Use CVE-2014-2270.

A CVE ID seems worthwhile because of possible libmagic use cases.

"file can be made to crash" is typically not security-relevant on its
own (a user can recover from this by not continuing to run file on the
same crafted file). We're not sure whether any distribution has
packages that rely on server-side use of libmagic, or whether it's
common to have long-running processes that use libmagic with untrusted
input.

"apt-rdepends --reverse file" gave some hints that resulted in these
possibilities, but the actual use of file (or libmagic) within these
packages was not investigated:

  https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/bacula-director-sqlite3

  network backup service - SQLite 3 storage for Director

  The Bacula Director service supervises all the backup, restore,
  verify, and archive operations. It can run as a daemon

  dep: file


  https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/guestfsd

  This package contains a standalone version the back-end daemon that
  carries out file system access on behalf of libguestfs applications.
