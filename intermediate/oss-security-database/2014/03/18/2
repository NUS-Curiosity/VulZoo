The recent upstream patch:

  https://bitbucket.org/jeromerobert/k4dirstat/commits/1ad2e96d73fa06cd9be0f3749b337c03575016aa#chg-src/kcleanup.cpp

addressed the ' issue using the '\\'' approach.

http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/19/Everything/source/SRPMS/k/k4dirstat-2.7.0-0.9.20101010git6c0a9e6.fc19.src.rpm
has:

    expanded.replace( QRegExp( "%p" ),
                      "\"" + QString::fromLocal8Bit( item->url() )  + "\"" );
    expanded.replace( QRegExp( "%n" ),
                      "\"" + QString::fromLocal8Bit( item->name() ) + "\"" );

As mentioned in the
http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/09/1 post, attempted
use of " for this type of quoting is a conceptually different problem
than attempted use of ' for this type of quoting, even if both
attempts are ultimately incorrect.

(We did not try to check whether the upstream version made a change
from incorrect use of " to incorrect use of ' at some point. This
could be considered an incomplete fix.)

Use CVE-2014-2527 for the vulnerability involving use of " (as shown
in the above calls to expanded.replace). This CVE assignment applies
to any upstream code or any Fedora-specific code that has this
specific issue.

Use CVE-2014-2528 for the vulnerability involving use of ' (as shown
in the above https://bitbucket.org commit).

If anyone happens to identify a version of the code that does not
attempt any type of quoting, a third CVE assignment may be possible.

> (And maybe it should be escaping ';' too if not already?)

This would typically not be addressed as a separate fix.
