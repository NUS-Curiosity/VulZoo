Use CVE-2014-2242. The root cause is, roughly, "does not block unsafe
namespaces such as a W3C XHTML namespace." This qualifies for a CVE
because there is known client software that uses this namespace in a
way that results in XSS. MediaWiki is obviously free to make an
announcement of a security fix for this type of issue, independent of
the question of who is at fault for the underlying problem.

> Also disallow iframe elements.

There is no CVE assignment for this change because there is no known
client software that uses any of the $validNamespaces namespaces in a
way that results in XSS. A third party who "owns" one of these
namespaces, or anyone else, could modify its role tomorrow and (for
example) release a browser extension that's vulnerable to this IFRAME
XSS attack when the namespace is used. However, defending against that
is essentially the same as defending against any other attack
requiring not-known-to-exist client software. It can only be
interpreted as security hardening. For example, MediaWiki conceivably
could validate uploaded .jpg files by looking for photos of the word
"IFRAME" because, well, you can't be too careful.

Use CVE-2014-2243. Bug 61346 comments 9 and 10 are not currently being
considered a vulnerability report -- the statements in comments 9 and
10 are not within the scope of CVE-2014-2243, nor do they have a
separate CVE ID.
