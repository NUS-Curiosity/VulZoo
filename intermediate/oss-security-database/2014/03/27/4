Subject: [OSSA 2014-007] Potential context confusion in Keystone middleware
 (CVE-2014-0105)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-007
CVE: CVE-2014-0105
Date: March 27, 2014
Title: Potential context confusion in Keystone middleware
Reporter: Kieran Spear (University of Melbourne)
Products: python-keystoneclient
Versions: All versions up to 0.6.0

Description:
Kieran Spear from the University of Melbourne reported a vulnerability
in Keystone auth_token middleware (shipped in python-keystoneclient). By
doing repeated requests, with sufficient load on the target system, an
authenticated user may in certain situations assume another
authenticated user's complete identity and multi-tenant authorizations,
potentially resulting in a privilege escalation. Note that it is related
to a bad interaction between eventlet and python-memcached that should
be avoided if the calling process already monkey-patches "thread" to use
eventlet. Only keystone middleware setups using auth_token with memcache
are vulnerable.

python-keystoneclient fix (included in 0.7.0 release):
