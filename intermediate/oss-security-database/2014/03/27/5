Subject: [OSSA 2014-008]  Routers can be cross plugged by other tenants
 (CVE-2014-0056)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-008
CVE: CVE-2014-0056
Date: March 27, 2014
Title: Routers can be cross plugged by other tenants
Reporter: Aaron Rosen (VMWare)
Products: Neutron
Affects: 2012.2 versions up to 2013.2.2

Description:
Aaron Rosen from VMWare reported a vulnerability where Neutron fails to
perform proper authorization checks when creating ports. By choosing a
device id of a router from a different tenant when creating a port, an
authenticated user can access the network of other tenants. This affects
deployments of Neutron using plugins relying on the l3-agent.

Icehouse (development branch) fix:

Havana fix: 
https://review.openstack.org/83393


Notes: 
One should perform and audit of the ports that are already attached to
routers after applying this patch and remove ports that a tenant may
have cross plugged.
