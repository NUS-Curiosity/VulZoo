Subject: Re: CVE-2014-0131 -- kernel: net: use-after-free
 during segmentation with zerocopy

It would be nice to clarify this bug description. It's a kernel memory
disclosure bug (not a memory leak in the sense of failing to collect
garbage). Although UAF is often worse than that, it's not in this case,
because there's 0 chance the after-free-user of the fragment will think the
fragment is bigger than it is and subsequently write too much data into it.

Is that right?
