Use CVE-2014-2387 for both issues involving files in the /tmp directory.

This seems to be an opportunity for security improvement, not a
vulnerability. It appears that the design goal was to listen for
commands in a way that could be acceptable on a server with
sufficiently restricted access, and not acceptable in arbitrary
environments. "port where the load balancer listens for commands" seems
sufficiently descriptive for a reasonable person to immediately wonder
who can send commands. Furthermore, the example in question:

  sudo pen 4444 localhost:9000 -C 127.0.0.1:5043

suggests that the person is aware that "a control port" means a TCP
port, not some other type of port with obvious permission-based
restrictions. A CVE assignment could be made if there were an
implementation error (e.g., the user specifies listening on 127.0.0.1
but the code actually listens on all interfaces). A CVE assignment
might also be possible for some types of design problems, but they'd
need to be considerably more surprising and the documentation would
need to be considerably more misleading.
