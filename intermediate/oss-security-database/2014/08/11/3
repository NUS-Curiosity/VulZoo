CVE-2014-3502: Cordova apps can potentially leak data to other apps via URL
loading


Severity: Medium

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Cordova Android versions up to 3.5.0

Description:
Android applications built with the Cordova framework can launch other
applications through the use of anchor tags, or by redirecting the webview to
an Android intent URL. An attacker who can manipulate the HTML content of a
Cordova application can create links which open other applications and send
arbitrary data to those applications. An attacker who can run arbitrary
JavaScript code within the context of the Cordova application can also set the
document location to such a URL. By using this in concert with a second,
vulnerable application, an attacker might be able to use this method to send
data from the Cordova application to the network.

The latest release of Cordova Android takes steps to block explicit Android
intent urls, so that they can no longer be used to start arbitrary applications
on the device.

Implicit intents, including URLs with schemes such as "tel", "geo", and "sms"
can still be used to open external applications by default, but this behaviour
can be overridden by plugins.

Upgrade path:
Developers who are concerned about this should rebuild their applications with
Cordova Android 3.5.1.
