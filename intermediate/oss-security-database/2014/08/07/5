Subject: CVE-2014-3562: Vulnerability in 389-ds

This was initially sent to the distros list on August 5th:

It was found that when replication was enabled for each attribute in Red
Hat Directory Server / 389 Directory Server, which is the default
configuration, the server returned replicated metadata when the
directory was searched while debugging was enabled. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information.
