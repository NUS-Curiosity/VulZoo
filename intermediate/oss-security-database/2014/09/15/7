Bug 8979 says "about 1 month ago ... pushed wip-8979 which removes the
fixed buffer size. but, we still need to make things not crash when
the auth reply processing fails. that could still happen if we get a
huge ticket (>4k) and kmalloc fails on a large page size. or the auth
reply from the mon is simply not understood by the client."

This apparently has multiple known vulnerability types.

Use CVE-2014-6416 for the buffer overflow.

Use CVE-2014-6417 for the issue of incorrect handling of kmalloc
failures.

Use CVE-2014-6418 for ths missing validation of the auth reply.

Our guess is that c27a3e4d667fdcad3db7b104f75659478e0c68d8 is intended
to address all three of these crash issues, but additional CVE IDs
might be needed if there were an incomplete fix.
