Use CVE-2013-7402 for the chtsanti discoveries, i.e., the other issues
in the pre-r1018 code that made a remote crash possible. This might,
for example, include attack vectors with invalid method names.

There is no CVE ID for the http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/code/1021
issue. This seems to be a usability problem that was introduced by the
first version of the security fixes.
