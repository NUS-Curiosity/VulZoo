As far as we can tell, the
http://www.qnap.com/useng/index.php?lang=en-us&sn=885&c=3036&sc=&n=22457
reference suggests that the code execution for that PoC occurs because
the QNAP Bash build has the CVE-2014-6271 vulnerability. In that case,
the applicable CVE ID is CVE-2014-6271, not a separate CVE ID specific
to QNAP's build.

If you mean something else -- for example, if another reference states
that the implementation language of restore_config.cgi is not sh and
that the design of restore_config.cgi was supposed to drop privileges
immediately, but there's an implementation flaw in which Bash is
launched before privileges are dropped -- then there could conceivably
be a separate CVE ID for that restore_config.cgi issue. Similarly, if
you're referring to an authentication bypass -- for example, if the
implementation language of restore_config.cgi is not sh and the design
of restore_config.cgi was supposed to exit immediately for
unauthenticated requests, but there's an implementation flaw in which
Bash is launched before missing authentication is detected, then there
could conceivably be a separate CVE ID.
