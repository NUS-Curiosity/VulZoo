Using the two patches, CVE-2014-6271 and the one line eol-pushback.patch, I am 
not able to reproduce what I expect should be happing with bash 4.2.

Should I be seeing a problem with the reproducers that were mentioned in an 
earlier piece of this thread, either:

bash -c 'true <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF
<<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF <<EOF'

or

(for x in {1..200} ; do echo "for x$x in ; do :"; done; for x in {1..200} ; do 
echo done ; done) > test-script.sh $ bash test-script.sh


The first one gives me a series of:

bash: line 1: warning: here-document at line 1 delimited by end-of-file (wanted 
`EO')

But does not result in a segfault.. (perhaps my memory layout/allocations just 
happen to be avoiding that)

And the test-script.sh runs w/o segfault or other error being present.. again 
maybe I'm lucky?


(Or am I simply missing something in the reproducer steps?)
