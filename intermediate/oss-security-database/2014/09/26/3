So, according to:

http://www.intelsecurity.com/advanced-threat-research/#
http://tif.mcafee.com/threats/12817

that's indeed the same (or really close) vulnerability. Can a CVE be
assigned?

When trying to test NSS updates I tried with epiphany browser, which
uses gnutls (through libsoup and glib-networking), and it seemed indeed

Can a CVE be assigned too?
