I got this message from MITRE some time back:

"No, we are keeping CVE-2014-7169. CVE-2014-7169 was already public at
nvd.nist.gov before 1146319 was created. Also, the nvd.nist.gov entry
most likely has a much wider audience. We will enter a REJECT entry
for CVE-2014-3659."

So CVE-2014-3659 stands rejected and we will use CVE-2014-7169 for this
issue.
