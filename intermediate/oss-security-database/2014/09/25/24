John first brought this aspect up on the private distros list, but I
asked for it to be moved to oss-security, which John did (thanks!)

My reply on distros was:

While your specific examples are not necessarily relevant, I agree that
in the long run the functionality should be restricted in a way like you
suggest.

That's my feeling too.

At the very least, we also need Florian's patch adding a prefix and a
suffix to the variable names, although this won't be sufficient against
local attacks via existing blacklist-using sudo-like wrappers.

Our excuse is that blacklists are not a good practice anyway.
