I don't know what's common with PHP.  I don't think there is much public 
documentation about what it takes to run PHP at scale in a secure 
fashion (also taking compromised or downright malicious customers into 
account).

The wrapper does not run per request.  I have not tested this, but I 
don't think it sees any request-specific environment variables at this 
point.  FCGI transfers request information over a socket at descriptor 0 
and not through environment variables.
