While I somehow agree with the above (this sure is a vuln in 3rd party
programs) I also still think bash should fix this by making it harder
to pass malicious content (e.g. switch an option like "yes-I-know-this
is-totally-insecure" to "on" ), even if it breaks
"backward-compatibility" and "workflows".

This reminds me of this:

https://xkcd.com/1172/

bottom line: "Every change breaks someones workflow" - so this is no
excuse at all.

After all we're in the 21st century and programs need to become more
secure by orders of magnitude, compared to bad practices in the past.

This is a simple tradeoff:
making people fix their programs by a backward incompatible change
(in a new release) or allowing insecure stuff (just big projects
with security in mind will change their program)

as always: not to upgrade/ not to change things is no option at all
