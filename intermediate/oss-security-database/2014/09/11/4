We're not sure whether a CVE request was intended for this. Here, the
wording "via template source file" would typically mean an attack
vector, but maybe what is meant is that a template source file is the
vulnerable file. If the scenario were something like "the extension
enables an attack by accepting template source files from untrusted
parties in a way that is unintended by Smarty," then the extension
could be considered the primary affected product and could have its
own CVE ID for this issue. If this Problem Description text is
intended to mean that Smarty is the primary affected product, then a
CVE for the previously known issue in Smarty might already exist. If
anyone knows the best reference for "Old versions of this library are
known to be vulnerable," that could help resolve the question.

We typically cannot combine the different flaw types into one CVE. We
could combine them into one CVE if CSRF were the single root cause of
all of the issues, but nobody has reported that here, and it seems
relatively unlikely.
