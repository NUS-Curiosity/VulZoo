Subject: Re: Security advisory in Jenkins

We are still learning how we should handle vulnerabilities, so I'm sure
there's room for improvements.

We have multiple release lines to which the fixes have to be released
simultaneously, and overall this overhead is significant. That's why we did
one massive release that contains all the fixes.

Wrt CVE-2013-2186, a week ago we got a report from somebody that he did a
security scan and found that we are still using a vulnerable version of the
library to which CVE-2013-2186 is assigned. In this release we use a newer
version of the library that addresses the problem, and I thought it'd be
appropriate to raise a flag to the users that if they continue to use older
versions, they'd remain vulnerable to CVE-2013-2186. That's why it's in the
advisory. It is not because we sat on a report for more than a year.

When you say the timeframe is especially concerning, perhaps you mean you
are concerned that we fail to notice this vulnerability in our library for
more than a year, and if so, you are of course right. Jenkins project has
gotten a long list of library dependencies, and I haven't found any
practical means to get notified when vulnerabilities are found in any one
of them.
