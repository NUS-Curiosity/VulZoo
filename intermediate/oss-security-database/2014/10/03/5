What about the DoS impact claimed here, though? -

 sysklogd
 ~~~~~~~~
 A segfault seems possible in sysklogd if a negative facility value (due to
 integer overrun in facility parsing) is used. This could be used to
 carry out a remote DoS.

If this can be used to crash syslogd, it's "real security impact", even
if rather limited.

Have you tried triggering this condition (getting syslogd to crash)?
