we usually do not do that. The patch set I mentioned (here on list and in
the advisory) contains patches for versions we will never touch.

Yeah, so to solve the obviously vague wording:

- 7.6.7 is not vulnerable, all previous v7 are.
- 8.4.2 is not vulnerable, all previous v8 are.
- all older ("totally dead") versions are vulnerable to the extend as
described in the advisory and patches as linked to in the advisory can be
used to solve the issue for some of these versions.
- for v7 and v8 no specific patch files exist because we have released new
stable versions. Nobody should ever use an old stable version, because the
difference to the current stable is missing bugfixes.

Thanks,
Rainer
