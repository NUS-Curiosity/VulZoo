Chet is 7168 new vulnerability or is a typo and should be CVE-2014-7186?
Doesn't bash43-026  fix CVE-2014-7169?

Is this summary correct?
1) CVE-2014-6271 (Initial vulnerability, Bash Code Injection Vulnerability via Specially Crafted Environment Variables): GNU fix bash43-025  & bash32-052 

2) CVE-2014-7169 (Further parser error,  this was assigned to cover incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271): GNU fix bash43-026  & bash32-053

3) CVE-2014-6277 (this is the hardening patch which adds function name mangling, it makes exploitation over the network impossible): Florian's patch /GNU fix bash43-027 & bash32-054

4) CVE-2014-6278 (bash: code execution via specially crafted environment): Florian's patch /GNU fix bash43-027 & bash32-054

5) CVE-2014-7186 (Out of bound memory read error in redir_stack): GNU fix bash43-028 ??

6) CVE-2014-7187 (Off-by-one error in nested loops): No upstream patch available yet ?
