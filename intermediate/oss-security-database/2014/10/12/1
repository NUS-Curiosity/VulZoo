Agreed. One pain point i have encountered with CVE SPLIT/MERGE is the
"when is a code fork a fork, or just a normal fork?" E.g. sometimes it's
easy: like one week after the MariaDB fork from MySQL it's obvious that
any flaw affecting one will affect the other and they're basically the
same code, but as time goes on MariaDB is diverging. One thing that
would be hugely useful here to solve the CVE MERGE problem, and to let
people know what related software packages they should look at would be
a database of code considered "equivalent" by Mitre for the purposes of
CVE MERGE and also for people to check if other things are affected by
the same flaw.

I suspect there aren't actually that many entries, and populating it as
they come up would be pretty simple, especially if there's an easy way
to submit entries (just send an email?).  Would this be something Mitre
can do perhaps?
