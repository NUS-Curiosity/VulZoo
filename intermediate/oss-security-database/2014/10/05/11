I have had a pretty deep look at it. Bottom line is that I couldn't
reproduce it manually either. So I checked the test environment. As it
turns out, the root cause for my ability to crash was that the test scripts
did not setup things properly for v3 ... some v5 binary modules kept be
used. Digging deeper in the old code, a crash seems as unlikely as said in
the initial report. The reason is that some masking happens, which in turn
prevents most problems with the negative PRIs. I'll update the advisory
soon. Sorry for the noise and thanks for keeping this straight.
