Subject: Xen Security Advisory 108 (CVE-2014-7188) - Improper MSR range
 used for x2APIC emulation

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

              Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-7188 / XSA-108
                              version 4

              Improper MSR range used for x2APIC emulation

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The MSR range specified for APIC use in the x2APIC access model spans
256 MSRs. Hypervisor code emulating read and write accesses to these
MSRs erroneously covered 1024 MSRs. While the write emulation path is
written such that accesses to the extra MSRs would not have any bad
effect (they end up being no-ops), the read path would (attempt to)
access memory beyond the single page set up for APIC emulation.

IMPACT
======

A buggy or malicious HVM guest can crash the host or read data
relating to other guests or the hypervisor itself.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.1 and onward are vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered Jan Beulich at SUSE.
