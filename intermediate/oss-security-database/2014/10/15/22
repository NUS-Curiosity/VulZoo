Subject: [OSSA 2014-036] Potential leak of passwords into log files (CVE-2014-7230,
 CVE-2014-7231)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-036
CVE: CVE-2014-7230, CVE-2014-7231
Date: October 15, 2014
Title: Potential leak of passwords into log files
Reporter: Amrith Kumar (Tesora)
Products: Cinder and Nova (versions up to 2014.1.3)
                    Trove (versions up to 2014.1.2)

Description:
Amrith Kumar from Tesora reported two vulnerabilities in the
processutils.execute() and strutils.mask_password() functions available
from oslo-incubator that are copied into each project's code. An
attacker with read access to the services' logs may obtain passwords
used as a parameter of a command that has failed (CVE-2014-7230) or when
mask_password did not mask passwords properly (CVE-2014-7231). All
Cinder, Nova and Trove setups are affected.

Kilo (development branch) fixes:
https://review.openstack.org/116927 (Cinder)
https://review.openstack.org/126052 (Cinder ssh_execute)
https://review.openstack.org/116982 (Nova)
https://review.openstack.org/126047 (Nova   ssh_execute)
https://review.openstack.org/121417 (Trove)

Juno (proposed branch) fixes:
https://review.openstack.org/126594 (Nova   ssh_execute)
https://review.openstack.org/126592 (Cinder ssh_execute)

Icehouse fixes:
https://review.openstack.org/121382 (Cinder)
https://review.openstack.org/126665 (Cinder ssh_execute)
https://review.openstack.org/121096 (Nova)
https://review.openstack.org/126699 (Nova   ssh_execute)
https://review.openstack.org/121416 (Trove)

Notes:
The former patch did not cover the ssh_execute method used in Nova and
Cinder, thus two more patches are required for these projects.
Nova and Cinder fixes are included in the 2014.2rc2 release candidate
and will appear in a future 2014.1.4 release.
Trove fix was included in the 2014.2rc1 release candidate and 2014.1.3
release.
