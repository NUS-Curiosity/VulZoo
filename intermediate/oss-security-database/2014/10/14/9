Subject: [OSSA 2014-035] Nova VMware driver may connect VNC to another
 tenant's console (CVE-2014-8750)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-035
CVE: CVE-2014-8750
Date: October 14, 2014
Title: Nova VMware driver may connect VNC to another tenant's console
Reporter: Marcio Roberto Starke
Products: Nova
Versions: up to 2014.1.3

Description:
Marcio Roberto Starke reported a vulnerability in the Nova VMware
driver. A race condition in its VNC port allocation may cause it to
connect the wrong console if instances are created concurrently. By
repeatedly spawning new instances, an authenticated user may be able
to gain unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other
tenants. Only Nova setups using the VMware driver and the VNC proxy
service are affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:

Notes:
This fix was included in the 2014.2rc1 release candidate and will
appear in a future 2014.1.4 stable point release.
