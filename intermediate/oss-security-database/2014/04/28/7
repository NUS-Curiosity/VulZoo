The fix is here:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/?id=90f62cf30a78721641e08737bda787552428061e

It depends on a few commits immediately preceding it as well as
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/?id=78541c1dc60b65ecfce5a6a096fc260219d6784e.

So far the fix has not made it to Linus' tree or to -stable.
