This issue was reported as fixed in 1.0.51:
http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7188

but it was found that the fix was incomplete with the full fix in 1.0.53:
http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7194

Should this get a second CVE or should we continue to use CVE-2014-2707?

Furthermore, another security issue was also fixed in 1.0.53:
http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7195

"
- cups-browsed: SECURITY FIX: Fix on usage of the
  "BrowseAllow" directive in cups-browsed.conf. Before, if the
  argument of a "BrowseAllow" directive is not understood it
  is treated as the directive not having been there, allowing
  any host if this was the only "BrowseAllow" directive. Now
  we treat this as a directive which no host can fulfill, not
  allowing any host if it was the only one. No "BrowseAllow"
  directive means access for all, as before (Bug #1204).
"

I believe this should receive a CVE.

Thanks
