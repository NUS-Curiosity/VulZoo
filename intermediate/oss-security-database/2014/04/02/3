I do agree with the overall explanation but from that point on I don't
think there is anything in openjpeg that would lead to a heap write
before triggering a null pointer dereference or an OOB heap read. IIRC
the latter being fixed in general by segfault4.patch, which ensures
that all allocated heap memory is initialized.

Well, depending on the above this specific bug might be split off
CVE-2013-1447 - the original id covered bugs that could only be
classified as leading to denial of service, nothing more.
