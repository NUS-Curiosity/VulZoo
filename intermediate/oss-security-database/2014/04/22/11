Subject: CVE-2014-0181: Linux network reconfiguration due to incorrect netlink checks

It is possible to reconfigure the network on Linux by calling write(2)
on an appropriately connected network socket.  By passing such a
socket as stdout or stderr to a setuid program, anyone can reconfigure
the network.

Eric Biederman sent patches to netdev containing a possible fix.
