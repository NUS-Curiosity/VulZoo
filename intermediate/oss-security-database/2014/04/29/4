Subject: CVE request: directory traversal in DSA-2915-1-patched dpkg in Debian squeeze

Hi,

The recent update[1] of dpkg for CVE-2014-0471 in Debian squeeze (and
possibly Ubuntu lucid[2]) actually introduces a vulnerability in that
release[3], while it was not affected by the original vulnerability.
The newly introduced vulnerability is dependent on the version of
patch(1) that is installed on the system, so that:

updated dpkg in squeeze + patch(1) from squeeze = vulnerable
updated dpkg in squeeze + patch(1) from wheezy = not vulnerable
updated dpkg in wheezy + patch(1) from squeeze = vulnerable (but not confirmed)
updated dpkg in wheezy + patch(1) from wheezy = not vulnerable

In other words, if the updated dpkg package is not installed in a
squeeze system, this new vulnerability would only be exposed if a
system is partially upgraded to wheezy.

Given that at least one PoC demonstrates that squeeze's updated
package is vulnerable, while the previous dpkg in wheezy isn't (it
refuses to unpack the package), I think this is a new vulnerability
and should therefore receive its own CVE.

If you agree, could you please assign one?

Thanks in advance.
