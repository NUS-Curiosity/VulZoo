Well, as I put in my tentative timeline, and according to Jussi Eronen
(from NCSC-FI, afaict) mail in that thread, NCSC-FI only reported to
OpenSSL “a couple of hours before the advisory”, so my understand is
that NCSC-FI was not aware of the vulnerability last week.  Maybe
Codenomicon was, though. Jussi, could you confirm that?

Ok the “Mark notifies^Winforms Red Hat” line and the “Huzaifa
Sidhpurwala opens a bug” could actually be merged, they were more or
less at the same time.

I'm also unsure why that could not have been done earlier, when OpenSSL was
first notified (by Google, supposedly).

Yeah, maybe the report by NCSC-FI to OpenSSL scared them. I don't know
who to contact at OpenSSL and I'm not sure if they read the list.

Actually, all times are UTC. I don't know about others, but Debian
security team is mostly in western Europe, so it was monday
evening/night.

I don't think they said they were notified by Codenomicon/NCSC-FI (and
that doesn't fit the timeline).

Sure, thank you for starting that coordination as soon as you were made
aware of the vulnerability (and sorry we weren't there monday morning
UTC to help you on that).

I was more ranting about what happened and did not happened “last week”.
