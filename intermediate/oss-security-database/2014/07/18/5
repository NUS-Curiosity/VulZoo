There are a few different groups who are potentially able to assign
CVE IDs for issues in, say, LibreSSL. On rare occasions, the
different groups don't have the same expectations about coordinating.

At MITRE, we (obviously) know where CVE-2014-2970 came from, and we'll
send information here about the resolution as soon as it happens.
