Subject: CVE-2014-0475: glibc directory traversal in LC_* locale handling

Stephane Chazelas discovered that directory traversal issue in locale
handling in glibc.  glibc accepts relative paths with ".." components
in the LC_* and LANG variables.  Together with typical OpenSSH
configurations (with suitable AcceptEnv settings in sshd_config), this
could conceivably be used to bypass ForceCommand restrictions (or
restricted shells), assuming the attacker has sufficient level of
access to a file system location on the host to create crafted locale
definitions there.

(To backport the new test in a reliable fashion, you need to tweak the
Makefile to set the LOCPATH environment variable.)
