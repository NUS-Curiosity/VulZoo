Probably, especially if there is a checkout of the repository in the
file system under a predictable path.  (I expect that most hosted
repositories use the bare format.)  I don't know how common this is
with the existing Git hosting frameworks.  Some of them don't use
OpenSSH and may not implement environment variable processing at all.

It seems fairly likely because unexpected, but benign locale settings
would interfere with the hook script processing (which likely assume
U.S. date formats and UTF-8).
