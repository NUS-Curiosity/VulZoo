Subject: Re: CVE request - Snoopy incomplete fix for CVE-2008-4796

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

The information that has been sent so far doesn't determine whether
there should be one CVE ID or two CVE IDs. A statement of "does still
allow command injection" would potentially mean two CVE IDs, whereas
"may still allow command injection" could end up as "does not still
allow command injection."

The original CVE request was on July 9, and implied that watching
http://snoopy.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snoopy/Snoopy/Snoopy.class.php?view=log
was of interest because a second security fix might be announced there
"shortly." However, that view=log page was last updated on July 8. We
will continue to check that view=log page from time to time.
