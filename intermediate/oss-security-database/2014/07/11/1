I knew about this behaviour (I imagine lots of people were), but hadn't
considered it a vulnerability - it's more restricted across setuid, so had
assumed it was intentionally permitted. Locale files are not executable
code, so even if you imagine a ForceCommand+AcceptEnv configuration *and*
have the ability to create a message catalog, don't you still need another
bug to exploit this?

However, admittedly there was that zonefile parsing vulnerability and IIRC
TZ also permits directory traversal when not setuid. TZ is just as plausibly
part of AcceptEnv as LC_ALL, so maybe if it wasn't intentional there's at
least a weak argument there for calling it a glibc vulnerability.

Anyway, if we're clearing up old unexploitable glibc bugs, here's another
one to consider. LD_PROFILE uses the inherited umask, so you can create
root-owned world writable files like this:

$ umask 0
$ LD_PROFILE=libc.so.6 su --version
su from util-linux 2.24.2
$ ls -l /var/profile
-rw-rw-rw-. 1 root taviso 18M Jul 10 16:12 libc.so.6.profile

I hadn't reported it as you have to have created /var/profile, and...

$ sudo yum whatprovides /var/profile
No matches found

But maybe some other distros have a package (or a bug that lets you create
directories), I havn't checked. There are a bunch of ways to abuse this if
you have /var/profile.

Tavis.

p.s. I think LD_HWCAP_MASK is still not in unsecure_vars :-)
