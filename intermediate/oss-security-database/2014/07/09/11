Subject: CVE request - Snoopy incomplete fix for CVE-2008-4796

Please see: http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jul/16

Note, the new fix [1] referenced in the above FD posts does not look to
be a complete fix either and may still allow command injection.

Snoopy upstream has been notified and a more complete fix that removes
curl and instead uses native php code should be available shortly [2].

Thanks.
