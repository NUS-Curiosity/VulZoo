Subject: [CVE request] Array allocation fixes in libgfortran

Janne Blomqvist fixed several CVE-2002-0391-style integer overflows in 
array allocation in libgfortran, the run-time support library for the 
Fortran compiler which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection.  The 
upstream Subversion commit is here:

 
<https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc?limit_changes=0&view=revision&revision=211721>

These changes will be part of the next version of GCC (whose version 
number is still to be decided).

I think this warrants a CVE assignment.
