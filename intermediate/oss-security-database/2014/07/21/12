LC_*, LANG, LANGUAGE are about setting all the aspect of
localisation, not only message catalogs:
- character set
- character classes (see my other post about bash honouring the
  [:blank:] characters as token separators, and [:alpha:] as
  valid variable names.
- transliteration (toupper/tolower) you can make "foo" match
  "bar" case insensitively by making them all map to XXX in
  uppercase.
- sort orders (so that one can make [A-Z] include / or B sort
  before A)
- decimal point (so one can have 123 be understood as 1.3 (2
  being the decimal point)
- month/day names (newline in a month name for the output of ls
  -l or date) (as in January is "Jan\n-rw----- 1...")
- ...
- not to mention the fact that the whole localisation code is
  quite complex and I wouldn't be surprised if it crashed
  miserabily on unexpected/incorrect locale data

Note that it's not about the ability to create message catalogs
but about the ability to upload files with arbitrary names.

Most git hosting deployment fulfill all the criteria I'd say.

the main problem here I'd say is that those variables are
honoured *by default* by most of a Unix tool chest, and the
shell to start with (see my other email in this thread about
bash), so even "ForceCommand LC_ALL=C some/command" won't fix
everything.
