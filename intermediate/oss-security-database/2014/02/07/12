Use CVE-2014-1891.

Use CVE-2014-1892.


> Xen 3.3 through 4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a

Use CVE-2014-1893.


> Xen 3.2 (and presumably earlier) exhibit both problems, with the

> listed above.

the part of the 3.2 problems associated with the first overflow, for
FLASK_{GET,SET}BOOL, FLASK_USER and FLASK_CONTEXT_TO_SID, is within
the scope of CVE-2014-1891

the part of the 3.2 problems associated with unreasonably large memory
allocation is within the scope of CVE-2014-1892

the part of the 3.2 problems associated with the second overflow, for
FLASK_{GET,SET}BOOL, is within the scope of CVE-2014-1893

all other vectors (e.g., other suboperations) that can lead to integer
overflows in 3.2, even if they are related to the first overflow or
related to the second overflow, have CVE-2014-1894 assigned now


> http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-85.html
> XSA-85
> Off-by-one error in FLASK_AVC_CACHESTAT hypercall

Use CVE-2014-1895.


> http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-86.html
> XSA-86
> libvchan failure handling malicious ring indexes

Use CVE-2014-1896.
