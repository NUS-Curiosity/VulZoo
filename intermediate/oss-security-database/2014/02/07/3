Subject: CVE Split: CVE-2014-0050 Apache Commons FileUpload and Apache
 Tomcat DoS

Hi,

CVE-2014-0050 was assigned to a flaw that affects both Apache Commons FileUpload and Apache Tomcat DoS [1].

Although Commons FileUpload and Tomcat are affected by this flaw and the vulnerable classes share the same ancestry, the code bases for them have been maintained in separate source trees for a long while now.

Can this CVE be split?
