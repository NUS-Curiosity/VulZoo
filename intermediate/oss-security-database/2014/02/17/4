Subject: CVE-2014-0069 -- kernel: cifs: incorrect handling of bogus user
 pointers during uncached writes

A flaw was found in the way cifs handled iovecs with bogus pointers
userland passed down via writev() during uncached writes.

An unprivileged local user with access to cifs share could use this flaw
to crash the system or leak kernel memory. Privilege escalation cannot
be ruled out (since memory corruption is involved), but is unlikely.

Upstream patch:

Patches have been reported to the linux-cifs mailing list:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cifs/9401
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cifs/9402

Only the first patch is required to fix the flaw.  The second patch is
to ensure that this does not get hit again in the future by adding
extra protection. 

Thanks,
