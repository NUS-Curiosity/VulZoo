Subject: [OSSA 2014-004] Glance Swift store backend password leak
 (CVE-2014-1948)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-004
CVE: CVE-2014-1948
Date: February 12, 2014
Title: Glance Swift store backend password leak
Reporter: Nikhil Komawar (Rackspace)
Products: Glance
Versions: 2013.2 versions up to 2013.2.1

Description:
Nikhil Komawar from Rackspace reported an information leak in Glance
logs. The password for the Swift store backend is logged at WARNING
level as part of the URL when authentication to a store fails if
image location is not disabled by policy or the store is a
single-tenant configuration. An attacker with access to the logs
(local shell, log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may
leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct
full access to the Glance Swift store backend. Only Glance setups
using the Swift store backend are affected.
