              Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-1950 / XSA-88
                              version 3

      use-after-free in xc_cpupool_getinfo() under memory pressure

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

If xc_cpumap_alloc() fails then xc_cpupool_getinfo() will free and incorrectly
return the then-free pointer to the result structure.

IMPACT
======

An attacker may be able to cause a multi-threaded toolstack using this
function to race against itself leading to heap corruption and a
potential DoS.

Depending on the malloc implementation, privilege escalation cannot be
ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

The flaw is present in Xen 4.1 onwards.  Only multithreaded toolstacks
are vulnerable.  Only systems where management functions (such as
domain creation) are exposed to untrusted users are vulnerable.

xl is not multithreaded, so is not vulnerable.  However, multithreaded
toolstacks using libxl as a library are vulnerable.  xend is
vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Not allowing untrusted users access to toolstack functionality will
avoid this issue.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Coverity Scan and diagnosed by Andrew
Cooper.
