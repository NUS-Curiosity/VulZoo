Just off Twitter:

<noptrix> recvmmsg.c - linux 3.4+ local root (CONFIG_X86_X32=y) expl0it - http://pastebin.com/DH3Lbg54

SHA-256(recvmmsg.c.txt) = 4603acf96e845cecd2c5877a68fa5b5c591ba00c52859ded2a31a9daf48a457d

for the version I just downloaded (but did not review, although it looks
sane at first glance).  The exploit includes offsets for 3 Ubuntu kernels.
