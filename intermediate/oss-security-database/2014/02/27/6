Subject: Re: CVE request: PLOGGER 1.0RC1 multiple vulnerabilities

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> We found two vulnerabilities in PLOGGER version 1.0RC1, including:


> 1. Authenticated Arbitrary file upload vulnerability affecting PLOGGER
> version 1.0RC1
> 
> This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to upload an arbitrary
> PHP file on the remote web server in an accessible path, by sending a
> specifically crafted zip file.

> session.post('http://' + HOST + "/plog-admin/plog-upload.php",

> ## Add true image file to block the race condition (mandatory not
> null)

Use CVE-2014-2223.

Can you explain the race condition? For example: without the true
image file, would the product extract the .php file but then delete it
very soon afterward?



> 2. CAPTCHA bypass vulnerability
> 
> A theme called "Lucid" provided in PLOGGER version 1.0RC1 implements a
> weak CAPTCHA prone to a replay attack. By abusing this vulnerability,
> an unauthenticated user may be able to post a huge number of comments.

> The script generating the CAPTCHA image inserts a code in the current
> user session, but this value is not unset while processing the form,
> thus allowing an attacker to submit multiple times the form with
> always the same captcha and associated code.

> The vulnerable code is located in plog-comment.php, line 106.

Use CVE-2014-2224.
