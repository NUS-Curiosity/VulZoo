Subject: CVE-2014-0246 sos: md5 hash of GRUB password collected when running
 sosreport

Hi all,

When using a GRUB bootloader password, the md5 hash of said password was 
collected and stored in the resulting archive of debugging information 
when running sosreport. An attacker able to access the archive could use 
this flaw to obtain the GRUB bootloader password. (CVE-2014-0246)

Red Hat would like to thank Dolev Farhi of F5 Networks for reporting 
this issue.
