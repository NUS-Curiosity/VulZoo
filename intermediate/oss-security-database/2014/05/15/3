> It also fixes a second issue, for which a CVE is missing, quoting from
> the announcement:

>> Issue: Malformed URLs from user input incorrectly validated
>> The validation for redirects did not correctly validate some malformed
>> URLs, which are accepted by some browsers. This allows a user to be
>> redirected to an unsafe URL unexpectedly.
>>
>> Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g.
>> django.contrib.auth.views.login, django.contrib.comments, and i18n) to
>> redirect the user to an "on success" URL. The security checks for
>> these redirects (namely django.util.http.is_safe_url()) did not
>> correctly validate some malformed URLs, such as
>> http:\\\djangoproject.com, which are accepted by some browsers with
>> more liberal URL parsing.
>>
>> To remedy this, the validation in is_safe_url() has been tightened to
>> be able to handle and correctly validate these malformed URLs.
