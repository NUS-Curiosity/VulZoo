Use CVE-2014-3137.

The scope of this CVE does not include any behavior of Chrome that
could be interpreted as a Chrome vulnerability, e.g., "can make a
request with the content-type of text/plain;application/json (IMO this
is a bug in Chrome)" in 616. A later comment in 616 says "The original
reporter mentioned filing Chrome bugs." As suggested by the
http://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/ page, Chrome bugs are the
mechanism for getting CVE assignments from the Google CNA.
