Use CVE-2014-3462 for that issue, i.e., 'The purpose of MAC headers is
to prevent an attacker with read/write access to the ciphertext from
being able to make changes without being detected. Unfortunately, this
feature provides little security, since it is controlled by an option
in the .encfs6.xml configuration file (part of the ciphertext), so the
attacker can just disable it by setting "blockMACBytes" to 0 and
adding 8 to "blockMACRandBytes" (so that the MAC is not interpreted as
data).'
