Subject: Re: local privilege escalation due to capng_lock as used in seunshare

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

We think there should be a CVE ID for the combination of these two
observations:

1. seunshare is intended to be setuid root (see the
http://userspace.selinuxproject.org/trac/browser/policycoreutils/sandbox/Makefile
file)

2. dropping privileges no longer makes the traditional change to the
saved set-user-ID, as shown by the getresuid example in the
http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/04/30/4 post

Use CVE-2014-3215.

This message obviously isn't intended to contribute to the technical
discussion of how the design of seunshare and other software led to
this state. Also, nobody has sent MITRE's cve-assign team a PoC in
which running seunshare contributes to a privilege escalation.
CVE-2014-3215 might be considered an "exposure." Essentially, running
seunshare is a way to bypass a potentially important protection
mechanism, and that wasn't a documented effect of installing
seunshare.
