"So OpenBSD gets notified for sure"... That is kind of weird.  Read
the commit message.  It is originally from the OpenSSL lists.  Do none
of you read the lists?  It's obvious the OpenSSL developers don't.

The errata would have gone out same day Ted commited the fix, except I
was in the Atlas mountains... and then it was forgotten until I got
back home.

I'm sure you've all got your "processes" for handling these things.
But then you get paid for handling these things in some way, don't
you?

We don't get paid.  And therefore, I don't know where I should find
the time to be on another mailing list.  It is not like I would have
sent a mail to anyone.  In general our processes are simply commit &
publish.  So I'll decline.
