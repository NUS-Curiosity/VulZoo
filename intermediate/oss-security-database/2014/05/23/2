>> CVE-2014-2906: fish temporary file creation vulnerable to race condition
>> leading to privilege escalation
>> 
>>   Versions 1.23.0 to 2.1.0 (inclusive) execute code from these temporary files,
>>   allowing privilege escalation to those of any user running fish, including
>>   root.
>> 
>>   Additionally, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive),
>>   fish will read data using the psub function from these temporary files,

This actually needs two CVE IDs because there are two affected
functions, with different sets of affected versions. (For example,
there is a psub vulnerability in version 1.22.0, but there is no
funced vulnerability in 1.22.0 because funced didn't yet exist.)

For the psub vulnerability, please continue to use CVE-2014-2906.

For the funced vulnerability, please use CVE-2014-3856.

At present, we're not assigning an additional CVE ID for this "local
users ... elevate their privileges" issue. Our interpretation is that
you're not trying to make an announcement that 2.1.1 is a vulnerable
version. Instead, you're trying to document the machine environment on
which fish_config in 2.1.1 can be safely used (i.e., machines with
untrusted local users are not fully supported for fish_config at the
moment). If you actually wanted a CVE ID for versions 2.1.1 and
earlier, referring to the fish_config attack by local users, please
let us know.
