Subject: RE: request for CVEs for git clients

Just a quick note, since there has been some confusion or question about whether additional identifiers are necessary for other git clients.

If a client uses an "official" git library and inherits the vulnerability from that code, then CVE-2014-9390 is appropriate based on shared libraries / codebases.

If there are other git clients that work with the git "protocol" but contain independently-written code (i.e. a separate implementation), and those clients are vulnerable, then each implementation should receive its own ID.
