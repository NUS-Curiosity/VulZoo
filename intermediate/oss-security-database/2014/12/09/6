Subject: CVE question: Return of POODLE

Hi All,

Before i ask my question:

It seems some TLS implementations may be vulnerable to POODLE like 
attack if they use SSL 3.0 type padding and the padding bytes are not 
checked by the implementation.

https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/12/08/poodleagain.html
https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/cve-2014-8730-padding-issue-8151


CVE-2014-8730 was assigned to this issue (by MITRE i suppose) and its 
not clear if this CVE has been assigned to their code or to the protocol 
weakness.

I have not checked if any implementations are vulnerable, but could 
MITRE please confirm if its ok to reuse this CVE if any crypto-libs are 
found vulnerable, or if they plan to assign another CVE id?
