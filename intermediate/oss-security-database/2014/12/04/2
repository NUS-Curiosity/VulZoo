Subject: Apache Hadoop 2.5.2 release to fix CVE-2014-3627

Apologies for the delay in getting this across to you, Apache Hadoop 2.5.2
(released on 11/19) fixes the following security issue:

--

CVE-2014-3627: Apache Hadoop distributed cache vulnerability

Severity: Severe

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Hadoop 0.23.0 to 0.23.11
Hadoop 2.0.0 to 2.5.1

Users affected: Users running the YARN NodeManager daemon with Kerberos
authentication

Impact: Vulnerability allows a cluster user to expose private files owned
by the user running the YARN NodeManager process.  The malicious cluster
user can create a public tar archive containing a symlink to a local file
on the node owned by the user running the YARN NodeManager process.  The
permissions of the local file will be changed to be world-readable when the
public archive is localized on the node.

Mitigation: Users should upgrade to 2.5.2.
