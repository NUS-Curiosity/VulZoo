Subject: CVE-2014-8106 qemu: cirrus: insufficient blit region checks

It was found that the Cirrus blit region checks were insufficient.

Cirrus is the default graphical adapter for x86 in qemu in any released
version, and it's also used for vnc (spice uses qxl).

A privileged guest user could use this flaw to to write outside of vram
allocated buffer boundaries in the host's qemu process with attacker
provided data.
