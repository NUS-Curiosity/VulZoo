Subject: CVE-2014-8104 - Critical OpenVPN DoS Vulnerability

I saw an email come through the pfSense list yesterday, but haven't seen
anything about it discussed here. So I'm bringing it to this list's
attention.

[ As a side note, I mistakenly thought the OP on the pfSense list
mistakenly posted his link to a forum post on OpenVPN that was written in
2010, when in fact, that user had joined in 2010 but posted to the pfSense
forum recently - https://forums.openvpn.net/topic17625.html ]
