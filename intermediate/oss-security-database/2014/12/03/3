Subject: RE: CVE-2014-8104 - Critical OpenVPN DoS Vulnerability

Hi,
Is this vulnerability really 'critical' if we consider that a malicious user
needs to be authenticated to crash the gateway?
I understand that the vulnerability is exploitable if a client is
compromised (certificate stolen).
In such a case (client compromised), the risk is greater as confidentiality
is breached.

I saw an email come through the pfSense list yesterday, but haven't seen
anything about it discussed here. So I'm bringing it to this list's
attention.

[ As a side note, I mistakenly thought the OP on the pfSense list mistakenly
posted his link to a forum post on OpenVPN that was written in 2010, when in
fact, that user had joined in 2010 but posted to the pfSense forum
recently - https://forums.openvpn.net/topic17625.html ]
