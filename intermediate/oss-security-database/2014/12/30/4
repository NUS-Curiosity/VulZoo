No, CVE-2014-9425 is only for the Zend/zend_ts_hash.c issue with:

  142        tsrm_mutex_free(ht->mx_reader);
  143        tsrm_mutex_free(ht->mx_reader);

We generally can't change the scope of a CVE ID to include additional
bugs after that CVE ID has been sent to oss-security. Otherwise,
anyone developing a remediation for a CVE would typically see their
remediation suddenly become incomplete because the meaning of the CVE
changed.

Also, for example, information showing a double-free issue (aka
CWE-415) would not be combined with information showing a
use-after-free issue (aka CWE-416). That situation would have two CVE
IDs even if the reports were sent together and were, say, specifically
about PHP 5.6.4.
