We're not sure why you listed Ticket #6016 twice, but here are the CVE
IDs for these http://jqueryui.com/changelog/1.10.0/ XSS issues:

> Title, reported by shadowman131
> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6016
> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/7e9060c109b928769a664dbcc2c17bd21231b6f3

Use CVE-2010-5312.


> combobox demo, reported by DJtomy

As far as we can tell, 5fee6fd5000072ff32f2d65b6451f39af9e0e39e
doesn't fix anything in the jQuery library, and it is reverted in
f2854408cce7e4b7fc6bf8676761904af9c96bde. We're not sure about
conventions for changelogs, but it seems potentially misleading to
just include "Fixed: XSS in combobox demo. (#8859, 5fee6fd)" in the
1.10.0 changelog anyway.

A side issue is that 5fee6fd5000072ff32f2d65b6451f39af9e0e39e, by
itself, only modified the demos/autocomplete/combobox.html file. We
realize that the demos are shipped in the jquery-ui distribution.
However, the demos typically wouldn't be part of the deployed product,
so there's a question of whether combobox.html could have its own
CVEs. In this case, the question seems largely irrelevant because
changing the combobox.html code wasn't a useful way to address a
vulnerability.

Use CVE-2012-6662 for the issue fixed in
f2854408cce7e4b7fc6bf8676761904af9c96bde.
