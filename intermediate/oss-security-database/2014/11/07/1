> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-kerberos

> A fix was merged and released today for the package which performs
> kerberos authentication when using python-requests. Prior to this,
> every version of the package did not properly handle mutual
> authentication which means that the client did not verify that the
> user was communicating with a trusted server. The version which
> contains the fix is 0.6 and all prior versions are considered
> vulnerable.

> This bug, however, prevented the mutual authentication code from being
> executed, so it's possible that users think they're talking to a
> trusted server, but they're not.

> requests_kerberos/kerberos_.py

> Make certain that responses always pass through handle_other() to provide mutual
> authentication before returning them to the user.

> 0.6: 2014-11-04
> Handle mutual authentication (see pull request 36)
