-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

>  * XSS in wptexturize() via comments or posts. Unauthenticated. Affected
> versions <= 3.9.2 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5). Discovered by Jouko Pynnonen.

> http://klikki.fi/adv/wordpress.html

Use CVE-2014-9031.


>  * XSS in media playlists. Affected versions 3.9, 3.9.1, 3.9.2, 4.0.
> Reported by Jon Cave.

Use CVE-2014-9032.


>  * CSRF in the password reset process. Affected versions 4.0, 3.9.2, 3.8.4,
> 3.7.4.

> http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/30418

Use CVE-2014-9033.


>  * Denial of service for giant passwords. This is the same issue as
> CVE-2014-9016
> in Drupal, and was reported by the same individuals to both projects. The
> phpass library by Solar Designer was used in both projects without setting
> a maximum password length, which can lead to CPU exhaustion upon hashing.
> Reported by Javier Nieto Arevalo and Andres Rojas Guerrero.

> http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/30467

Use CVE-2014-9034.

We consider this distinct from CVE-2014-9016 because the use of a
maximum password length can be chosen independently.


>  * XSS in Press This. Affected versions <= 4.0 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 /
> 3.9.3). Reported by John Blackbourn.

Use CVE-2014-9035.


>  * XSS in HTML filtering of CSS in posts. Affected versions <= 4.0 (except
> >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 / 3.9.3). Reported by Robert Chapin.

Use CVE-2014-9036.

(Note that, for the XSS issues, we have used the discoverer
information as expressed in the
http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/25/10 post -- this is
slightly different from the way the discoverer information was
expressed in the https://wordpress.org/news/2014/11/wordpress-4-0-1/
announcement.)


>  * Hash comparison vulnerability in old-style MD5-stored
> passwords. Affected versions <= 4.0 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 / 3.9.3). The
> WordPress install have once run WordPress < 2.5 (March 29, 2008), the user
> must not have logged in since the install was updated to >= 2.5, and the
> user needed to have a password for which the md5 hash was something that
> could be collided with due to PHP dynamic type comparisons (something like
> 1 in 170 million). Reported by David Anderson.

Use CVE-2014-9037.


>  * SSRF: Safe HTTP requests did not sufficiently block the loopback IP
> address space. Affected versions <= 4.0 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 / 3.9.3).
> Reported by Ben Bidner.

> https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/30444

Use CVE-2014-9038.


> * Previously an email address change would not invalidate a previous
> password reset email.  Affected versions <= 4.0 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 /
> 3.9.3). WordPress now invalidates this if the user remembers their
> password, logs in, and changes their email address. Reported by Momen
> Bassel, Tanoy Bose, and Bojan Slavkovic.

> http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/30431

Use CVE-2014-9039.
