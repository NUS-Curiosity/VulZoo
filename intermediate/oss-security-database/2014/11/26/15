Thanks!

This post linked to
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/19/18. Unfortunately,
the discussion there was quite brief and the only reason mentioned
seems to be a potentially sheer number of such issues. I don't feel
it's a valid reason without clearly documenting such an approach in
documentation intended for users (and for security researchers).

Then, in http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/19/18,
Moritz Muehlenhoff writes: "For an application profile such as an
office suite handing out CVE IDs to crash/CPU overload bug w/o
potential of code injection is a waste of time and impractical". This
is ambiguous as there are different office suite with different
behabvior in regard to crashes. E.g., crashed instance of AbiWord
doesn't take other windows with it.

Then, there is autosaving in LibreOffice. By default it's triggered
every 15 minutes. Hence only the last 15 minutes (or less) of work in
all windows is lost when a crash (or cpu load bug) happens (in default
configuration). This can also affect assessment of crashes as
non-/security issues. But it will be nice to explicitly state why and
which issues are considered non-/security.

I guess it will be better for folks from LibreOffice to comment on
this directly.

Yes, that's what I got from your earlier emails. Thanks for confirming
it.

And a vendor can even establish a security policy such as "you MUST
NOT work with potentially untrusted files". It's not ideal but it's
better to have a policy which accurately reflect the real
situation. (The example is speculative, I don't imply anything about
the real situation with LibreOffice.)

Unfortunately I don't see any such policy stated anywhere. One of the
natural places for it would be the page dedicated to security in
LibreOffice: https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/ . But it
doesn't touch the question of security policy. Instead, it links to
the list of security advisories:
https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/ , which
happily lists several DoS issues: CVE-2012-4233, CVE-2013-4156. IMHO
this reaffrims the default security policy.

I don't see any security policy in the Help too.
