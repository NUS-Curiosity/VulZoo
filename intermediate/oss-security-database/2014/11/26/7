> Crash importing malformed .rtf -- potentially exploitable for RCE

Use CVE-2014-9093 for bug 86449.

(For reference, http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/19/3 is
about finding a series of bugs in version 3.5.4 on Debian stable -- in
other words, a version based on a mid-2012 codebase -- and reporting
them directly upstream without commenting on 4.2.x or 4.3.x.)

For the others, in addition to the
http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/19/18 post, "Michael
Meeks from officesecurity@...ts.freedesktop.org indicated that they
are not interested in CVEs for DoS-only crashers" is also relevant.
This has multiple possible interpretations, e.g., "not interested"
because their security team won't track the issues using CVEs, or "not
interested" because they are not vulnerabilities. The "is a security
issue because it takes down all other windows with it" is often
relevant to CVE because it represents a default security policy if
there is no information from a vendor about their security policy.
However, a vendor is free to establish a security policy such as "if
you are working with a potentially untrusted file, you MUST NOT have
any other windows open in which you are maintaining state about your
other editing work." In other words, they can define all DoS-only
crashers to be applicable only in unsupported use cases.
