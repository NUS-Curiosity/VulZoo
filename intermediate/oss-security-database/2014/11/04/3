You're preaching to the choir; I highly value the good work they do. And
I am sensitive to the fact that assignments are sometimes made with
imperfect/incomplete information with time and other resource
constraints limiting the amount of analysis that can go into any given
report.

I used Alexander's post as a springboard for a follow-up question. The
case of libbfd, because of the variation in the issues, can be
illuminating as to CVE allocation - broadly speaking.

But, my take differs from Alexander's. He seemed to be questioning the
justification of some of the libbfd CVE assignments. My preference, on
the other hand, is a more liberal approach to allocation when dealing
with libraries. My earlier email explains why.

Your reply made me worry my email came across as some kind of rebuke.
So let me go on record by saying that though not taxonomic by design,
the CVE project is an extremely valuable vulnerability tracking tool and
MITRE should be commended for their leadership in this area.
