> Is this not a same/similar case?

There are many UDP protocols in which the reply traffic is larger than
the request traffic. A vendor can handle this in several possible
ways, including (for example) a statement that the protocol
implementation details were intentional, and that adverse effects are
a network-operations problem, not a software problem. CVE is about
software mistakes. So, at least at the moment, we are looking for
vendors who characterize the issue as a software mistake, and fix it.

In the chronyd case, this seems likely, so we don't expect any
long-term issue with including CVE-2014-0021 in CVE.

There may well be other reasonable approaches. An example approach
might be making CVE assignments for any protocol implementation that's
similar to one that already has a CVE (e.g., similar to ntpd). We're
not currently using that approach.
