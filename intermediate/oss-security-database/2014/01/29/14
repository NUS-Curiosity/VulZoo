Subject: CVE REJECT request: CVE-2013-4588

    Hello,

CVE-2013-4588 was assigned to a stack overflow flaw in the Linux kernel.

  -> http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/77

===
Kernel: net: ipvs: stack buffer overflow

Linux kernel built with the IP Virtual Server(CONFIG_IP_VS) support is
vulnerable to a buffer overflow flaw. It could occur while setting or
retrieving socket options via setsockopt(2) or getsockopt(2) calls.
Though a user needs to have CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to perform these IP_VS
operations.

Upstream fix:
-------------
   -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/04bcef2a83f40c6db24222b27a52892cba39dffb
===

The bounds check added by the above patch are found to be redundant, as the 
same is done in routine 'nf_sockopt_find'. [1]

   + if (cmd < IP_VS_BASE_CTL || cmd > IP_VS_SO_SET_MAX)
   +     return -EINVAL;
   + if (len < 0 || len > MAX_ARG_LEN)
   +     return -EINVAL;

That makes it a security non-issue. Please kindly reject this CVE.

Thank you.
