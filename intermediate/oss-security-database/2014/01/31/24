I'm referring to the following part of your message in [1]:

Would having about 7 days of advance notice (and at most 19 on some
occasions, per list policy) on a small subset of Linux kernel
vulnerabilities be of much help in preparing update packages?

Exactly, same for us in the end.

Yes.

Definitely true in this case.

This time I was lucky in that a) Ubuntu was fast, b) the patch was
trivial and c) the patch was identical to the one needed for our kernel.
None of these are guaranteed. Usually I would take the upstream
kernel.org patch or if not yet available the original patch and adapt it
to our kernel. We will run/support 3.12 longer than kernel.org will
provide updates, so at some stage, we need to start porting patches
ourselves. Note that since we're providing Lustre/ZFS support, we have some
restrictions in what kernel versions we use.

Sure, I know.

Thanks, fixed.
