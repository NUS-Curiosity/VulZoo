Thanks!  To make sure MongoDB developers are aware of this, I am CC'ing
this reply to security@...godb.com as specified here:

Past MongoDB security issues are listed here:

http://www.mongodb.org/about/alerts/#security-related

and they don't appear to include this "new" issue yet.

I've just added these two links to:
