https://drupal.org/node/2169595 already has CVEs:

CVE-2014-1398 (Comment, User and Node Statistics property access bypass)
CVE-2014-1399 (Entity list property access bypass)
CVE-2014-1400 (Unpublished comments access bypass)

As far as I know SA-CONTRIB-2013-098 and SA-CONTRIB-2014-002 are still missing
CVEs.
