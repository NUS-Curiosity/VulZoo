             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-1666 / XSA-87
                              version 2

     PHYSDEVOP_{prepare,release}_msix exposed to unprivileged guests

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The PHYSDEVOP_{prepare,release}_msix operations are supposed to be available
to privileged guests (domain 0 in non-disaggregated setups) only, but the
necessary privilege check was missing.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or misbehaving unprivileged guests can cause the host or other
guests to malfunction. This can result in host-wide denial of service.
Privilege escalation, while seeming to be unlikely, cannot be excluded.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.1.5 and 4.1.6.1 as well as 4.2.2 and later are vulnerable.
Xen 4.2.1 and 4.2.0 as well as 4.1.4 and earlier are not vulnerable.

Only PV guests can take advantage of this vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM guests will avoid this issue.

There is no mitigation available for PV guests.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

This issue was disclosed publicly on the xen-devel mailing list.

RESOLUTION
==========
