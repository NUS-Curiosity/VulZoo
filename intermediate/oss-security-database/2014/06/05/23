Can you comment on how the four patches:

Subject: [patch 1/4] futex-prevent-requeue-pi-on-same-futex.patch
Subject: [patch 2/4] futex: Validate atomic acquisition in
Subject: [patch 3/4] futex: Always cleanup owner tid in unlock_pi
Subject: [patch 4/4] futex: Make lookup_pi_state more robust

relate to these two on LKML:

Subject: [PATCH 3.14 001/228] futex: Add another early deadlock detection check
Subject: [PATCH 3.14 002/228] futex: Prevent attaching to kernel threads

http://lists.openwall.net/linux-kernel/2014/06/05/436

It appears that "futex: Add another early deadlock detection check" is
assumed to have been applied, and is being revised further by "futex:
Make lookup_pi_state more robust", but "futex: Prevent attaching to
kernel threads" is a patch on its own, not touched by the four patches.
Correct?  Should distros be applying "futex: Prevent attaching to kernel
threads" as well (back-porting it as necessary)?  Does it have security
impact (it appears so)?

Thanks, and sorry for my confusion.

Alexander
