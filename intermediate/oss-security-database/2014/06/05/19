There are different default-password problems that seem to have been
fixed at substantially different times, and this would often require
separate CVEs.

The issue reported in
http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/29/4 apparently
included a default password of mooo. Use of mooo apparently stopped
after
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/commit/e7e53d296787e674859c1a06db93fcf9d98173b4
(September 2013).

Commits such as
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/commit/4339020c62e43fa16f2145d46636f7dc0e26327f
suggest that other default-password issues were fixed in 2014,
apparently including password, marionette, mongopass, OSEnterprise,
and changeme.

To have one CVE for everything, you'd need a situation similar to:

   1. one version released by Red Hat was based on code such as
      https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/e4c285f52fa93ed4626837d0436943717f85843a/enterprise/install-scripts/generic/openshift.sh
      which has both the mooo issue and other default-password issues

   2. the next version released by Red Hat fixed the mooo issue and
      the other default-password issues

Is that what you mean, i.e., no release had a partial fix?

(The reason this question originally came up is that the wording in
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1097008 is "the optional
installer also did this." You've now clarified that the reason for
those MONGO_PASSWORD= lines in broker.conf is that the product was
installed by this optional installer. However, a need for multiple
CVEs is still possible, as reflected in the question above.)

Finally, are any of the CVEs duplicates of CVE-2013-4253 or
CVE-2013-4281? Those two CVE IDs are mentioned at
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/master/README.md
but the only attempted documentation seems to be links to nonexistent
access.redhat.com URLs, and the two CVE IDs don't seem to be in
Aliases fields in Red Hat Bugzilla.
