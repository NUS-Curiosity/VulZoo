Specifically, the futex syscall can leave a queued kernel waiter hanging
on the stack. By manipulating the stack with further syscalls, the waiter
structure can be altered. When later woken up, the altered waiter can
result in arbitrary code execution in ring 0.

This flaw is especially urgent to fix because futex tends to be
available within most Linux sandboxes (because it is used as a glibc
pthread primitive).
