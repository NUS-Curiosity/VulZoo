Thanks!

Yes, there is a parameter in the daemon.conf configuration file that 
allows the user to turn the autospawn off.

I have tested the patch, and it survives the empty packet without the 
infinite loop. Besides, after the patch, there is no code path in which 
recvmsg() is not called after a successful FIONREAD ioctl (even if it 
returns a zero size). So, any FIONREAD-related infinite loop that 
possibly remains on the RTP reception path after the patch is to be 
found on the path where the ioctl itself fails.
