To the people on oss-security e.g? Published CVEs and obviously problems we
experience on our installations.

Probably something to tell Red Hat as well. They are still on 2.6.32 :)
But they have their reasons just as we have ours ...

That's not totally new to me :) So let's say "as sure as possible".

Right. Thanks for the hint with the test suites. Will try them out.

    >> Anyway, I've applied all the (2+4) patches to our 3.12.

    Greg> Why are you "stuck" at 3.12?

We need quite a bit of out-of-kernel.org stuff. Without staying on a
fixed release for some time, this is non-maintainable.

    Greg> There is someone still maintaining 3.12-stable, why not rely

We thankfully do rely on that as our base. In this case though, the
patches haven't been ported until this moment. And I can't wait for them
to appear since there is no time-line when that will happen ...

Thanks for your comments,

Roland
