Subject: CVE-2014-0477: Email::Address: Denial-of-Service in
 Email::Address::parse

Hi

Bastian Blank reported a denial of service vulnerability in
Email::Address, a Perl module for RFC 2822 address parsing and
creation[1]. Email::Address::parse uses significant time on parsing
empty quoted string, as allowed by RFC 2822.

CVE-2014-0477 was assigned to reference this issue.

Bastian Blank suggested a fix which was applied upstream as [2]
contained in a new upstream version 1.905[3] which contain additional
commits to avoid slowdowns.
