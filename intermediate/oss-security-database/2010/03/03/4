Sorry about not informing oss-security when I did this; I meant to.

CVE-2009-3297 has been rejected since it was used heavily for multiple 
issues that should have been assigned separate entries.  People weren't 
just using CVE-2009-3297 for Samba, they were using it for fuse and 
others.

This rejection has since been uploaded to the CVE site:

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3297

Along with the three new CVEs:

CVE-2010-0787 (Samba)
CVE-2010-0788 (ncpfs)
CVE-2010-0789 (FUSE)

I try very hard to avoid doing this kind of split (and REJECT) except when 
it seems like there will be a lot of confusion; I know how much work it is 
to clean these up in advisories and so on.  I recognize that many people 
have used CVE-2009-3297 for the Samba problem, but it's been used in 
DEBIAN:DSA-1989 for FUSE and FEDORA-2010-1145 for ncpfs, for example.  An 
administrator who thinks that "CVE-2009-3297 is fixed" might have solved 
the ncp issue but still be vulnerable to the Samba issue.

I had originally asked oss-security for clarification on this, without an 
answer:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/02/04/7

(recognizing that I'm the most guilty party for not answering...) but 
other situations forced me to clear this out.

I agree - this was an error on my part, so I apologize for the confusion.
