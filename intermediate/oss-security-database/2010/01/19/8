Subject: BIND CVE-2009-4022 fix incomplete

Hi Steve,

I'm not assigning this one as I'm not sure if you've seen this or not.

ISC released an update today for BIND, part of it was that CVE-2009-4022
was not completely fixed:
https://www.isc.org/advisories/CVE-2009-4022

If you look down at the bottom of their advisory you can see this:
    Jan. 19 - Revised Summary, Severity, Description, Workaround, Impact &
    Solution (earlier fixes incomplete) 

As best as we can tell, this is why:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=554851#c7

Thanks.
