According to the blog post, "all bugs are in the new ACL Manager
introduced in 2008-05-05".  The vulnerable code appears to have been
committed on "Sat Nov 17 07:57:40 -0800 2007":

http://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/commit/2a3623da3390f0118660d541928ae8c635631b3d#diff-1

According to http://www.dokuwiki.org/changes , there was no release
between 2007-06-26 and 2008-05-05, which must be why only the latter
date was mentioned.
