All,

I apologize for taking so long to handle this.  Dan, thanks for being
so diligent about digging up more information!  That couldn't have
been easy, let alone fun.

Due to the high variation in affected kernel versions, most of these
are SPLIT.

These are SPLIT because the affected files are in different versions.

hdsp.c - CVE-2010-4080

hdspm.c - CVE-2010-4081

Presumably the lack of a current patch means this will affect a
different version than CVE-2010-4072 (ipc/shm.c shmctl), see above.

CVE-2010-4083
