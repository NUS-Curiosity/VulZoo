Subject: Re: glibc $ORIGIN problem - CVE-2010-3847

Hi,

This was discussed off-list before, but just to have it more widely
known/available - distros are welcome to reuse our sanitize-env patch
from Owl:

http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/glibc/glibc-2.3.5-owl-alt-sanitize-env.diff

or perhaps a revision of it forward-ported to current glibc in ALT's
package.  Here's a relevant commit:

http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=64963eb224c9

Perhaps further changes were made to some of the patched files in
Dmitry's repository above (the commit is a bit dated, whereas the
current tree is based on glibc 2.11.2).  Dmitry, you could want to
comment on that.

These changes, being a result of exhaustive review of glibc for env var
uses, might also provide further inspiration for more attacks on glibc
(without our patch).

Alexander
