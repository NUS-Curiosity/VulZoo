Subject: CVE request: kernel: heap contents leak from ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL

This is an uncommon leak I found that was fixed in 2.6.36 here:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=ae6df5f96a51818d6376da5307d773baeece4014

This is different from CVE-2010-2478, but was introduced at the same time
(0853ad66, 2.6.27-rc1).

Thanks,

-Kees
