I believe the disagreement here is caused by different opinions on what
should be and what does not need to be called security.

This got CVE-2010-2443 from Mitre few days ago.  But I guess you're
going to (or should?) ask for one more for td_stripbytecount case I
pointed out in one of the previous replies (split due to different
fixed-in version).  Sauli's fuzzer to blame for the discovery again ;).
