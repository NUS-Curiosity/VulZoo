Subject: CVE assignment notification -- CVE-2010-0426 -- sudo improper pseudocommands
 file path check

Hi vendors,

   a privilege escalation flaw was found in the way
   sudo used to check file paths for pseudocommands.
   If local, unprivileged user was authorized by sudoers
   file to edit one or more files, it could lead to
   execution of arbitrary code, with the privileges
   of privileged system user (root).

   [2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=567337

Patches from Todd C. Miller:
   [3] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=395605&action=diff
       (against sudo v1.7.x)
   [4] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=395606&action=diff
       (against sudo v1.6.x)

   which should overcome the deficiency.
