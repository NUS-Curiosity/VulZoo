Subject: CVE-2005-4886 assigned to old remote oops

http://git.kernel.org/linus/0d3d077cd4f11

This issue should have got a CVE name back in 2005 when it was discovered 
to be a security issue, but probably didn't affect any other vendor at the 
time.  Fixed upstream in 2.6.12, more details at:

Thanks, Mark
