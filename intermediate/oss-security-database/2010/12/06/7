 "pfSense "graph.php" Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities"


The original Full-Disclosure post also mentions a number of issues 
that only affect pfsense 2 beta 4.

So, I've assigned CVE-2010-4412 for these other issues.

To review:

CVE-2010-4246 - graph.php (pfsense stable and 2 beta 4)

CVE-2010-4412 - pkg_edit.php, pkg.php, status_graph.php, interfaces.php
                 (only 2 beta 4)
