Subject: Re: CVE request: VLC media player - DLL preloading
 vulnerability


We will have one CVE per vulnerable application.  Yes, it's going to be 
very painful.  Roughly, the rationale is: "the product does not protect 
against a common configuration/behavior in its environment."

> VLC was exploitable by loading wintab32.dll, a component request by
> Qt, as shown in http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/14750/

Use CVE-2010-3124


> There's another possibility with DMO.

Is this a distinct product outside of VLC, or is it just a different 
component / attack vector?
