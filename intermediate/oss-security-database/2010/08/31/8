The way Cisco has written up this CVE, they are clearly focusing on the 
generation of corrupted attributes, not a protocol problem.  So, I'd want 
a separate CVE for the general BGP design issue.

I can't quite tell the difference between CVE-2009-2055 and what Florian 
is requesting a CVE for.  In CVE-2009-2055, Cisco seems to be implying 
that it's a problem in XR, not the design of the whole protocol - but it's 
not immediately clear if they even "fixed" it.  The issue at hand is 
whether we need a new CVE or a rewrite for the old CVE-2009-2055.
