Subject: Multiple bugs in freetype

FYI

I've reported recently multiple problems in freetype (around ~20),
most of them are NULL-ptr derefs, stack exhaustion and div by zero
issues, but the rest might be interesting. RedHat was kind enough to
assign CVE numbers to some of them. vendor-sec members tend to treat
it as public issues, so reposting here:

> CVE-2010-2497 freetype integer underflow #30082 #30083
> CVE-2010-2498 freetype invalid free #30106
> CVE-2010-2499 freetype buffer overflow #30248 #30249
> CVE-2010-2500 freetype integer overflow #30263
> CVE-2010-2519 freetype heap buffer overflow #30306
> CVE-2010-2520 freetype buffer overflow on heap #30361

I wasn't trying to make weaponized exploits, although some of those
issues are clearly exploitable.
