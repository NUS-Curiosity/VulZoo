Subject: Another freetype-demos buffer overflow

Hello everyone,

While fixing CVE-2010-2527, one of our developers, Marek Kašík, discovered
an additional buffer overflow in the ftmulti demo program.

I've assigned it CVE-2010-2541. There is more information in our bug:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=617342

Upstream was told and added a partial fix to their git:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2-demos.git/commit/?id=3636982a7666bcfa0e47fb31d565314d1b3e7d78

I've attached a patch to the Red Hat bug that we're using.

Thanks.
