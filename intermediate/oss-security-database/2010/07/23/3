Subject: CVE assignment notification -- CVE-2010-2474 -- JBossESB

Hello Steve,

JBossESB: privilege escalation in cross-domain contexts

The security context from an authentication request should check the
domain and invalidate the information if the service is secured with a
different security domain.

At present the execution of a service with a different domain could
result in the pipeline being executed differing credentials, one set
from the first domain if the request is still valid, a second set
from the second domain if it has expired.
