Subject: Re: CVE Request -- Mercurial --Doesn't verify subject
 Common Name properly


Ouch, this is painful for a number of reasons.

Maybe Python "should" get the CVE, but the decision to push the issue to 
application developers means that those developers will each have to 
provide fixes, and software consumers will have to track these related 
vulns at the application level.

(One could make the same argument about fundamental design flaws in 
standards-based protocols, for which CVE generally assigns a single 
identifier, but those issues generally feel "different" to me.  Quite 
logical, I know...)

Anyway, I think we need to assign separate CVEs for each affected product 
as an instance of "an implementation not working around security-relevant 
design limitations of APIs" (which is consistent with the approach that 
CVE has taken with respect to the DLL hijacking / insecure library loading 
issues of the past couple months.)

I've been tempted to start assigning a single CVE to design limitations 
such as this Python certificate issue, and (where needed) independent CVEs 
for affected implementations, but I'm not feeling adventurous enough yet. 
it kind of goes against the idea where each vuln has only one CVE 
associated with it.

So - use CVE-2010-4237 for the issue in Mercurial, and feel free to 
consult with me privately for the other issues if you wish.
