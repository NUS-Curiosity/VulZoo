I can't follow you with that. Those packages are part of my Debian
distribution, which is lenny and the reason I initially posted this
issue to Debian security.

Let me add that for an experienced user it should/may be clear that
command line arguments may be visible in process list or via the proc
fs. The MySQL GUI-tools _and_ mysql command line tool do in fact that
they care about sensitive information (eg. user, password, host). But
then the GUI does this epic fail calling 'mysql' through an 'xterm -e
mysql ...' call. Or some other kind of terminal. This is a kind of stupid.
