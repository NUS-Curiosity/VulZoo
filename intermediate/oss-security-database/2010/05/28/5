Ah, right. I confused the bug mentioned in 3.4.8 with the advisory.
Thank you for clarification and pointing this out!

Right. I am going to pick up the fix, then.

Thanks. To summarize, 3.3.x is only affected by OOB read (CVE-2010-1642)
As smbd follows error code path where smb_panic is called, I guess we
can say that 3.3.x is not affected by CVE-2010-1642.
