This already appears to have a CVE, fromt he bug report:

ReversingLabs Corp approached CERT-FI about detection evasion attacks found in
many Antivirus software and other signature-based protection software. In
short, the case is related to falures when parsing archive formats.
?ReversingLabs Corp has crafted 15 ZIP, CAB, 7Z and RAR archive files that are
considered valid by the relevant decompressors, but signature based detection
systems cannot detect malicious content contained within them.

CVE: CVE-2010-0098
