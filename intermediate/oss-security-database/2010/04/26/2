Subject: WordNet wn format string issue

Hi!

Petr Pisar discovered a format string bug in wordnet while doing review
of wordnet packages in Fedora / RHEL:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=585206
  https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=317265

We're not treating this as security issue (no good attack vector,
fortify source mitigation) and fixing it as a regular bug.  Though as
the issue can be triggered in a similar way as CVE-2008-2149, and some
vendors fixed that one as security, bringing this to attention if
anyone wants to use a different approach.
