OK.  BTW, I think this is not exploitable on current kernels, at least
not via RLIMIT_NPROC (it does not apply to fsuid), yet it is desirable
to check the return value from such syscalls.

What about the completely missing privilege switching in pre-1.1.2 (the
bug found by Sebastian)?  I don't recall if it already had a CVE id
assigned or not.
