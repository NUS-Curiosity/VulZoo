Steve,

There are a few requests for MITRE below (2008 and 2009 IDs needed).

This needs to be properly understood. I'm not assigning IDs until someone
does a proper triage.

I presume this is a DoS (the details are pretty slim)
CVE-2010-3443

This looks to be a buffer overflow.
CVE-2010-3444

I'm out of 2009 IDs. Can MITRE take this one.

I'm out of 2009 IDs. Can MITRE take this one.

I have no 2008 IDs. This one will have to wait for MITRE.

This one looks like a stack overflow, the advisory isn't very clear, but
claims there are two possible outcomes. We can always split later if
needed.
CVE-2010-3445
