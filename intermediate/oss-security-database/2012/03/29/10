Thank you for the suggestion.  Unfortunately, adding more clarity and
specific examples would make the wiki page even longer and potentially
more tempting to skim/skip.  For now, I opted to simplify the text
quoted above to:

"Please notify upstream projects/developers of the affected software,
other affected distro vendors, and/or affected Open Source projects
before notifying one of these mailing lists in order to ensure that
these other parties are OK with the maximum embargo period that would
apply (and if not, then you may have to delay your notification to the
mailing list), unless you're confident you'd choose to ignore their
preference anyway and disclose the issue publicly soon as per the policy
stated here."

This is slightly shorter and it let me add emphasis (bold face) in some
places.
