Subject: The Gimp GIF plug-in CVE-2012-3481 issue

Hi,

so here is the 3rd one:

specially crafted GIF image files could cause a heap-based buffer overflow via 
an integer overflow of the 'height' / 'len' properties of the file.
Attackers could exploit this to cause a Denial of Service (Application crash)
or to (potentially) execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running 
gimp.

Thanks to Jan Lieskovsky and Florian Weimer for joining me in researching this
flaw.

Matthias
