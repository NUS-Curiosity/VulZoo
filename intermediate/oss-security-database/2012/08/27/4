Subject: CVE request: joomla before 1.5.26 password change

I think this one
http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/396-20120305-core-password-change.html
never got a CVE.

Note what may be confusing: 1.5.25 and 1.5.26 both fixed a password
change vuln, the earlier one already got a CVE (CVE-2011-4321), but
they seem to be different issues.
