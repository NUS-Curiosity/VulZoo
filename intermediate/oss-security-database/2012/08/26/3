Why?  2a doesn't affect 0.7.x, because wash_attribs in these versions
has the following code
{{{
      if (isset($this->_html_attribs[$key]) ||
         ($key == 'href' && preg_match('/^(http:|https:|ftp:|mailto:|#).+/i', $value)))
        $t .= ' ' . $key . '="' . htmlspecialchars($value, ENT_QUOTES) . '"';
}}}
while 0.8.x used to have
{{{
      if (isset($this->_html_attribs[$key]) ||
         ($key == 'href' && preg_match('!^([a-z][a-z0-9.+-]+:|//|#).+!i', $value)))
        $t .= ' ' . $key . '="' . htmlspecialchars($value, ENT_QUOTES) . '"';
}}}

As one can see, version from 0.7.x won't allow "javascript:" as
0.8.x's version will, so 0.7.x is clean from this bug (checked sources
for 0.7.1, 0.7.2 and 0.7.3).

Basing on the fix,
  https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/c086978f6a91eacb339fd2976202fca9dad2ef32
I believe that the "self XSS" is only triggered when user composes
e-mail in HTML mode and one of his text signatures contains some HTML
code.  The issue shows up only when a message is composed (so, it
doesn't matter for the signatures of received mails) and XSS is
triggered by the contents of the signature that the user has for his
identity.  So, only the entity that can edit user's signatures will
provoke this XSS, thus this vulnerability can be used only with some
other one that will allow to modify user's signatures.
