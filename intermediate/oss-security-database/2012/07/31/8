"The RSGallery2 team is pleased to announce the release of RSGallery2
3.2.0 for Joomla 2.5.x and RSGallery2 2.3.0 for Joomla 1.5.x. These
are security releases, users are advised to upgrade immediately. A
special thank you goes to Stergios Kolios."

This announcement already has CVE assignments (at least CVE-2012-3554
and CVE-2012-4071; possibly others) but we are still coordinating with
the researcher to determine if any details will be released.
Therefore, this message about the CVE assignments may be useful to
only a limited audience.

The changelog.php files in the RSGallery2 2.3.0 and 3.2.0 downloads
currently do not label any specific changelog entries as security
fixes with their "* -> Security Fix" notation. It might or might not
turn out that one or more of the changelog entries actually is
associated with either CVE-2012-3554 or CVE-2012-4071.
