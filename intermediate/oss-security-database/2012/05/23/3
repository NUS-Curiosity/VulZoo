Subject: CVE request(?): hostapd: improper file permissions of hostapd's config leaks credentials

Hi Kurt, 
Hi vendors,

not too critical in my opinion, but I think still worth to be at least 
mentioned briefly as other distros such as Fedora 16 were affected too:

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=740964

I'm not sure whether this issue should get a CVE, but in the past similar 
vulnerabilities got a CVE (e.g. CVE-2012-0863).

Thanks,
Matthias
