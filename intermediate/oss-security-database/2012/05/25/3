This should be rejected as per the message two responses after the first
reference above:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/08/10/2

where Eugene says, based on the "this isn't a security flaw" message
from Dan Rosenberg.

Can you add a "REJECT" or "DISPUTED" note or whatever?  This probably
should have never been written up.

Thanks.
