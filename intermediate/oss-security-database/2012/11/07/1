Subject: CVE Request -- axis2, axis2c

Hello Kurt, Steve, all,

I did not find CVEs for Axis2 or Axis2/c when going through the pile of
CVEs generated from the paper:

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_ccs12.pdf

Axis appeared to get CVE-2012-5784 but it is my understanding that Axis2
and Axis2/c are different codebases and should therefore get their own
CVE entries.

shmat_cccs12.pdf claims Axis2 is vulnerable but silent on Axis2/c.

Has anyone else looked into if Axis2/c is vulnerable? (I gave it a very
cursory inspection.) The project pages are silent on the issue.

Did I overlook these CVE entries?

Thanks
