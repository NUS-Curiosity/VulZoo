Because I update the web site and I didn't get around to it until this
morning. http://www.libreoffice.org/advisories/cve-2012-4233/
https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/HTB23106 is the source of the CVE and
their advisory contains the reproducer documents.

Well, I'd be more than happy to have more distro folk subscribed to
officesecurity@...ts.freedesktop.org Fixing the bugs is easy, syncing
embargo dates between LibreOffice and Apache OOo is a bit more
