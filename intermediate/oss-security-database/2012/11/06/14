Subject: CVE-2012-4461 -- kernel: kvm: invalid opcode oops on SET_SREGS with
 OSXSAVE bit set

A flaw has been found in the way Linux kernel's KVM subsystem handled
vcpu->arch.cr4 X86_CR4_OSXSAVE bit set upon guest enter. On hosts
without the XSAVE feature and using qemu userspace an unprivileged
local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
