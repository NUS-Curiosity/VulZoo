This is all there is:

The Debian changelog is probably not of much use.

I don't see how that is relevant, this is the mcrypt(1) tool in concern. 
libmcrypt and libmhash are not affected.

The attached file is a PoC built with a slightly modified mcrypt. It appears 
that there is no way to disable the salt bit in the unmodified mcrypt while 
still producing a file that can later be opened. (for those looking at the 
code, the salt bit is only disabled when using --bare)
