While checking the issue I noticed that the same issue also affects 
radsecproxy's DTLS support, which was not fixed. Upstream has now released 
version 1.6.2 addressing the vulnerability in its DTLS support code.

Now, the thing is that upstream re-used the previously assigned CVE id 
CVE-2012-4523. According to the guidelines a new id should be assigned since 
they affect different versions even if the issues are related.

So, I guess a new id is in order?
