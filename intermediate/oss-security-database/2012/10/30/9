Subject: RE: VideoLAN TiVo Demuxer Duplicate CVEs (CVE-2011-5231 and
 CVE-2012-0023)

Sean,

Thank you for noticing this.

CVE-2011-5231 was an accidental duplicate of CVE-2012-0023, and it was only released a couple days ago.

CVE-2012-0023 has been in use since January.

Google search results show that CVE-2012-0023 has many more hits.

Even though the issue was first published in December 2011 and CVE-2012-0023 has "2012" in the name, this off-by-one is very common for identifiers for issues published in December/January of any year.

So, even though it's not "aesthetically appropriate," keep CVE-2012-0023 and REJECT CVE-2011-5231.

- Steve

function in modules/demux/ty.c in VideoLAN VLC media player 0.9.0
through 1.1.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
