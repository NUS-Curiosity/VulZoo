Here are CVE assignments for these mixed open-source/closed-source
issues:

Windows: flood of ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation
         messages - CVE-2012-5362

  (a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-4669)


FreeBSD and NetBSD: flood of ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation
                    messages - CVE-2012-5363

  (a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-2393)

  (We're aware that it's possible for the observed IPv6 behavior to
   have different root causes on FreeBSD and NetBSD.)


Mac OS X: flood of ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages - no CVE

  (There's no CVE assignment from MITRE because the observed impact
   is potentially reasonable for some design goals. It's possible
   that there will be a future CVE assignment by Apple.)


Windows:  flood of ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets
          containing multiple Routing entries - CVE-2012-5364


FreeBSD and NetBSD: flood of ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets
          containing multiple Routing entries - CVE-2012-5365


Mac OS X: flood of ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets
          containing multiple Routing entries - CVE-2012-5366

  (We're aware that it's possible for the observed IPv6 behavior to
   have the same root cause on Mac OS X as on both FreeBSD and
   NetBSD.)
