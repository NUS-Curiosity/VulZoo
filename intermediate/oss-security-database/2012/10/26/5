Subject: CVE-2012-5671: Exim <= 4.80 DKIM heap-based buffer overflow

Hi,

Exim 4.80.1 was released earlier today to fix a remotely triggerable
heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in DKIM support (enabled by
default).  Here's the announcement as posted to the exim-announce list
(including instructions on how DKIM support may be disabled, and
download links for Exim 4.80.1):

Distro vendors had 1 day of advance notice, which some have made use of.
