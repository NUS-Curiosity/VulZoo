That's not the same as a generic "don't use this."  For this 
CVE-2012-2400, there is a specific advisory from a specific vendor telling 
customers to patch a vulnerability.  It's "unspecified" all over the place 
due to lack of details, so risk analysis is problematic, but it's a 
statement of some kind of vulnerability in a specifc version by an 
authoritative source.

Oracle and HP publish advisories like this on a regular basis.

CPE is neutral on security - it's just about identifying software packages 
and versions.  One main use is in vulnerability management, but it's more 
general than that.
