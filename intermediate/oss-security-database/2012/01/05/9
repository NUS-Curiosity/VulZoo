Correct form of CVE request:

-------------------
According to Secunia https://secunia.com/advisories/47381/  "The
vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error when using munge
authentication and can be exploited to impersonate other users."

http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/resources/docs/torque/3-0-3/changelog.php#259

>From changelog: b - Change so user cannot impersonate a different user
when using munge.

This affects Torque 2.5.8 and is fixed n Torque 2.5.9. Torque 2.5.9 was
released on Nov 5, 2011
(http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/resources/downloads/torque/)

-------------------

Ideally then you'd also post a link to the source code change. Depending
on the availability of an upstream advisory/etc. this isn't always
necessary.

Important note: In future I will not be assigning CVE's for postings of
just the Secunia URL, you need to include more information as mentioned
above so that a) I can research and verify the issue and b) to reduce
the chance of duplicates and c) assign the correct year.

Please use CVE-2011-4925 for this issue.
