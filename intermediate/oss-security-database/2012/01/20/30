My bad, I read the NEWS and then the ChangeLog and promptly forgot that
CVE-2011-4566 had been assigned. I emailed with Pierre Joye, here is a
summary:

Please use CVE-2012-0788 for this issue.

These need to be researched a bit more (do they have a security impact?).

Unfortunately memory leaks (where memory is used, then released but not
released properly) can result in denial of service attacks.

Please use CVE-2012-0789 for this issue.
