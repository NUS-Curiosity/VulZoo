As Steve has pointed out, this was incorrect (different researcher found
the second vuln). So the previous issue:

CVE-2011-3361 is related to "Ensure $num is numeric in lib/BackupPC/CGI/Browse.pm to avoid XSS attack."

=====================

For this new issue please use CVE-2011-4923 which covers:

View.pm XSS vulnerabilities exploited via urls such as:

index.cgi?action=view&type=XferLOG&num=<XSS here>&host=<some host>
index.cgi?action=view&type=XferErr&num=<XSS here>&host=<some host>

Sorry for the mess.
