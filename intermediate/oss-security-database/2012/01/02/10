i pondered this possibility when i initially added the override
parameter to kcheckpass, but i couldn't come up with anything usefully
exploitable - it would have to be some right which is granted to the
user *only* by this particular service - but not full logins. this seems
a bit far-fetched. so while you have a valid point in principle, it
doesn't seem particularly relevant for desktop systems.

fwiw, linux-pam's pam_unix has an own setuid helper for shadow pw
verification for some time now. most services don't actually need root
for authentication at all. consequently, it is usually not useful to
install kcheckpass setuid root at all, which makes this whole discussion
somewhat irrelevant in the first place (except that the upstream
makefiles will still try to install with setuid root).
