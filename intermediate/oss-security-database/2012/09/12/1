Subject: CVE Request: Apache Axis2 XML Signature Wrapping Attack

Juraj Somorovsky and colleagues have described an XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attack against a variety of platforms in a paper delivered at USENIX [0]. Various platforms are covered, including OpenSAML and Apache Axis2. OpenSAML is covered by CVE-2011-1411 [1], but I can't find a CVE ID for Axis2. Could one please be assigned? The OpenSAML CVE ID is 2011 because some vendors were given pre-notification of the issue in 2011. Since all the details were made public in 2012, I suggest assigning a 2012 CVE ID for Axis2.

Thanks
