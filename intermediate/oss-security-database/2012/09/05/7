            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-3496 / XSA-14
                             version 3

           XENMEM_populate_physmap DoS vulnerability

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.  Credit Matthew Daley.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

XENMEM_populate_physmap can be called with invalid flags.  By calling
it with MEMF_populate_on_demand flag set, a BUG can be triggered if a
translating paging mode is not being used.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest kernel can crash the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen systems running PV guests.  Systems running only HVM guests
are not vulnerable.

The vulnerability dates back to at least Xen 4.0.  4.0, 4.1, the 4.2
RCs, and xen-unstable.hg are all vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be mitigated by ensuring that the guest kernel is
trustworthy or by running only HVM guests.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.

CREDIT
======

Thanks to Matthew Daley for finding this vulnerability (and that in
