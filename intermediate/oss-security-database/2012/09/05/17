Our interpretation is that this line item is not CSRF:

   "Registered user could change app configs without admin rights"

It's a permissions/authorization problem.  It's made WORSE by CSRF, but 
even without CSRF, a registered user could do something they shouldn't.

So, we assigned CVE-2012-4752 for "Registered user could change app 
configs without admin rights"

The 4.0.5 changelog at http://owncloud.org/changelog/ also says "Several 
CSRF security fixes"

So, we assigned CVE-2012-4753 for the CSRF fixed by 4.0.5.
