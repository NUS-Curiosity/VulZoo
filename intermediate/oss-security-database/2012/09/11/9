Subject: Re: CVE Request (minor) -- JVM: heap memory disclosure
 (possibly various JDKs)


Jan/Kurt,

The bug report appears to be describing a narrow class of vulnerability 
that could affect multiple codebases that implement Java Virtual Machines, 
not just Oracle's; if so, then a separate CVE would be needed for each 
REPORTED codebase, and CVE-2012-4416 is ONLY for bug id 7196857 for the 
Oracle-supported JVM.

I wonder about the severity of the issue, but given the possibility that 
applications might access an array before a fill, and applications may 
depend on there being "empty" elements after initialization, this seems 
reasonable for a CVE.
