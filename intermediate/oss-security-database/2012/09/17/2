Um, I focused on the suid/daemons that we have on our dist, so theres
indeed no claim that the list of attack vectors is complete. I cannot
check any library/pam combination of any UNIX that is outthere. :)
Though, I tried to be as 'complete as possible'.
For example, you can also use su as attack vector if you run systemd
(via pam_systemd and su keeping a parent pam-session as root, triggering
pam_systemd.so load with user given environment; loading libdbus).
And finally pam_ck_connector, but AFAIS this cannot be triggered
as it only runs via login or login managers which dosn't leave room
for DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS passing so easily.
But you know, these guys are maybe more clever than us and they get more
money for their results. Thats the A in APT. :)

Ok, there is also 'nonce-tcp' which you could use to dump (parts of) secret files.
There is also the option to use a UNIX socket that you dont have write permission
to, writing semi-garbage to it (with root peer credentials), maybe triggering
actions in daemons that are 'unexpected'.

Yes, but I didnt check libgio explicitely. There might be other issues lurking inside
libgio.
