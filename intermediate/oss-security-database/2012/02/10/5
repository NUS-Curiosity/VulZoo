Subject: [vs] CVE-2012-1037 GLPI <= 0.80.61 LFI/RFI

Hi,

I found a File Inclusion vulnerability in GLPI <= 0.80.61. I contacted the project team; 
the bug is now patched and a new version is available (0.80.7).

I've published the advisory on fulldisclosure:

http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Feb/157 <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Feb/157>

CVE-2012-1037: GLPI <= 0.80.61 LFI/RFI

Severity: Important

Vendor: GLPI - http://www.glpi-project.org

Versions Affected
=================

All versions between 0.78 and 0.80.61

Description
===========

GLPI fails to properly sanitize the GET 'sub_type' parameter in the front/popup.php file:

  [...]
  checkLoginUser();

  if (isset($_GET["popup"])) {
     $_SESSION["glpipopup"]["name"] = $_GET["popup"];
  }
 
  if (isset($_SESSION["glpipopup"]["name"])) {
    switch ($_SESSION["glpipopup"]["name"]) {
  [...]
    case "add_ruleparameter" :
           popHeader($LANG['ldap'][35], $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);
           include strtolower($_GET['sub_type']."Parameter.php");   // <======= 
           break;
  [...]
  
To be triggered, the attacker needs to be authenticated. However, GLPI provides default accounts that often aren't 
changed or disabled:

    glpi/glpi
    tech/tech
    normal/normal
    post-only/postonly

Impact
======

Since there is a suffix, the vulnerability can be used as a RFI (requires allow_url_include = On).

For LFI, the target file has to end up with "parameter.php". GLPI automatically escapes all GET and POST parameters 
with addslashes(), so the null byte technique is not usable. I have not tested exploitation using the path truncation 
technique but it might be possible.


Mitigation
==========

Upgrade to GLPI 0.80.7.


Exploit
=======

http://<server>/front/popup.php?popup=add_ruleparameter&sub_type=<file>


Timeline
========

08 feb 2012 - Found the bug.
09 feb 2012 - Contacted the GLPI Team.
09 feb 2012 - Bug fixed & new version available.

Thanks to the GLPI team for being responsive!

I think you can package the new version into security updates.
Please let me know if you need any more details.
