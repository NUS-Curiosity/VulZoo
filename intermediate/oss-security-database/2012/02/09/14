There's nowhere near enough information available to validate that the
new(?) issue reported by ImmunitySec matches up to CVE-2012-0492.
Hopefully ImmunitySec/Oracle can comment on this and clear it up for
users/vendors.

Unfortunately CVE only works as well as the vendors using it decide it
will. A biased example: Red Hat provides links to security reports with
details, bugzilla entries, code commit information, and so on. Vendors
that fail or refuse to provide details/code commits for their Open
Source projects and so on make things extremely difficult for users and
other vendors. =( An example of this is the following blog entry:

http://blog.montyprogram.com/oracles-27-mysql-security-fixes-and-mariadb/

I'm not trying to pick on Oracle but this is topical and a perfect
example of the problem(s) CVE was meant to address but can't if vendors
don't participate in the process appropriately.
