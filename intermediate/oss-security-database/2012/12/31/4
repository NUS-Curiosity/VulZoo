Subject: Dispute CVE-2012-5903 SMF index.php scheduled-parameter XSS

Hello,

I tried to reproduce CVE-2012-5903 SMF index.php scheduled-parameter XSS without luck. Does someone have a working payload for this? References:

Until someone provides a working PoC I dispute this issue. SMF hasn't replied to my emails about this. Please note there is several comments[1][2] in forums about this too.

It's not a security vulnerability if attacker already has administrator access to the application. Should we REJECT CVE-2012-5903?
