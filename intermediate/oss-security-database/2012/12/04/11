Ahhh... yes, Timo is correct.  If you're only DoS'ing your own
connection, I wouldn't consider this a flaw.

I (mistakenly) thought this took down the entire dovecot server.  My
apologies.

Can we have this CVE rejected or disputed?  As Timo says, it's a
pointless CVE.

Thanks, and sorry about that.
