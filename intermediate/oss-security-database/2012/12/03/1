(removed the full-disclosure/bugtraq mailing lists, they don't need to be 
further spammed with minor CVE assignment details.)

Kurt - I suggest we REJECT CVE-2012-5579 and preserve CVE-2012-5611 
because of the strong likelihood that CVE-2012-5611 will be more commonly 
referenced in the very near future.

Misconfigurations generally should not be captured with CVE IDs.  At best, 
we will probably describe CVE-2012-5613 to emphasis the sysadmin's role.

Just to toss a droplet of esoteric commentary into the bloodbath - while I 
generally agree with the belief that distinct privileges should imply 
boundaries that can not be broken, the reality is that most privilege 
models are not well-documented or well-understood, and some privileges 
might (by design) be effectively equivalent.  So, privilege issues aren't 
necessarily guaranteed to be treated as vulnerabilities if they don't 
violate the intended security policy.  There was some discussion about 
this kind of challenge in the Linux kernel on oss-security a while back 
that makes my head hurt just thinking about it.

Does anybody have any URLs for older reports of this issue?
