Hi!

If you're preparing cscope updates for CVE-2009-0148 and you may still
be shipping packages based on 15.5, you may want to have a look at:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=499174

Steve, as the first public report for this is from 2006:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=189666

I believe 2006 CVE id is needed here.

If you only ship 15.6 or later, you can ignore this mail.
