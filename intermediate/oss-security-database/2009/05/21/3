This is a different vector that isn't directly covered by that CVE, and
may not have been fixed entirely when CVE-2009-1482 was fixed, so a new
CVE can be considered.

However, we generally avoid including "defense-in-depth" fixes unless they
can be demonstrated to be exploitable - or, if a vendor plans to release
an advisory "just to be safe."

The changeset says "maybe not XSS exploitable though" so I'm not sure
whether a CVE's needed yet.
