The resolution indicates the bug had already been fixed at the time the 
bug was reported, thus implying it was a duplicate report of 
CVE-2008-0783. The CVE-2008-0783 patch [1] explicitly validates 
the 'action' variable as mentioned in the bug report.

However, the original poster reported the 0.8.6i-3.4 Debian revision as 
vulnerable and according to DSA 1569-2 [2], it should not have been.

Do you have any indication this is not covered by CVE-2008-0783?
