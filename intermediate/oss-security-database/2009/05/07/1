Subject: [oCERT-2009-001] Pango integer overflow in heap allocation size 
	calculations

#2009-001 Pango integer overflow in heap allocation size calculations

Description:

Pango is a library for laying out and rendering text, with an emphasis
on internationalization.  Pango suffers from a multiplicative integer
overflow which may lead to a potentially exploitable, heap overflow
depending on the calling conditions.  For example, this vulnerability is
remotely reachable in Firefox by creating an overly large
document.location value but only results in a process-terminating,
allocation error (denial of service).

The affected function is pango_glyph_string_set_size. An overflow check
when doubling the size neglects the overflow possible on the subsequent
allocation:

  string->glyphs = g_realloc (string->glyphs, string->space *
                              sizeof (PangoGlyphInfo));

Note that other font rendering subsystems suffer from similar issues and
should be cross-checked by maintainers.


Affected version:

Pango < 1.24


Fixed version:

Pango >= 1.24
(check with your package maintainer for backports)
