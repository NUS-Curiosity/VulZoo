They look like typos to me.  That DSA lists 7 CVE-2009-390x CVEs, while
it should probably list CVE-2009-3*6*0x ones.  CVE-2009-390[345] are
public and for unrelated applications.

Changelog seems to list correct ids:

+poppler (0.8.7-3) stable-security; urgency=high
+
+  * Non-maintainer upload by the Security Team.
+  * Fix CVE-2009-3603 to CVE-2009-3609, CVE-2009-0755. Based on patches
+    by Marc Deslauriers
+  * Fix CVE-2009-3938
