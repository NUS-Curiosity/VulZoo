Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the strip_tags function in
Ruby on Rails before 2.2.s, and 2.3.x before 2.3.5, allows remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving
non-printing ASCII characters, related to HTML::Tokenizer and
actionpack/lib/action_controller/vendor/html-scanner/html/node.rb.
