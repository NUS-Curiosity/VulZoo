Subject: ghostscript CVE for multiple NULL dereferences in JBIG2 decoder

I'm not sure if a CVE name has ever been requested for this issue.
Similar to Adobe's CVE-2009-0658 issue, the same PDF proof-of-concept
was used to crash ghostscript (multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws
found in Ghostscript's JBIG2 compression format decoder).

If a CVE name was assigned for this, does anyone know it?  I can't find
it.  If not, could one be assigned?  Details are available on our
bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=503785

Thanks.
