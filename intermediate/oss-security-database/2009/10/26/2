in past cve's, from what i've seen, when there is an issue with the same
source code in multiple projects (i.e. embeds and forks), there is only
one cve issued with a text something like, "buffer overflow in
openoffice.org and go-oo...."

so, i think 2009-3239 should be rejected and the text for 2009-2139
should be updated to indicate that the problem affects both
openoffice.org and go-oo.
