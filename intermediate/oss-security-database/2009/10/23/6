Based on the above -^ I would vote for separate CVE identifier for expat flaw
(and its embedded copies in dozen of packages):

https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615#c8
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615#c10

To remember sounding of CVE-2009-2625:
---------------------------------------

Apache Xerces2 Java, as used in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK
and JRE 6 before Update 15 and JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 20, and
in other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop and application hang) via malformed XML input, as
demonstrated by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing framework.

Argumentation for new CVE id:
-----------------------------
a, CVE-2009-2625 doesn't mention expat (just "other products", this could
    be fixed though)
b, The impact differs on Apache Xerces2 Java (infinite loop and application
    hang, 100% cpu use -- have checked unpatched java-1.6.0-openjdk) and in expat
    (clean crash) - gdb output attached for both testcases.

Steve, Josh, which way would be easier to follow?
i, mention expat in CVE-2009-2625, change impact to DoS (crash)
    via malformed XML file, which triggers UTF-8 parser crash? or
ii. assign new CVE id for expat (and its embedded copies) with
     clean impact description and note that crash happens in UTF-8
     parser?

Opinions, ACKs, NACKs appreciated.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
