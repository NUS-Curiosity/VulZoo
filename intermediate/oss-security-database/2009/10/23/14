In traditional CVE, it would have been appropriate to combine the
following three issues, because they are the same flaw type (XSS) and
affected versions, even though they are clearly distinct bugs:

Within the CVE team, we've started applying an additional consistency rule
where we will even split issues with the same vuln-type and version *if*
the finder/discloser/researcher/creditee is different.  In this case, none
of these three CVEs have exactly the same finder, so it's OK to let them
remain split. (I'm somewhat nervous about the implications of this rule
process-wise - and CVE assignment is already "weird enough" - but I'm
continuing with this anyway.)

Note that the TYPO3 advisory doesn't explicitly state which bug is present
in the 4.0.x series.

This would still remain distinct from the other XSS because the affected
versions are different.
