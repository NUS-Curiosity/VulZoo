What type of specific information are you looking for? Mozilla works
with upstream Xiph.org to get such issues resolved upstream, and then
we either take a minimal fix downstream or a full library upgrade to
latest upstream code. Lately, we've been having to do full library
upgrades due to the complexity of fixes and dependencies on other
changes.

I'll see if we can get those still private bugs concerning the media
library fixes open sooner rather than later, though. I can probably CC
you (and possibly others) to the bugs quicker than that, if it would
help.
