Subject: Kernel ecryptfs CVE id (CVE-2009-2908)

As some of you may have noticed, the 2.6.31.2 kernel contained this bit in the
changelog:
eCryptfs: Prevent lower dentry from going negative ...

The commit is here:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.31.y.git;a=commit;h=afc2b6932f48f200736d3e36ad66fee0ec733136

I've assigned this CVE-2009-2908. At the very least it's a DoS as it causes an
OOPS due to a NULL pointer dereference, it may allow arbitrary code execution
as the structure in question does contain function pointers. If someone who
knows more than me wants to chime in here, please do.

I've filed a bug in the Red Hat Bugzilla:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=527534

It doesn't really contain any additional data. If I discover anything new,
I'll add my comments there.

Thanks.
