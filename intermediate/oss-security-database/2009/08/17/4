Subject: SELinux and mmap_min_addr behaviour (CVE-2009-2695)

FYI given upstream discussions we gave CVE-2009-2695 to 'a system with 
SELinux enabled with the default targeted policy is more permissive for 
unconfined domains, allowing local users to map low memory areas even if 
mmap_min_addr protection is enabled.  This could allow the exploitation of 
NULL pointer dereference flaws'. See also http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-18042
