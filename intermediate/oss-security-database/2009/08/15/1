Subject: mailfilter 0.8.2 fixes CVE-2007-1558 (APOP)

CVE-2007-1558:
  The APOP protocol allows remote attackers to guess the first 3 
  characters of a password via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks that use
  crafted message IDs and MD5 collisions. NOTE: this design-level issue
  potentially affects all products that use APOP, including (1)
  Thunderbird 1.x before 1.5.0.12 and 2.x before 2.0.0.4, (2) Evolution, 
  (3) mutt, (4) fetchmail, (5) SeaMonkey 1.0.x before 1.0.9 and 1.1.x 
  before 1.1.2, (6) Balsa 2.3.16 and earlier, and possibly other 
  products.

Mailfilter 0.8.2 is now out and added the mitigation mutt added a while 
ago: http://mailfilter.sourceforge.net/NEWS
