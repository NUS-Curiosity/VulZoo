Subject: Re: CVE request: kernel: parisc: isa-eeprom missing
 lower bound check


I wasn't sure how to interpret the phrase "poke in random memory" from the
bug comment and there wasn't enough source code context, so I guessed that
the impact is reading unexpected memory, but maybe it's also a crash or
whatever.

The eisa_eeprom_read function in the parisc isa-eeprom component
(drivers/parisc/eisa_eeprom.c) in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc6
allows local users to access restricted memory via a negative ppos
argument, which bypasses a check that assumes that ppos is positive
and causes an out-of-bounds read in the readb function.
