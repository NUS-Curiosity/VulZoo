Due to lack of relevant details from the researcher, it's unclear whether
vectors 2 through 4 are also array index errors, although it's implied
somewhat.  Arguably this could have been split into 2 separate CVES.

Multiple buffer overflows in NASA Common Data Format (CDF) allow
context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated
using (1) an array index error in the ReadAEDRList64 function, and
other errors in the (2) SearchForRecord_r_64, (3) LastRecord64, (4)
CDFsel64, and other unspecified functions.
