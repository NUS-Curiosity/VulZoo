Following up an earlier question of mine (umbrella CVE for a class of  
problems, here: weak X.509 name verification that terminates early on  
embedded NUL bytes):

Mandriva Security (I think it was them - if I recall correctly) wrote in  
their fetchmail security advisory something along the lines of  
"CVE-2009-2666, [...] related to CVE-2009-2408" (with some more details).  
This is probably the best way around this problem of how do we assign and  
organize: We have the individual CVE name for the fetchmail weakness (so  
it can be tracked), and we also have as reference the CVE name of the  
first published issue that sort of founded a problem class, by instance of  
Mozilla NSS.

CVE-2009-2408 here turns into some dual-use: (1) to track the  
library/Mozilla application bug, (2) to name the problem class.

Perhaps this should/could be considered a pragmatic solution to the  
"umbrella CVE" problem I posed earlier.
