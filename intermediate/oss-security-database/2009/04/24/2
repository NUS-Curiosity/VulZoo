The URL above is equivalent to the http://git.kernel.org CONFIRM that's
currently in the CVE.

We have two main input streams for CVE: incoming requests, and
already-public information in mailing lists or vuln DBs that we monitor.
oss-security contains incoming requests but it also becomes public
information that's monitored by other vuln DBs.  Sometimes those VDBs pick
up your CVE requests before we do.  That's probably what happened here.
(I wasn't the original CVE analyst for this bug.)
