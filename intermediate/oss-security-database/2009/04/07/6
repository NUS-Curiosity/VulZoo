The details are scant, but I believe bug #1462[1] to be different from the
unrar issue discussed in the blog and CVE-2009-1241.

Specifically, the patch for 1462 is svn commit r4981 to
libclamav/untar.c to prevent a DoS (infinite loop).

Also, bug 1335[2] is fixed in commit r4980 by a patch to cli_scanpe() in
libclamav/pe.c to prevent a DoS (divide by zero).

AFAICT, the unrar issue (CVE-2009-1241) is covered in Debian bug
#484642[3] and clamav bug #1050[4].

Could we get CVE identifiers for the two remaining issues?
