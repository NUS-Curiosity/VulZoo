Subject: Re: FreeType malformed compressed data issue

Hey, you're right, this one was just a non-exploitable crash, the
other issues were regular integer overflow. I didn't report this
particular one as a security issue, but it was fixed at the same time,
sorry for the confusion :-)

Thanks, Tavis.
