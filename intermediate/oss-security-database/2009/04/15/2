If some applications mis-use the library API then that is really
unfortunate.

Changing the library to work around application bugs is a BAD idea.
It helps only one platform and complicates cross-platform software
that does play by the rules.

I would recommend fixing applications that mis-use the library API.
To encourage application developers, the library could log a warning
and return a DENY result for improper calls such as a zero-length
hostname or address argument.
