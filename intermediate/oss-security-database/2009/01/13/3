Subject: update on CVE-2008-5718

Hi,
I just did a security update for CVE-2008-5718 and since the 
description is not really verbose I thought I'd share what I 
found in case anyone else is working on that.

This issue only affects netatalk installations that make use 
of a pipe command to handle the print file and also use one 
of the available variables in the piped command.

The netatalk documentation documents %F, %U and %J while 
there is also %C which is undocumented but visible in the 
code (and does the same as %J).

These variables are expanded, %F with the content of %%From:, %J with 
%%Title: from the PostScript stream and %U with the user 
printing the file.

After the variable expansion (which is done in 
pipexlate(lp.c) the specified,expanded command is passed to 
popen() without properly escaping it before.

So exploiting this is pretty straight forward if you know 
the papd configuration (which is at least world-readable on 
Debian) just by for example preparing a ps file including 
something like %%Title: $(yourcommand) and print it.

Steve, can you update the CVE id description according to 
this information?

Cheers
Nico
P.S. The patch I used can be found on:
