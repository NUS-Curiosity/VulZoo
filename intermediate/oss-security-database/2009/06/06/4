The patch link seems to be working again.


======================================================
Name: CVE-2009-1932
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1932
Reference: CONFIRM:http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-good/commit/?id=d9544bcc44adcef769cbdf7f6453e140058a3adc
Reference: BID:35172
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/35172
Reference: OSVDB:54827
Reference: URL:http://osvdb.org/54827

Multiple integer overflows in the (1) user_info_callback, (2)
user_endrow_callback, and (3) gst_pngdec_task functions
(ext/libpng/gstpngdec.c) in GStreamer Good Plug-ins (aka
gst-plugins-good or gstreamer-plugins-good) 0.10.15 allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
code via a crafted PNG file, which triggers a buffer overflow.
