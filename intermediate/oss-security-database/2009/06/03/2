Subject: CVE-2009-1385 kernel: e1000_clean_rx_irq() denial of service

e1000 has an issue in which a partial frame can leak through validation
check on reception. This can lead to an underflow in the length
computation of the frame which will panic the system in question.

This bug was discovered and fixed in e1000-7.5.5 since April 2007, but
was somehow not merged in the upstream kernel...

Notes:
 * fix panic on changing MTU under stress
