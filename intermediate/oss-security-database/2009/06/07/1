Just checked, but nr_sendmsg() does not use lock_sock()/release_sock() in
2.4, so the patch above did not bring any regression. I don't know if this
lock is needed there. It has always been there in 2.6 and never in 2.4.
Either it's a long-time missed patch or just not needed here. I won't touch
it as I have no way to test it and nobody complains ;-)

Regards,
Willy
