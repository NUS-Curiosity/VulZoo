Subject: libtiff buffer underflow in LZWDecodeCompat

A crafted TIFF can crash libtiff in LZWDecodeCompat via underflow (different
from CVE-2008-2327).

Based on discussions[1] and a quick analysis[2], I don't think this is
exploitable, but it does lead to crashes in any application using libtiff.
I've reported it upstream[3], with the attached patch.

Has anyone else looked this over?
