Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin 2.11.x
before 2.11.9.4 and 3.x before 3.1.1.0 allows remote attackers to
perform unauthorized actions as the administrator via a link or IMG
tag to tbl_structure.php with a modified table parameter.  NOTE: other
unspecified pages are also reachable, but they have the same root
cause.  NOTE: this can be leveraged to conduct SQL injection attacks
and execute arbitrary code.
