Subject: watch for LDAP anonymous binds and empty passwords


FYI, we've seen "LDAP anonymous binds and empty passwords" a couple times
in CVE, the latest being PostgreSQL (IDs forthcoming).  This smells like a
general vuln class to me, so developers may want to re-examine their LDAP
support.  CVE-2009-1905 and CVE-2007-6714 are examples.

I haven't investigated closely but the pattern may be that a blank
password can return successful authentication when anonymous binds are
allowed.  There's a relatively rare history of LDAP-specific vulns, which
suggests to me that not a lot of people have been looking for this.
