Davem generally handles his own -stable queue for the net subsystem
and submits fixes himself, but that's nice to notify about upcoming
patches in case it gets missed !

Indeed, it seems so. I'm queuing it up for next release. I will have
to review it since the changes are not obvious. If you're aware of
any reproducer, I'd be glad to get it (in private) ; I'd like to at
least ensure I don't break the driver while trying to fix it !

Thanks!
Willy
