Subject: [oCERT-2009-008] Dillo integer overflow


#2009-008 Dillo integer overflow

Description:

Dillo, an open source graphical web browser, suffers from an integer overflow
which may lead to a potentially exploitable heap overflow and result in
arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is triggered by HTML pages with embedded PNG images, the
Png_datainfo_callback function does not properly validate the width and
height of the image. Specific PNG images with large width and height can be
crafted to trigger the vulnerability.

Affected version:

Dillo <= 2.1

Fixed version:

Dillo >= 2.1.1
