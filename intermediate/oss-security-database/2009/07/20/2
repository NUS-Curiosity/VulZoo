What makes you think this does not affect earlier kernels?  This does
not match my analysis, but maybe I am missing something, hence I ask.

BTW, as you're aware, this fix is a hardening measure for/against
SUID-root programs with a certain class of design errors in them; it is
not exactly a fix for the kernel itself, although it should be in the
kernel.  I do not mean to downplay the issue, but I think it is
important that we distinguish the different types of changes that we are
making in response to Brad's exploit.
