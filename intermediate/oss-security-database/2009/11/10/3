That issue has a CVE id. I gave it CVE-2009-3614 quite some time ago.
http://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=125561742729846&w=2

The discussion then branched out into if an unchecked call to setuid to drop
permissions is a security flaw (as a user could cause it to fail, preventing
oping from dropping privs). I saw nothing in the code that showed it to be
anything but a bug, as oping doesn't do anything exciting after the call could
fail.
