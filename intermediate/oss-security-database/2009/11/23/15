Subject: Re: CVE request: php 5.3.1 -  proc_open() bypass PHP
 Bug #49026 [was: Re: CVE request: php 5.3.1 update]

CVE-2009-4018

PHP before 5.3.1 proc_open() can be used to bypass the
safe_mode_protected_env_vars INI setting. This could be used to alter the
process environment possibly executing arbitrary code.
