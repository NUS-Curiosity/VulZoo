Subject: CVE-2019-0204: Some Mesos components can be overwritten making
 arbitrary code execution possible.

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Mesos 1.4.0 to 1.7.0
The unsupported Apache Mesos pre-1.4.0 releases may be also affected.

Description:
A specifically crafted Docker image running under the root user can
overwrite the init helper binary of the Mesos container runtime and/or
the Mesos command executor. A malicious actor can therefore gain
root-level code execution on the host.

Mitigation:
1.4.x users should upgrade to 1.4.3
1.5.x users should upgrade to 1.5.3
1.6.x users should upgrade to 1.6.2
1.7.x users should upgrade to 1.7.2
1.8-dev users should obtain Mesos 1.8.0 or latest snapshot of 1.8-dev
