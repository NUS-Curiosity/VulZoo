Subject: CVE-2019-10198: Authorization bypass in Foreman tasks plugin

Hello,

An authorization bypass was discovered in the Foreman tasks plugin which
allows authenticated users to see details of tasks without validating the
user has proper permissions to do so. Viewing the details requires prior
knowledge of the task UUID, which can not be easily guessed.

This affects Foreman tasks since version 0.7.8, and fixed in versions
0.15.7, 0.16.0 and newer.
Further information: https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27275
Commit fixing the issue:
