SECURITY-1424 / CVE-2019-10352
Users with Job/Configure permission could specify a relative path escaping
the base directory in the file name portion of a file parameter definition.

This path would be used to store the uploaded file on the Jenkins master,
resulting in an arbitrary file write vulnerability.


SECURITY-626 / CVE-2019-10353
By default, CSRF tokens in Jenkins only checked user authentication and IP
address.

This allowed attackers able to obtain a CSRF token for another user to
implement CSRF attacks as long as the victim's IP address remained unchanged.


SECURITY-534 / CVE-2019-10354
Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views.

These views are frequently comprised of several view fragments, enabling
plugins to extend existing views with more content.

In some cases attackers could directly access a view fragment containing
sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding
view.
