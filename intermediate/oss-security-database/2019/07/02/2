Subject: CVE-2019-13164 Qemu: qemu-bridge-helper ACL bypassed with long
 interface names

   Hello,

It was discovered that the Access Control List (ACL) implemented by 
qemu-bridge-helper program could be bypassed in particular case when the 
bridge interface names are as long as IFNAMSIZ-1, ie 15 characters. If the ACL 
specified in the /etc/qemu/bridge.conf file denies access to a bridge 
interface with name IFNAMSIZ-1 bytes long, but it allows all other interfaces. 
It is possible for a local attacker to use qemu-bridge-helper to create a tap 
device and attach it to a denied bridge interface, thus bypassing the ACL. 
This could be used by the attacker to get access to confidential data 
transmitted on the bridge.
