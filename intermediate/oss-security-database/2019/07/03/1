Subject: CVE-2019-10183 virt-install: unattended option leaks password via
 command line argument

   Hello,

Virt-install(1) utility used to provision new virtual machines has introduced 
an option '--unattended' to create VMs without user interaction. This option 
accepts guest VM passwords as command line arguments. Thus leaking them to 
others users on the system via process listing.

It was introduced recently in the virt-manager v2.2.0 release.
