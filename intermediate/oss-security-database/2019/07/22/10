IMHO the key difference between the two is the initial impression one
gets from the message layout.


This Exim message looks just like any other full-detail disclosure
report. It takes time to read the text and clicking through to the
repository links to realize that this is not actually leaking code
changes and detail about the issue.


The OpenSSL is just a warning that a new version X is about to land.

People who care are left to do their own research into where to get it.
The distro teams who need the warning already know that.
