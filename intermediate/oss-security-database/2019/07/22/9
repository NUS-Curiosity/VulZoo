Perhaps part of the confusion stems from:

This statement makes it sound like the fix can be downloaded by anyone
that knows about the git repo containing the fix...

you only published the public repo, which does not yet contain either
the tag exim-4.92.1 nor the branch exim-4.92.1+fixes until CRD (as
promised in the headline).  Perhaps the wording could be improved to
explicitly mention that the private repo mentioned earlier is
specifically redacted from this more public pre-release announcement,
and/or repeating the fact that the public repo will not contain the fix
until CRD (some readers will miss details that are presented only in a
headline but not reiterated in the body, on the grounds that headlines
typically only summarize contents rather than add details, such that you
can read slightly faster by skipping headlines if you are going to read
the full version instead).

Or even the choice of tense in this paragraph may help: it sounds like
past tense ("is the officially released version") even though at the
time of the email it is a future tense ("will become the officially
released version").
