Subject: CVE-2018-11802: Apache Solr authorization bug vulnerability disclosure

CVE-2018-11802: Apache Solr authorization bug disclosure
Severity: Important
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected: Apache Solr 7.6 or less

Description:
jira  ticket : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-12514
In apache Solr the cluster can be partitioned into multiple
collections and only a subset of nodes actually host any given
collection. However, if a node receives a request for a collection it
does not host, it proxies the request to a relevant node and serves
the request. Solr bypasses all authorization settings for such
requests. This affects all Solr versions that uses the default
authorization mechanism of Solr (RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin)

Mitigation:
A fix is provided in Solr 7.7 version and upwards. If you use Solr's
authorization mechanism, please upgrade to a version newer than Solr
7.7.
