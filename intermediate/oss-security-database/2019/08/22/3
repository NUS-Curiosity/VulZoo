The issue is that, for example, PCI DSS requires fixes for anything with a score >= 4.0 so we have endless end-users demanding fixes for their servers which don't have even physical access or, indeed, physical presence.  It's not even demanding the fixes as they may already be fixed or simply not applicable because the affected driver isn't present; it's the hours or days wasted verifying that the fix available or not present.[2]

Before I put the VAX "Do Not Copy this Key" key (yes, it fits all 750s) I pressed accidentally pressed the reset button a couple of times just by propping myself up on the machine.  Spectacularly bad design by today's standards.

In the past we have considered Denial Of Service only USB vulnerabilites as non-issues, as physical access
can cause the same.

USB Vulnerabilities where you can achieve code execution by a malicious USB device are something else though and in my opinion warrant a CVE.
