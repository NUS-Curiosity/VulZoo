True, but we care about more than just the kernel side of things.

Can I suggest that we fork the discussion around security-bugs.rst to
LKML? I can suggest an initial patch to address your comments here but I
think that this is better handled on LKML.

My concern with Monday is timezones: we should do the math here, but I'd
like to avoid spilling over to Sunday (or very early Monday for that
matter) for some timezones.

As far as I understand specific dates for the microarchitectural bugs
were set pretty late in the process.

It's not just the microarchitectural bugs I was referring to, we are
getting security reports from users about security bugs in various
distros and we end up circling back with relevant distros to patch them
up. A recent example would be:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1834499 where an
internal user has reported a kernel memory leak due to a missing patch
in Ubuntu.

Microsoft's history with Linux is a rather recent one. I can offer the
following examples if you're willing to give us a few months off of the
"1 year" requirement:

CVE-2018-1002105: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/aks-clusters-patched-for-kubernetes-vulnerability/
CVE-2018-5391, CVE-2018-5390: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/security-bulletin-for-august-2018/
CVE-2019-5736: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/iot-edge-fix-cve-2019-5736/
CVE-2019-11477, CVE-2019-11478, CVE-2019-11479: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/security-advisory-on-linux-kernel-tcp-vulnerabilities-for-hdinsight-clusters/

I'd love to develop a framework that would allow for sharing of reports
between linux-distros/security@.../MSRC given the explicit approval of
the reporter. I think that the current "silo" model is broken.

Microsoft in general, and MSRC in particular have proved during
Meltdown/Spectre that they are a trusted entity which can work well with
the open source community to advance our common goals.
