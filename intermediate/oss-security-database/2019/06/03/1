Subject: kernel: CVE-2018-16871 nfs: NULL pointer dereference due to an
 anomalized NFS message sequence

A flaw was found in NFS in the Linux Kernel. An attacker who is able
to mount an exported NFS file system  is able to trigger a null
pointer dereference by an invalid NFS sequence.

This can panic the machine with a null pointer dereference and
therefore deny to the NFS server. Any outstanding disk writes to the
NFS server will be lost.

Upstream fix:
