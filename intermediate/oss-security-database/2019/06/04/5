Subject: Re: CVE-2019-10149: Exim 4.87 to 4.91: possible remote exploit

Hi,

our non-public security Git repo is

    ssh://git@....exim.org/exim.git

Access is granted to the known and trusted SSH keys we have.

The branch fix-CVE-2019-10149 contains the fix. It is one commit ahead
of the exim-4_91+fixes branch and we'll eventuelly merge it into the
+fixes branch.

The relevant commit is d740d2111f189760593a303124ff6b9b1f83453d and is
signed with my GPG key, the same key that signed this message.

If you need help backporting it to older releases, please do not
hesitate to contact us.

The planned CRD (coordinated release date) is 2019-06-11 10.00 UTC.
Please do not publish any package or source until this date.

    Best regards from Dresden/Germany
    Viele Grüße aus Dresden
    Heiko Schlittermann
