Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2019-12401: XML Bomb in Apache Solr versions prior to 5.0

Severity: Medium

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
1.3.0 to 1.4.1
3.1.0 to 3.6.2
4.0.0 to 4.10.4

Description: Solr versions prior to 5.0.0 are vulnerable to an XML resource
consumption attack (a.k.a. Lol Bomb) via itâ€™s update handler. By leveraging
XML DOCTYPE and ENTITY type elements, the attacker can create a pattern
that will expand when the server parses the XML causing OOMs

Mitigation:
* Upgrade to Apache Solr 5.0 or later.
* Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic
is allowed to post documents to the running Solr instances.
