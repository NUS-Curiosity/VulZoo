            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-19967 / XSA-282
                              version 2

             guest use of HLE constructs may lock up host

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Various Intel CPU models have an erratum listed under the title
"Processor May Hang When Executing Code In an HLE Transaction".  It
describes a potential hang when using instructions with the XACQUIRE
prefix on the host physical memory range covering the first 4 MiB
starting at the 1GiB boundary.

IMPACT
======

A malicious or buggy guest may cause a CPU to hang, resulting in a DoS
(Denial of Service) affecting the entire host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions are affected.

Only Intel based x86 systems are affected.  Please refer to Intel
documentation as to which specific CPU models are affected.

AMD x86 systems as well as Arm ones are not affected.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation.  A BIOS update may be available for some
systems, working around the issue at the firmware level.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches works around this issue
for the CPU models known to be affected at the time of writing.
