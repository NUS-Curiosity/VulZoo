Subject: [CVE-2018-11803] Apache Subversion Denial of Service Vulnerability

This is a security notification for Apache Subversion HTTP Servers:

CVE-2018-11803
Severity: Medium
Affected Versions: Apache Subversion 1.11.0, 1.10.0 to 1.10.3

Subversion's mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD module versions 1.11.0 and 1.10.0 
to 1.10.3 will crash after dereferencing an uninitialized pointer if the 
client omits the root path in a recursive directory listing operation. 
This issue can be triggered by any client on Subversion repositories 
configured for anonymous read access. If read access requires 
authentication, a denial of service attack can only be performed by an 
authenticated user.

The Subversion releases 1.10.4 and 1.11.1 contain the fixes for this 
vulnerability and are available immediately at:

https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/subversion/?p=32084

Additional details, including patches for 1.10.3 and 1.11.0 can be found at:

https://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2018-11803-advisory.txt

We encourage users of Subversion to upgrade to the latest appropriate 
version as soon as reasonable.

Thanks,
- The Subversion Team
