CVE-2019-17555: DoS via Retry-After header vulnerability

Severity: Important
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Olingo 4.0.0 to 4.6.0
The OData v2 versions of Olingo 2.x are not affected

Description:
The AsyncResponseWrapperImpl class reads the Retry-After header and
passes it to the Thread.sleep() method without any check. If a
malicious server returns a huge value in the header, then it can help
to implement a DoS attack.

Mitigation:
4.x.x users should upgrade to 4.7.0
