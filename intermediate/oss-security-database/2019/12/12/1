Subject: Apache SpamAssassin v3.4.3 released with fix for
 CVE-2018-11805

Apache SpamAssassin 3.4.3 was recently released [1], and fixes an issue
of security note where nefarious CF files can be configured to run
system commands without any output or errors.  With this, exploits can
be injected in a number of scenarios.  In addition to upgrading to SA
3.4.3, we recommend that users should only use update channels or 3rd
party .cf files from trusted places.

This issue has been assigned CVE id CVE-2018-11805 [2]
