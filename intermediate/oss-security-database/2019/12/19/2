Subject: [CVE-2019-17571] Apache Log4j 1.2 deserialization of untrusted data
 in SocketServer

CVE-2019-17571: Deserialization of untrusted data in SocketServer

Severity: Critical
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/RL:W

Product:
Apache Log4j

Versions Affected:
Apache Log4j up to and including 1.2.27. Separately fixed by
CVE-2017-5645 in Log4j 2.8.2.

Problem type:
CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data

Description:

Included in Log4j 1.2 is a SocketServer class that is vulnerable to
deserialization of untrusted data which can be exploited to remotely
execute arbitrary code when combined with a deserialization gadget
when listening to untrusted network traffic for log data.

Mitigation:

Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should
upgrade to Log4j 2.x which both addresses that vulnerability as well
as numerous other issues in the previous versions.
