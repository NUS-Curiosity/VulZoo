Subject: Re: CVE-2019-5736: runc container breakout exploit code

While fixing docker / runc is clearly the right fix, would using chattr -i
on runc be a quick mitigation for the issue? I believe that will prevent
the file from being overwritten by the exploit and Etienne Stalmans
verified that it helped:

(Note I tried top posting this to mailing list and it didnâ€™t work).
