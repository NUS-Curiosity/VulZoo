Subject: Dulwich security issue

Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team has found a buffer overflow
in the C implementation of the apply_delta() function in Dulwich. This
function is used when accessing Git objects in pack files. Any
Git server or client based on Dulwich that handles untrusted pack
files is very likely to be vulnerable.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2015-0838.

I have attached patches against current HEAD and 0.9.8.
Dulwich 0.9.9 has been released with just this patch.

Tarball available here:
https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/dulwich/dulwich-0.9.9.tar.gz

GPG signature:
https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/dulwich/dulwich-0.9.9.tar.gz.asc

Cheers,

Jelmer
