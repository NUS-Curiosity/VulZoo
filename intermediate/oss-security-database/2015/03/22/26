No, the scope of CVE-2014-9390 does not include that. Use
CVE-2014-9706 for this vulnerability in dulwich.

The scope of CVE-2014-9390 is currently undefined, in part because
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9390
intentionally doesn't have any related information. Usage of
CVE-2014-9390 is, very roughly, concerned with "The string .git/ for a
directory name has always been considered Very Special. Therefore,
other strings with equivalence relationships to .git/ must also be
considered Very Special."

The root cause of the problem in dulwich seems to be "The string .git/
for a directory name was not considered Very Special." This is
completely distinct conceptually, and is a much simpler case for CVE
coverage.

There are two types of concerns with CVE-2014-9390. First,
CVE-2014-9390 can only apply to omitted equivalence-relationship
handling in source code that is, or is directly copied from, "Git
before 1.8.5.6, 1.9.x before 1.9.5, 2.0.x before 2.0.5, 2.1.x before
2.1.4, and 2.2.x before 2.2.1" source code. It is not possible to have
a CVE for a cross-implementation vulnerability class of this
equivalence-relationship handling. Second, usage of CVE-2014-9390
seems to span multiple types of problems, possibly including all of:

  http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/178.html
  http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/180.html
  http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/182.html
