Subject: Another Python app (rhn-setup: rhnreg_ks) not checking hostnames
 in certs properly CVE-2015-1777

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1198740

Jan Bee of the Google Security Team reports:

The /usr/sbin/rhnreg_ks fails to properly validate hostnames in
certificates. This can result in man in the middle attacks.

===

Please note that this issue cannot easily be exploited to cause any
significant damage to a system other then preventing registration from
taking place properly which the attacker would be able to do in any
event if the can man in the middle the connection.
