Subject: Re: CVE-2015-0881

So for those of us vendors/etc that need to backport security fixes
and/or confirm our software is fixed how are we supposed to do this?

How long will the patch/attack information be embargoed for?

Also why has this been covered up for over 5 years and is now still a
secret? I'm very confused and I have some grave concerns about how
JVN/upstream is handling this.
