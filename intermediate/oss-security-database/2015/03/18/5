 releases

Hello,
I should mention that I forgot to include one CVE in my tweet: CVE-2015-0291.
I am not sure if this CVE has high severity or is low, but should be according
to openssl bug guideline 'high'. Seems so that this CVE is a Dos vulnerability:

https://twitter.com/ramosbugs/status/577935589397278720

@Sh1bumi @ArneBab @hynek I have working exploit for upcoming CVE-2015-0291 1.0.2
server DoS. As far as I know not active in wild.

@ramosbugs alias <David Ramos> is the bug reporter of CVE-2015-0291.

So, as far I know, there are 4 openssl CVEs:

CVE-2015-0209, CVE-2015-0285, CVE-2015-0288 and CVE-2015-0291

Are these all CVEs or are there any other currently reserved high rated CVEs?

best regards,
