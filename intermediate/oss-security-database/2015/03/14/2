Greetings,

Please assign a CVE ID for the following issue

Description:

MantisBT's permalink_page.php builds a permanent link to a configured 
filter. Using a crafted URL, an attacker can make this link execute 
arbitrary javascript code in the user's browser.

Affected versions:
- >= 1.1.0a4
- 1.3.0-beta.1

Fixed in versions:
- 1.2.19 (released 2015-01-25)
- 1.3.0-beta.2 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [1]

Credit:
This vulnerability was originally discovered by Paul Richards in May 
2014, with the first public report in [2] and also mentioned in [3], 
although a CVE was never requested for it.
It was recently reported a second time by Robert Foggia in [4], leading 
to the present CVE request.
The issue was fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer), as a 
side-effect of addressing CVE-2015-1042, see [5].
