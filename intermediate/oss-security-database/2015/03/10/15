This is what confused me into accepting the message for oss-security.
I found this website:

http://www.instantcms.ru/get

which says (in Russian) that InstantCMS is licensed under GNU GPLv2.

If the message was about a proprietary product (or a SaaS offering?),
then ideally we should have rejected it... but as discussed before, it's
unrealistic for list moderators to investigate these things thoroughly.
