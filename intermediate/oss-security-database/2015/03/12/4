If your SSL/TLS implementation accepts expired certs as being ok, then
you have a problem.

By stealing it? Certificate revocation doesn't work. Otherwise we
wouldn't have vendors shipping browser updates to invalidate known to be
compromised certificates, we'd be relying on CRL/OCSP and not hacks like
OCSP stapling.

That's a real world bug. Logic error "trust properly signed cert" vs.
"trust specific CA signed cert".

Uhm. Did you not look at any of the cve.mitre.org links I sent? These
are incredibly common failures. Hint: if some class of bug has a bunch
of CVE's you can multiply it by 100 or more for the number of affected
real world cases (and that's in English software alone).

Anyways I think we're sufficiently off topic now.
