Subject: CVE request: 2 issues in inspircd

Hi,

the Debian Security Team is requesting 2 CVEs for inspircd.

  * the fix that was included in Debian for CVE-2012-1836 is incomplete,
    and does not solve the original remote code execution problem. See:

      https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=780880#5

  * a DoS can be triggered by invalid DNS packets. See:

      https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=780880#5
      https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/commit/58c893e834ff20495d007709220881a3ff13f423
      
Cheers,

--Seb
