PEP 476 cites 11 CVEs that resulted from python not properly validating
certificates.   This would be number 12.

Shouldn't python versions prior to 2.7.9 and 3.4.3 have a CVE each for
the lack of verification? If internal corporate software stops working
because of invalid certificates, wasn't it broken anyway?
