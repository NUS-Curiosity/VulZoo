JPCERT has now provided me a copy of the attack. They have requested I
not reveal the details, so I am treating that and the patch details as
embargoed for the time being.

Without revealing too much (I hope) I can confirm:

* It is a known vulnerability
 - to upstream that is, but no CVE assigned.

* The initial report of this issue to upstream occured during 2009.

* Squid 1.x, 2.x, and 3.0 releases are all vulnerable.

* All Squid-3.1 stable releases are not vunerable.
 - eg, you can bump the fixed version number back to 3.1.1 for most OS
distributions.


For the record; there is now FALSE information floating around in some
CVE-2015-0881 "copies" about it being about CRLF issues. The Cisco
report came to my attention first, but they are not alone.

To all those people cut-n-pasting blurb text from CWE-113 in place of
the JPCERT description: please dont do that. There are multiple "HTTP
response splitting" attack vectors which have nothing to do with the
(current) CWE-113 description. This is one of those cases.
