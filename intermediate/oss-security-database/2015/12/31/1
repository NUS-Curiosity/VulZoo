[...]

Note that two of the bounds checks added in that commit are incorrect:

1. In conv_jistoeuc() the check uses > rather than <, which causes all
   conversions to return an empty string.  This is presumably not a
   security issue, but is a regression.

3. In conv_euctojis() the comparison is with outlen - 3, but each pass
   through the loop uses up to 5 bytes and the rest of the function may
   add another 4 bytes.  The comparison should presumably be 
   '<= outlen - 9' or equivalently '< outlen - 8'.

The first check is fixed by a later commit:
