    WebKit in Apple Safari before 6.2.8, 7.x before 7.1.8, and 8.x
    before 8.0.8, as used in iOS before 8.4.1 and other products, does
    not properly perform taint checking for CANVAS elements, which
    allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and obtain
    sensitive image data by leveraging a redirect to a data:image
    resource.

    The private-browsing implementation in WebKit in Apple Safari before
    6.2.8, 7.x before 7.1.8, and 8.x before 8.0.8 does not prevent
    caching of HTTP authentication credentials, which makes it easier
    for remote attackers to track users via a crafted web site.
