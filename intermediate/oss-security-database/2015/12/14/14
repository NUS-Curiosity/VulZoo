Subject: Re: Chef: knife bootstrap leaks validator privkey into system logs

Use CVE-2015-8559 for the originally described issue in 3871. The
"sudo command logging on most reasonable systems, in the system logs.
The logs may also be forwarded to other places (possibly in clear
text)" scenario, at least, seems relevant.

In general, an issue with unlogged private data on a command line
sometimes does not have a CVE ID, if the command line only occurs
during initial installation of a machine, before any unprivileged user
accounts would have access. (We don't know enough about the use cases
to determine whether that sometimes applies to chef.)

We aren't assigning a CVE ID for a "can't recall but I suspect this is
also a problem" report. If there is a second vulnerability disclosed by
lamont-granquist, then there should be a second CVE ID.

3872 was linked from 3871. If there is a race-condition vulnerability
disclosed in 3872, we may be able to assign a CVE ID. (We would not
want a CVE if the issue can occur only before unprivileged user
accounts would have access.)
