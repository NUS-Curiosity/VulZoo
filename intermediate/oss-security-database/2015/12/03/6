The patch was incomplete.  While it defended against the potential overrun
while reading PNG files, it did not detect a potential overrun by
applications using png_set_PLTE directly.  Libpng versions 1.6.20, 1.5.25,
1.4.18, 1.2.55, and 1.0.65 which were released today, December 3, 2015, fix
this remaining problem.

The PNG Development Group has not yet been made aware of any application
that is actually vulnerable to CVE-2015-8126. The original "crash" obtained
by fuzzing optipng had triggered an assert() that probably should have been
a warning; no out-of-bounds read occurs in optipng.
