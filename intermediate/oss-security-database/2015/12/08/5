Subject: CVE for git issue - please use CVE-2015-7545

With apologies, I can't find the original
http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/37 in my mailbox (3+ months old) but
we've now shipped advisories, had several people ask and not gotten a CVE
yet so here it is:

CVE-2015-7545 Git: Some protocols (like git-remote-ext) can execute
arbitrary code found in the URL

The other HTTP redirect/protocol issues don't seem to be security issues
per se (unexpected/annoying yes, but I can't think of any real security
impact).
