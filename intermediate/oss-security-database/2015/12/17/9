Subject: [oCERT 2015-011] PyAMF input sanitization errors (XXE)


#2015-011 PyAMF input sanitization errors (XXE)

Description:

PyAMF is a Python module that implements the Action Message Format (AMF)
protocol, allowing Flash interoperation with various web frameworks.

PyAMF suffers from insufficient AMF input payload sanitization which
results in the XML parser not preventing the processing of XML external
entities (XXE).

A specially crafted AMF payload, containing malicious references to XML
external entities, can be used to trigger Denial of Service (DoS)
conditions or arbitrarily return the contents of files that are accessible
with the running application privileges.

Affected version:

PyAMF <= 0.7.2

Fixed version:

PyAMF >= 0.8.0
