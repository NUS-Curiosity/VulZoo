As far as we can tell, the CVE request is primarily about the
vulnerability that affects versions 2.9.22 through 3.3. Use
CVE-2013-7441.

>> Versions released between 2.9.16 and 2.9.22 ... are vulnerable in the
>> sense that the bad design is still there, but I don't believe they
>> would crash in that manner.

If someone is interested in a CVE ID for those older versions
(released in 2010 and 2011), and the behavior is different (e.g., if
the unexpected client behavior doesn't immediately lead to a crash and
instead can cause memory corruption), please let us know.
