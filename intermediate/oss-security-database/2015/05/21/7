The Apache Jackrabbit community is pleased to announce the release of
Apache Jackrabbit 2.10.1. This release fixes an important security issue in
the jackrabbit-webdav module reported by Mikhail Egorov.

The release is available for download at:

  http://jackrabbit.apache.org/downloads.html

See the full release notes below for details about this release.

Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.10.1

Introduction
------------

This is Apache Jackrabbit(TM) 2.10.1, a fully compliant implementation 
of the
Content Repository for Java(TM) Technology API, version 2.0 (JCR 2.0) as
specified in the Java Specification Request 283 (JSR 283).

Apache Jackrabbit 2.10.1 is a patch release that contains fixes and
improvements over Jackrabbit 2.10. Jackrabbit 2.10.x releases are considered
stable and targeted for production use.

Security advisory (JCR-3883 / CVE-2015-1833)
--------------------------------------------

This release fixes an important security issue in the jackrabbit-webdav 
module
reported by Mikhail Egorov.

When processing a WebDAV request body containing XML, the XML parser can be
instructed to read content from network resources accessible to the host,
identified by URI schemes such as "http(s)" or  "file". Depending on the
WebDAV request, this can not only be used to trigger internal network
requests, but might also be used to insert said content into the request,
potentially exposing it to the attacker and others (for instance, by 
inserting
said content in a WebDAV property value using a PROPPATCH request). See also
IETF RFC 4918, Section 20.6.

Users of the jackrabbit-webdav module are advised to immediately update the
module to this release or disable WebDAV access to the repository. Users
on earlier versions of Jackrabbit who are unable to upgrade to 2.10.1 should
apply the fix to the corresponding 2.x branch or disable WebDAV access until
official releases of those earlier versions are available. Patches for 2.x
branches are attached to the JIRA issue.
