> t1disasm: buffer overflow in set_cs_start

As far as we can tell, versions before 1.39 had two different
instances of the unchecked "while (!isspace(*q) && *q != '{')" loop.
One of them, found by a researcher using afl-fuzz, was in the
set_cs_start function in t1disasm.c. The other, apparently found
manually by the vendor, was in the main function of t1asm.c. There are
similar situations in which there might have been two CVE IDs
assigned. Here, however, we feel that there should be only one CVE ID,
because it seems extremely unlikely that t1disasm.c and t1asm.c had
independent mistakes. Almost certainly, the mistake was made once and
then copied from one file into the other.

Use CVE-2015-3905.
