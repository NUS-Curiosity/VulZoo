This is part of u-boot source maintained externally but included
in qemu sources tarball.  It is not used directly even for building
qemu, used only by relevant maintainers when they update files in
pc-bios/ which are produced from this set of sources.  If the bug
is to be assigned, it should be filed against u-boot not qemu.

The same thing, it is ipxe source, not used by qemu in any way.

This one is real, used for -smb argument, to start smbd, making
its configuration.  Maybe tmpnam() should be used here.

This is solely for debugging by JIT maintainers.  Not useful for or
used by users.
