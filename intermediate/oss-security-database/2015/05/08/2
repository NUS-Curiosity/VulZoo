Advisory by Netsparker.
Name: DOM XSS Vulnerability in Twenty Fifteen WordPress Theme
Affected Software : WordPress
Affected Versions: 4.2.1 and probably below
Vendor Homepage : https://wordpress.org/ and

Vulnerability Type : DOM based Cross-site Scripting
Severity : Important
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-3429
Netsparker Advisory Reference : NS-15-007

Description
--------------------
By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can
hijack a logged in user’s session. This means that the malicious
hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the
session of the victim while the hacker maintains access. As seen from
the XSS example in this article, if a web application is vulnerable to
cross-site scripting and the administrator’s session is hijacked, the
malicious hacker exploiting the vulnerability will have full admin
privileges on that web application.
