Subject: Netty/Play's Security Updates (CVE­-2015­-2156)

During a recent assessment, we discovered a security flaw within Netty’s
cookie parsing code which leads to a universal HttpOnly bypass in Play
Framework and potentially other frameworks using Netty as a dependency.

The issue has been fixed in Netty 3.9.8.Final, 3.10.3.Final, Netty
4.1.0.Beta5, Netty 4.0.28.Final and Play Framework 2.3.9.

Technical details of the vulnerability:

Many other projects using Netty may be vulnerable to similar
"side­-effects" of the incorrect cookies parsing routine. We recommend that
every project relying on Netty’s CookieDecoder method should mitigate the
potential risk by upgrading to the latest version.

Cheers,
Luca
