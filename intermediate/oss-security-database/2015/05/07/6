There are currently 5 sets of advisories+patches at:

http://w1.fi/security/

These are numbered 2014-1, 2015-[1234].  Out of them, it appears that
only 2014-1 (CVE-2014-3686) and 2015-1 (CVE-2015-1863) have been on
oss-security so far:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/04/22/8

I haven't looked into this closely, but maybe Martin's request should
be for 2015-[234] rather than only for 2015-4.

And I'd like to see the full advisories posted in here so that they are
preserved in the list archives, unless there's a reason not to.  Jouni?
