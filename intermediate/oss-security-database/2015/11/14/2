It's a bit hard to judge from the description what this is about.

Am I right to assume that this is a fix for the XML encryption issues
Juraj Somorovsky found? He just presented that at BH Amsterdam
yesterday.
Every app that is using XML encryption in any way should be checked for
that.
(and the tl;dr is: don't decrypt unauthenticated data)
