 deserialisation flaw

I think a precedent has been set with the Groovy issue [1] that we'd issue a CVE for the libraries that allow us to execute code during deserialization of their classes.

[1] CVE-2015-3253 

As Gsunde points out, it would make it a lot easier for everyone to refer to this issue if it had a CVE.

Subject: Assign CVE for common-collections remote code execution on deserialisation flaw

Hello oss-esc,

It was found that a flaw in Apache commons-collections Java library allowed remote code execution when Deserialised with Java Object Serialization. Full details of the vulnerability can be found in this recent blog post, [1]. A proposed patch for 3.2.x branch has been submitted upstream, but no release has been made with the fix at the current time. The issue affects version 3.x, and 4.x of Apache common-collections, [2].
