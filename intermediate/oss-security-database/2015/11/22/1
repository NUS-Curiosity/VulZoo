Use CVE-2015-8316.

The scope of this CVE is only the LightDM behavior.
https://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/+bug/1516831/comments/6 says "for
some reason the X server was sending Request packets with a addresses
field empty. Other Ubuntu releases are not doing this." There may be
other ongoing research into mishandling of an empty field, especially
because the "attack" is now inadvertently occurring in the wild. If
there's a related vulnerability in another independent display manager
(or if this is somehow a vulnerability in the X server) a different
CVE ID would be needed.
