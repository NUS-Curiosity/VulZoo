Subject: CVE-2015-5257 - Weak Randomization of BridgeSecret for Apache Cordova Android

===================================================================
CVE-2015-5257: Weak Randomization of BridgeSecret for Apache Cordova Android

Severity: Low

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Cordova Android versions up to and including 3.6.4

Description:

Cordova uses a bridge that allows the Native Application to communicate
with the HTML and Javascript that control the user interface.  To protect
this bridge on Android, the
framework uses a BridgeSecret to protect it from third-party hijacking.
However, the BridgeSecret is not sufficiently random and can be determined
in certain scenarios.

Upgrade Path:
Developers who are concerned about this issue should rebuild their
applications with Cordova Android 4.1.1 or later.  Version 3.7.1 and later
do not contain this vulnerability.
