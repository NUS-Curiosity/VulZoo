 In what sense? CVE has accomplished it's primary mission, we have an
identifier for this vulnerability which makes discussing it easy (instead
of saying "that thing in that other thing, you know function foo(), no the
other version of that thing" we can just say "CVE-foo").

As for the CVE (Mitre/NVD) database being updated to contain an entry, we
wait. Although now that I'm on the CVE board I'm going to see what we can
do to speed things up/get better coverage/etc.
