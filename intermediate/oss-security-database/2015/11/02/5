Use CVE-2015-8041 for this integer overflow (with various possible
impacts). The vendor's report is listed under "security advisories" on
the http://w1.fi/security page, and it may be reasonable to interpret
"hostapd/wpa_supplicant should have (re)confirmed NDEF message
validity properly" to mean "hostapd/wpa_supplicant had a vulnerability
because they did not (re)confirm NDEF message validity properly." In
other words, although the issue is not exploitable with any known NFC
implementation, the hostapd/wpa_supplicant design goal was to operate
safely even if validation were missing in an NFC implementation.
