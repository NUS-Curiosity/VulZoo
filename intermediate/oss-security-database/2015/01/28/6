Dear Qualys team, dear list,

I have been made aware off line that I have been working with an edited
version of GHOST.c : the original version has a name buffer of size
1024, which is indeed perfectly fine to copy 991 + 1 byte !

There is no stack overflow in the original GHOST.c code : my humble
appology for the noise :(

Best regards,
