Use CVE-2015-1193 for the .. path traversal (CWE-22).

Use CVE-2015-1194 for the symlink following, which can allow access 
outside of the current directory.

CVE distinguishes symlink following from path traversal as different 
vulnerability types.  The fix for one issue is not necessarily guaranteed 
to fix the other.  Also, since symlink following attacks can often be used 
against protected files within a directory that is already accessible to 
the attacker, it might cause confusion to use the "directory traversal" 
term to describe them.
