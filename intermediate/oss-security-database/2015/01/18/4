> Description:
> Tushar Patil from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images

> thus may overrun the backend. Images in deleted state are not taken into
> account by quota and won't be effectively deleted until the upload is
> completed. Only Glance setups configured with user_storage_quota are
> affected.
