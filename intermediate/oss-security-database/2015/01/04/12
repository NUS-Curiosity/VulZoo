I have a question back on this assignment. Initially CORE-4630 did not
had a CVE reference in the title at leat afair, but some time ago the
reference to CVE-2014-9323 appeared.

We used then this reference in Debian to track the issue, but also
others have it:

https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=910653
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1172445
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9323
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9323

Should CVE-2014-9492 be rejected and CVE-2014-9323 to be still
continued to be used?

Regards,
Salvatore
