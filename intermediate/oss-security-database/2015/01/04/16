main part of this page:
 IMPORTANT: The variable length arbitrary digits will begin at four (4)
 fixed digits and expand with arbitrary digits only when needed in a
 calendar year, for example, CVE-YYYY-NNNN and if needed CVE-YYYY-NNNNN,
 CVE-YYYY-NNNNNNN, and so on. This also means there will be no changes
 needed to previously assigned CVE-IDs, which all include 4 digits.

The rule is:

- 4 digits until 9999
- 5 digits until 99999
- 6 digits until 999999
- 7 digits starting with 1000000

2014 CVEs can still get assigned by the rules, so they will slowly creep
up a bit still. But in general new issues will now get 2015 CVEs.
