Use CVE-2015-1352 for this issue in which a return value isn't
validated.

Because of an unusual process step on MITRE's end, there was also some
communication about these bugs that was only between MITRE and Joshua
Rogers, without a Cc to oss-security. For Bug #68740, the additional
discussion sent to us was (more or less) was that code in between
lines 140 and 167 wouldn't change g->setbits to a non-NULL value. This
is also essentially implied by the reasoning used in the Description
section of Bug #68740. (We didn't want to send the private e-mail
here, but Joshua Rogers is free to send it if he wants.)

MITRE doesn't have a full code analysis and isn't confident about
whether the "explicit null dereference" exists or not. All we can
offer is that the "wouldn't change g->setbits to a non-NULL value"
seems somewhat implausible because it means that significant intended
functionality of the code wouldn't have worked at all.

As an example, this sequence of function calls seems possible:

  p_str - ordinary - bothcases - p_bracket - allocset

where allocset contains:

  p->g->setbits = (uch *)malloc(nbytes);
  
and a memset (and the code before the line-140 "g->setbits = NULL"
includes a "p->g = g").

We're going to defer a CVE assignment for Bug #68740 until someone
outside MITRE offers additional analysis. It might be worthwhile to
update Bug #68740 so that the "explicit null dereference" term isn't
used. Although maybe a code path with a NULL pointer dereference can
be found, it's apparently not the case that g->setbits is explicitly
guaranteed to be NULL on line 1279.
