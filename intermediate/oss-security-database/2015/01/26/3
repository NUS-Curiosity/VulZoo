Subject: Reject CVE-2012-3878?

This was initially i assigned CVE-2012-3878, before it was determined
that it should not be treated as a vulnerability:

<http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2012/07/msg189909.html>

The CVE description has somehow leaked, but not the relationship with
the URL, making it non-obvious what this is about.
