Hi all,

As promised, I wrote down my lengthy thoughts in a blog post:

Regarding CVEs - I made similar experiences as Michal. It's very
mixed, sometimes I get CVEs quickly, sometimes I don't get answers to
requests.

I would like the CVE process to be a better tool to organize this (as
I've written in my blog post), but right now I feel it's not working
reliably enough for that. At some point I stopped caring too much about
CVEs because I felt waiting for them stops me from reporting more
issues.
