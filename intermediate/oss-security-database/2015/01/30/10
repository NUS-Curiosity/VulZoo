I reluctantly approved the above posting even though it contains no
indication this has anything to do with GHOST, and it bottom-quotes a
mostly irrelevant message (latest one from the thread).

linkbc02, if you have any reason to believe this is relevant to GHOST,
then please explain.  And if you have no such reason, then please also
state so, and we'll more confidently disregard this false alarm. ;-)
