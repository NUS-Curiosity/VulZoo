Subject: Fwd: ClamAV® blog: ClamAV 0.98.6 has been released!

Hi!

FYI:

ClamAV 0.98.6 release notes list several issues which looks like 
security fixes but only one CVE mentioned.

ChangeLog lists bugzilla numbers but the bugs are not yet public.

Relevant commit are not yet in github repo but the diff between 0.98.6 
branch and the released tarball is quite small and seems to contain 
almost only relevant fixes.
