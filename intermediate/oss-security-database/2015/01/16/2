Subject: jar(1) -- directory traversal

Hi!

jar(1) in Debian jessie (openjdk-7-jdk 7u71-2.5.3-2) is susceptible to a 
directory traversal vulnerability via absolute and relative paths. Other 
distros could also be interested in this issue.

Initial report:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774953

Not sure if this is just CVE-2005-1080 not fixed or something else. But
please note that CVE-2005-1080 talks about .. only.

Debian security team forwarded the report to Oracle Security Team at 
2015-01-12 11:01 +0100. Thanks!
