Subject: Re: CVE request: two issues in vorbis-tools

Hi,

Original poster of the reports here. My original concern was also that
these were minor issues, so I didn't request CVEs. I posted in FD list
because a month has passed and I still haven't received any answers in the
vorbis-tools bug tracker.
