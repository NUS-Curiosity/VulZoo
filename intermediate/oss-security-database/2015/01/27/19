> Vulnerability Id: (pending)
>
> Severity: Low
>
> Details
>  Socats signal handler implementations are not asnyc-signal-safe. When
>  a signal is triggered while the process is within a non
>  async-signal-safe function the signal handler will call a non
>  sync-signal-safe function too. POSIX specifies the behaviour in this
>  situation as undefined. Dependend on involved functions, libraries,
>  and operating system, the process can continue, freeze, or crash.
>  Mostly this issue occurs when socat is in listening mode with fork
>  option and a couple of child processes terminate at the same time.

> Testcase
>  none
