Thank you very much. We also sincerely regret that some information
about this vulnerability was leaked a few hours before the Coordinated
Release Date (Time, in this particular case).

Here is a list of potential targets that we investigated (they all call
gethostbyname, one way or another), but to the best of our knowledge,
the buffer overflow cannot be triggered in any of them:

apache, cups, dovecot, gnupg, isc-dhcp, lighttpd, mariadb/mysql,
nfs-utils, nginx, nodejs, openldap, openssh, postfix, proftpd,
pure-ftpd, rsyslog, samba, sendmail, sysklogd, syslog-ng, tcp_wrappers,
vsftpd, xinetd.

That being said, we believe it would be interesting if other people
could have a look, just in case we missed something.

With best regards,
