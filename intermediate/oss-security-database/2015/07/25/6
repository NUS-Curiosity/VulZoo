Although a supporter of full disclosure (it was the only way to get MS to 
fix their egregious bugs), I'd be really pissed off if I woke up one 
morning to find my system r00ted because some idiot got his jollies by 
announcing the exploit at the same time as the patch.

What would be a reasonable interval (for some definition of "reasonable") 
in that case?  24 hours?  48 hours?  0 hours?

I seem to recall that we had this discussion a few years ago...
