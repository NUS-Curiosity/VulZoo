Frankly, over the years I have seen pretty few people on the side of the
angels complain that "But *why* didn't you include a weaponized exploit
with your advisory? I feel so cheated!".

Have we seen anybody from Qualys offer comment? I may have missed that.

Really? Why? This list is about concepts and practices in open source
software security, among other things. Discussing how to do ethically
defensible disclosure seems to fit that bill.

Actually, I have something lined up:

Anyway, the reason that this *really* makes me angry is that I have
spent a long time on the defensive side, trying to keep the kids from
messing too much with kind-of-important scientific systems.

In these situations, where an exploit for a new local root vulnerability
turned up without prior warning, we typically started seeing root-level
incidents within 24 hours. Have you ever tried to get big organizations,
made up of a zillion independent entities, to apply security patches
within a timescale of hours?

The last time I dealt with one of those incidents, some kid thought it
was fun to use this shiny new exploit to wreck a compute cluster used
for designing new cancer drugs. Yeah, really.

What many people don't seem to realize is how much the availability of
ready-to-run exploits increases the risk to innocent bystanders.

Show your cleverness all you like; I'll applaud you. Qualys does a lot
of good stuff, they deserve to get a little marketing out of their work.
But hold off on the fscking exploits until the user base has had a
sporting chance to patch, yes?
