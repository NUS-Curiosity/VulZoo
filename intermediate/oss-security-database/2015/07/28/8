mancha pinged me on IRC while trying to figure out what kernel versions
are affected and I realized that I forgot to include an import detail in
my original email.

The following commit introduced the issue:

  commit 034faeb9ef390d58239e1dce748143f6b35a0d9b
  Date:   Wed Oct 30 11:15:24 2013 +0000
  
      KEYS: Fix keyring quota misaccounting on key replacement and unlink

Which means that v3.13 and newer kernels are affected:

  $ git describe --contains 034faeb9ef390d58239e1dce748143f6b35a0d9b
  v3.13-rc1~18^2~6^2~2
