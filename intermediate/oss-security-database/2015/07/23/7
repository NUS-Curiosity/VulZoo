Subject: Re: Re: CVE Request for OpenSSH vulnerability -
 authentication limits bypass

MITRE et al. -

I don't think I agree with your CVE-2015-5600 assignation analysis.

The change introduced by upstream's patch [1] is not to prevent a client
from supplying an arbitrary number of keyboard-interactive devices, per
se. What the fix does is prevent a given keyboard-interactive device
from getting queried more than once per userauth request.  

Unfortunately I don't have ready access to a server with multiple
keyboard-interactive device types but, unless I'm mistaken, if the
devices in the supplied client list all differ, the behavior is
unchanged pre and post patch:

-oKbdInteractiveDevices="snap,crackle,pop"

The difference in behavior can be observed when the list contains
repeats:

-oKbdInteractiveDevices="snap,snap,snap"

Pre-patch the above would query the snap device three times per userauth
request while post-patch only once.

So, your hypothetical of:

-oKbdInteractiveDevices="krb5,krb6,krb7,krb8,krb9,krb10,krb11"

would work the same before and after the fix. Each of the seven listed
devices would get queried once per userauth request. Assuming a default
maxauth of 6, that means a total of 42 device queries before the
connection gets severed.  

In practice, the flaw allows mounting a brute-force attack using fewer
connections. For example, if a server has MaxAuthTries=6, one can use:

-oKbdInteractiveDevices="pam,pam,pam"

to pack 18 password guesses (three per userauth request) in a single
connection instead of the intended limit of 6.

The fix prevents this circumvention of MaxAuthTries.

Please let me know if you don't agree.
