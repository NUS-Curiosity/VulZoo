> remote DoS via flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums

It appears that you are primarily asking for a CVE ID for the issue
involving the absence of a cond_resched call. Use CVE-2015-5364.

However, the presence of "return -EAGAIN" may also have been a
security problem in some realistic circumstances. For example, maybe
there's an attacker who can't transmit a flood with invalid checksums,
but can sometimes inject one packet with an invalid checksum. The
goal of this attacker isn't to cause a system hang; the goal is to
cause an EPOLLET epoll application to stop reading for an indefinitely
long period of time. This scenario can't also be covered by
CVE-2015-5364. Is it better to have no CVE ID at all, e.g., is
udp_recvmsg/udpv6_recvmsg simply not intended to defend against this
scenario?
