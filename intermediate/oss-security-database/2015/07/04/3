The scope of CVE isn't strictly limited to released upstream versions.
As mentioned at the bottom of the
http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/01/04/7 post, some
products sometimes have CVEs for this type of unreleased software,
whereas others do not. We feel that Foreman is probably in the latter
category.

http://theforeman.org/contribute.html and 10469 suggest that the
incorrect code was found only on the develop branch:
  
    - Master - latest stable release code
    - Develop - new features and bug fixes

    Master is frozen between major releases.

http://theforeman.org/introduction.html doesn't suggest that anyone
ships a product using code from the Foreman develop branch, but we
don't want to immediately rule out that possibility. This seems to be
a good choice for moving to the REJECT state, and we will most likely
do that next week unless there's an important reason to keep
CVE-2015-3199.
