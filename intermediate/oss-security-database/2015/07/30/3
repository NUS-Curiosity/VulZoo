I have just released xfsprogs v3.2.4 to address these issues. Please
see the release announcement here for details on where to find it:

PS: A comment on the CVE disclosure process: please ensure that the
upstream maintainer is informed of the CVE and the public disclosure
plan *before* disclosure occurs.  Apart from preventing co-ordinated
release of the fixes, failing to inform the maintainer of the
problem before public disclosure is impolite and disrespectful.
