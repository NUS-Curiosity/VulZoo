Subject: RE: Re: CVE request: XSS in MantisBT

According to github https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/cabacdc291c251bfde0dc2a2c945c02cef41bf40 - the fix referenced for CVE-2014-8986 has never been tagged to a 1.2.x release.

I've not yet done an announcement for this fix as it's not gone into a release.

It's listed as the fix @ http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8986, however, that changeset has never been tagged against 1.2.

A 5 seconds search through the MantisBT changesets tells me that it was CVE-2014-8986.
See https://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=17889.

Which, by the way, would have been even easier for you to find if you had actually bothered to follow the process and report the security issue in our tracker yourself instead of emailing me that PDF file of yours and making me do the legwork.

You know, this really sounds like paranoia... You know me, and should know better. I have never taken credit for somebody else's work. Credit was given, where it was due:

As far as I can tell, while related, these are indeed 2 distinct issues even though they are evidently related.

Quite frankly, I just can't be bothered to analyze whether my follow-up fix for CVE-2014-8986 reintroduced the issue or not.

Even if I did, the fact remains that 1.2.19 was released as it was, so we DO have two distinct issues here in any case.
