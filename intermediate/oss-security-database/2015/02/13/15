A 5 seconds search through the MantisBT changesets tells me that it was 
CVE-2014-8986.
See https://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=17889.

Which, by the way, would have been even easier for you to find if you 
had actually bothered to follow the process and report the security 
issue in our tracker yourself instead of emailing me that PDF file of 
yours and making me do the legwork.

You know, this really sounds like paranoia... You know me, and should 
know better. I have never taken credit for somebody else's work. Credit 
was given, where it was due:

As far as I can tell, while related, these are indeed 2 distinct issues 
even though they are evidently related.

Quite frankly, I just can't be bothered to analyze whether my follow-up 
fix for CVE-2014-8986 reintroduced the issue or not.

Even if I did, the fact remains that 1.2.19 was released as it was, so 
we DO have two distinct issues here in any case.
