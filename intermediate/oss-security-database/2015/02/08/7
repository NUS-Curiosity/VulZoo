This seems to be easily fixed by proper configuration (i.e. having
soap.wsdl_cache_dir set to a directory accessible only to the user
running PHP, or, on the shared host, having per-user config for each
user) but I'm not sure how to fix it in the generic case since that
directory wouldn't exist by default. On specific package - like RH - it
could create a separate directory - like /tmp/php-wsdl-cache - with web
server permissions and set the variable to use it - but since default
PHP install has no install scripts not sure yet how to improve it in a
generic way.
