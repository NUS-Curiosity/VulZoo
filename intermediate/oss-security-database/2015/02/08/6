CVE-2013-4578 OpenJDK: jarsigner does not detect unsigned bytecode
injected into signed jars

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1031471

Fixed upstream in OpenJDK:

http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u/jdk/rev/d5f36e1c927e

Also reportedly fixed in Oracle Java in CPU Jan 2014

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujan2014-1972949.html

But I don't see the CVE. Oracle can you confirm if this was fixed, and
which CVE it was given? Thanks.
