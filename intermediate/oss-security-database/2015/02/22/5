- From the "Contact Us page"
(<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/contact.html>)

  squid-bugs @ lists.squid-cache.org

... which goes to me and some other trusted developers. I dont mind
direct contacts for this type of thing, but the main contact address
guarantees someone sees it within a few hrs.


Regarding the CVE:

1) This is the first I've heard about this particular CVE number
assignment.

2) I did have some discusions with JPCERT about _a_ response splitting
vulnerability around those years. But the messages from them were IIRC
about replicating response splitting in a 2.x versions which were
incompletely fixed by:
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/bugs/#squid-2.5.STABLE7-header_parsing>
(did not get a CVE AFAIK).

3) I have not been able to replicate the #2 issue in the Squid-3
series and several iterations of changes to the parsers there have
been careful to take the above issue into account. So I'm not sure
where the 3.1.10 comes from. Assuming it is the same vulnerability.

I'm not sure 3.1.10 is the right version for attribution on any
response splitting fix. There certainly were no patches solving
anything related to respinse splitting in that version. Some
borderline memory leak vulnerabilities perhapse, but not response
splitting.


NP: Just to confuse things there was a major replacement of the HTTP
request-line parser on the 2015-02-10 which does explicitly fix all
lot of known HTTP request-line parse issues, including a few response
splitting vectors using downgrade to HTTP/0.9 handling. That will only
be in the 3.6 series though.
