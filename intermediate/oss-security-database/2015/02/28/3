Use CVE-2014-9687. Our interpretation is that this is a vendor CVE
request based on a vendor's perspective that ecryptfs-setup-private's
use of the default salt was never the intended behavior. (For example,
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/trunk/view/head:/doc/beginners_guide/ecryptfs_beginners_guide.tex
says "It is highly advised that you also provide a salt along with the
password, which will help make an attack against your files harder
than if you use the default salt.")
