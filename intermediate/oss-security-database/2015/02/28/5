Subject: Re: CVE Request: PuTTY fails to clear private key information from memory

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Use CVE-2015-2157.

This falls into a narrow set of situations in which a CVE ID can be
assigned even though the issue does not cross privilege boundaries.
The vendor is specifically announcing this as "This is a security
vulnerability." (Also, wiping private-key memory is a conventional
behavior seen in many products. It is not the same as wiping any
memory block that any researcher may feel is sensitive in some way.)

Because of the "this bug" wording, a single CVE ID is assigned.
However, in general, these two cases could be distinguished:

  - violating a user's reasonable expectations about what preemptive
    memory wiping should occur

  - providing a UI feature advertised as a way to tell a product to
    wipe a key from memory, accompanied by actual behavior in which no
    wiping occurs

with separate CVE IDs. In other words, there would be two CVE IDs if
there were two bugs (one for each case) fixed independently.
