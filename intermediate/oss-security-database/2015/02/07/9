Ghostscript right now has ~180 open unfixed bugs from fuzzing:
http://bugs.ghostscript.com/buglist.cgi?component=fuzzing&query_format=advanced&resolution=---

I believe most of them are related to this fuzzing effort from 2013:
http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=493
(I think Gynvael is on this list, maybe he can comment on the state)

gs already does invalid memory reads without any fuzzing at all. Just
compile it with asan and try to use the pdfwrite device.
