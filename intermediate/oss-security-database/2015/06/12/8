Subject: Fedora Atomic - downloads updates over HTTP (CVE-2015-3229)

So TL;DR: Uploads were downloaded over HTTP instead of HTTPS

Workaround for existing deployments: download the CHECKSUM via HTTPS and
confirm it, e.g.:

https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/22/Cloud_Atomic/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Cloud_Atomic-22-x86_64-CHECKSUM
