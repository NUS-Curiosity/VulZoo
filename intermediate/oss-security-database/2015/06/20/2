Subject: [CVE-2015-3188] Apache Storm remote code execution vulnerability

CVE-2015-3188: Apache Storm remote code execution vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Storm 0.10.0-beta

Description:
The UI daemon in Apache Storm 0.10.0-beta allows remote users to run 
arbitrary code as the user running the web server. With kerberos 
authentication this could allow impersonation of arbitrary users on other 
systems, including HDFS and HBase.

Mitigation:
0.10.0-beta users should upgrade to 0.10.0-beta1 or disable the Storm UI
daemon.

Apache Storm 0.10.0-beta1 artifacts are available for immediate download here:

Credit:
This issue was discovered by Bobby Evans of the Apache Storm PMC
