Subject: Re: CVE requests / Advisory: Codestyling Localization (Wordpress plugin) - multiple RCE via CSRF, multiple XSS

It appears that the main vulnerability you are reporting is the
multiple CSRF. Use CVE-2015-4179.

In reading your advisory, we weren't able to determine if there are
any realistic scenarios in which an authenticated user would
intentionally use csp_po_scan_source_file or csp_po_save_catalog_entry
for RCE (i.e., scenarios that do not involve CSRF) and thereby obtain
additional access to the server machine. We think you may mean
scenarios in which the authenticated user has the manage_options
capability but not the edit_plugins capability.

(As always, to obtain multiple CVE IDs for a report, it is useful to
describe all of the substantially distinct scenarios, not only the
scenarios in which risk is greatest.)

Also, we did not understand whether the "Multiple XSS in various AJAX
actions ... reflected unescaped POST parameters in certain AJAX
actions' responses" issue is independently relevant. Do you mean that
there is unescaped reflection regardless of whether the AJAX action is
authorized? More specifically, if all of the CSRF issues in the plugin
were fixed in a normal way, would unauthenticated attackers be able to
conduct XSS attacks by hosting JavaScript code that forces an
administrator's browser to make a POST request without a nonce?
