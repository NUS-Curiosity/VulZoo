Subject: Re: Possible CVE Request: Multiple stack overflows in squashfs-tools and sasquatch

> Yes, that is correct.

>>   - "int bytes" is incorrect because the return value of

Use CVE-2015-4645.


>>   - pull/5 says "If we fix this by making the variable size_t, we run
>>     into an unrelated problem in which the stack VLA allocation of
>>     fragment_table_index[] can easily exceed RLIMIT_STACK" but
>>     actually RLIMIT_STACK can be exceeded regardless of the data type
>>     of the bytes variable

Use CVE-2015-4646.
