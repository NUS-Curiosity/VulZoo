These two URLs:

  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3811
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2188

currently do not point to the same fix, and never have pointed to the
same fix. The first URL has existed since May, and the second has
existed since March.

>> Is there a reason two CVEs were assigned for this

The two CVEs were assigned to two different issues.

Our perspective is that multiple sources, including the upstream
vendor, currently have an error in which wnpa-sec-2015-14 refers to
bug number 10844, and that the intended bug number for
wnpa-sec-2015-14 (after that error is corrected) is 10978. We will
check with the upstream vendor and see whether they can confirm that
bug number 10978 actually does refer to a non-identical security
problem that was addressed months after 10844.
