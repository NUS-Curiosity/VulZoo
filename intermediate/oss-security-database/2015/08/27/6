The DESCRIPTION section of T106893 refers to a similar issue that
existed in other code until 2013. As far as we can tell, both issues
have security relevance for the same reason (although the first issue
was debated at the time). So, we think it will be best to use
CVE-2015-6727 for the issue fixed in the
https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki/commit/5faabfa1bbf65536ea36108887040198afcb3c82
commit, and CVE-2013-7444 for the issue fixed in the
https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki/commit/dc2966bd05b69321300c63fd0bd78e7c78ecea6e
commit.

Use CVE-2015-6728.

> <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T97391>

Based on the T97391 "Apr 28 2015, 5:58 PM" comment describing both
"Confirmed the rel404 issue" and "ForeignAPI images also have an xss"
vectors, it appears that the original John Menerick report was about
"unvalidated or sanitized parameters are pulled from the client's
request" and that the f parameter wasn't necessarily known to be
exploitable when that report was written. (Maybe this isn't accurate
because the "attached image" in the original report is apparently
unavailable.) In any case, use CVE-2015-6729 for the John Menerick XSS
report, and use CVE-2015-6730 for the internal XSS discoveries.

> <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T103761>

Use CVE-2015-6731 for the Grunny XSS report, and use CVE-2015-6732 for
the internal XSS discoveries.

There is currently no CVE ID for the "The Special:CreateForm post to
add the template doesn't check the csrf token, so it can be submitted
for a user via csrf" statement in the T103761 DESCRIPTION section. We
aren't sure about this, but we think that a CSRF token check there is
not thought to be required. If a CSRF token check there is thought to
be required, then another CVE ID can be assigned.

There are multiple options with which this topic could be covered in
CVE, e.g.,

  1. It is a single integration-policy error. In other words, the
     policy is that Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi may have an update
     at any time from the upstream GeSHi source code, but the contrib
     directory must be excluded. A person who did an update did not
     follow that policy.

  2. The problems with using the upstream contrib directory within
     MediaWiki need to be considered individually.

We're using option 2.

"Some scripts could be potentially be used for DoS" is not really
enough information, because distinct types of DoS can't always be
combined into one CVE ID. We think the only known DoS problem is
resource consumption from otherwise correct algorithms, as mentioned
at http://qbnz.com/highlighter/ with "GeSHi aims to do this all as
quickly as possible. Many customisable features of GeSHi facilitate
speed increases, and you can easily find a balance between the amount
of highlighting done and the speed in which it is done." Use
CVE-2015-6733 for this type of resource-consumption DoS, which has
security relevance within the MediaWiki product.

Use CVE-2015-6734 for the cssgen.php keywords-1 XSS. (Although not
directly related to CVE assignment, it's possible that that XSS hasn't
been reported upstream because it's not listed on the
https://github.com/GeSHi/geshi-1.0/commits/master/src/contrib/cssgen.php
page.)


> * Extension:TimedMediaHandler - User:McZusatz reported that resetting
> transcodes deleted the transcode without creating a new one, which could be
> used for vandalism or potentially DoS.
> <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T100211>

Use CVE-2015-6735.


> * Extension:Quiz - Internal review discovered that Quiz did not properly
> escape regex metacharacters in a user controlled regular expression,
> enabling a DoS vector.
> <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T97083>

Use CVE-2015-6736.


> * Extension:Widgets - MediaWiki developer Majr reported a potential HTML
> injection (xss) vector.
> <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T88964>

Use CVE-2015-6737. We think that the primary vulnerability is that the
approach to integrity protection is wrong, and that the HTML injection
is resultant from this. In any case, we think that only one CVE ID is
needed for T88964.
