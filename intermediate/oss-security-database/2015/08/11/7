Hi,

Any information available on why both Wireshark CVEs
CVE-2015-3811 CVE-2015-2188 point to one fix ?

Thanks

Hello,

It looks like the following two Wireshark advisories fix the same flaw:

https://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2015-14.html
https://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2015-07.html

Both fix a flaw in the WCP dissector and refer to the following bug:

https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10844

Is there a reason two CVEs were assigned for this, or should one of them
be rejected?

Thanks!
