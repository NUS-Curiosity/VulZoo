Subject: CVE Request: Glibc Pointer guarding weakness

Hello,

A weakness in the dynamic loader have been found, Glibc prior to 2.22.90 
are affected. The issue is that the LD_POINTER_GUARD in the environment 
is not sanitized allowing local attackers easily to bypass the pointer 
guarding protection on set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.


Details and PoC at:
http://hmarco.org/bugs/glibc_ptr_mangle_weakness.html


A patch is already sent to Glibc maintainers. This issue is similar to 
http://hmarco.org/bugs/CVE-2013-4788.html but now affect to dynamic 
linked applications.


Could you please assign a CVE ?
