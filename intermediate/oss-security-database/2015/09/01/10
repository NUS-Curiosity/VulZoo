 (CVE-2015-3280)

=============================================================
OSSA-2015-017: Nova may fail to delete images in resize state
=============================================================

:Date: September 01, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2015-3280


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Nova: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3, and
2015.1 versions through 2015.1.1


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD and Tushar Patil from NTT DATA, Inc
independently reported a vulnerability in Nova resize state. If an
authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it
will cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute
node it was running on. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of
service attack. All Nova setups are affected.
