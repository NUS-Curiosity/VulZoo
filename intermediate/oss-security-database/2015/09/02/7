Subject: CVE-2015-5239 Qemu: vnc infinite loop issue

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the VNC display driver is vulnerable to an infinite 
loop issue. It could occur while processing a CLIENT_CUT_TEXT message with 
specially crafted payload message.

A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on the 
host, resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:
