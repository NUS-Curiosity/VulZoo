This is mostly a question for the persons who assigned CVE-2015-1318
and CVE-2015-1862. Should these CVE assignments be interpreted to
mean:

  CVE-2015-1318 - in Apport, an unprivileged user can use a
                  namespace-based attack because there is an execve by
                  root after a chroot into a user-specified directory

  CVE-2015-1862 - in ABRT, an unprivileged user can use a
                  namespace-based attack because there is an execve by
                  root after a chroot into a user-specified directory

with "Furthermore, Abrt suffers from numerous race conditions and
symlink problems" not yet mapped to any CVE IDs? (CVE-2012-5660 is a
similar but older issue.) These additional ABRT issues would seem to
be, for example, independently relevant on a system where the kernel
was built without namespaces support. However, the raceabrt.c
attachment says "This is a race condition exploit for CVE-2015-1862."
