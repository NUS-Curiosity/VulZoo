This bug has been known since January, yes. To reduce the window of
vulnerability, we privately reported it to major distributions first,
aligning everyone on the same release date. Such synchronization takes
time. Given that the bug was not, to the best of our knowledge,
exploited in the wild, we believed that 3 months of embargo is not
exuberated. This is a common practice in the security industry, called
"responsible disclosure."

Following the kernel  security bugs policy [1], we reported it to 
the kernel security contacts few days before making the issue public.
Few days after issue became public, we published a clear report to all
of the relevant mailing lists.

Yes. Should be applied ASAP to all kernels that contain uverbs.
We put some effort to make sure the patch will apply cleanly on all
historical versions of the kernel, so backporting should be simple.
