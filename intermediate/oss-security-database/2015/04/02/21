I want to add that we would like to see users registering a very large memory region (perhaps the entire process address space) for local access, and then enabling remote access only to specific regions using memory windows. However, this isn't supported yet by our driver. Still, there are valid cases where you would still want the results of an mmap(0,...) call to be remotely accessible, in cases where there is enough trust between the local process and the remote process. It may help a middleware communication library register a large portion of the address space in advance, and still work with random pointers given to it by another application module.
