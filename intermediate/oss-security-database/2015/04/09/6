Upstream patches:

http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=a2bebfd6e09d
http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=2cdb5e142fb93

Please note that the first patch committed to QEMU project git is
slightly different than the initial submission as it includes fix
for a regression caused by the original patch.

Thanks,
