This change is in released kernels already, specifically all of the
following ones:
	4.14.326 4.19.295 5.4.257 5.10.197 5.15.133 6.1.55 6.3

Perhaps this advisory was written before those kernels were released?

v6.2 is long end-of-life, sorry.  But for all of the other versions you
quote above, it should now be resolved.
