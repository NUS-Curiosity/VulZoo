I did enquire about this, but the Linux maintainers and Microsoft were
distinctly unreceptive to the idea.  Not that I blame them - it's hard
enough to do late microcode loading, livepatching and activation of new
safety properties when the uarch isn't moving underfoot.

Yes, many things become racy under virt, hence why we try our best to
stick to architecturally enumerated properties.

Agner Fogh's manuals have a little more information, and importantly
give the upper bound which tops out at 47 cycles.

There is at least a 1 cycle change in latency between the byte and
non-byte forms, which I suspect is down to the non-byte forms needing to
consume an extra input register before starting.

But the main reason for choosing the byte form is indeed fewer moving
parts to worry about in the critical sections, where one wrong
instruction can render all protections moot.

You're welcome.
