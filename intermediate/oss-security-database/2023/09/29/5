CVE-2023-42119 https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1473/ 


The ZDI contacted us in June 2022. We asked about details but didn't get
answers we were able to work with.

Next contact with ZDI was in May 2023. Right after this contact we
created project bug tracker for 3 of the 6 issues. 2 high scored of them
are fixed (OOB access). A minor scored (info leak) is fixed too.

Fixes are available in a protected repository and are ready to be
applied by the distribution maintainers.

The remaining issues are debatable or miss information we need to fix
them.

We're more than happy to provide fixes for all issues as soon as we
receive detailed information.

    Best regards from Dresden/Germany
    Viele Grüße aus Dresden
    Heiko Schlittermann
