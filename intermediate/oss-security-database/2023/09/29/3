Subject: Multiple Exim4 Zero Days

I bring this up as I have not yet seen any information here about
several CVEs related to Exim Mailserver which were published by ZDI on
2023-09-27 [1]:

* CVE-2023-42114 [CVSS 3.7]
* CVE-2023-42115 [CVSS 9.8]
* CVE-2023-42116 [CVSS 8.1]
* CVE-2023-42117 [CVSS 8.1]
* CVE-2023-42118 [CVSS 7.5]
* CVE-2023-42119 [CVSS 3.1]

There also seem to be issues in Exim's bug tracker related to those:
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2999
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3000
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3001
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3002
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3003

According to ZDI the original reports were sent in June 2022.

I'm wondering if somebody knows anything about mitigations and/or why
there are still no fixes for these issues after more than a year.
