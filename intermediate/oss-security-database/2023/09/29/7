In Wuffs, every memory access is checked for safety at compile-time, and
that includes being in-bounds.  If the compiler cannot prove that every
access is safe, the code will not compile.  There are no bounds checks
at runtime.

Interfacing with hardware accelerators obviously will need unsafe code,
but my understanding is that most vulnerabilities are in various
parsers or in the code the accelerators replace, not in the code that
interfaces with the accelerators.
