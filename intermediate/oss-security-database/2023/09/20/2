Subject: ISC has disclosed two vulnerabilities in BIND 9 (CVE-2023-3341,
 CVE-2023-4236)

On 20 September 2023 we (Internet Systems Consortium) disclosed two vulnerabilities affecting our BIND 9 software:

- CVE-2023-3341:        A stack exhaustion flaw in control channel code may cause named to terminate unexpectedly https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-3341
- CVE-2023-4236:        named may terminate unexpectedly under high DNS-over-TLS query load https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-4236

New versions of BIND 9 are available from https://www.isc.org/downloads

Operators and package maintainers who prefer to apply patches selectively can find individual vulnerability-specific patches in the "patches" subdirectory of each published release directory:

- https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.16.44/patches/
- https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.18.19/patches/
- https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.19.17/patches/

With the public announcement of these vulnerabilities, the embargo period is ended and any updated software packages that have been prepared may be released.
