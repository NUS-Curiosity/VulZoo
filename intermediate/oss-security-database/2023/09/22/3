Oh, you're correct - this commit is _not_ in 1.3.2.

I was looking at the main branch and wrongly assumed that all I see in
there before:

commit ca332209cb5567c9b249c86788cb2dbf8847e760 (tag: v1.3.2, origin/1.3.2)

is in 1.3.2.  However, that commit tagged 1.3.2 got into main as part of
a merge commit, by which point main already had other commits including
95ea5226c870449522240ccff26f0b006037c520 that were not in 1.3.2 branch/tag.

So there may be 1 to 3 commits fixing more security issues after 1.3.2.

Thank you for correcting me!
