I did a (too) rough survey of the upstream repository and (too quickly)
concluded that it wouldn't help me with fixing these in Debian, so I
worked from Debian's fork. I should have made this more clear.

Still needed in git.

I'll be replacing the Debian-specific, broken fix of CVE-2017-11358 with
the one committed upstream. Thanks.

Indeed, I should have revisited the upstream tree. Upstream also fixes a
double free and I'll be replacing my patch with the upstream one.

The code is refactored, but I think the issue persists in wav_read_fmt
where wav->bitsPerSample isn't checked.

The hunk context changed and channels are now verified, but the size
validation is still missing. During further analysis I also found that
my patch is insufficient still.

If uc becomes 1, we assign it to v->size, later we pass 6 - v->size as
the second parameter to lsx_adpcm_init, which is used as an index into a
static array of 5 elements. We thus have an out-of-bounds read access
here. I don't yet know where exactly the check belongs as v->size == 1
may be valid in some contexts still.

Updated patch attached.

Thank you.

I think it would be good to have a maintained upstream repository of sox
eventually. It seems like multiple distributions are maintaining
diverging patch piles now.
