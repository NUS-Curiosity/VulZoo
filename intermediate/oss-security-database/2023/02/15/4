The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* Azure Credentials Plugin 254.v64da_8176c83a
* Email Extension Plugin 2.93.1
* JUnit Plugin 1166.1168.vd6b_8042a_06de
* Pipeline: Build Step Plugin 2.18.1
* Synopsys Coverity Plugin 3.0.3


Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and

SECURITY-3032 / CVE-2023-25761
JUnit Plugin 1166.va_436e268e972 and earlier does not escape test case
class names in JavaScript expressions.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control test case class names in the JUnit
resources processed by the plugin.


SECURITY-3019 / CVE-2023-25762
Pipeline: Build Step Plugin 2.18 and earlier does not escape job names in a
JavaScript expression used in the Pipeline Snippet Generator.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control job names.


SECURITY-2931 / CVE-2023-25763
Email Extension Plugin bundled multiple preconfigured templates for
notification emails. The Email Template Testing feature can be used to see
what these and other templates would look like based on a given build.

Email Extension Plugin 2.93 and earlier does not escape various fields
included in those email templates, like build display name, user display
name, and the names of tests.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control affected fields.


SECURITY-2934 / CVE-2023-25764
Email Extension Plugin allows defining custom email templates using Config
File Provider plugin as Jelly or Groovy files. The Email Template Testing
feature can be used to see what these templates would look like based on a
given build by specifying the `managed:` name prefix.

Email Extension Plugin 2.93 and earlier does not escape, sanitize, or
sandbox rendered email template output or log output generated during
template rendering.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to create or change custom email templates.


SECURITY-2939 / CVE-2023-25765
Email Extension Plugin allows defining custom email templates using Config
File Provider plugin as Jelly or Groovy files. When defined inside a
folder, email templates need to be subject to Script Security protection
(sandboxed execution or full-script approval).

In Email Extension Plugin 2.93 and earlier, templates defined inside a
folder were not subject to Script Security protection.

This vulnerability allows attackers able to define email templates in
folders to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the
context of the Jenkins controller JVM.


SECURITY-1757 / CVE-2023-25766
Azure Credentials Plugin 253.v887e0f9e898b and earlier does not perform
permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.


SECURITY-1756 / CVE-2023-25767 (CSRF) & CVE-2023-25768 (missing permission check)
Azure Credentials Plugin 253.v887e0f9e898b and earlier does not perform
permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified web server.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.


SECURITY-2793 (1) / CVE-2023-23850
Synopsys Coverity Plugin 3.0.2 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.


SECURITY-2793 (2) / CVE-2023-23847 (CSRF) & CVE-2023-23848 (missing permission check)
Synopsys Coverity Plugin 3.0.2 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting
in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
