SECURITY-3291 / CVE-2023-36478 & CVE-2023-44487
Jenkins bundles Winstone-Jetty, a wrapper around Jetty, to act as HTTP and
servlet server when started using `java -jar jenkins.war`. This is how
Jenkins is run when using any of the installers or packages, but not when
run using servlet containers such as Tomcat.

Jenkins 2.427 and earlier, LTS 2.414.2 and earlier bundles versions of
Jetty affected by the security vulnerabilities CVE-2023-36478 and
CVE-2023-44487. These vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated attackers to
cause a denial of service.

NOTE: This only affects instances that enable HTTP/2, typically using the
`--http2Port` argument to `java -jar jenkins.war` or corresponding options
in service configuration files. It is disabled by default in all native
installers and the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project.
