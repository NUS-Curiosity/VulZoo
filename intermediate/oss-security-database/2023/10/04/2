 x86/AMD: Divide speculative information leak

No intent?  It wouldn't be terribly hard, they could just RNG over the
register afterwards or run a 1/1 to nullify any data left therein.  The
latter would require control lines to be in place, the latter would just
mean extending the microcode instruction.  That said I could understand the
want to depricate zen1 support entirely, everyone upgraded when they could
it was super super cheap to do so & there weren't really any enterprise
users.
