            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2023-34326 / XSA-442
                               version 2

                  x86/AMD: missing IOMMU TLB flushing

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The caching invalidation guidelines from the AMD-Vi specification (48882—Rev
3.07-PUB—Oct 2022) is incorrect on some hardware, as devices will malfunction
(see stale DMA mappings) if some fields of the DTE are updated but the IOMMU
TLB is not flushed.

Such stale DMA mappings can point to memory ranges not owned by the guest, thus
allowing access to unindented memory regions.

IMPACT
======

Privilege escalation, Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host,
and information leaks.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions supporting PCI passthrough are affected.

Only x86 AMD systems with IOMMU hardware are vulnerable.

Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can
leverage the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Not passing through physical devices to guests will avoid the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Roger Pau Monné of XenServer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
