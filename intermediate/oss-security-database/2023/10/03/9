I concur.  I'd appreciate security advisories from the KVM project.

I strongly oppose removal of a port/support for a certain architecture
just because some implementations of it are/were problematic.  Adding a
warning is fine.

P.S. Demi Marie, please note that oss-security list content guidelines
explicitly discourage CC'ing other lists(*), and Xen advisories are
already stretching this.  In this reply, I am still CC'ing many of what
you had CC'ed as I am following up on your specific points relevant to
those lists, but in general let's be more careful about this.

(*) Because we may then get off-topic follow-ups from there, especially
if CC'ing project user lists or high-volume lists like LKML.  In this
specific case, we're lucky so far.
