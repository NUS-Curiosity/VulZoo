Subject: Re: Exim4 MTA CVEs assigned from ZDI

Dear Exim users,

thank you for your patience.  The following tries to provide an abstract
about the topics that arose during the recent hours.

Summary
-------
Six 0day exploits were filed against Exim.

None of these issues is related to transport security (TLS) being
on or off.

* 3 of them are related to SPA/NTLM, and EXTERNAL auth. If you do not use
  SPA/NTLM, or EXTERNAL authentication, you're not affected.
  These issues are fixed.

* One issue is related to data received from a proxy-protocol proxy. If
  you do not use a proxy in front of Exim, you're not affected. If your
  proxy is trustworthy, you're not affected. We're working on a fix.

* One is related to libspf2. If you do not use the `spf` lookup type
  or the `spf` ACL condition, you are not affected.

* The last one is related to DNS lookups. If you use a trustworthy
  resolver (which does validation of the data it receives), you're
  not affected. We're working on a fix.

Schedule
--------
Currently we're in contact with the major distros and aim to release
those fixes that are available as soon as possible. (Aiming Monday, Oct
2nd.) The below mentioned commits are currently available in a
protected repo to a restricted set of users only.
