Subject: CVE-2023-36461: mastodon: Denial of Service through slow HTTP
 responses

(I have no affiliation with the project, but posting
this here because it seems to me that increasingly
non-packaged / GitHub distributed projects tend not to
send out announcements here.)

https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-9pxv-6qvf-pjwc

(This advisory describes an issue found by Cure53 as
part of an audit performed at Mozilla's request)

When performing outgoing HTTP queries, Mastodon sets a
timeout on individual read operations, but a malicious
server can indefinitely extend the duration of the
response through slowloris-type attacks.

Impact
This vulnerability can be used to keep all Mastodon
workers busy for an extended duration of time, leading
to the server becoming unresponsive.
