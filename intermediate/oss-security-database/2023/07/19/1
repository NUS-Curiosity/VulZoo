Subject: curl: fopen race condition: CVE-2023-32001

fopen race condition
====================

Project curl Security Advisory, July 19 2023 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-32001.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl can be told to save cookie, HSTS and/or alt-svc data to files. When
doing this, it called `stat()` followed by `fopen()` in a way that made it
vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition problem.

By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could trick the victim to create or
overwrite protected files holding this data in ways it was not intended to.

INFO
----

The attacker needs permissions and rights enough to be able to create or
rename directory entries in the directory the victim saves their files.

This race condition modifies the behavior of symbolic link files in affected
components, they might be followed instead of being overwritten when the
condition is met leading to undesired and potentially destructive behavior.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2023-32001 to this issue.

CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: libcurl 7.84.0 to and including 8.1.2
- Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.84.0 and >= 8.2.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/20f9dd6bae50b722

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

SOLUTION
------------

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0c667188e0c6cda615a0

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

  A - Upgrade curl to version 8.2.0

  B - Apply the patch to your local version

  C - Do not save cookie, HSTS or alt-svc data

TIMELINE
--------

This issue was reported to the curl project on June 27, 2023. We contacted
distros@...nwall on July 12, 2023.
