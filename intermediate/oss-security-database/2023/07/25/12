Yes, very disappointing. Pure speculation; perhaps they were planning on
disclosing at the end of the year with full set of Microcode ready but
something we don't know (yet) forced them to disclose early. Who knows.

Very unscientific and limited test but I just compiled qemu 7.2.4 on a
gentoo workstation with a Ryzen 7 3700X (Zen 2) running linux kernel
5.15.119. Took 5 min 37s. Rebooted into 5.15.122 with the chicken bit fix
(confirmed in dmesg appears to be applied), compiled qemu again, this time
it took 5 min 25s. So my initial impression is the chicken bit fix is fine
in general but remains to be seen if certain workloads significantly
impacted I guess.
