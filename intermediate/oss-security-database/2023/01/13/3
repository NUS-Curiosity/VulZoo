Subject: CVE-2023-22602: Apache Shiro before 1.11.0, when used with Spring
 Boot 2.6+, may allow authentication bypass through a specially crafted
 HTTP request 

Description:

When using Apache Shiro before 1.11.0 together with Spring Boot 2.6+, a specially crafted HTTP request may cause an authentication bypass.

The authentication bypass occurs when Shiro and Spring Boot are using different pattern-matching techniques. Both Shiro and Spring Boot < 2.6 default to Ant style pattern matching.
Mitigation: Update to Apache Shiro 1.11.0, or set the following Spring Boot configuration value:  `spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy = ant_path_matcher`
