CVE-2022-45143 Apache Tomcat - JsonErrorReportValve injection

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.1
Apache Tomcat 9.0.40 to 9.0.68
Apache Tomcat 8.5.83

Description:
The JsonErrorReportValve did not escape the type, message or description 
values. In some circumstances these are constructed from user provided 
data and it was therefore possible for users to supply values that 
invalidated or manipulated the JSON output.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following
mitigations:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 10.1.2 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.69 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.84 or later
