 security@...g vs. linux-distros@

Hi, Alexander and all,

I was more or less waiting for a public discussion to start on oss-security or somewhere else, because I'd like to express how important the announcements of Linux kernel issues via linux-distros is to us.

We operate the IT infrastructure of a scientific research institute (456 users, 144 Linux servers, 98 Linux workstations, about 6 PB used storage). We are not using any distro, everything is build locally and we maintain the systems by continuous rolling upgrades. 

All systems from workstations to cluster servers run the same (set of) kernels and identical userspace. The setting is rather unusual these days, all shared storage including homes is on software raid and available to the other systems via automounted nfs. We have a few public servers and a rather big computer cluster with a job scheduler. Everything is multi-user. We need to maintain separation between users and to defend the systems against attacks from the (possible abused) unprivileged user accounts. 

Our scientist run software on cluster-servers which often take many, many days to complete because of the size of the input data. Other might, for example, experiment with Jupyter Notebooks and have a lot of in-memory state. We have long running remote login sessions round the clock. For efficiency, most things run natively on hardware and not in virtual machines. System reboots have a lot of negative impact for our users.

Even nowadays not everything is single-user or microservices. "All users of the X:X kernel series must upgrade" or "just run mainline" is not a helpful strategy for us, because there is the operational issue of booting into a new kernel. Also, because we have a rather unusual settings, it is not unusual that we run into bugs others haven't discovered before. That's why we rather test new releases and roll them out slowly. That may be a corner case, but these corner cases exist, too.

We heavily rely on the information about kernel security issues published to linux-distros, which we, of course, can only receive via oss-security after the embargo. We analyze each and every new topic on oss-security to decide, whether it is relevant to us and what we can do about it. Nearly all of the userspace issues are of no relevance to us, but many of the kernel issues are, if we happen to run affected kernel versions. 

We go a long way to avoid rebooting. This might be as easy as disabling unused dynamic modules by just removing the .ko files from userspace, but sometimes we even convert an upstream fix into a loadable module which uses ftrace to replace or wrap the buggy functions in the running systems. A "reboot party" would only be a measure of last resort. 

oss-security gives us the notifications and enough information or references so that we can deal with the problems. We can not just follow mainline (or a stable series) and analyze every patch ourself to identify, whether a security bug was silently fixed. We can not boot into a new kernel every few days, just in case.

Exploits are sometimes helpful, too, for example to quickly identify whether we run affected versions, which sometimes isn't that trivial to find out otherwise, or to verify that our mitigations are working as intended. 

I would very much appreciate if a policy could be found with the kernel community that encourages to send information to linux-distros. If that requires that the rather strict procedures and deadlines of linux-distros are relaxed, I hope there is room for compromise.

Best

  Donald
