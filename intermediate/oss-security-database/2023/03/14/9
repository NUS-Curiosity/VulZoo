You have chosen not to update to latest possible git(?).

Now, latest git removed support for built-in GSM, and i am too
lazy and angry (do not get me started on Microsoft and OAuth for
a normal "app" that is to read mail, they now no longer accept
simple token refresh but with re-authenticating a 1024 or so bit
password after 3600 seconds, and then fail to accept SMTP even
though it is included, POP3 is not there anyway even though
announced, but IMAP is right -- is anybody here??  But that is
off-topic; just like my single-line graylister fix to support
verbose logs in non-development code, sic) to check it.

_But_ .. "default" is mysterious, there is WAVE_FORMAT_GSM610
right above, and it is optional in latest git, which does not even
support the "default:" label.
How can you reach "default:", thus?
