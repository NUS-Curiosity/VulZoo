Subject: CVE-2023-46857 - Weak SVG asset filtering mechanism in Squidex leads
 to XSS

Hello all,

Squidex, a "headless" open source CMS framework was found to have a 
stored XSS vulnerability in the "Upload Assets" functionality due to 
insufficient SVG element filtering. The vulnerability affects all 
versions of the framework prior to 7.9.0.

CVE-2023-46857 was assigned to this vulnerability by MITRE.

The vulnerability affects authenticated users of the Squidex CMS Web 
application and allows for malicious JavaScript to be executed within 
victim user browsers. Moreover, the vulnerability enables an attacker to 
collect the CMS authentication token from browser local storage and it 
is therefore possible for the attacker to gain unauthorized access to a 
victim user's session.
