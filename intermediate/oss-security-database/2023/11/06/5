Hello all,

The Rust project was in contact with the libgit2 maintainers to coordinate the 
two disclosures (that's why we mentioned it in the distros email), but some 
miscommunication happened and the libgit2 side of the advisory didn't end up 
being posted here by its maintainers.

libgit2's advisory is available here, and has CVE-2023-22742 assigned to it:

https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-8643-3wh5-rmjq

The libgit2 advisory and fix ended up being published later, on January 20th.
