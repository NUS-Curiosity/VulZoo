Subject: CVE-2023-29215: Apache Linkis JDBC EngineCon  has a
 deserialization command execution 

Severity: important

Description:

In Apache Linkis <=1.3.1, due to the lack of effective filtering
of parameters, an attacker configuring malicious Mysql JDBC parameters in JDBC EengineConn Module will trigger a
deserialization vulnerability and eventually lead to remote code execution. Therefore, the parameters in the Mysql JDBC URL should be blacklisted. Versions of Apache Linkis <= 1.3.0 will be affected.
We recommend users upgrade the version of Linkis to version 1.3.2.
