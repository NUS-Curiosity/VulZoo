BTW, even with the kernel bug fixed, there are ioctl number clashes
between different devices, so even e.g. isatty(3) is not necessarily
safe if called with elevated privileges under a possible confused deputy
scenario.  Here's strace showing some clashes on older Linux/i386:

$ cat isatty.c
int main(void) { return isatty(0); }
$ gcc isatty.c -o isatty
$ strace -e ioctl ./isatty
ioctl(0, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_NEXT_DEVICE or TCGETS, {B38400 opost isig icanon echo ...}) = 0

IIRC, I was the one to add this feature to strace 20+ years ago:

* Sat Jun 08 2002 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com>
- Updated to today's CVS version (post-4.4) with an additional fix for
displaying all possible ioctl names when there's more than one match,

So the number clashes were known, but the security relevance maybe not.
