That's good to know. I was wondering if there were distros that did not
have setuid binaries, which was why I said only ``a number of distros''
were vulnerable.

I just noticed that sudo added the isatty check a day ago (April 17th)
[1]. I think this change was inspired by this vulnerability, wasn't it?
However, as Jakub Wilk pointed out, isatty is still implemented by an
ioctl call, so the addition of this check has nothing to do with this
vulnerability. Nevertheless, it is still a good idea to make sure isatty
succeeds before using ioctl calls with other (perhaps more complex and
arbitrary) tty commands.
