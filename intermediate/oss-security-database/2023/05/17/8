The "original writeup" you reference says this is CVE-2023-2156.

Thank you for bringing this to oss-security.

I'd appreciate it if you and/or others also post plain text extracts of
such content, not only the links.  Anyone willing to do it this time?

Also, this list isn't only about Linux, so when posting about
Linux-specific issues let's state so in the Subject line.  In this case,
the issue is in Linux kernel and it affects systems with enabled sysctl
net.ipv6.conf.*.rpl_seg_enabled for at least some interface(s).
