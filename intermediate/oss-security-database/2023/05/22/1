 incomplete

CVE-2023-28709 Apache Tomcat - Fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M2 to 11.0.0-M4
Apache Tomcat 10.1.5 to 10.1.7
Apache Tomcat 9.0.71 to 9.0.73
Apache Tomcat 8.5.85 to 8.5.87

Description:
The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete. If non-default HTTP connector 
settings were used such that the maxParameterCount could be reached 
using query string parameters and a request was submitted that supplied 
exactly maxParameterCount parameters in the query string, the limit for 
uploaded request parts could be bypassed with the potential for a denial 
of service to occur.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following
mitigations:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M5 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 10.1.8 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.74 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.88 or later
