Subject: CVE-2020-25723 QEMU: assertion failure through
 usb_packet_unmap() in hw/usb/hcd-ehci.c

Hello,

A flaw was found in the USB EHCI controller emulation of QEMU. It
could occur while processing USB requests due to DMA memory map
failure not being properly detected. This was fixed in the following
commit by checking the return value of usb_packet_map(), thus
preventing a reachable assertion issue from occuring in a later call
of usb_packet_unmap().

Upstream commit:
https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=2fdb42d840400d58f2e706ecca82c142b97bcbd6

This issue was reported by Cheolwoo Myung (cc'd).
CVE-2020-25723 was assigned by Red Hat Inc.

Best regards.
