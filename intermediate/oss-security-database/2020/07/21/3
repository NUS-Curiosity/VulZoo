Subject: CVE-2020-15859 QEMU: net: e1000e: use-after-free while sending
 packets

   Hello,

A use-after-free issue was found in the INTEL 82574 NIC (e1000e) emulator of 
the QEMU. It could occur while sending packets if the guest user set the 
packet data address to e1000e's MMIO address. A guest user/process could use 
this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.
