CVE-2020-13753
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK before 2.28.3 and WPE WebKit before 2.28.3
    Credit to Milan Crha at Red Hat.
    The bubblewrap sandbox of WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit, prior to 2.28.3,
    failed to properly block access to CLONE_NEWUSER and the TIOCSTI
    ioctl. CLONE_NEWUSER could potentially be used to confuse xdg-
    desktop-portal, which allows access outside the sandbox. TIOCSTI can
    be used to directly execute commands outside the sandbox by writing
    to the controlling terminal's input buffer, similar to
    CVE-2017-5226.


We recommend updating to the latest stable versions of WebKitGTK and WPE
WebKit. It is the best way to ensure that you are running safe versions
of WebKit. Please check our websites for information about the latest
stable releases.
