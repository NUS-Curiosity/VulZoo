 of RDP static virtual channels

CVE-2020-9497: Improper input validation of RDP static virtual channels

Versions affected:
Apache Guacamole 1.1.0 and earlier

Description:
Apache Guacamole 1.1.0 and older do not properly validate data
received from RDP servers via static virtual channels. If a user
connects to a malicious or compromised RDP server, specially-crafted
PDUs could result in disclosure of information within the memory of
the guacd process handling the connection.

Mitigation:
Users of versions of Apache Guacamole 1.1.0 and older that provide
access to untrusted RDP servers should upgrade to 1.2.0.

We would like to thank the GitHub Security Lab and Eyal Itkin (Check
Point Research) for reporting this issue.
