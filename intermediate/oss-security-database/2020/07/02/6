In the curl project we (nowadays) request and get CVE IDs from Hackerone, and 
we've subsequently told them to publish these two recent curl related CVE IDs 
when we made them public to the world - I suspect this is just them being a 
little slow. We don't have any direct contact with MITRE.

All details regarding the two recent curl flaws are here:

  https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2020-8169.html
  https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2020-8177.html
