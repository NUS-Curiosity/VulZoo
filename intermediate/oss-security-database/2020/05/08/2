Subject: Linux kernel: two buffer overflow in the marvell wifi driver

Hi,
There are two buffer overflows in marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel
which cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code.

Description
==========
[1]CVE-2020-12653：The mwifiex_cmd_append_vsie_tlv() in
drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/scan.c calls memcpy() without checking
the destination size may trigger a buffer overflower, which a local user
could use to cause denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

[2]CVE-2020-12654：mwifiex_ret_wmm_get_status() in
drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/wmm.c calls memcpy() without checking
the destination size.Since the source is given from remote AP which
contains illegal wmm elements , this may trigger a heap buffer overflow.
