Subject: CVE-2020-13253 QEMU: sd: OOB access could crash the guest resulting
 in DoS

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds read access issue was found in the SD Memory Card emulator of 
the QEMU. It occurs while performing block write commands via sdhci_write(), 
if a guest user has sent 'address' which is OOB of 's->wp_groups'. A guest 
user/process may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS.
