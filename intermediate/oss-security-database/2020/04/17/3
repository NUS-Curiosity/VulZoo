Subject: 回复：CVE-2020-10708 kernel: race condition in kernel/audit.c may allow low privilege users trigger kernel panic


Hey, it's public now. Please visit: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1822593

I'm not sure whether it exists on the mainline kernel. Maybe I'll do some research sometime.

Thanks.

When the system is configured to panic on events being dropped, an attacker who is able to trigger an audit event that starts while auditd is in the process of starting may be able to cause the system to panic by exploiting a race condition in audit event handling. This creates a denial of service by causing a panic."

That bug link seems to be restricted at the moment :(

Any hint on if this is still an issue on the "mainline" kernel.org
releases or not given that 3.10 is a bit old?

thanks,
