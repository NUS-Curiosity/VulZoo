Subject: [CVE-2020-9488] Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch
 in Apache Log4j SMTP appender

Summary: Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in
Log4j2 SMTP appender. This could allow an SMTPS connection to be
intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log
messages sent through that appender.

Mitigation: Users should upgrade to Apache Log4j 2.13.2 which fixed
this issue in LOG4J2-2819 by making SSL settings configurable for
SMTPS mail sessions. As a workaround for previous releases, users can
set the `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` system property to `true`
to enable SMTPS hostname verification for all SMTPS mail sessions.
