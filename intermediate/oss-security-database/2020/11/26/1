            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-28368 / XSA-351
                              version 2

                 Information leak via power sidechannel

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers have demonstrated using software power/energy monitoring
interfaces to create covert channels, and infer the operations/data used
by other contexts within the system.

Access to these interfaces should be restricted to privileged software,
but it was found that Xen doesn't restrict access suitably, and the
interfaces are accessible to all guests.

For more information, see:
  https://platypusattack.com
  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00389.html

IMPACT
======

An unprivileged guest administrator can sample platform power/energy
data.  This may be used to infer the operations/data used by other
contexts within the system.

The research demonstrates using this sidechannel to leak the AES keys
used elsewhere in the system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Power/energy monitoring interfaces are platform and architecture
specific.  Consult your hardware vendor to ascertain what power feedback
interfaces are available.

For ARM systems, all versions of Xen are vulnerable.  The fix restricts
access to the AMU (Activity Monitors Unit) interface, introduced in
Armv8.4.

For x86 systems, Xen 4.14 and earlier are vulnerable - master is not
vulnerable, as these issues have been addressed in a more general
fashion.

The x86 fixes restrict access to:
 * Intel RAPL interface, introduced in SandyBridge CPUs.
 * Intel platform energy interface.
 * Intel perf_ctl interface, introduced in Pentium 4 CPUs and also
   implemented by other vendors.
 * AMD RAPL interface, introduced in Ryzen/EPYC CPUs.
 * AMD compute unit energy interface, present in Fam15/16 CPUs.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations available.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.
