Subject: CVE-2020-25637 libvirt: double free in
 qemuAgentGetInterfaces() in qemu_agent.c

Hello,

A double free memory issue was found to occur in the libvirt API
responsible for requesting information about network interfaces of a
running QEMU domain. This flaw affects the polkit access control
driver. Specifically, clients connecting to the read-write socket with
limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the libvirt
daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate
their privileges on the system.

CVE-2020-25637 has been assigned for this flaw.

Fixed in libvirt v6.8.0 (2020-10-01).
