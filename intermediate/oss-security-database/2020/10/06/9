Git can do the sorting for you with --sort.

And if you have other tags in your repo that can confuse things, so
specifying that you want "v*" tags avoids that.

eg:

$ git tag -l "v*" --sort=v:refname --contains 1bdc76aea115 | head -n 10
v4.8
v4.8-rc1
v4.8-rc2
v4.8-rc3
v4.8-rc4
v4.8-rc5
v4.8-rc6
v4.8-rc7
v4.8-rc8
v4.9

Obviously for ease of use you want that in an alias or script.

cheers
