Subject: CVE-2020-14355 spice: multiple buffer overflow
 vulnerabilities in QUIC decoding code

Hello,

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in the QUIC image
decoding process of the SPICE remote display system. More
specifically, these flaws reside in the spice-common shared code
between the client and server of SPICE. In other words, both the
client (spice-gtk) and server are affected by these flaws. A malicious
client or server could send specially crafted messages which could
result in a process crash or potential code execution scenario.

CVE-2020-14355 has been assigned for this flaw by Red Hat Inc.
