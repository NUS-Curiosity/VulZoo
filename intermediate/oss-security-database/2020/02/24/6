I would like a bit of clarification. We use OpenSMTPD as a dumb thing
that only relays mail to a central server and never delivers it
locally. The remote server is under our control.

=============
table credentials { smarthost.example.com=myuser:mypassword }

listen on 127.0.0.1

# No local mailboxes
action to_postfix relay host
smtp+tls://smarthost.example.com@...rthost.example.com auth
<credentials> helo myhostname.example.com
match from local for any action to_postfix
=============

Is the hole exploitable in this configuration?
