Subject: CVE-2020-10769 kernel: Buffer over-read in
 crypto_authenc_extractkeys() when a payload longer than 4 bytes is not aligned.

Hello Team,

Red Hats kernel has a flaw in Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
(AEAD), a form of encryption technique which
simultaneously assures the confidentiality and authenticity of data with
below details.

A buffer over-read flaw was found in crypto_authenc_extractkeys in
crypto/authenc.c  in  the IPsec Cryptographic  algorithmâ€™s
module, authenc. When a payload is longer than 4 bytes, and is not
following 4-byte alignment boundary guidelines, it causes
a buffer over-read threat, leading to a system crash. This flaw allows a
local attacker with  user  privileges  to  cause a  denial
of service.

'CVE-2020-10769' was assigned by Red Hat Inc.
