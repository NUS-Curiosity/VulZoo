Subject: Django security releases issued: 3.0.7, and 2.2.13 for CVE-2020-13254
 & CVE-2020-13596.

https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2020/jun/03/security-releases/ <https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2020/jun/03/security-releases/>

In accordance with `our security release policy <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/>`_, the Django team is issuing `Django 3.0.7 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/3.0.7/>`_ and `Django 2.2.13 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.2.13/>`_. These releases address the security issue detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.

CVE-2020-13254: Potential data leakage via malformed memcached keys
===================================================================

In cases where a memcached backend does not perform key validation, passing
malformed cache keys could result in a key collision, and potential data
leakage. In order to avoid this vulnerability, key validation is added to the
memcached cache backends.

Thank you to Dan Palmer for the report and patch.

CVE-2020-13596: Possible XSS via admin ``ForeignKeyRawIdWidget``
================================================================

Query parameters for the admin ``ForeignKeyRawIdWidget`` were not properly URL
encoded, posing an XSS attack vector. ``ForeignKeyRawIdWidget`` now
ensures query parameters are correctly URL encoded.

Thank you to Jon Dufresne for the report and patch.

Affected supported versions
===========================

* Django master branch
* Django 3.1 (currently at alpha status)
