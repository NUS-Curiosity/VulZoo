Subject: CVE-2020-13881: pam_tacplus 1.3.8 through 1.5.1, the TACACS+ shared
 secret gets logged via syslog if configured with debug parameter

References: CVE-2020-13881, pam_tacplus#149

TACACS+ shared secret gets logged (syslog) by the PAM tacplus [1], if the
PAM module is configured with the debug parameter. The secrets get logged
at DEBUG loglevel.

pam_tacplus 1.5.3 avoids the logging of the secret, via upstream commit
4a9852c31c2fd0c0e72fbb689a586aabcfb11cb0 [2].

The original README of pam_tacplus held a configuration example with the
debug parameter set, which might have resulted in some setups, which are
running in debug-mode, based on the example configuration.

This issue got reported  by Adarsh Pandey from Arista Networks [3].
