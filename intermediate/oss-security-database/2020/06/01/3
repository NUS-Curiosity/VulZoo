Subject: CVE-2020-13659 QEMU: exec: address_space_map returns NULL without
 setting length to zero may lead to DoS

   Hello,

A NULL pointer dereference issue was found in the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 
emulator of the QEMU. This issue occurs because the address_space_map() API 
while mapping physical memory into host's virtual address space may return 
NULL, without setting the length parameter to zero(0). A guest user/process 
may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS 
scenario.

Upstream patch:

Thank you.
