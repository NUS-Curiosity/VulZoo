Subject: CVE-2020-1711 QEMU: block: iscsi: OOB heap access via an unexpected
 response of iSCSI Server

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds heap buffer access issue was found in the way iSCSI Block 
driver in QEMU handled response coming from an iSCSI server, while checking 
status of a Logical Address Block (LBA) in iscsi_co_block_status() routine.

A remote user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS 
OR potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process on 
the host.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-01/msg05535.html

This issue was reported by Felipe Franciosi, Raphael Norwitz and Peter 
Turschmid of nutanix.com.

Thank you.
