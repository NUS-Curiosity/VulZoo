Operators and package maintainers who prefer to apply patches selectively can
find individual vulnerability-specific patches in the "patches" subdirectory
of the release directory for our two stable release branches (9.11 and 9.16)

  https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.11.22/patches
  https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.16.6/patches

With the public announcement of these vulnerabilities, the embargo
period is ended and any updated software packages that have been
prepared may be released.
