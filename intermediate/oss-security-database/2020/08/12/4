SECURITY-1955 / CVE-2020-2229
Jenkins 2.251 and earlier, LTS 2.235.3 and earlier does not escape the
tooltip content of help icons. Tooltip values can be contributed by
plugins, some of which use user-specified values.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.


SECURITY-1957 / CVE-2020-2230
Jenkins 2.251 and earlier, LTS 2.235.3 and earlier does not escape the
project naming strategy description that is displayed on item creation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users with Overall/Manage permission.


SECURITY-1960 / CVE-2020-2231
Jenkins 2.251 and earlier, LTS 2.235.3 and earlier does not escape the
remote address of the host starting a build via 'Trigger builds remotely'.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission or knowledge of the
Authentication Token.


SECURITY-1975 / CVE-2020-2232
Email Extension Plugin stores an SMTP password in its global configuration
file `hudson.plugins.emailext.ExtendedEmailPublisher.xml` on the Jenkins
master as part of its configuration.

While this password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted and
displayed in plain text as part of the configuration form by Email
Extension Plugin 2.72 and 2.73. This can result in exposure of the
password.


SECURITY-1794 (1) / CVE-2020-2233
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.8.2 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to enumerate
credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part
of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.


SECURITY-1794 (2) / CVE-2020-2234 (permission check) & CVE-2020-2235 (CSRF)
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.8.2 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified JDBC URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method, potentially capturing credentials stored
in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.


SECURITY-1940 / CVE-2020-2236
Yet Another Build Visualizer Plugin 1.11 and earlier does not escape
tooltip content.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users with Run/Update permission.


SECURITY-1763 / CVE-2020-2237
Flaky Test Handler Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier does not require POST requests
for the "Deflake this build" feature, resulting in a cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to rebuild a project at a previous git
revision where the tests were failing.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
