That's odd, and not the best way to do this, the commit really showed up
in 4.8-rc1:
	$ git describe --contains 1bdc76aea115
	v4.8-rc1~162^2~21

You forgot to sort by "version", which is what you need to do if you
want to try to look at tags, but then it's still a bit off:
	$ git tag --contains 1bdc76aea115 | sort -V | head -n 10
	v4.8
	v4.8-rc1
	v4.8-rc2
	v4.8-rc3
	v4.8-rc4
	v4.8-rc5
	v4.8-rc6
	v4.8-rc7
	v4.8-rc8
	v4.9

hope this helps,
