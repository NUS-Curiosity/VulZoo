Subject: CVE-2020-25085 QEMU: sdhci: out-of-bounds access issue while doing
 multi block SDMA

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds r/w access issue was found in the SDHCI Controller emulator 
of QEMU. It may occur while doing multi block SDMA, if transfer block size 
exceeds the 's->fifo_buffer[s->buf_maxsz]' size. It'd leave the current 
element pointer 's->data_count' pointing out of bounds. Leading the subsequent 
DMA r/w operation to OOB access issue. A guest user/process may use this flaw 
to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS scenario.
