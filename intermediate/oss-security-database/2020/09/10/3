CVE-2020-11998: Apache ActiveMQ JMX remote client could execute arbitrary code

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Affected Version: only Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.12

Vulnerability details: 
A regression has been introduced in the commit preventing JMX re-bind.
By passing an empty environment map to RMIConnectorServer, instead of the map that contains
he authentication credentials, it leaves ActiveMQ open to the following attack:

"A remote client could create a javax.management.loading.MLet MBean and use
it to create new MBeans from arbitrary URLs, at least if there is no
security manager. In other words, a rogue remote client could make your
Java application execute arbitrary code."

Mitigation: Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.13
