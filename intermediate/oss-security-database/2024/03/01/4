Subject: CVE-2024-27138: Apache Archiva: disabling user registration is not
 effective 

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Archiva 2.0.0 or later

Description:

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Archiva.

Apache Archiva has a setting to disable user registration, however this restriction can be bypassed. As Apache Archiva has been retired, we do not expect to release a version of Apache Archiva that fixes this issue. You are recommended to look into migrating to a different solution, or isolate your instance from any untrusted users.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer
