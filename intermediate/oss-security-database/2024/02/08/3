Subject: [ADVISORY] CVE-2023-3966: Open vSwitch: Invalid memory access in
 Geneve with HW offload.

Description
===========

Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to crafted Geneve
packets causing invalid memory accesses and potential denial of service.
Triggering the vulnerability requires that Open vSwitch has flow hardware
offload with Linux TC flower enabled (other_config:hw-offload=true).
It is not enabled by default.

The issue is caused by insufficient validation of Geneve metadata
fields in the offload path.  Open vSwitch versions 2.12 and newer are
affected.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned CVE-2023-3966 identifier to this issue.


Mitigation
==========

For any version of Open vSwitch, disabling flow hardware offload will
prevent the issue (setting other_config:hw-offload=false and reboot
the system).  We do not recommend attempting to mitigate the vulnerability
this way because it may impact the overall system throughput.

By default, flow hardware offload support is not enabled.
