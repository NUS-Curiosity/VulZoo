I've taken the one remaining missing fix into the next round of kernel
releases, so all should be good now.

The "interesting" thing here is that the project in question (the
kernel) does not consider "mounting a corrupted filesystem" as a real
attack vector at all.  There's been long discussions about it, the most
recent being last year on the kernel summit discuss mailing list, and at
the kernel summit itself.

So while CVSS might consider this a real issue, the developers of the
project itself do not.  The disconnect is one that drives people who use
sysbot tools to create fancy corrupted filesystem images with the goal
of getting a CVE for their CV, crazy on a weekly basis when the issues
they report get constantly ignored.

Good times :)
