Subject: CVE-2023-51441: Apache Axis 1.x (EOL) may allow SSRF when
 untrusted input is passed to the service admin HTTP API 

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Axis through 1.3

Description:

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Axis allowed users with access to the admin service to perform possible SSRF
This issue affects Apache Axis: through 1.3.

As Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. Alternatively you could use a build of Axis with the patch from  https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/685c309febc64aa393b2d64a05f90e7eb9f73e06  applied. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release 
fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards
 this are welcome.
