 out-of-bound writes when writing escape sequence

Here's what I sent the glibc's security team a few weeks back; I fixed 
some typos:


# PHP's heap in 2 sentences

PHP's heap is page-based; each page contains chunks of some specific 
size, such as 8, 0x10, 0x18, etc.

Chunks do not have any header or footer, they are raw data. Therefore, 
an overflow from some chunk on the heap directly lands on the next chunk.
Now, for each chunk size, a singly-linked list stores chunks that are 
not allocated (similar to tcache in ptmalloc).

# Exploiting iconv()

Say some PHP application allows you to convert some text from UTF-8 to 
some arbitrary charset. It uses PHP's iconv() function to do so,
which internally calls glibc's iconv(). You ask the application to 
convert some buffer of size 0x50 from UTF-8 to ISO-2022-CN-EXT. It allocates
an output buffer of the same size. Imagine that, by chance, the output 
buffer is on top of a free chunk. We have something like this:

0x7fCCBBAA1000 [output_buffer]
0x7fCCBBAA1050 [free_chunk]

Since free_chunk is not allocated, its first 8 bytes contain a pointer 
to the next free chunk in the 0x50 free list, say 0x7fCCBBAA10A0.

We trigger a one byte overflow. Since our vulnerability is not that 
good, the byte that overflow can only have a few values: 0x48 (H), 0x49 
(I), etc.
Consider that it is 0x48 for this example.

So, we overflow one byte into free_chunk, which will effectively modify 
the LSB of the free list pointer. It was 0x7fCCBBAA10A0 and becomes
0x7fCCBBAA1048.

Using the vulnerability, we have modified the free list for chunks of 
size 0x50. If we manage to force PHP into allocating a few 0x50 chunks,
it will therefore allocate one chunk at address 0x7fCCBBAA1050 
(free_chunk's address), and the next one at address 0x7fCCBBAA1048.
The two chunks overlap, so we can overwrite one's content with the other.

This is the basic idea behind using this vulnerability for PHP 
exploitation.

I have built a reliable exploit against a popular PHP application.

## PHP: file read to RCE

Another funny thing: in PHP, when you call a file-read function (such as 
file_get_contents()), you can perform encoding modification on the data
before it is returned. For instance:

```php
echo 
file_get_contents('php://filter/convert.iconv.utf-8.utf-16/resource=/etc/passwd');
```

This returns the contents of /etc/passwd, but converted to utf-16 using 
iconv.

I managed to build a fully reliable, PHP-agnostic exploit that converts 
a file read primitive (for instance, a call to file_get_contents() with 
a controlled
parameter) to remote code execution.

Therefore, with this bug, any person that has a file read vulnerability 
on a PHP application has RCE. Any person that can force PHP into calling 
iconv()
with controlled parameters has RCE.
