Subject: Linux Kernel use-after-free in SCSI generic device interface

Hi folks,

This is CVE-2016-9576.

This original post from  Dmitry Vyukov <dvyukov @ google . com> has a kasan/syzkaller report:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=148010092224801&w=2

https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dvyukov/80cd94b4e4c288f16ee4c787d404118b/raw/10536069562444da51b758bb39655b514ff93b45/gistfile1.txt

which in turn turned out to be a kernel memory read or
potentially even a kernel memory write, in using the scatter gather
write mode of the /dev/sg* scsi generic devices.

The affected code is in Linux down to 2.6.something (problem might require splice() to be exploitable).

Linus has committed a fix for this to mainline:

commit a0ac402cfcdc904f9772e1762b3fda112dcc56a0
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@...ux-foundation.org>

    Don't feed anything but regular iovec's to blk_rq_map_user_iov

    In theory we could map other things, but there's a reason that function
    is called "user_iov".  Using anything else (like splice can do) just
    confuses it.
