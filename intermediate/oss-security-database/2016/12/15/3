Subject: CVE-2016-9588 Kernel: kvm: nVMX: uncaught software exceptions in L1
 guest lead to DoS

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the KVM virtualisation support(CONFIG_KVM), with 
nested virtualisation(nVMX) feature enabled(nested=1), is vulnerable to an 
uncaught exceptions issue. It could occur if a L2 guest was to throw an 
exception which is not handled by L1 guest.

A L1 guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest resulting in DoS.
