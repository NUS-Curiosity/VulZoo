I had this discussion with Stanislav Brabec, from SUSE, a while ago.

"Just for curiosity, I just ran grep for TIOCSTI ioctl() over all
openSUSE sources. I got about 60 matches.

I analyzed use of some cases:

util-linux: used in agetty in wait_for_term_input()
kbd: contrib utility sti equal to tiocsti utility.
irda: Used by handle_scancode() to emulate input.
tcsh: Used in ed mode and in pushback().
emacs: Used in stuff_char() (putting char to be read from terminal)
...

It seems that TIOCSTI is used for:
- Read character, and if it does not match, put it back.
- Wait for character, than put it back for processing.
- Implementing a simple line editing."

So yes.
