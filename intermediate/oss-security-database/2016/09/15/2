We don't feel that it's a case of independent mistakes in the client
and server. The type of exposure is not, by itself, relevant to the
number of CVEs.

Use CVE-2016-7406 for all of this.

Use CVE-2016-7407. (Admittedly, we do not completely understand
whether this is identical to a code problem previously found in
PuTTY.)


> - Security: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if
>   particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where

Use CVE-2016-7408.

>   running user if compiled with DEBUG_TRACE and running with -v
>   https://secure.ucc.asn.au/hg/dropbear/rev/6a14b1f6dc04

Use CVE-2016-7409.
