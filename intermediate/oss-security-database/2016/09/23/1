OSSA-2016-011: Nova may fail to delete images in resize state regression

:CVE: CVE-2016-7498


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Nova: ==13.0.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Rajesh Tailor from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova. If an
authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it
will cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute
node it was running on. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of
service attack. All Nova setups are affected.

  re-introduced in the first release of Mitaka version of Nova and it
  was re-fixed in nova-13.1.0.
