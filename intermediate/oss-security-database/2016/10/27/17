Subject: CVE-2016-7067 - CSRF in Monit Service Manager

Hello,

I'd found a CSRF issue in Monit(https://mmonit.com/monit/) in the Service
Manager application that affects versions 5.19.0 and earlier. Red Hat has
assigned CVE-2016-7067 to this issue. Monit has fixed this issue in version
5.20.0

Description:
The forms in Monit's Service Manager are vulnerable to a cross site request
forgery attack.
Successful exploitation will enable an attacker to disable/enable all
monitoring for a particular host, disable/enable monitoring for a specific
service.
