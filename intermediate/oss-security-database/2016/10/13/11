Subject: CVE Request: another recursion in GRE

Hi,

While debugging the issue CVE-2016-7039, SUSE engineer Michal Kubecek also spotted
a similar problem fixed earlier this year.

If a packet has the layout: | IPv4 header | GRE header | IPv4 header | GRE header | ...
depending on left over stack it could run the kernel out of stack due to
recursion and so crash the kernel.
This might be hard to hit with regular Ethernet MTUs, but easier with Jumbo frames.

Michal has a testcase in 
https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1001486#c5


As far as I see fixed in 4.6, introduced in 3.13 (bf5a755f).

    tunnels: Don't apply GRO to multiple layers of encapsulation.
    
    When drivers express support for TSO of encapsulated packets, they
    only mean that they can do it for one layer of encapsulation.
    Supporting additional levels would mean updating, at a minimum,
    more IP length fields and they are unaware of this.
    
    No encapsulation device expresses support for handling offloaded
    encapsulated packets, so we won't generate these types of frames
    in the transmit path. However, GRO doesn't have a check for
    multiple levels of encapsulation and will attempt to build them.
    
    UDP tunnel GRO actually does prevent this situation but it only
    handles multiple UDP tunnels stacked on top of each other. This
    generalizes that solution to prevent any kind of tunnel stacking
    that would cause problems.
