Hello, David,

Could you, please, tell, if you plan to submit that patch of yours to be merged upstream?

Nope, I don't think that security@...nel.org was sent the patch, but if
the maintainer of the subsytem already knows about it (it looks like he
wrote the patch), then there was no need to let that alias know about
it, right?

Any idea if this is going to be submitted to be merged upstream?
