Here, we will assign the ID to the broadest possible interpretation of
the issue, which perhaps can be restated as "Tor internal functions
were entitled to expect that buf_t data had NUL termination, but the
implementation of or/buffers.c did not ensure that NUL termination was
present."

Use CVE-2016-8860.

With this CVE, any related "we should still fix them as they occur"
patches can most likely be treated as defense-in-depth changes, and
won't require separate CVE IDs.
