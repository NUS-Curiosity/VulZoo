Hello Mitre,

the previous assignment on this issue was about only one CVE ( see 
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/10/16/18 )

We sayd that the cause of the two null pointer access was the same.

Now for completeness I posted the stacktrace of both locations in bmp_dec.c 
but I guess that the root cause remains the same.

Do you need to reject one of these two or it is fine as is?
