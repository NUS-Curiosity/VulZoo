So I had a chance to talk to Paul

Basically: the RFC doesn't define a specific way to handle this, as such a
CVE cannot be given to the RFC (currently CVEs will be given to
RFCs/protocols that say "do something bad" like using weak encryption
algorithms).

As such it was left up to all the IKE implementations themselves to
determine what to do with respect to retransmits.

I think it's safe to say an amplification of 1:10 or more qualifies as a
problem, I'm not sure what the exact amplification ratio to qualify for a
CVE is (1:3, 1:7?) but I think 1:10 or more should definitely qualify.

Thus a lot of other IKE implementations will be needing CVEs for this class
of problem (as well as other protocols).
