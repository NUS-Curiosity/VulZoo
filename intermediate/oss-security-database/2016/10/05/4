Yes, indeed. This patch also introduced a regression in the processing
of some images.
Cf. https://bugs.debian.org/734238

Do you specifically know of a distribution that still has that patch?
If I remember the context correctly, the use of comp0size could then
lead to a heap buffer overflow later on. Was that what you noticed?

In any case, the patch should indeed better be replaced by the one
provided upstream (cf. the Debian bug report).
