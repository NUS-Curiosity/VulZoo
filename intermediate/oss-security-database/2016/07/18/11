Subject: Re: CVE-2016-5323: libtiff 4.0.6 tiffcrop
 _TIFFFax3fillruns(): divide by zero

Is this the fix for this CVE?

https://github.com/vadz/libtiff/commit/2f79856097f423eb33796a15fcf700d2ea41bf31

Appears to mention CVE-2016-5321 and CVE-2016-5323 so not sure if commit
https://github.com/vadz/libtiff/commit/d9783e4a1476b6787a51c5ae9e9b3156527589f0

is a partial fix for CVE-2016-5321

regards,
Armin
