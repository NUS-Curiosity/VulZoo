Subject: Re: Ruining the Magic of Magento's Encryption Library

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

We wanted to provide at least one CVE ID for this report, because
there are some CVE use cases in which it's of interest to track
whether a code review exists, even if there isn't yet a specific
association with patch management.

It's possible that some CVE ID assignments could be made for
third-party applications that use this library.
http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/07/19/3 doesn't directly
discuss what parts of the cryptography code are reachable in default
or typical deployments of Magento. We haven't been able to find
documentation that describes how independent developers were expected
to use the library code.
http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.1/ext-best-practices/extension-coding/security-performance-data-bp.html
has general comments such as "Avoid using low-level functionality" and
"Always encrypt sensitive data or configurations." Finally, there are
no recent Crypt.php or Encryptor.php commits on the
https://github.com/magento/magento2/tree/develop/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Encryption
page.

Given the above, we will initially focus on

  https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/6ea7d2d85cded3fa0fbcf4e7aa0dcd4edbf568a6/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Encryption/Crypt.php#L64-L69
  https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/6ea7d2d85cded3fa0fbcf4e7aa0dcd4edbf568a6/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Encryption/Crypt.php#L83

http://php.net/manual/en/function.rand.php says "rand - Generate a
random integer ... This function does not generate cryptographically
secure values, and should not be used for cryptographic purposes."

Use CVE-2016-6485 for the incorrect choice of the rand function within
the

  $initVector .= $abc[rand(0, strlen($abc) - 1)];

line.
