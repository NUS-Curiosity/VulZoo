As far as we can tell, your message did not provide a link to a
whitepaper, and any attachment did not arrive either through direct
email or in any of the oss-security list archives.

We think the commit already occurred:

  https://git.lysator.liu.se/nettle/nettle/commit/3fe1d6549765ecfb24f0b80b2ed086fdc818bff3

> I would like to request a CVE id for the flaw in nettle.

Use CVE-2016-6489 for the vulnerability that was fixed in
3fe1d6549765ecfb24f0b80b2ed086fdc818bff3.

At this point, we are not assigning any CVE IDs for potential
"incomplete fix" issues mentioned in the 003093.html post, such as
"The CRT code used for RSA signing uses other functions which may
leak, in particular division functions with branches depending on
secret data ... exponents use a normalized size field (so top limb is
non-zero). This might still leak information about the top exponent
bits ... Mini-gmp builds don't try to be side-channel silent."
