> mmap_panic: Malicious calls to mmap() can trigger an allocation panic
> or trigger memory corruption.

> http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/att-68/mmap_panic_c.bin

>> When a user provides the __MAP_NOFAULT flag to mmap, the
>> kernel calls amap_alloc() which calls malloc() with a size derived 
>> from the user-passed size. This is called through
>> sys_mmap(), uvm_mmapfile() and uvm_map() without ever
>> validating the user-provided size. This can result in a panic
>> in malloc. For example when requesting a mapping of
>> 0x222.1111.0000 bytes, amap_alloc() will compute that it needs
>> 0x2221.1110 slots and amap_alloc1() will compute that it needs
>> 0x2221.1200 total slots and will call malloc() to allocate
>> 0x2.2211.2000 bytes resulting in a panic of
>> "panic: malloc: allocation too large, type = 98, size = 9161482240".

Use CVE-2016-6239 for this general "too large" issue.


>> Besides causing a panic, the amap_alloc() code can also miscalculate 
>> the allocation size which would cause an undersized allocation in 
>> amap_alloc1(). This could lead to memory corruption later. There are 
>> two causes.

>> First amap_alloc() computes slots from a size_t size into
>> an integer slots variable:
>> If the original size is larger 0x1000.0000.0000 or larger it will
>> result in a truncated value of slots, resulting in an undersized amap.

Use CVE-2016-6240 for this first "miscalculate" issue.


>> The second problem arises in amap_alloc1():
>> The number of slots is rounded up so that the slot entries fill
>> full pages. This rounding up happens in the integer "totalslots"
>> variable, and can overflow the original "slots" value. This
>> can happen when requesting an allocation of size 0xfff.ffff.0000,
>> for example. In this case amap_alloc() computes that
>> 0xffff.fff0 slots are needed and amap_alloc1() computes
>> that zero totalslots are needed, and allocates an amap of zero
>> bytes. If the amap->am_slots, amap->am_bckptr or amap->am_anon
>> fields are later accessed, it can lead to out-of-memory
>> reads and writes on the kernel allocation heap.

Use CVE-2016-6241 for this second "miscalculate" issue.

Use CVE-2016-6242.

Use CVE-2016-6243.

Use CVE-2016-6246.

Use CVE-2016-6247.
