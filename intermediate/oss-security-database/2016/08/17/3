It seems that Greg keeps on being bothered with questions ;-)
Here's one more: the relevant Upstream commit
75ff39ccc1bd5d3c455b6822ab09e533c551f758
is referenced in all change logs of yesterday's kernel releases...
... Except for: 4.7.1 (https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/
linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.7.1)
Did 4.7.1 miss the fix?

Thanks again,
Gsunde
