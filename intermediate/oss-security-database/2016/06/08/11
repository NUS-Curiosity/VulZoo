Maybe I should be a little more verbose on this:
1) attacker recovers the DSA host key. 
2) attacker mitm-attacks client connections to the server and recovers the user's private key by exploiting the vulnerable openssl on the client side 
3) ...

The same principles apply when the computational burden is reversed for client auth, aren't they?
