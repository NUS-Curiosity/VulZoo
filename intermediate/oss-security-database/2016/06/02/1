Subject: [OSSA-2016-008] Incorrect Audit IDs in Keystone Fernet Tokens can
 result in revocation bypass (CVE-2016-4911)

============================================================================================
OSSA-2016-008: Incorrect Audit IDs in Keystone Fernet Tokens can result in revocation bypass
============================================================================================

:Date: May 23, 2016
:CVE: CVE-2016-4911


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Keystone: ==9.0.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Lance Bragstad (Rackspace) reported a vulnerability in the Keystone
Fernet Token Provider. By rescoping a token a user will receive a new
token without correct audit_ids, these incorrect audit_ids will
prevent the entire chain of tokens from being revoked properly. This
vulnerability does not impact revoking a token by its individual
audit_id. Only deployments with Keystone configured to use Fernet
tokens are impacted.
