Many protocols could be described as "flawed." The IKEv1 protocol
amplification concern does not make it flawed in a way that would lead
to a per-protocol CVE ID assignment. We are maintaining the
CVE-2016-5361 ID assignment for the upstream announcement of
"libreswan 3.16 vulnerable to DDOS attack. Please upgrade to 3.17" and
accompanying upstream patch, as described in the
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/06/10/4 post.
