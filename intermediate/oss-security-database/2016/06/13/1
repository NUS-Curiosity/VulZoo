In that case, no CVE should be assigned to this issue as well. Its not
libreswan which is flawed, but its the protocol which they are trying to
implement.

Also the following products (which implement IKEv1 are flawed, since
they follow this protocol)

 ipsec-tools
 racoon2
 openswan
 strongswan
 libreswan
 ike
 vpnc

(There may be others, but i can only think of the above)
