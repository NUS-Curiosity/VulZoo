As far as we can tell, the main issue you are reporting is that the
product attempts to forbid executable content within otherwise safe
file types, and does this incorrectly.

Use CVE-2016-1713.

There are no other CVE IDs for your report. For example, the ability
of the attacker to use the .php extension, although unusual, does not
seem to be an entirely separate problem.
