Subject: Re: CVE Request: freeradius: the EAP-PWD module performs insufficient validation on packets received from an EAP peer

We have revisited this and decided that it needs unique CVE IDs. As
mentioned on that security.html page, "These issues were found by
Jouni Malinen as part of investigating
http://w1.fi/security/2015-4/" - this suggested a possibility that the
CVE IDs listed in
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/31/6 would be
applicable. However, FreeRADIUS apparently has an independent
implementation of EAP-pwd. This led to a somewhat unusual situation in
which most of the vulnerability findings were, at a high level, the
same -- but resulted from a different set of mistakes within a
different codebase. The applicable FreeRADIUS changes can be found in
the "Commits on May 4, 2015" section of:

  https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commits/v3.0.x/src/modules/rlm_eap/types/rlm_eap_pwd

and are distinct from the changes in the http://w1.fi/security/2015-4/
patches.

We are associating the three CVE IDs below with the items on the
security.html list, not with the specific FreeRADIUS commits.


>> The EAP-PWD packet length is not checked before the first byte is
>> dereferenced. A zero-length EAP-PWD packet will cause the module to
>> dereference a NULL pointer, and will cause the server to crash.

Use CVE-2015-8762.


>> The commit message payload length is not validated before the packet
>> is decoded. This can result in a read overflow in the server.
>> 
>> The confirm message payload length is not validated before the packet
> is decoded. This can result in a read overflow in the server.

Use CVE-2015-8763 for both of these issues.


>> A strcpy() was used to pack a C string into an EAP-PWD packet. This
>> would result in an over-run of the destination buffer by one byte.

Use CVE-2015-8764.
