As far as we can tell, there are two distinct cross-origin issues
within FFmpeg's URL processing. Use CVE-2016-1897 for the concat issue
(which is fully described in the blog/274855 reference) and
CVE-2016-1898 for the subfile issue (which is mentioned but not
described in the blog/274855 reference).

The essential problem is that a crafted file forces the victim to
visit an arbitrary external URL, but this URL is constructed using
data from the victim's local filesystem.

This might describe a vulnerability, but we aren't sure whether the
access to file:///home/ctf/flag.txt is really unintended FFmpeg
behavior. This might be better modeled as a site-specific
vulnerability in the web service, because it should have arranged for
the file:///home/ctf/flag.txt URL to be interpreted within an
appropriately safe sandbox context.

Similarly, the reports of FFmpeg SSRF in blog/274855 might be better
modeled as site-specific vulnerabilities within the "online video
conversion" web application.
