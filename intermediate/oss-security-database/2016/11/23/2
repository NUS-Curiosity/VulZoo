Use CVE-2016-9557 for the issues addressed by these
d42b2388f7f8e0332c846675133acea151fc557a changes:

  Some problematic types like uchar, ulong, and friends have been replaced
  with names with a jas_ prefix.
  ...
  An option max_samples has been added to the BMP and JPEG decoders to
  restrict the maximum size of image that they can decode.  This change
  was made as a (possibly temporary) fix to address security concerns.
  ...
  Some new integer overflow checks were added.
  ...
  Some new safe integer add/multiply functions were added.

(max_samples has a default of 64 Mb or 128 Mb in different parts of
the code.)
