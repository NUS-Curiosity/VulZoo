This switches to using libidn2, which hasn't had a substantial commit
in around 5 years (https://gitlab.com/jas/libidn2/commits/master), and
currently doesn't even show up in the file listing for the https
version of alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libidn/. (Somehow http and https are
different; the https version has HSTS headers which you might need to
take into account if comparing).

Moving something as widely used as curl to this makes me feel a little
uneasy (and I'm a bit surprised it wasn't called out specifically in the
release notes).

Has anyone poked at it much yet?
