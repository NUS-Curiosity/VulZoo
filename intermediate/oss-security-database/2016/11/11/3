Subject: CVE-2016-8645: linux kernel: net: a BUG() statement can be hit in
 net/ipv4/tcp_input.c

Hello,

Let me please inform that it was discovered by Marco
Grassi <marco.gra@...il.com> (many thanks) that the
Linux kernels since at least v4.0 are crashing in
tcp_collapse() after making a number of certain syscalls.

RHEL-7 kernels (3.10.0-xxx) are not vulnerable. Also,
the upstream kernels since v4.9-rc1 are not vulnerable too,
as they have the commit c9c3321257. Unfortunately, this
commit is not fix, but just a workaround. I'm not aware
of any fix as of now.

CVE-2016-8645 was assigned to this flaw internally by
the Red Hat, please, use this CVE-ID in communications
regarding this flaw.
