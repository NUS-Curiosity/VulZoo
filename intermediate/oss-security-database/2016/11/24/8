Subject: Linux kernel: CVE-2016-8650 : Local denial of service with in key subsystem

Gday,

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel key management subsystem in which
a local attacker could crash the kernel (denial of service) or corrupt
the stack and additional memory by supplying a specially crafted RSA
key.  This flaw panics the machine during the verification of the RSA
key and seems to do a 1 byte corruption of the stack.

This vulnerably can be triggered by any unprivileged user with a local
shell account.
