Subject: Re: [FD] CVE-2016-4484: - Cryptsetup Initrd root Shell

Hello,

It would be more precise to say "2:1.7.3-2" rather than "2:1".
This number refers to the Debian package. It seems that Debian is using
different version numbers for the "cryptsetup" package:

https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4484

We are not sure whether the last part of the version number (2:1.7.3-2)
of the Debian package (1.7.3-2) is used to match with the cryptsetup
version.

Just to avoid confusion, the bug is on the scripts (initramfs) and not
in the cryptsetup encryption/decryption algorithms.

Regards,
Hector Marco & Ismael Ripoll.
