The "2:" prefix is called an "epoch" and was introduced around the
time the package was renamed from "cryptsetup-luks" to "cryptsetup"
(for reasons not entirely clear to me from reading the package
changelog, but is usually employed to work around version numbers
going in reverse or mistakes in version numbers for a package). The
-2 suffix is a package revision, which makes updated packages
containing non-updated upstream releases possible (necessary to, for
example, be able to fix bugs in the packaging itself). So in the
case of a 2:1.7.3-2 package version, 1.7.3 is the corresponding
upstream source version number.
