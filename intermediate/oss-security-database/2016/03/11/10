    Credit to Apple.
    WebKit, as used in Apple iOS before 9.2.1 and Safari before 9.0.3,
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web site, a different
    vulnerability than CVE-2016-1725 and CVE-2016-1726.

CVE-2016-1724
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK+ before 2.10.5.
    Credit to Apple.
    WebKit, as used in Apple iOS before 9.2.1, Safari before 9.0.3, and
    tvOS before 9.1.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
    or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web
    site, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-1727.

CVE-2016-1725
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK+ before 2.10.5.
    Credit to Apple.
    WebKit, as used in Apple iOS before 9.2.1 and Safari before 9.0.3,
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web site, a different
    vulnerability than CVE-2016-1723 and CVE-2016-1726.

CVE-2016-1726
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK+ before 2.10.8.
    Credit to Apple.
    WebKit, as used in Apple iOS before 9.2.1 and Safari before 9.0.3,
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web site, a different
    vulnerability than CVE-2016-1723 and CVE-2016-1725.

CVE-2016-1727
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK+ before 2.10.5.
    Credit to Apple.
    WebKit, as used in Apple iOS before 9.2.1, Safari before 9.0.3, and
    tvOS before 9.1.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
    or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web
    site, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-1724.

CVE-2016-1728
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK+ before 2.10.5.
    Credit to an anonymous researcher coordinated via Joe Vennix.
    The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) implementation in Apple iOS before
    9.2.1 and Safari before 9.0.3 mishandles the "a:visited button"
    selector during height processing, which makes it easier for remote
    attackers to obtain sensitive browser-history information via a
    crafted web site.


We recommend updating to the last stable version of WebKitGTK+. It is
