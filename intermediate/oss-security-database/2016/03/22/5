Thanks.  Meanwhile, @idl3r tweeted what is claimed to be and looks like
a relevant but possibly incomplete PoC for this bug:

<idl3r> Sent a proposal about CVE-2015-1805 to CSW but got no response. Didn't know you guys found it too :D @jduck @ZIMPERIUM
<@idl3r> @jduck Here is a rough PoC if you'd like to try, better success rate is also possible https://github.com/idl3r/testcode/blob/master/test2.c

I've attached this file, for archival.

The default target_addr looks like it was being tested on a specific
kernel for AArch64, but there's nothing very arch specific in here.
The SELinux mode check suggests that target_addr is probably meant to
hit that one variable in the kernel, although there are many other
relevant targets.
