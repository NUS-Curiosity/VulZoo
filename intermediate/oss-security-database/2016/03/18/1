Unfortunately, I can currently only share early work based on a modified 
version of gitdb which can’t create a packfile (Maybe I will be able to 
upload the full gitdb version in a few weeks). You can find it as an 
attachment along an example file.

This email contains a vulnerable version of git with libasan 
https://github.com/google/sanitizers and no optimizations which helped 
me to identify the issue. When I pushed that large repository, libasan 
printed a stack trace which ended on strcpy() in path_name.c (just cat 
2GB.txt in a terminal)

Either way once you have packfile, you need to create a network payload. 
Since my vector was ssh I used the good vim editor on the packfile in 
order to add the missing informations (nul bytes included) (since 
everything is text based outside the packfile).
Doing it manually was much faster than trying to create a script. I 
included an example for ssh which will fill ram if cloned or pushed 
(without doing anything related to the vulnerability). It should help 
demonstrating how to produce one for triggering rce.

For those who don’t want to try it. I included a crafted repo ready for 
use which will crash affected versions. It will help distributions 
testing their own patches.
Of course everything I did was about strcpy() and don’t contains 
executable code (though putting some shoud be easy). For other 
vulnerabilities based on that size_t to int truncation, just ask Peff at 
GitHub, inc. He did is own testing.

On the contrary, please make them widely available so other 
distributions can test their own patches faster.
