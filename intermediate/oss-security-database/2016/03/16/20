Use CVE-2014-9767 for this issue that was apparently disclosed in
https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=67996 in 2014. The issue could be
relevant in cases where, for example:

  - a parent directory is on a filesystem that can't support many
    inodes, and the attacker can cause a DoS by creating thousands of
    empty directories there

  - a parent directory is served by the web server and allows a full
    directory listing, and the attacker can therefore post spam in the
    form of directory names

> https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=70312

These were mentioned here 6 months ago in the
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/09/08/8 and earlier
posts. We don't see any issue with re-opening the discussion at this
point, but could you please provide new information or a
counterargument?

For example, in 70385, is the security concern that someone may deploy
a web application that accepts arbitrary untrusted TIFF files and is
intended to print EXIF values, but would realistically instead print
the contents of other memory locations associated with a different
client's session?

In 70312, the "[2015-08-21 02:00 UTC]" comment says 'I'm sorry but I
cannot change the bug type. It is not "Security".' Was it supposed to
have been categorized as a security bug, or is the discussion from 6
months ago applicable:

  This might be primarily an interoperability bug. 70312 doesn't attempt
  to show that the hashes produced by PHP's HAVAL implementation had
  weaker security properties than those produced by a correct
  implementation. (One might also argue that applications requiring
  especially good hash properties should not be using HAVAL at all.)
