Subject: Mitre, reserved CVEs and oss-security?

Hi all,

I think it would be a good idea for Mitre to remove the RESERVED mark
from CVEs that have been released for use by people mailing issues to
the oss-security to get CVE numbers. The CVE database could then point
at the oss-security mailing list archives as a reference for the issue.

Any thoughts?

For exampleÂ CVE-2016-2515 could refer to one of these posts:
