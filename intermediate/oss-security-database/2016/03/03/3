I had suggested this in past (several years ago to the original Steven),
and again in this email last November:

https://cve.mitre.org/data/board/archives/2015-11/msg00018.html

my understanding is it's a no go due to two main factors:

1) CVE database lacks a good update mechanism to inform people of updated
entries
2) CVE entries must be "complete" before being added (e.g. researched/full
write up/etc.).

I could of course be wrong, we never actually got a response from Mitre on
my November email about this.

I'd be happy to bring it up on the board list again (CC'ed). Mitre can you
enlighten us please?
