Subject: CVE-2016-2385 Kamailio SEAS module heap buffer overflow

Kamailio (successor of former OpenSER and SER) is an Open Source SIP
Server released under GPL. It can be used to build large platforms for
VoIP and realtime communications, presence, WebRTC, Instant messaging
and other applications.

A heap overflow was found in Kamailio version 4.3.4 (possibly affecting
earlier versions also). The heap overflow takes place in the encode_msg
function of the SEAS module and can be triggered remotely if the module
is enabled.

A technical analysis of the vulnerability can be found here:

The vulnerability may allow an attacker to cause memory corruption,
process termination or potentially remote code execution.

This defect has been fixed in version 4.3.5 of Kamailio. Administrators
of affected systems are strongly advised to upgrade Kamailio to the
latest stable release.
