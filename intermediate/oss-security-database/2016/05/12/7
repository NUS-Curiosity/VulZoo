Hi Moritz,

You are right. Issue 775 was a duplicate of CVE-2016-1924.

I didn't notice that limingxing has been reported this issue (reported at
http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/128 and assigned CVE-2016-1924). I have
tested the proof-of-concept file supplied by limingxing and confirmed that
issue 775 was a duplicate of CVE-2016-1924. It seems that limingxing did
not report it to the official developers because I could not find any
information about this issue on GitHub and the official developers did not
fix it for a long time. I thought this was a new issue and reported it to
them after I did some fuzz testing. Anyway, this issue has been fixed by
the official developers now.
