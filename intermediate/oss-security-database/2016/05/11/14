Thanks!

The report of these stack exhaustions is here:

http://www.msweet.org/bugs.php?U549 (but you need to register)

Just to clarify, since we compiled testmxml with ASAN, in order to
reproduce  using the attached files in the original binary it is
necessary to reduce a little the stack size, for instance:

$ ulimit -s 4000

The stack exhaustations are still possible with the original testmxml
binary, but it requires slightly bigger files.
