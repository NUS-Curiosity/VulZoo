Maybe we can fold all three similar bugs in sound/core/timer.c into
the existing CVE-2016-4569?

In my sound.git tree,

cec8f96e49d9be372fdb0c3836dcf31ec71e457e
  ALSA: timer: Fix leak in SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_PARAMS
9a47e9cff994f37f7f0dbd9ae23740d0f64f9fe6
  ALSA: timer: Fix leak in events via snd_timer_user_ccallback
e4ec8cc8039a7063e24204299b462bd1383184a5
  ALSA: timer: Fix leak in events via snd_timer_user_tinterrupt

BTW, at the next time, *please* put the upstream maintainer into the
loop...
