Hi,

as you can see here:

http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/graphicsmagick

GM in Ubuntu resides in the "universe" repository

When you read up about "universe" here:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu

you will see that:

"Universe - Community maintained software, i.e. not officially supported
software."

which means all software from universe is _not_ officially supported
by canonical and thus receives only timely updates, if a community
member picks up the necessary work.

Too also quote from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS

"The LTS designation applies only to specific subsets of the Ubuntu
archive."

See also this (german) article about packages which do not
get security updates in Ubuntu "LTS" releases, because they are
only community maintained:

http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Ubuntu-LTS-Langzeitpflege-gibt-es-nur-fuer-das-Wichtigste-3179960.html

There is also a command line tool to find out about unsupported
packages:

ubuntu-support-status --show-unsupported
