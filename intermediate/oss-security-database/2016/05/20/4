The above topic is worthy of discussion.  What is a security issue in 
some contexts is normal and necessary in others.

The GraphicsMagick development code is not vulnerable to this one. 
GraphicsMagick may have been vulnerable in the past.

In interest of full-disclosure, the GraphicsMagick project has fixed 
approximately 45 CVE-worthy issues since the last release, not 
including issues covered by CVE-2016-2317 and CVE-2016-2318 (which are 
fixed in the development code).  Many of the test files are published 
in full open view on bug trackers or other places.

In a similar time-frame, the ImageMagick project has been provided a 
great many files (likely more than 100) which crash the software and 
many of these files are published in full open view on bug trackers or 
other places.  Commits and other records show that problems are being 
fixed.

When fixed versions are released, OS distributions which continue to 
provide 3-year old releases are exposing users to releases with 
perhaps hundreds of fixed vulnerabilities which can be triggered using 
publically available files.
