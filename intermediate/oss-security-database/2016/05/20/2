Subject: CVE-2016-4440 Kernel: kvm: vmx: incorrect state update leading to
 MSR access

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based virtual machine(CONFIG_KVM) along 
with Hyper-v Synthetic Interrupt Controller(SynIC) support is vulnerable to an 
undue APIC register access issue. In that a guest with SynIC enabled, could 
gain access to host's Machine Specific Registers(MSR).

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel 
resulting in DoS OR potentially leverage it to escalate privileges on the 
host.
