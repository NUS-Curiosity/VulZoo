Thanks for taking the time to do the git bisect!

I think CVE-2016-4347 and CVE-2015-7558 (stack exhaustion due to
cyclic dependency, reported here:
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/12/21/5) are in fact,
the same issue. This is probably my fault (sorry!).

MITRE: We should reject the the newly assigned one?

Gustavo.
