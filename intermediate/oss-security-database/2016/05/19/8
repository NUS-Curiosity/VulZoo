Subject: Re: ImageMagick Is On Fire -- CVE-2016-3714

Without making a commercial pitch for the company I work ... I suspect one
aspect of other vendors not fixing this is that there is a very
simple/effective/verifiable workaround to prevent exploitation of this, and
even with vendor updates I would still suggest using the workaround, after
reading the MVG docs it seems to much like flash to ever be "safe" (also in
a web app world I can't imagine a normal use case for people uploading MVG
files).
