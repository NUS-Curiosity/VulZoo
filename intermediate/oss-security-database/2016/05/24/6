Subject: Re: [ANNOUNCE] CVE-2016-3088: ActiveMQ Fileserver web application vulnerabilities

Hi Tim,

it’s an omission. The feature will be completely removed with 5.14.0 and
it’s been disabled by default since 5.12.0, so 5.13.x broker that haven’t
this feature turn on explicitly are not vulnerable.

I’ll fix the announcement now to say 5.13.x so it’s future proof in case of
new 5.13 branch releases
