Subject: CVE-2016-0617: linux kernel: hugetlbfs: fix bugs in
 hugetlb_vmtruncate_list()

Hello All,

There was a bug in the linux kernel's hugetlbfs handling of punching
holes in huegtlbfs files with either truncate or fallocate.  The problem
was introduced in 1bfad99ab (" hugetlbfs: hugetlb_vmtruncate_list()
needs to take a range", 4.3-rc1) and, I think, fixed in 9aacdd354d19
("fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c: fix bugs in hugetlb_vmtruncate_list(), 4.5-rc1).

This issue was assigned CVE-2016-0617.
