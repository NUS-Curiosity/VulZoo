Subject: CVE-2022-38170: Apache Airflow: Overly permissive umask for
 deamons 

Description:

In Apache Airflow prior to 2.3.4, an insecure umask was configured for numerous Airflow components when running with the  `--deamon` flag which could result in a race condition giving world-writable files in the Airflow home directory and allowing local users to expose arbitrary file contents via the webserver.

Mitigation:

Run without the `--deamon` flag via a process supervisor instead (systemd, runit, etc.).

Credit:

The Apache Airflow PMC would like to thank Harry Sintonen for reporting this issue.
