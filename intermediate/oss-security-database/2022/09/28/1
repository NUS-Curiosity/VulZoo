Subject: CVE-2021-43980: Apache Tomcat: Information disclosure

Severity: important

Description:

The simplified implementation of blocking reads and writes introduced in 
Tomcat 10 and back-ported to Tomcat 9.0.47 onwards exposed a long 
standing (but extremely hard to trigger) concurrency bug in Apache 
Tomcat 10.1.0 to 10.1.0-M12, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.18, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.60 
and 8.5.0 to 8.5.77 that could cause client connections to share an 
Http11Processor instance resulting in responses, or part responses, to 
be received by the wrong client.

Thanks to Adam Thomas, Richard Hernandez and Ryan Schmitt for 
discovering the issue and working with the Tomcat security team to 
identify the root cause and appropriate fix.
