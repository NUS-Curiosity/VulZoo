Regarding epmd, how is this achieved in the binary packages? Because on 
Arch at least, setting `ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1` as stated in 
https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/999#issuecomment-345068280 is 
still required. Should Arch make that a default in the systemd service 
file? For now this has just been a recommandation for single node 
security since 2017 
(https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CouchDB#Single_node_setup_&_Security), 
but I can make it the default (the second part of the wiki advice being 
now an upstream default, I think it would make some sense).

Bruno/Archange (Arch maintainer for CouchDB)
