 Execution Vulnerability in Packaging

Hi Bruno,

first of all, thanks for maintaining CouchDB for Arch. Secondly, for any security related questions, please do not hesitate to contact security@...chdb.apache.org instead of any one of the team individually, as we can’t know if any of is available at all times (vacations and whatnot :)

As for your questions, see this PR to our packaging infrastructure for how we handle this on Debian and Centos/Rocky: https://github.com/apache/couchdb-pkg/pull/92/files

Best
Jan

> Regarding epmd, how is this achieved in the binary packages? Because on Arch at least, setting `ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1` as stated in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/999#issuecomment-345068280 is still required. Should Arch make that a default in the systemd service file? For now this has just been a recommandation for single node security since 2017 (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CouchDB#Single_node_setup_&_Security), but I can make it the default (the second part of the wiki advice being now an upstream default, I think it would make some sense).
