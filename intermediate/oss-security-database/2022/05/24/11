I don't intend to share the exploit to the public, mainly because
the issue was fixed only few days ago. Instead, anyone wanting to check
his own system for the bug should resort to the attached PoC repro.

>I realize this is one of the aspects that not everyone is happy about.

Yes, you got that right.
