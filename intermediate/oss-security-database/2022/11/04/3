Subject: CVE-2022-37866: Apache Ivy: Ivy Path traversal

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Severity: medium

Description:

When Apache Ivy downloads artifacts from a repository it stores them in
the local file system based on a user-supplied "pattern" that may
include placeholders for artifacts coordinates like the organisation,
module or version.

If said coordinates contain "../" sequences - which are valid characters
for Ivy coordinates in general - it is possible the artifacts are stored
outside of Ivy's local cache or repository or can overwrite different
artifacts inside of the local cache.

In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker needs collaboration
by the remote repository as Ivy will issue http requests containing ".."
sequences and a "normal" repository will not interpret them as part of
the artifact coordinates.

Mitigation:

Users of Apache Ivy 2.0.0 to 2.5.1 should upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.
