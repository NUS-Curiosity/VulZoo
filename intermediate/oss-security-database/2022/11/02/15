I'm not sure what the value is of all this Monday-morning
quarterbacking, from 'basically trivial' fuzzing to code-quality
comparisons of hypothetical Rust ports.  OpenSSL's development process
has a bad rap, and there are definitely some easy wins to be had.
Posting "if they'd only adopted my pet practice" to oss-sec isn't fixing
anything in the OpenSSL project.  Please consider directing fuzzing
advice and PL theory directly to the project?  I agree there would be
benefit to this stuff, but dunking on them on unrelated lists isn't
getting the medicine to the patient.

Respectfully,
