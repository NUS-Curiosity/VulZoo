Subject: CVE-2022-46363: Apache CXF directory listing / code exfiltration

Severity: moderate

Description:

A vulnerability in Apache CXF before versions 3.5.5 and 3.4.10 allows
an attacker to perform a remote directory listing or code
exfiltration. The vulnerability only applies when the CXFServlet is
configured with both the static-resources-list and
redirect-query-check attributes. These attributes are not supposed to
be used together, and so the vulnerability can only arise if the CXF
service is misconfigured.
