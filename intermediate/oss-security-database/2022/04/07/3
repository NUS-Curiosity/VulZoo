Alexander,

indeed it doesn't cross guest-host boundaries.  However, /dev/kvm is 
accessible by unprivileged users, so it should be treated like any other 
unprivileged NULL pointer dereference in Linux.  I do not apply an 
embargo for those bugs, but whether to assign a CVE is not my choice.

(As an aside, this is the third fuzzing bug reported for KVM on 
security@...nel.org and linux-distros, but I think only one of them was 
really security sensitive).

Thanks,

Paolo
