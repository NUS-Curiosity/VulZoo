We sent the report to oss-security as instructed by linux-distro.

As Paolo said, /dev/kvm can be accessed by an unprivileged local user. 
So it's a Dos. It also seems like there is a kernel NPD issue on oss 
before: https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/02/5

We are willing to cooperate with the final decision of the CVE issuer 
and oss-security.

Personally, I agree with Paolo this is not a scary bug. No embargo makes 
it be fixed quickly.
