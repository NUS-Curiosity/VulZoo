The CNA that assigned that CVE is Oracle, so Oracle is the CNA to talk
to to make changes to it. MITRE won't make changes to it as they're
not the CNA behind that CVE.

Right, this is documented in the CNA rules [1]:

"8.2.1 MUST provide enough information for a reader to have a
reasonable understanding of what products are affected. If the
affected products are not explicitly listed in the description, then
the CNA MUST provide a reference that points to the known affected
products."
