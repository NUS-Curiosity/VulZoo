CVE-2022-28346: Potential SQL injection in ``QuerySet.annotate()``, 
``aggregate()``, and ``extra()``
====================================================================================================

``QuerySet.annotate()``, ``aggregate()``, and ``extra()`` methods were 
subject to SQL injection in column aliases, using a suitably crafted 
dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the
``**kwargs`` passed to these methods.

Thanks Splunk team: Preston Elder, Jacob Davis, Jacob Moore, Matt 
Hanson, David Briggs, and a security researcher: Danylo Dmytriiev 
(DDV_UA) for the report.

This issue has severity "high" according to the Django security policy.
