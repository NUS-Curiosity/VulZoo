/sigh

AMD changed the CVE in the bulletin between the final draft, and what
went public.

CVE-2022-23816 has been referenced by multiple other vendors too, so is
definitely out in the world.Â  Hopefully MITRE will close out one of
CVE-2022-23816 and CVE-2022-29900 as a dup of the other.

For now, I think the least confusing option is to keep both referenced.
