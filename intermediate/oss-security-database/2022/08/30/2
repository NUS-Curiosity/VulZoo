Subject: CVE-2022-31790 CVE-2022-31789: Watchguard XTM/Firebox firewalls:
 Multiple vulnerabilities

Hello,

While performing a red-team assessment we discovered a few 
vulnerabilities on Watchguard firewalls of the XTM/Firebox brand:

Here are the different CVEs and WSGA references for the bugs:

- Xpath time-based injection in wgcgi: CVE-2022-31790, WSGA-2022-00017
- Integer overflow leading to UAF/overflow in wgagent: CVE-2022-31789, 
WSGA-2022-00015
- Local privilege escalation from nobody to root: WSGA-2022-00018

Combined, the two latter bugs lead to pre-authentication remote code 
execution as root on XTM/Firebox devices.
Although the second bug is present in both XTM and Firebox models, the 
exploitation differs as the libc (ptmalloc) version is different, 
(respectively 2.19 and 2.28).
