SECURITY-2796 / CVE-2022-38663
Git Plugin 4.11.4 and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with
asterisks) credentials in the build log provided by the Git Username and
Password (`gitUsernamePassword`) credentials binding. Usernames are masked
instead of passwords in cases when usernames are not set to be treated as
secret.


SECURITY-2765 / CVE-2022-38664
Job Configuration History Plugin 1165.v8cc9fd1f4597 and earlier does not
escape the job name on the System Configuration History page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to configure job names.


SECURITY-2157 / CVE-2022-38665
CollabNet Plugins Plugin 2.0.8 and earlier stores a RabbitMQ password
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`hudson.plugins.collabnet.share.TeamForgeShare.xml` on the Jenkins
controller as part of its configuration.

This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller
file system.


SECURITY-2448 / CVE-2021-25738
Kubernetes Continuous Deploy Plugin 2.3.1 and earlier bundles a version of
Kubernetes Java Client library with the vulnerability CVE-2021-25738 that
does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of
arbitrary types.

This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by
users able to provide YAML input files to Kubernetes Continuous Deploy
Plugin's build step.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
