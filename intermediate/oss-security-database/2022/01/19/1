Subject: CVE-2021-45230: Apache Airflow: Creating DagRuns didn't respect
 Dag-level permissions in the Webserver 

Description:

This CVE applies to a specific case where a User who has "can_create" permissions on DAG Runs can create Dag Runs for dags that they don't have "edit" permissions for. 

This is a very low severity CVE and admins can mitigate this issue by removing the global "can_create" permissions on DagRun for Airflow versions >=2.0.0,<2.2.0 and 1.10.x versions that have set `rbac=True` in config.

Apache Airflow PMC would like to thank Franco Cano Erazo for reporting this issue.
