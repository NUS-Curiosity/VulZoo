I think this depends on how Debian is installed (e.g., keeping installer
defaults for a desktop system, or using a custom package selection).

The "policykit-1" containing pkexec is "optional" and thus not present
in all Debian installations:

    $ lsb_release -d ; apt-cache show policykit-1 | grep Priority
    Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
    Priority: optional
    Priority: optional

    $ lsb_release -d ; apt-cache show policykit-1 | grep Priority
    Description:	Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)
    Priority: optional
    Priority: optional

Best regards,
Erik
