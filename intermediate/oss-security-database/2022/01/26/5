Subject: Re: pwnkit: Local Privilege Escalation in polkit's
 pkexec (CVE-2021-4034)

Exploit by blasty attached (also at: 
https://haxx.in/files/blasty-vs-pkexec.c).

PS: Untested because my Debian machine doesn't contain pkexec, even 
though Qualy's advisory says it is by default on Debian.

PS2: Since vuln is trivially exploitable other exploits will arise for 
sure. Well, indeed there are already other exploits. (eg: 
https://github.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034).

Cheers,
