Thanks for informing oss-security of these issues, but good security
announcements have a little more detail, like what actions users or
distributors need to take (upgrade to a new version?  what version?)
and information on where to find more details, like a bug id in your
bug tracker.  If you look at the announcements from other Apache
projects, you'll see they often include those.

Some good examples:
