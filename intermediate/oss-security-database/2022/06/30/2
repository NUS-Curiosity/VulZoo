Hi all,

I'm attaching Norbert's exploit (lpe.c) that was attached to his May 12
notification to linux-distros.  We're now one month past the due date
for Norbert's expected posting of this (should have been May 27, which
is 7 days after public disclosure of the vulnerability on oss-security).

Norbert, I would still appreciate a reply to the message below.  I'm
quoting it in full for context since it's been a month.

Thanks,

Alexander
