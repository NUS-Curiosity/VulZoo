Subject: CVE-2022-28615: Apache HTTP Server: Read beyond bounds in
 ap_strcmp_match() 

Severity: low

Description:

Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose information due to a read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input buffer.  While no code distributed with the server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected.

Credit:

The Apache HTTP Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue
