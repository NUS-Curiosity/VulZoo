Per oss-security list content guidelines, actual vulnerability detail
must be included in postings (message body or text/plain attachment).

I've attached a text export of the above web page to this message.
(I did not bother doing the same for the operational notifications.)

Michael, I'd appreciate it if you start including such detail in your
oss-security postings.  Including the links as well is great (such as
for easy access to updated revisions while the links work); including
only links is discouraged.

Thanks,

Alexander
