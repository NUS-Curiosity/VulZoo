Subject: CVE-2018-8023: A remote attacker can exploit a vulnerability in the
 JWT implementation to gain unauthenticated access to Mesos Executor HTTP API.

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Mesos 1.4.0 to 1.6.0
The unsupported Apache Mesos pre-1.4.0 releases may be also affected.

Description:
Apache Mesos can be configured to require authentication to call the
Executor HTTP API using JSON Web Token (JWT). The comparison of the
generated HMAC value against the provided signature in the JWT
implementation used is vulnerable to a timing attack because instead
of a constant-time string comparison routine a standard `==` operator
has been used. A malicious actor can therefore abuse the timing
difference of when the JWT validation function returns to reveal the
correct HMAC value.

Mitigation:
pre-1.4.x users should upgrade to at least 1.4.2
1.4.x users should upgrade to 1.4.2
1.5.x users should upgrade to 1.5.2
1.6.0 users should upgrade to 1.6.1
1.7.0-dev users should obtain Mesos 1.7.0
