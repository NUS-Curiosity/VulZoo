Subject: Information on file, sqlite, libarchive, pcre issues for CVE IDs
 assigned by Apple?

Hi,
Apple has assigned a few CVE IDs for open source components not engineered at Apple:

  CVE-2017-13816: found by OSS-Fuzz

file
  Available for: macOS Sierra 10.12.6, OS X El Capitan 10.11.6

Of the IDs mentioned above, only CVE-2017-10989 refers to specific, identifiable information.
Does anyone on the list have additional information on any of these bugs; allowing to map them
to upstream bug reports/patches?

Why does the Apple CNA have a mandate to assign CVE IDs to generic FLOSS components not
written by Apple to begin with? Especially if they're not participating in standard open source
security information sharing practices.

Cheers,
        Moritz
