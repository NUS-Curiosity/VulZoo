======================================================================

1) Affected Software
 
Linux Kernel versions 4.1.x prior 4.1.49, 4.4.x prior to 4.4.114, 4.9.x
prior to 4.9.71, and 4.14.x prior to 4.14.8.
 
======================================================================

2) Severity
 
Rating: Less critical
Impact: DoS (Denial of Service)
Where:  Local Area Network
 
======================================================================

3) Description of Vulnerabilities
 
Secunia Research has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Linux Kernel,
which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of
Service).
 
An error in the "get_pipe()" function (drivers/usb/usbip/stub_rx.c) can be
exploited to cause an out-of-bounds read memory access and subsequently
trigger a BUG() failure and a kernel crash by sending a specially crafted
USB over IP packet.
 
An error in the "stub_recv_cmd_submit()" function
(drivers/usb/usbip/stub_rx.c) when handling CMD_SUBMIT packets can be
exploited to trigger an arbitrary memory allocation and subsequently cause a
kernel crash by sending a specially crafted USB over IP packet.
 
These vulnerabilities are confirmed in version 4.14.0-rc1 and reported in
versions 4.4.x prior to 4.4.114, 4.9.x prior to 4.9.71, and 4.14.x prior to
4.14.8. Other versions may also be affected.
 
An error in the "stub_send_ret_submit()" function
(drivers/usb/usbip/stub_tx.c) can be exploited to trigger a NULL pointer
dereference and subsequently cause a kernel crash by sending a specially
crafted USB over IP packet.
 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires USB over IP daemon
(usbipd) to be running.
 
This vulnerability is confirmed in version 4.14.0-rc1 and reported in
versions 4.1.x prior 4.1.49, 4.4.x prior to 4.4.107, 4.9.x prior to 4.9.71,
and 4.14.x prior to 4.14.8. Other versions may also be affected.
 
======================================================================

4) Solution
 
Update to version 4.1.49, 4.4.114, 4.9.71, or 4.14.8.

The Flexera CNA has assigned the CVE-2017-16912, CVE-2017-16913, and
CVE-2017-16914 identifiers for the vulnerabilities through the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project.

8) About Flexera
 
Flexera helps application producers and enterprises increase application
usage and the value they derive from their software.
 
http://www.flexera.com
 
Flexera delivers market-leading Software Vulnerability Management solutions
enabling enterprises to proactively identify and remediate software
vulnerabilities, effectively reducing the risk of costly security breaches.
 
https://www.flexera.com/enterprise/products/
 
Flexera supports and contributes to the community in several ways. We have
always believed that reliable vulnerability intelligence and tools to aid
identifying and fixing vulnerabilities should be freely available for
consumers to ensure that users, who care about their online privacy and
security, can stay secure.
Only a few vendors address vulnerabilities in a proper way and help users
get updated and stay secure. End-users (whether private individuals or
businesses) are otherwise left largely alone, and that is why back in 2002,
Secunia Research started investigating, coordinating disclosure and
verifying software vulnerabilities.
In 2016, Secunia Research became a part of Flexera and today our in-house
software vulnerability research remains the core of the Software
Vulnerability Management products at Flexera.

The public Secunia Advisory database contains information for researchers,
security enthusiasts, and consumers to lookup individual products and
vulnerabilities and assess, whether they need to take any actions to secure
their systems or whether a given vulnerability has already been discovered
