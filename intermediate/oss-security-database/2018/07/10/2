Subject: [Annoucement] CVE-2018-1337 Plaintext Password Disclosure in Secured Channel

CVE-2018-1337: Plaintext Password Disclosure in Secured Channel

Severity: Critical

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache LDAP API 1.0.0

Description:
A bug in the way the SSL Filter was setup made it possible for
another thread to use the connection before the TLS layer has been
established, if the connection has already been used and put back
in a pool of connections, leading to leaking any informations
contained in this request (including the credentials when sending
a BIND request)

Mitigation:

Users are urged to use this 1.0.2 version ASAP. There is no impact
in their application, the API remains unchanged.

The previous version (LDAP API 1.0.1) was a workaround for this
problem.

History:
2018-05-15 Original advisory

Credit:
This issue has been reported by Wei Deng (Datastax), the initial
workaround was proposed by Mike Adamson (Datastax) and the further
investigations/tests/verification were conducted by Wei Deng,
Mike Adamson, Jeremiah Kordan (Datastax) and Ben Coverston (Datastax).
