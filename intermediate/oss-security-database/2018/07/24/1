Subject: [CVE-2018-10906] libfuse: restriction bypass of the "allow_other" option
 when SELinux is active

Hi,

I've just released updated versions of libfuse 2.x and libfuse 3.x that fix CVE-2018-10906.

Jann Horn discovered that it is possible to bypass fusermount's restrictions on the use of the "allow_other" mount option as follows if SELinux is active. fusermount is a (typically setuid) helper for mounting FUSE file systems.

Best,
-Nikolaus
