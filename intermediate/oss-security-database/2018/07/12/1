Subject: CVE-2018-1334 Apache Spark local privilege escalation vulnerability

Severity: High

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions affected:
Spark versions through 2.1.2
Spark 2.2.0 to 2.2.1
Spark 2.3.0

Description:
In Apache Spark up to and including 2.1.2, 2.2.0 to 2.2.1, and 2.3.0, when
using PySpark or SparkR, it's possible for a different local user to
connect to the Spark application and impersonate the user running the Spark
application.

Mitigation:
1.x, 2.0.x, and 2.1.x users should upgrade to 2.1.3 or newer
2.2.x users should upgrade to 2.2.2 or newer
2.3.x users should upgrade to 2.3.1 or newer
Otherwise, affected users should avoid using PySpark and SparkR in
multi-user environments.
