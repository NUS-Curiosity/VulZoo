Subject: CVE-2018-8009: Apache Hadoop distributed cache archive vulnerability

CVE-2018-8009: Apache Hadoop distributed cache archive vulnerability

Severity: Severe

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
  Hadoop 0.23.0 to 0.23.11
  Hadoop 2.0.0-alpha to 2.7.6
  Hadoop 2.8.0 to 2.8.4
  Hadoop 2.9.0 to 2.9.1
  Hadoop 3.0.0-alpha to 3.0.2
  Hadoop 3.1.0

Users affected: User running the YARN NodeManager daemon and YARN
users that leverage public archives in the distributed cache

Impact: Vulnerability allows a cluster user to publish a public
archive that can affect other files owned by the user running the YARN
NodeManager daemon. If the impacted files belong to another already
localized, public archive on the node then code can be injected into
the jobs of other cluster users using the public archive.

Mitigation: Users should upgrade to Apache Hadoop 2.7.7, 2.8.5, 2.9.2,
3.0.3, or 3.1.1.
