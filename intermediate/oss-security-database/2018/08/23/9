Thanks.  We have a policy here that the actual content must be in the
message, not only included by reference.  Luckily, Qualys already
brought some detail in here, but nevertheless I'm also attaching a text
export of your blog post.  Next time you post, please take care of this
on your own (if relevant).

"At least the most essential part of your message (e.g., vulnerability
detail and/or exploit) should be directly included in the message itself
(and in plain text), rather than only included by reference to an
external resource.  Posting links to relevant external resources as well
is acceptable, but posting only links is not.  Your message should
remain valuable even with all of the external resources gone."

As it relates to the actual issue (and past issues, which had to do with
the password hashing step being skipped or done differently), I'd like
to note that username enumeration will generally remain possible via
finer and more numerous timing measurements, primarily because user
lookup with getpwnam(3) and such is generally not timing-safe.  Fixing
some of these issues, we're just making username enumeration harder,
slower, and less reliable.  These are fine goals and it's great that
specific fixable issues are getting fixed, but I do see why the OpenSSH
team wouldn't formally treat this as a vulnerability.  OTOH, easy
username enumeration issues were treated as vulnerabilities (although
maybe not by upstreams, I just don't recall) at least for proftpd and
vsftpd (these got CVE IDs for such issues in 2004), and probably more.
