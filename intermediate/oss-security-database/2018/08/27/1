Subject: CVE-2018-10938: Linux kernel: net: infinite loop in
 net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c:cipso_v4_optptr() allows a remote DoS

Heololo,

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel present since v4.0-rc1 and through v4.13-rc4.
A crafted network packet sent remotely by an attacker may force the kernel to enter
an infinite loop in the cipso_v4_optptr() function in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c leading
to a denial-of-service.

All the kernels with the cipso_v4_optptr() function which have not backported
the upstream commit 40413955ee26 are vulnerable.

Thanks to Yves Younan from Cisco for mentioning this.
