As I understand the process this "released" is the point where the
embargo ceases.

If the agreed embargo time was not already over the vendor is
responsible for having "broken" the embargo. So this release should not
have happened prior to the agreed embargo time.

Broken or not it is over now.

As the embargo was ended as per above, these types of thing are not blocked.

Secondary patches are only affected if found while waiting to release
the embargoed changes. In which case there is either nothing released to
clients needing it, or it is an independent bug that should be able to
publish a fix without reference to the embargoed issue.
