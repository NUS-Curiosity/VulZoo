Subject: [CVE-2018-11771] Apache Commons Compress 1.7 to 1.17 denial of service vulnerability

CVE-2018-11771: Apache Commons Compress 1.7 to 1.17 denial of service vulnerability

Severity: Low

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Commons Compress 1.7 to 1.17

Description:
When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, the read method of
ZipArchiveInputStream can fail to return the correct EOF indication
after the end of the stream has been reached.  When combined with a
java.io.InputStreamReader this can lead to an infinite stream, which
can be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that
use Compress' zip package.

Mitigation:
Commons Compress users should upgrade to 1.18 or later
