Subject: Re: Own on install. How grave it is?

Many OS installs/etc take a password during install, either manually
(e.g. prompting you at the command line), or the OS is installed using
tools that allow a password to be set (e.g. Red Hat kickstarter,
Satellite, CloudForms).

In general if an OS install does NOT give you any way to set a
password during install and forces you to install the product, boot it
and then login with blank credentials and set a password you end up
with a CVE since a network based attacker can easily win that race, a
good example being FreeNAS CVE-2014-5334. If the installer can prompt
for a password or take a password through other means (e.g.
kickstarter) than there's a safe option so no CVE is needed typically.
