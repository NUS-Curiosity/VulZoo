Team Debian has found an issue with our patch. Dovecot login process would crash after few minutes of idle after consecutive aborted logins.

This is fixed with https://github.com/dovecot/core/commit/a9b135760aea6d1790d447d351c56b78889dac22.patch

We would like to thank Apollon and Salvatore for raising this to our attention.
