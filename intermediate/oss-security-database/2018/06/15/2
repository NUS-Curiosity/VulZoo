For the record, this is https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00145.html
aka CVE-2018-3665 with codename "Lazy FPU Save/Restore".

XEN advisory https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-267.html was posted here too, describing it a bit better.

Full details are planned to be released June 27th.

Ciao, Marcus
