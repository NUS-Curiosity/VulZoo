Thanks, fixed.

Yes. I did two weeks of due diligence on the important package managers,
Git, and anything I could think of that is critical. But I am not saying
what I looked at, because there might be something I missed, and I want
everybody to join in and have a fresh look. It is too much for a single
person.

I didn't know about Debian code search, so thanks for the tip.

You reporting these? If not, I can do it.
