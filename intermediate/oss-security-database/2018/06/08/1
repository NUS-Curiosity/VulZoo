Subject: CVE-2018-1000204: Linux kernel 3.18 to 4.16 infoleak due to incorrect
 handling of SG_IO ioctl

Hi all,

Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 incorrectly handles an SG_IO ioctl
on /dev/sg0 (or any other SCSI device) with
dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp.
This may lead to copying up to 1000 kernel heap pages to the userspace.
See the PoC exploit attached.

This bug has been fixed in the upstream kernel already:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a45b599ad808c3c982fdcdc12b0b8611c2f92824,
and CVE-2018-1000204 has been assigned to it.

The problem has limited scope, as users don't usually have permissions
to access SCSI devices. On the other hand, e.g. the Nero user manual
suggests doing `chmod o+r+w /dev/sg*` to make the devices accessible.
