Subject: CVE-2018-8025 on Apache HBase

CVE-2018-8025 describes an issue in Apache HBase that affects the 
optional "Thrift 1" API server when running over HTTP. There is a 
race-condition which could lead to authenticated sessions being 
incorrectly applied to users, e.g. one authenticated user would be 
considered a different user or an unauthenticated user would be treated 
as an authenticated user.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-20664 implements a fix for 
this issue, and this fix is contained in the following releases of 
Apache HBase:

* 1.2.6.1
* 1.3.2.1
* 1.4.5
* 2.0.1

This vulnerability affects all 1.x and 2.x release lines (except 1.0.0).
