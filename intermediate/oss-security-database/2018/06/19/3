Subject: CVE-2018-12558: DOS in perl module Email::Address

Hello!

Perl module Email::Address, also in the last version 1.909 is vulnerable
to Algorithm Complexity problem and can cause Denial of Service when
attacker prepares specially crafted input. Root of this problem is that
parsing of email addresses in Email::Address module is done by regular
expressions, which in perl can be exponential.

The trivial input is 30 form-fields characters. You can test it with
following oneliner:

$ perl -MEmail::Address -E 'Email::Address->parse("\f" x 30)'

Vulnerable are all applications which receive (untrusted) emails and
parse address headers (From/To/Cc/...) by Email::Address module. Such
application can be DOSed by sending email with 30 form-fields characters
in From or To header.

Note that this is not the only one problematic input, due to way how is
Email::Address implemented it should be possible to prepare more
non-trivial inputs.

This problem was already reported to Debian Security Team and they
suggested to ask MITRE for assigning CVE identifier. MITRE now assigned
CVE-2018-12558.
