Subject: ISC has disclosed two vulnerabilities in BIND 9.12 (CVE-2018-5736,
 CVE-2018-5737)

ISC has disclosed two vulnerabilities today, CVE-2018-5736
and CVE-2018-5736.  Both vulnerabilities affect only releases
in the BIND 9.12 branch (that is:  9.12.0 and 9.12.1.)
Releases in other branches (such as 9.9, 9.10, 9.11) are not affected.

To address these issues a new security release of BIND, 9.12.1-P2,
has been issued.

BIND 9.12.1-P2 can be found via the ISC software download page:
