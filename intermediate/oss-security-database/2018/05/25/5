No, syzkaller/syzbot runs programs in a user namespace, so any distro
that allows unprivileged users to create user namespaces (e.g. Ubuntu)
is vulnerable to most of the bugs syzbot finds.

But nevertheless all those bugs need to be checked whether they
actually are security flaws, and that requires quite a lot of effort.

OK, if the process was like that for the rest of those bugs, that
explains a somewhat random selection of syzbot bugs for which CVEs
were assigned :)

Thanks!
