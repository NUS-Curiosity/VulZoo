Subject: Apache ORC 1.5.0 and 1.4.4 Released

All,
   This week we released two releases ORC 1.5.0 and ORC 1.4.4. The 1.5
release adds some great new features:

   - New C++ Writer
   - Support for variable length HDFS blocks
   - CSV to ORC converter
   - Much faster decimal implementation for precision <= 18 digits
   - Support for building C++ library on Microsoft Visual C++.
   - Support for older versions of Hadoop (all of the way back to 2.2.x)

For more details, please see
https://orc.apache.org/news/2018/05/14/ORC-1.5.0/ .

These releases also fix a denial of service vulnerability. Users are
encouraged to update.

# CVE-2018-8015: Apache ORC denial of service vulnerability

## Severity:

Medium

## Vendor:

[The Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org)

## Versions Affected:

* ORC 1.0.0 to 1.4.3

## Description:

A malformed ORC file can trigger an endlessly recursive function call in the
C++ or Java parser.

The impact of this bug is most likely denial-of-service against software
that
uses the ORC file parser. With the C++ parser, the stack overflow might
possibly corrupt the stack.

## Mitigation:

* 1.3.x and 1.4.x users should upgrade to 1.4.4.
* 1.0.x to 1.2.x users should apply ORC-360 (Java) and ORC-313 (C++).

## Example:

An ORC file with a struct, union, array, or map type that includes itself as
a child will cause the parser to infinitely recurse until the stack
overflows.
