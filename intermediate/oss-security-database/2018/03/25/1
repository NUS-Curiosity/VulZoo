Perhaps I'm hitting an outdated mirror (195.154.151.36), but this page
lists "OptionsBleed" as the most recent CVE, and the download page shows
2.4.29 as the latest release.

I found 2.4.33 by browsing my suggested mirror "manually", but it does
not have the PGP signatures.

https://apache.uib.no/httpd/

I had to go to <https://www-eu.apache.org/dist/httpd/> in order to
verify the integrity.

Please look into it, and thanks for the notices.
