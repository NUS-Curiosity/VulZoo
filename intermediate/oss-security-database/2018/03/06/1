Subject: CVE-2018-1066 : kernel - CIFS - Null pointer dereference in ntlmv2
 response client crash.

Gday,

Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that there was a flaw in the CIFS client
implementation in kernel that could cause a null pointer dereference
and panic the a Linux CIFS client.  It would require the server to
implement the CIFS protocol incorrectly or momentarily impersonate the
CIFS server during session recovery (such as when the server was shut
down, or the network conditions were bad). The attacker would need to
return an empty "TargetInfo" in the NTLMSSP setup negotiation response
causing the null pointer dereference when interpreted by the client.
