CVE-2017-15715: <FilesMatch> bypass with a trailing newline in the file name

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29

Description:
The expression specified in <FilesMatch> could match '$' to a newline character
in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the filename.
This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are are
externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.

Mitigation:
All httpd users should upgrade to 2.4.30 or later.
