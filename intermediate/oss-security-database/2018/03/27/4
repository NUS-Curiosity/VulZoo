Subject: CVE-2018-1091: Linux kernel: a KVM guest kernel crash during core
 dump on POWER9 host

Hello,

A guest kernel crash can be triggered from unprivileged userspace during core
dump on POWER host due to a missing processor feature check and an erroneous
use of transactional memory (TM) instructions in the core dump path leading to
a denial of service.
