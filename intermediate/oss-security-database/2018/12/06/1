   Hello,

A flaw was found in qemu Media Transfer Protocol (MTP). A path traversal in 
the in usb_mtp_write_data function in hw/usb/dev-mtp.c due to an improper 
filename sanitization. When the guest device is mounted in read-write mode, 
this allows to read/write arbitrary files which may lead do DoS scenario OR 
possibly lead to code execution on the host.
