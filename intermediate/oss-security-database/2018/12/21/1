Subject: sqlite: CVE-2018-20346: integer overflow (resulting in buffer
 overflow) for FTS3 queries

Hi

MITRE has assigned CVE-2018-20346 for the "Magellan" called vulnerabilities.
The description in the CVE database reads as:

> SQLite before 3.25.3, when the FTS3 extension is enabled, encounters
> an integer overflow (and resultant buffer overflow) for FTS3 queries
> that occur after crafted changes to FTS3 shadow tables, allowing
> remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging the ability
> to run arbitrary SQL statements (such as in certain WebSQL use cases),
> aka Magellan.
