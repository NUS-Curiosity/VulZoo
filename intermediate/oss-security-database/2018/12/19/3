Subject: CVE-2018-20125 QEMU: pvrdma: null dereference or excessive memory
 allocation when creating QP/CQ

   Hello,

A Null pointer dereference issue was found in QEMU's implementation of 
VMWare's paravirtual RDMA device. It could occur while creating CQ/QP ring 
objects in pvrdma_ring_init() routine.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash QEMU process or allocate 
excessive memory on host resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:

   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg02823.html

This issue was reported by Li Qiang.

Thank you.
