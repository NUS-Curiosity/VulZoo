Subject: Additional context information about RedHat's announcement of
 CVE-2018-5742

Hello --

Internet Systems Consortium would like to provide packagers and
redistributors of our software some additional context concerning
CVE-2018-5742, which was announced yesterday by RedHat, affecting
some BIND packages in RedHat and CentOS.

Their disclosure of the issue can be found via this page:

  https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-5742

and more information can be found in their respective bug trackers:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-5742
  https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=15528

The RedHat announcement is understandably focused mostly on the
impact to customers using their packages, but because some of the
other subscribers to this list distribute their own packages that
are based on BIND we thought it might be helpful to provide some
additional information about this CVE.

1)  The issue does not exist in any of the BIND source packages
    provided directly by ISC.

2)  We have worked with RedHat to determine the root cause of
    CVE-2018-5742 and have concluded that it was introduced
    accidentally while backporting the Negative Trust Anchor (NTA)
    feature to a branch of BIND prior to when it was introduced
    in the upstream (ISC) version.  We would therefore advise
    any other packagers who have backported NTA to the BIND 9.9
    or 9.10 codebase that they might want to investigate to see whether
    they have similarly introduced a vulnerability in their code.
    If you find that you have done so, please contact
    security-officer@....org, as ISC are the CVE Numbering Authority
    for BIND and we will need to be included in the discussion
    as to whether any such vulnerabilities fall under CVE-2018-5742
    or require a separate CVE ID assignment.

If you are distributing BIND packages and have further questions
we will do our best to answer them.

(as ISC Security Officer)
