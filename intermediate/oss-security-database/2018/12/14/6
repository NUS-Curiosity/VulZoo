Definitely.  But relatively few people build their own per-machine
kernels.  For many Linux distros, it's a choice of which base kernel to
use and maintain, and then they enable plenty of features that are in
any demand at all.

For someone doing their own kernel builds and bothering to spend time
deciding on every option, yes.  This was slightly time-consuming in the
2.0.x days.  Much more so later.  Probably unaffordable for most now.

Thank you for this impressive list!

It starts Apr 25 2016, which is before I'd have considered RHEL7 kernels
mature enough for purposes of this discussion.  Although it gets close.

I started to comment on some of these, but I don't want us to be
splitting hairs over old bugs that I don't have a perfect understanding
of, so I deleted my comments and will instead summarize:

In my first message in this thread I was focusing on issues
that are: high or critical overall severity (not all of yours are),
affect x86-64 kernel builds (although I didn't say so), and are fully
exposed in a typical distro.  A weird fs type isn't sufficiently exposed
even if compiled in, or if it is then I think that's a distro issue to
be fixed.  I assume it normally takes at least plugging in a USB thumb
drive or having privileges to be able to mount a rogue filesystem.

That's 3 low or medium severity, one non-x86-64, and one high+ severity
but slightly before my time range (let's say, latest one year).

That's 1 high+ severity (UAF via late TLB flush).  The other two feel
lower severity either because of lower impact (infoleak from the stack)
or obscure prerequisites (stack overflow via ecryptfs).

(Un)fortunately, RHEL7 has backports of some of these features - IIRC,
eBPF since RHEL 7.6, userfaultfd for a long time, user namespaces for a
long time but disabled by default.

If a feature is backported after it's had those bugs already found and
fixed upstream, then those bugs don't count against that distro kernel.

I could be wrong about some of the detail.  I mention it to illustrate
how non-trivial it is to consider even a small set of bugs like this wrt
different kernel versions and builds.

This also means that my analysis of Kees' data was relatively easy only
due to lack of detail (no vulnerability detail with that data, and no
"3.10 RHEL7" kernel in the illustration).

When each new high+ severity issue is found, what matters is whether it
affects the kernel (in the chosen branch or distro) patched against the
previous such issue or not.  We have no illustration on that.

Sure.  You and others should feel encouraged to identify such features
that are currently compile-time only but could be made possible to
enable/disable via sysctls and such, and contribute patches under KSPP
or otherwise.  Then maybe we'll see distros enable fewer questionable
features by default or/and more systems will have those features
disabled by sysadmins.

google.com has "p=reject", googlemail.com has "p=quarantine\;
sp=quarantine", gmail.com has "p=none\; sp=quarantine\".  I know that
mail from @gmail.com has been getting through via the list to recipients
on Gmail fine.  I don't yet know if @googlemail.com will work just as
well or not.  I hope it will.
