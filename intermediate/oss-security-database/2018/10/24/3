Additionally, this release was mainly to pick up two security fixes:

CVE-2018-11785:
- Missing authorization check in Apache Impala allows a
Kerberos-authenticated but unauthorized user to inject random data into a
running query, leading to wrong results for a query

CVE-2018-11792 (IMPALA-7502):
- ALTER TABLE/VIEW RENAME required ALTER on the old
table. This may pose a potential security risk, such as having ALTER on a
table and ALL on a particular database allows a user to move the table to a
database with ALL, which will automatically grant that user with ALL
privilege on that table due to the privilege inherited from the database
