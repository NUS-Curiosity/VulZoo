I keep wondering if there isn't a way to fully remove the dangerous
bits from a postscript interpreter so it can _only_ be used to view
the document and literally has no file system access compiled in at
all, so there's no way to touch the fs etc. regardless of what flags
the interpreter is invoked with.

(I, too, find removing the ability to look at historical postscript
documents a bit more draconian than I like.)
