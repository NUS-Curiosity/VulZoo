Is it actually the same issue? I'm asking because for instance, there
was indeed earlier CVE-2015-5621 and CVE-2018-1000116, which both were
adressed with this same commit, but are considered two separate
issues. So if CVE-2018-18066 is different from CVE-2015-5621 or
CVE-2018-1000116, the assignment would not be a duplicate.
