Subject: CVE-2018-12617 Qemu: qemu-guest-agent: Integer overflow in
 qmp_guest_file_read may lead to crash

   Hello,

The QEMU Guest Agent in QEMU is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the 
qmp_guest_file_read(). An attacker could exploit this by sending a crafted QMP 
command (including guest-file-read with a large count value) to the agent via 
the listening socket to trigger a g_malloc() call with a large memory chunk 
resulting in a segmentation fault.

A user could use this flaw to crash the Qemu-guest-agent resulting in DoS.

Upstream Patch:
   -> https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=141b197408ab398c4f474ac1a728ab316e921f2b

This issue was reported by Fakhri Zulkifli.

Thank you.
