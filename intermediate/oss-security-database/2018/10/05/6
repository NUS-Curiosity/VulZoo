It is.  Linking to temporary resources like Google Drive isn't great,
but luckily your message itself includes some detail.

Since you say that "leveraging root access to execute crafted
applications" is required, how is this a security issue?  Also, since
this setup has to be prepared locally, how is the attack "remote"?

In other words, would a sysadmin plausibly make this kind of custom
local setup, and why?  If the answer is no, then I think there's no
security issue here.
