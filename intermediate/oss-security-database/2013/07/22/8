Kurt's reply is a good reminder of why he needs that information. Based on 
the original post, some of these have assignments.

: Security fix: Do not show the reason for a failed login (i.e. "no such user")

Likely CVE-2013-1422 / OSVDB 90668

: Security fix: Escape HTML characters in category name.

Likely CVE-2013-1421 / OSVDB 90669

: Security fix: Check all passed in fields (either via HTML form or via
: URL parameter) for certain malicious tags (script, embed, etc.) and
: generate fatal error if found.

This one seems like it may be new.
