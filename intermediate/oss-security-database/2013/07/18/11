CVE-2013-4145 (XSS) is actually CVE-2012-2399. And, CVE-2013-4146
(CSRF) seems to be just the potential for CSRF via XSS -- don't think
this is a separate issue.

Neither of those are reproducible in
https://github.com/wordpress/secure-swfupload.

We're aware of CVE-2013-4144 and intend to fix it soon, but it's
really tough to classify "image injection" as a serious vulnerability
without there being any actual XSS there to further trick the user.

Thank you.
