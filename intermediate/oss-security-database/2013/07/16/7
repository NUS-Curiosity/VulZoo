Hi Jan et al.

Actually, issue #1's fix (CVE-2013-4132) just missed the 
tag/release 
deadline for 4.10.5 by a day or two. The FIXED-IN entry in the
revision comment is inaccurate.

Distribs, when upgrading to kde-workspace 4.10.5, should apply
https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kde-
workspace/repository/revisions/45b7f137fbc0b942fd2c9b4e8d8c1f0293e64
ba7.

Best,
