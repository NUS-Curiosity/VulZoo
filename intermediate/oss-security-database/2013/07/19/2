CVE-2013-2132 was already assigned to this issue in the Python driver:
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/05/31/6
https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-532
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-2132

While "your" CVE-2013-2132 refers to
https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-9878, which AFAICS is a different
issue.
