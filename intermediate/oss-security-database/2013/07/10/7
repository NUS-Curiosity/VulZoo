I'm wondering why you fail to reproduce this issue. I posted some 
details regarding my setup at the Nagios Tracker: 
http://tracker.nagios.org/view.php?id=456

Unfortunately Nagios upstream sometimes rather unresponsive. At least 
that's what I observed.

Please let me know if you need any further details regarding the bug or 
advice on how to reproduce it.

Kind regards,
