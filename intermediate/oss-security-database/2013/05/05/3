CVE-2013-1942 was assigned for jPlayer 2.2.19 XSS, which is included
in ownCloud (and possibly other things?).

> CVE-2013-2022 and CVE-2013-2023 on other side for jplayer itself?

CVE-2013-2022 is for jPlayer 2.2.20 XSS

CVE-2013-2023 is for jPlayer 2.2.23 XSS

So XSS's in 3 different versions of jPlayer.
