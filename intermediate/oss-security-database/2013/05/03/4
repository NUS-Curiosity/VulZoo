In [1] CVE-2013-1942 was assigned, referencing the same commit.

 [1] http://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=136570964825921&w=2

Should CVE-2013-1942 thus only be used for owncloud reference, and
CVE-2013-2022 and CVE-2013-2023 on other side for jplayer itself?

Thanks a lot in advance for clarification!

Regards,
Salvatore
