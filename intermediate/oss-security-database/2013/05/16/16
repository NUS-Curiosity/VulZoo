Kurt: just to be clear, joepie91's attack didn't require javascript or
link-clicking or anything of the kind, because it's an img src -- as
long as your browser loads images automatically from non-origin hosts,
it will trigger this behavior.

That said, I agree with Kurt's general assessment here: this kind of DoS
is the nicest possible thing an attacker can do with a CSRF.
