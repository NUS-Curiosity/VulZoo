The older CVE, CVE-2013-1463, is much more widely used than the newer CVE-2013-1808, which would argue for keeping the older CVE-2013-1463.  However, because that older CVE focuses on the wrong product, and CVE-2013-1808 is referenced in Red Hat's Bugzilla and thus "more authoritative," this would argue for keeping CVE-2013-1808.

I'm not sure if wp-table-reloaded used custom version of the zeroclipboard or
not, but by looking at the checksums so did other plugins too. Let's REJECT
CVE-2013-1463 and use CVE-2013-1808.
