SA-CONTRIB-2013-094   CVE-2013-7064

Note that this says 'The module doesn't sufficiently fiter [sic] and
validate configuration values entered by administrators. This
vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a
role with the permission "Administer EU Cookie Compliance popup".' Our
perspective is that, typically, web applications do not have a threat
model in which crafted configuration settings entered by admins are a
vector that qualifies for a CVE assignment. You, in the context of
representing the "vendor" of the module, are allowed to have that
threat model if you want to. (This is entirely reasonable if an XSS
attack would realistically result in privilege escalation to a
higher-level admin account.) If you want to reconsider, we can
optionally reject this CVE for you. Otherwise, it will remain a valid
(and non-disputed) CVE.
