That's not consistent with guidance I've seen in the past - if update
is released claiming to fix some issue without actually fixing it, new
CVE is needed.  Not doing so leads to inconsistent security update data
with two different updates or package versions of the same component
being listed as fixing the same CVE.  Release text can probably explain
id reuse, and consider it sufficient for human consumption, but it's
probably more upsetting to tools processing machine readable versions
of update notifications (e.g. OVAL).

Yes, I can agree with that.  Previous patch makes it more difficult for
MITM attacker to perform their attack, as they can no longer intercept
all connections, but they need to let certain connections pass through
and intercept other.

As mentioned above, I believe the fact that 0.9 was previously
announced to fix CVE-2013-2073 should be sufficient to trigger new CVE
assignment regardless of how incomplete the original fix is.

Thank you!
