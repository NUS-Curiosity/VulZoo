Subject: [OSSA 2013-037] Nova compute DoS through ephemeral disk backing files
 (CVE-2013-6437)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-037
CVE: CVE-2013-6437
Date: December 18, 2013
Title: Nova compute DoS through ephemeral disk backing files
Reporter: Phil Day (HP)
Products: Nova
Affects: All supported versions

Description:
Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in the libvirt driver handling
of ephemeral disk backing files on Nova compute nodes. By repeatedly
creating snapshots, changing the os_type to a new random value, and
spawning new instances from the snapshot (and quickly deleting those
instances), an authenticated user could generate lots of different
ephemeral disk backing files and fill up compute node disks, potentially
resulting in a Denial of Service against a Nova setup. Only Nova setups
running the libvirt driver are affected.
