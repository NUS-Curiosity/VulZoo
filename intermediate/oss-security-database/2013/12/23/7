Relative to CVE-2013-7108, Nagios changed two files that Icinga did
not change. If the additional changes are vulnerability fixes, we will
assign two more CVE IDs. (The vulnerability types would not be the
same.) We are currently coordinating with Icinga upstream on this. In
any case, CVE-2013-7108 will represent a set of off-by-one error
issues that are common to Icinga and Nagios, and were all announced at
the same time. CVE-2013-7108 is not specific to only Icinga.
