A small side note on this CVE: David Bremner found that gitolite
previous to that commit also was vulnerable to a local filesystem
information leak: Depending on the user umask running gitolite setup,
he might create world readable files in the repositories, in
particular the gitolite-admin one.

As example in the Debian packaging postinst, [1] would result in a
world-readable /var/lib/gitolite3/repositories/gitolite-admin.git.

 [1] http://sources.debian.net/src/gitolite3/3.5.2-1/debian/postinst#L74

But this actually might not need a separate CVE for this issue
(altough different versions are affected, if I understand it correctly
both fall under CWE-276, Incorrect Default Permissions?).

Salvatore
