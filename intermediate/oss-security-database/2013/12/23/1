Uhmm but they aren't security issues, they are mistakes (usually
either duplicate or issues that turn out not to be a security
vulnerability). As well some of these issues (in this case both I
think) are still under embargo/not public so I can't always release
details when they are being publicly rejected.

This part I don't really understand. If you want to see what security
related bugs Red Hat products have you can simply search our BZ for
products and use look for the  keyword "Security". Not clear what
looking up CVE's that have been rejected due to errors/etc. has to do
with this?
