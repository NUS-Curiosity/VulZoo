Subject: [OSSA 2013-032] Keystone trust circumvention through EC2-style
 tokens (CVE-2013-6391)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-032
CVE: CVE-2013-6391
Date: December 11, 2013
Title: Keystone trust circumvention through EC2-style tokens
Reporter: Steven Hardy (Red Hat)
Products: Keystone
Affects: Havana and later

Description:
Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Keystone
trusts when used in conjunction with the ec2tokens API. By
generating EC2 credentials using a trust-scoped token, a trustee may
retrieve a token not scoped to the trust, therefore elevating
privileges to all of the trustor's roles. Only Keystone setups
enabling EC2-style authentication are affected.

Icehouse (development branch) fix:
https://review.openstack.org/61419

Havana fix:
https://review.openstack.org/61425

Notes:
This fix will be included in the icehouse-2 development milestone
and in a future 2013.2.1 release.
