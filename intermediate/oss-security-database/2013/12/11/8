Title: Metadata queries from Neutron to Nova are not restricted by tenant

Description:
Aaron Rosen from VMware reported a vulnerability in the metadata
access from OpenStack Neutron to Nova. Because of a missing
authorization check on port binding, by guessing an instance_id a
tenant may retrieve another tenant's metadata resulting in
information disclosure. Only OpenStack setups running
neutron-metadata-agent are affected.
