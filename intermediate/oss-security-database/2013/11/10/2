> For OpenVAS Manager, this is a security release addressing a serious
> security bug and it is highly recommended to update any installation of
> OpenVAS Manager 3.0 and 4.0 with the corresponding release.

> A software bug in OpenVAS Manager allowed an attacker to bypass the OMP
> authentication procedure. The attack vector was remotely available in
> case OpenVAS Manager was listening on a public network interface. In
> case of successful attack, the attacker gained partial rights to execute
> OMP commands.  The bypass authentication was, however, incomplete and
> several OMP commands failed to execute properly.

Use CVE-2013-6765.

Use CVE-2013-6766.

Apparently a discloser will provide technical details at a later date.
