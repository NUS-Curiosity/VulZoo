Subject: [OSSA 2013-030] XenAPI security groups not kept through migrate or
 resize (CVE-2013-4497)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-030
CVE: CVE-2013-4497
Date: November 14, 2013
Title: XenAPI security groups not kept through migrate or resize
Reporter: Chris Behrens (Rackspace) and Vangelis Tasoulas
Products: Nova
Affects: All supported versions prior to Havana

Description:
Chris Behrens with Rackspace and Vangelis Tasoulas reported a set of
vulnerabilities in OpenStack Nova's XenAPI hypervisor backend. When
migrating or resizing an instance, including live migration,
existing security groups may not be reapplied after the operation
completes. This can lead to unintentional network exposure for
virtual machines. Only setups using the XenAPI backend are affected.

The Havana release (2013.2) is not affected.

Grizzly fixes (will be included in a future stable point release):
