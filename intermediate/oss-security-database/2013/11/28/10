Subject: CVE Request: adequate: privilege escalation via tty hijacking

Hi Kurt,

I would like to request a CVE for an issue with 'adequate':

 http://bugs.debian.org/730691 (adequate: privilege escalation via tty
 hijacking):

----cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut-----
Package: adequate
Version: 0.4
Severity: serious
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

If root uses the --user option, then the user can hijack the tty with
the 
TIOCSTI ioctl.

This is similar to CVE-2005-4890.

Fix for this was commited at:

 https://bitbucket.org/jwilk/adequate/commits/94e5fc5d810057bffb673501ed809f7c2dabd9ee

Could a CVE be assigned to this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
