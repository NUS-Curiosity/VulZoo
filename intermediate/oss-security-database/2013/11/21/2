             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-6375 / XSA-78
                              version 2

           Insufficient TLB flushing in VT-d (iommu) code

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

This issue has been assigned CVE-2013-6375.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

An inverted boolean parameter resulted in TLB flushes not happening
upon clearing of a present translation table entry.  Retaining stale
TLB entries could allow guests access to memory that ought to have
been revoked, or grant greater access than intended.

IMPACT
======

Malicious guest administrators might be able to cause host-wide denial
of service, or escalate their privilege to that of the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.2.x and later are vulnerable.
Xen 4.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.

Only systems using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices to untrusted guests on
systems supporting Intel VT-d.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

This issue was disclosed publicly on the xen-devel mailing list.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.
