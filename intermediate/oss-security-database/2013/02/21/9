I further know about the wikipage with the ChangeLog, but there is no
patch referenced (thus the forum post). It's here:

 [1] http://www.zoneminder.com/wiki/index.php/Change_History

But I have not read trough yet, to see if there are more changes
indicating some security implication. For the one of my request there
was only

FIX - Fixed Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. Please note a
patch for this is also available for 1.24.4 which the 1.24.4 tarball
also contains for recent downloads.

I can check indeed if I find more. The the forum post for
CVE-2013-0232 there is still no answer from upstream[2]
