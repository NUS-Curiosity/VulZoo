cc'ing cve-assign to see if they can provide some guidance here.  I also
noticed that OpenSSL has a CVE for this (I'm assuming that the
CVE-2012-2686 issue is _not_ the same thing, but that CVE-2013-0169 is
this issue).

Since it's a weakness in TLS/DTLS itself, from my understanding, and not
necessarily in a particular implementation, I'm not sure if this
qualifies as one CVE for the weakness, or if it needs one per
implementation.

MITRE, can someone provide some guidance on this?
