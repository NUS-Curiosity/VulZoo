Subject: RE: WordPress plugins vulnerable to CVE-2013-1808

Henri,

It appears that CVE-2013-1463 was previously assigned to an issue that was claimed to exist in WP-Table Reloaded and fixed by that module developer, but the attack vector involves the id parameter to js/tabletools/zeroclipboard.swf, so this is likely a duplicate.  Can you confirm?

If this is a duplicate, we have an unusual situation for how to resolve it.  The older CVE, CVE-2013-1463, is much more widely used than the newer CVE-2013-1808, which would argue for keeping the older CVE-2013-1463.  However, because that older CVE focuses on the wrong product, and CVE-2013-1808 is referenced in Red Hat's Bugzilla and thus "more authoritative," this would argue for keeping CVE-2013-1808.
