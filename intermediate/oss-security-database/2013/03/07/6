Subject: RE: CVE Requests (maybe): Linux kernel: various info
 leaks, some NULL ptr derefs

This is a major challenge for CVE, but to do bug-based assignments will make CVE too dependent on the amount of vulnerability details that are available at the time of a CVE request - and those details vary widely.  While it is a problem for the distros, I have generally had the perspective that it is ultimately their responsibility to track which portions of a CVE are fixed, and when.

Note - the more fundamental problem here is that CVE is being used much earlier in the disclosure process than it used to be, and it's basically being used as a universal bug ID.  I strongly encourage the Linux community to consider adopting their own ID scheme.

I made comments similar to this a couple years ago, but I can't easily find the reference right now.

I think this is wrong.  I would understand if those issues were all in
the same subsystem at least (or if you assigned per-subsystem CVE IDs
for these), but this is not the case.  Many distros will fix some, but
not the others, or not all at the same time.  There's room for a little
bit of bundling here, but not that much.
