Agreed (I was wrong, not much more to say than that =). It sounds like
Mitre will be handling the additional CVEs for this issue as I
understand it.

Now my question is how concise do we go with the Linux kernel as far
as subsystems go? E.g. file subsystem vs network subsystem seems
obvious, and say ext4 vs. MSDOS file system code seems obvious but
what about network drivers (same chipset? same maker, different
chipsets? or like ext2 vs ext3 vs ext4).
