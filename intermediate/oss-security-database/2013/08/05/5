Subject: valid but unusual sequence of CVEs in SYM13-009

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

There's a recent disclosure at:

  http://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20130801_00

that has the following valid and correct sequence of CVEs:

  CVE-2013-4575
  CVE-2013-4676
  CVE-2013-4677
  CVE-2013-4678

In other words, the first CVE should NOT be re-interpreted to mean a
number that "fits better."

CVE-2013-4575 is for software that runs on Linux but we don't know
(and don't need to know) whether it is open source or might be open
sourced in the future. We're mentioning it at the request of someone
who has been assigned CVEs adjacent to CVE-2013-4575, with future use
for open-source vulnerabilities expected. Thanks very much to that
person for their help.
