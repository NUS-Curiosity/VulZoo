I don't think so -- it isn't the shell at fault when a setuid program
fails to manage its privileges properly.

Incidentally, I'm curious to know how the vmware-mount problem was
discovered. Was it discovered because dash does not have bash's
mitigation in place? Or was it discovered via some other mechanism?

Regardless of the answer, it is probably worth using bash's mitigation
in dash, but I'm curious if we'll make discovering future bugs in setuid
programs more difficult to spot by happenstance by doing so.

Thanks
