Some SSL certificate issues in Ruby were also fixed...

... testing by pointing rubygems.org to another host with https gives:

$ gem install foo
ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'foo' (>= 0) in any repository
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError)
    SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://rubygems.org/latest_specs.4.8.gz)
...

I think a "package management" solution that installs software on a system should
have good security measurements by default these days, and trivial man-in-the-middle
attacks should not be possible.

So the implicit assumption "installing gems is secure" is violated here, which would
require a CVE I think.

Ciao, Marcus
