>   [1] http://www.asmail.be/msg0055359936.html

* Issue #1 (tools/gif2tiff.c): Stack-based buffer overflow in the gif2tiff tool when reading GIF extension block on crafted GIF image
* Issue #2 (tools/gif2tiff.c): Stack-based buffer overflow in the gif2tiff tool when decoding a GIF raster image
* Issue #3 (tools/gif2tiff.c): Stack-based buffer overflow in the gif2tiff tool when decoding a GIF raster image (same routine like
                               in case #2, just different line code)
* Issue #4 (tools/tiff2pdf.c): Use after free in tiff2pdf tool when reading TIFF file raster image data and writing them to the output PDF XObject's
                               image dictionary stream
* Issue #5 (tools/rgb2ycbcr.c): Stack-based buffer overflow in the rgb2ycbcr tool when performing RGBA to YCbCr conversion (converting
                                non-YCbCr TIFF image to a YCbCr one) when processing crafted rasted date of provided TIFF image file

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
