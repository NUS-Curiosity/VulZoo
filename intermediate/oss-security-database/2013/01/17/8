Digest::SHA is part of the Perl core, so there's a similarity between this case
and CVE-2008-1927: double-free vulnerability in Perl 5.8.8 allowing a DoS
(memory corruption and crash).

Currently I see no way for an attacker to exploit this bug to allow arbitrary
execution of code from user space.  Any vulnerability of that type would appear
to require preexisting vulnerabilities in the Perl/glibc memory allocators.
