Hi Kurt,

Thanks for creating the CVE; please take note of a small rectification on the
original issue report:

David Hicks <d <at> hx.id.au> writes:

This affects *only MantisBT version 1.2.12* (and the 'master'
development branch after 15-Sep-2012), as earlier versions did not contain the
commit introducing the 'match type' filtering feature [1].

It's also worth mentioning that a better patch for the vulnerability is
available under follow-up issue #15388 [2]
