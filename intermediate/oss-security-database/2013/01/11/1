The MBeanInstantiator in Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.7 in
Java 7 Update 10 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via vectors related to unspecified classes that allow
access to the class loader, as exploited in the wild in January 2013,
as demonstrated by Blackhole and Nuclear Pack, and a different
vulnerability than CVE-2012-4681.
