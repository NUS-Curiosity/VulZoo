Subject: Confirming CVE for ettercap buffer overflow flaw (CVE-2012-0722?)

This isn't on MITRE's site (reserved), and the initial advisory
indicates that this has a CVE of CVE-2012-0722.  Can someone confirm
that this is the correct CVE name?



A stack-based buffer overflow was reported [1],[2] in Ettercap <=
0.7.5.1.  A boundary error within the scan_load_hosts() function (in
src/ec_scan.c), when parsing entries from a hosts list, could be
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long
entry.  In order to exploit this, a user must be tricked into loading a
malicious host file.

This has not yet been corrected upstream, but a proposed patch is
available [3].

The initial report [1] indicates that this was given the name
CVE-2012-0722.
