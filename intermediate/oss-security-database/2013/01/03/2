CVE-2012-5664 literally says:

"SQL injection vulnerability in the Authlogic gem for Ruby on Rails
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a crafted
parameter in conjunction with a secret_token value, related to certain
behavior of find_by_id and other find_by_ methods."


However in your description of the bug I don't see any references to the
Authlogic gem. This rather seems to be a generic RoR issue.


And both Debian and Ubuntu have marked this CVE as NOT-FOR-US because of
this (they don't ship Authlogic gem).


Could you please clarify this?


Thanks!
