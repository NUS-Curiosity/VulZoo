X.Org Security Advisory: October 8, 2013 - CVE-2013-4396
Use after free in Xserver handling of ImageText requests
========================================================

Description:
============

Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@...il.com) reported an issue to the X.Org security
team in which an authenticated X client can cause an X server to use memory
after it was freed, potentially leading to crash and/or memory corruption.

Affected Versions
=================

This bug appears to have been introduced in RCS version 1.42 on 1993/09/18,
and is thus believed to be present in every X server release starting with
X11R6.0 up to the current xorg-server 1.14.3.  (Manual inspection shows it
is present in the sources from the X11R6 tarballs, but not in those from the
X11R5 tarballs.)

Fixes
=====

A fix is available via the attached patch, which is intended to be included
in xorg-server 1.15.0 and 1.14.4.

Thanks
======

X.Org thanks Pedro Ribeiro for reporting this issues to our security team at
xorg-security@...ts.x.org.
