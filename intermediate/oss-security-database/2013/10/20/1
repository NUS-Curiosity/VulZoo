So my first reply bounced off the list (hopefully this one does not).

Please use CVE-2013-4450 for this issue.

As for shipping a security update with "no details" in order to
protect people this doesn't work very well when you're open source and
leave the keyword in the source code where the fix is and add comments
that give all the details.

You might as well release details in the advisory so that the god guys
can quickly assess the issue and deal with it properly, rather then
pretending that the bad guys can't read the source code and figure out
how to exploit this. It took me literally all of five minutes to
download the current version, the previous version minus one, diff
them, and look for the keyword "piplined" (what can I say, I was
eating a sandwich and only had one hand free ;).
