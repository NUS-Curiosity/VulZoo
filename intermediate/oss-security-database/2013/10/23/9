Subject: Re: Re: CVE for Wordpress plugin Portable-phpmyadmin

Exactly, You request the proper url and it lets you in as well as let you
perform all database level operations available on that specific file.
some sample screenshots should clear the issue (attached for reference).
[while phpmyadmin requires a valid userid and password for mysql db these
credentials are pulled from wp-config.php (wordpress config fle) file
directly in this plugin]

Besides these two, there are a large number of full path disclosure on the
whole project also however as wordpress itself doesn't consider that as a
security issue rather mark it as a configuration issue (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Security_FAQ#Why_are_there_path_disclosures_when_directly_loading_certain_files.3F)
Hence those are not reported.
