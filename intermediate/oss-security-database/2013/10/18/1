Solar Designer picked up that this one should probably not have been assigned.

The problem wasn't normal bias - it was that it was enforcing
"password rules" requiring at-least one uppercase and number, but not
lowercase (which was a normal bug).  So the "fix" would technically
make the keyspace smaller.

I added the -R / --no-rules flag to my branch which removes
enforcement altogether, the full diff from 2.06 can be viewed here:

Before using this flag, you should consider the minor negative effects
on the keyspace vs. generating passwords which might be "accidentally"
cracked while looking for simpler passwords.  Either way, generating a
longer password has a far better effect on security.

It is not my intent to maintain this package long-term.  If anyone is
interested, please fork and push NMUs to Debian.

Regards,
  Michael
