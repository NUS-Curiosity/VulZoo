Subject: IcedTea-Web release 1.4.1 fixing CVE-2012-4540

Hi!

IcedTea-Web release 1.4.1 (re-)fixes CVE-2012-4540.  That issue was
previously fixed in 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 branches, but the fix did not
make it to head and hence 1.4 was released vulnerable.

It is the same issue, but as vendors may have released security updates
for the issue before and later rebased to vulnerable 1.4, there's a new
CVE for missing / regressed security fix - CVE-2013-4349.
