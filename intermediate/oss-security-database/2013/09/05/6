The original patch was sent to netdev and lkml publicly from the start.

We do have someone who is supposed to forwarding security bugs from
security@...nel.org to distros.  I'm not on distros but apparently this
wasn't happening properly so we've recently assigned another person to
help with this.

We're reviewing our security policies for the during the kernel summit,
in October btw.  So far the main points are that people want less
secrecy and more public reviews and better testing.  Kees wants to keep
a record of CVEs in the kernel.

It's not clear if anything will actually change though.
