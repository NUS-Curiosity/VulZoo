I agree with Greg. We (Red Hat) haven't requested CVEs for issues in -rc
releases, which we consider under development, in the past and we do not
intend to start doing that. It's in fact one of the criteria when
examining upstream commits - if the bug and the fix is in -rc release,
skip it.

Just my 2 cents.
