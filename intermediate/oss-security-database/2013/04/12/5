Oops, I missed that one.

See pthread_atfork().  On Linux, it's not part of libc proper, so
you'd have to link against libpthread (which OpenSSL currently does
anyway, unnecessarily, and has performance drawbacks on Linux).

That's what's done, but it doesn't help if the seed *and* the PID are
reused, which is what was noticed in the PostgreSQL context (if I
understood the commit message correctly).

Mixing the PID is just not good enough, you need call getpid(),
compare the result to the previously seen PID, and reseed if there's a
change.  Gutmann's thesis disagrees with that, claiming (without
proof) that, "The only way to reliably solve this problem is to borrow
a technique from the field of transaction processing and use a
two-phase commit (2PC) to extract data from the pool."  But I think
this requirement mainly stems from a desire to avoid reseeding at all
cost.  He doesn't discuss the issue of PID-and-seed reuse, as far as I
can tell.
