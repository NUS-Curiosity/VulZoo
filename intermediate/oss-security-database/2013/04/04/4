Subject: RE: Confused with Drupal CVEs

Henri,

While SA-CONTRIB-2013-001 listed only one CVE, CVE-2013-0181, there were two vulnerabilities that were found by different researchers.  While they were originally merged into a single CVE (same vulnerability type), we also have guidelines that SPLIT issues into different groups if they are found by different researchers.  So, the MITRE team SPLIT these CVEs accordingly, after the initial erroneous assignment.  We listed http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/15/3 as a reference for the new/split CVE-2013-2715 because this was effectively where the vulnerability was more widely disclosed.
