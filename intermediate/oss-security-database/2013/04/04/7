 memory in event channel operations

             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-1920 / XSA-47

        Potential use of freed memory in event channel operations

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Wrong ordering of operations upon extending the per-domain event
channel tracking table can cause a pointer to freed memory to be left
in place, when the hypervisor is under memory pressure and XSM (Xen
Security Module) is enabled.

IMPACT
======

Malicious guest kernels could inject arbitrary events or corrupt other
hypervisor state, possibly leading to code execution.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions from 3.2 onwards are vulnerable when making use of
XSM.  Configurations without XSM or with a dummy module are not
affected.

MITIGATION
==========

Running without XSM (which is the default) will avoid this
vulnerability, albeit doing so will likely lower overall security of
systems that would otherwise have XSM enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
