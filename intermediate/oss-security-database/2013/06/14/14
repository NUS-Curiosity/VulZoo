CGI scripts don't run with the full privileges of the webserver. They
typically run with the privileges appropriate to a container inside the
webserver (a combination of virtualhost configuration directives, URL
address space, document root and  uid/gid.)

A user on the server that can edit CGI scripts in one context shouldn't
be able to take over other contexts on the same system. How would shared
hosting and userdir be possible if CGI scripts were allowed to do this?

You could certainly argue that some webservers are not written to
support shared hosting or userdir style functionality, but Monkey
clearly is written to support it.

I don't see how this issue is very different from CVE-2012-4442 and
CVE-2012-4443. Do you believe those CVEs were not appropriate?
