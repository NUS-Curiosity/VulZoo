Subject: [CVE identifier assignment notification] CVE-2013-2191
 python-bugzilla: Does not verify Bugzilla server certificate

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  It was found that python-bugzilla, a Python library for interacting with Bugzilla
instances over XML-RPC functionality, did not perform X.509 certificate verification
when using secured SSL connection. A man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacker could use this
flaw to spoof Bugzilla server via an arbitrary certificate.
