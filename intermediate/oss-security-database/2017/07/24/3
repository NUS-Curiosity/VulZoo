Subject: [CVE-2015-5191] local privilege escalation in Open VMware Tools

Open VMware Tools (CVE-2015-5191) contains multiple file system races in libDeployPkg, related to the use of hard-coded paths under /tmp.
Successful exploitation may result in a local privilege escalation. The impact of this vulnerability is low for distributions which have enabled PrivateTmp for the affected service.
