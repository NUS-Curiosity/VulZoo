Since CentOS 7 patched this vulnerability on September 13, 2017 (release
1708), we attached our CVE-2017-1000253.c exploit for CentOS-7 kernel
versions "3.10.0-514.21.2.el7.x86_64" and "3.10.0-514.26.1.el7.x86_64"
to this email (alternatively, this exploit is also available at
https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/).

Thank you very much!  With best regards,
