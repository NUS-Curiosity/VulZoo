Subject: Re: CVE-2017-8805: Unsafe symlinks not filtered in
 Debian mirror script ftpsync

Since security is determined by file and directory permissions and
ownership, not by symlinks, wouldn't the fact that a malicious user did not
have permissions to access the symlink's target file/directory prevent any
harm?
