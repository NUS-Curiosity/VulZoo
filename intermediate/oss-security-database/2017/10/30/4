Subject: Quagga: CVE-2017-16227: BGP session termination due to rather long
 AS paths in update messages

Hi

The following issue in Quagga got assigned CVE-2017-16227:

It was discovered that the bgpd daemon in the Quagga routing suite does
not properly calculate the length of multi-segment AS_PATH UPDATE
messages, causing bgpd to drop a session and potentially resulting in
loss of network connectivity.

It was reported as https://bugs.debian.org/879474 in the Debian bugtracker, and
following up now here on oss-security. I'm going to fquote the detailed report:

> there is a longstanding bug in quagga where certain BGP update messages
> cause a quagga bgpd to drop a session, possibly resulting in loss of
> network connectivity.
> 
> 
> Details:
> 
> Long paths in update messages are segmented in BGP, and the bug is in
> the recalculation of the framing information if there are more than two
> segments. The resulting data is invalid but will will be used for
> redistribution. At least if the receiver is another quagga bgpd, that
> message is rejected, eventually resulting in a BGP session termination.
> 
> The receiver's log (if written) contains an error message like
> | BGP: 172.23.97.181: BGP type 2 length 3074 is too large, attribute total length is 2069.  attr_endp is 0x562feb368121.  endp is 0x562feb367d2c
> then.

> So if a site's BGP peers all run quagga, that site will lose network
> connectivity due to frequent session termination. Additionally, the
> repeated initial full table transfer will result in a significantly
> bigger network load, I've seen around 1 MByte/sec/link, compared to
> usually less than one 1 kbyte/sec/link.
> 
> Such extremely long AS paths have occured in the global BGP table at
> least four times since June. Last time started on Oct 13th around 20:43
> UTC and lasted until the following week.

> All versions of quagga in Debian are affected.

> Kudos to Andreas Jaggi who identified the bug and provided a fix[1].
> After some hours of work I was able to reproduce the issue and can

> setup available upon request, it's just some stuff to write down.
