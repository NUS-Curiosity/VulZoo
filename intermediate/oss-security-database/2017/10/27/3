Subject: binutils: NULL pointer dereference in concat_filename (dwarf2.c) (INCOMPLETE FIX FOR CVE-2017-15023)

Description:
binutils is a set of tools necessary to build programs.

The commit fix for this issue says:

The PR22200 fuzzer testcase found one way to put NULLs into .debug_line file tables. PR22205 finds another.
So mitre considers this an incomplete fix.

The complete ASan output of the issue:
