Subject: Kernel 4.1.y might not contain patches for CVE-2016-10229

This is just a small notice that Linux Kernel 4.1.y might not contain patches to CVE-2016-10229 [1]. This is a reference to the Vanilla Linux sources without any distribution specific patching. Typically a number of distributions apply their own patches to the standard vanilla Kernel. 

The patches might also not be needed for 4.1.y sources as were discussed on the mailing list [see [2]]. 

Please check with the distribution you are using to see if the patches for CVE-2016-10229 have been applied to the kernel 4.1.y tree for the distribution that you are using.
