Subject: Linux kernel: CVE-2017-9242: out-of-bounds write in __ip6_append_data

The following CVE was assigned for an out-of-bounds write in IPv6
socket buffers.

The bug was found with syzkaller.

* CVE-2017-9242

The __ip6_append_data function in net/ipv6/ip6_output.c in the Linux
kernel through 4.11.3 is too late in checking whether an overwrite of
an skb data structure may occur, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service (system crash) via crafted system calls.
