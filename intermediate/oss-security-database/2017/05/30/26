* CVE-2017-9074

The IPv6 fragmentation implementation in the Linux kernel through
4.11.1 does not consider that the nexthdr field may be associated with
an invalid option, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (out-of-bounds read and BUG) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via crafted socket and send system calls.
