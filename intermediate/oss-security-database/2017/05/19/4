Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2017-5657: Apache Archiva CSRF vulnerability for REST endpoints

CVE-2017-5657: Apache Archiva CSRF vulnerabilities for various REST endpoints

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
    Archiva 2.0.0 - 2.2.1
    The unsupported versions 1.x are also affected.  

Several REST service endpoints of Apache Archiva are not protected against 
Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A malicious site opened in the same 
browser as the archiva site, may send HTML response that performs arbitrary 
actions on archiva services, with the same rights as the active archiva 
session (e.g. adminstrator rights).

Mitigation:
  All users are recommended to upgrade to Archiva 2.2.3 or higher, 
  where additional measures are taken to verify the origin of REST requests.
