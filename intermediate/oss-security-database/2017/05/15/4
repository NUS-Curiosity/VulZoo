Subject: CVE-2017-8934 pcmanfm: single instance socket may be blocked by
 another user

The socket placed in /tmp is predictable and public-writable. Therefore
if one user placed a symlink to another socket instead of socket for
another user then said another user will either be unable to use
pcmanfm, or may send requests to the first user's pcmanfm.

This bug has been assigned to CVE-2017-8934 [1].  A fix has been
committed to pcmanfm's git repository [2].  LXDE developers are
working on a release which fixes the problem.
