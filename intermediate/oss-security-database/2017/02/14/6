Subject: Re: Linux kernel: Reachable BUG_ON from userspace in
 sctp_wait_for_sndbuf()

CVE-2017-5986 was assigned, thanks.

> [Additional Information]
> A panic (BUG_ON()) is triggerable by a random user in userspace. There is no reproducer, but triggering it is easy:
> - bind&list a socket
> - connect to it (may use localhost)
> - accept the association
> - create a second thread
> - push data until sendmsg returns AGAIN
> - call a blocking sendmsg()
> - (2nd thread) do peel off operation
> - read some data
> - panic
