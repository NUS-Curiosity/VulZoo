I just reported this in Gentoo [1], yet I was informed that we're not
using su from util-linux, but from shadow. So depending on the
distribution you may not use this implementation of su.

I haven't digged deeper into this, can you say if this issue is
generic enough to be expected in other implementations as well? (Not
sure if the implementations of su in shadow and util-linux share a
common codebase, seems to be quite old stuff.)
