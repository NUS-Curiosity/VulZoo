Subject: Re: util-linux 2.29.2 fixes CVE-2017-2616

Hello,

as I have discovered the issue, I can confirm that su of util-linux as
well as shadow are affected.

I have supplied patches to both maintainers and the shadow patch has
been pushed now, too.

The code shares a common origin but differs slightly, which in fact made
the patch for shadow a bit trickier.

But as the code bases are so close to each other, I don't think that it
takes another CVE-ID for this one.
