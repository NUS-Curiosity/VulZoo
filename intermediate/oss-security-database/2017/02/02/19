Subject: curiosity for CVE-2016-10000

hello, MITRE, all,

i'm asking just out of curiosity about CVE-2016-10000. afaiu, it is in
a range allocated to some CNA, but it is not yet(?) allocated. can you
please, tell what CNA CVE-2016-10000 is allocated to (i was not able to
find this info at mirte.org) so i can ask them directly about this CVE status?

best regards,
