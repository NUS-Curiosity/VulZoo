at https://www.armis.com/blueborne/, "A Coordinated Disclosure"
paragraph you write that:

"Linux - Contacted August 15 and 17, 2017. On September 5, 2017, we
connected and provided the necessary information to the the Linux kernel
security team and to the Linux distributions security contact list and
conversations followed from there. Targeting updates for on or about
September 12, 2017 for coordinated disclosure."

May you please share with us who was contacted on August 15th and 17th
and why you waited until September 5th with the disclosure to
linux-distros and security@...nel.org?

If it was because of the strict embargo rules for linux-distros and
security@...nel.org mailing lists, next time please feel free to reach
Red Hat directly via secalert@...hat.com . We will honour any reporter
set embargo and can contact other vendors directly. And also work on the
fixes.

Thank you,
