CVE-2017-9803: Security vulnerability in kerberos delegation token functionality

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Solr 6.2.0 to 6.6.0

Description:

Solr's Kerberos plugin can be configured to use delegation tokens,
which allows an application to reuse the authentication of an end-user
or another application.
There are two issues with this functionality (when using
SecurityAwareZkACLProvider type of ACL provider e.g.
SaslZkACLProvider),

Firstly, access to the security configuration can be leaked to users
other than the solr super user. Secondly, malicious users can exploit
this leaked configuration for privilege escalation to further
expose/modify private data and/or disrupt operations in the Solr
cluster.

The vulnerability is fixed from Solr 6.6.1 onwards.

Mitigation:
6.x users should upgrade to 6.6.1
