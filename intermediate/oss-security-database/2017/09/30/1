Subject: binutils: memory allocation failure in _bfd_elf_slurp_version_tables (elf.c)

Description:
binutils is a set of tools necessary to build programs.

This issue was initially discovered because the nm process eat ~230GB of ram. Later on, another testcase hits the issue and now I have a 
stracktrace.
The relevant ASan output of the issue:

# nm -A -a -l -S -s --special-syms --synthetic --with-symbol-versions -D $FILE
