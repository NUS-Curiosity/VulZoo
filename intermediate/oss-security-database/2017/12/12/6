Subject: ROBOT attack (WolfSSL, Bouncy Castle, Erlang)

Hi,

I published details about the ROBOT attack today, it's a couple of
minor variations of the old Bleichenbacher attack.
(Return Of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat)

https://robotattack.org/

It is mostly about proprietary appliances, but also affects three FOSS
TLS stacks.

The attack is based on the fact that an attacker can distinguish valid
and invalid RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 paddings based on different server
responses.
