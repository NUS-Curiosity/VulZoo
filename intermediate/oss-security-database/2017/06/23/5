Subject: CVE-2017-7518 Kernel: KVM: debug exception via syscall emulation

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine(CONFIG_KVM) support 
is vulnerable to an incorrect debug exception(#DB) error. It could occur while 
emulating a syscall instruction.

A user/process inside guest could use this flaw to potentially escalate their 
privileges inside guest.

Note: Linux guests are not affected.
