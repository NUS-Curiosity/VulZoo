Hi Leo,

The ocaml.org <http://ocaml.org/> site is just being rebuilt in CI so it will be a few minutes
before the release is on the live site.  In the meanwhile, all the distribution
tarballs are available at:

https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/ <https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/>

regards,
Anil
