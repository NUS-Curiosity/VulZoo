Ok, I read the diff:

+       Sudo 1.8.20p2
+       [47836f4c9834]
+
+       * src/ttyname.c:
+       A command name may also contain newline characters so read
+       /proc/self/stat until EOF. It is not legal for /proc/self/stat to
+       contain embedded NUL bytes so treat the file as corrupt if we see
+       any. With help from Qualys.
+
+       This is not exploitable due to the /dev traversal changes in sudo
+       1.8.20p1 (thanks Solar!).

which says it is NOT exploitable, but you're saying that it is actually
exploitable? If confirmed yes I'll get you a new CVE for this asap. Thanks.
