Subject: Re: CVE-2017-15102: Linux kernel: usb: NULL-deref
 due to a race condition in [legousbtower] driver

Hello, Greg, all,

My fault here was indeed not stating that a Red Hat's product is
vulnerable (thus, a CVE was assigned), but stating that only Linux
kernel is vulnerable (while indeed it was fixed a long ago). Please,
accept my apologies.

I'm afraid, you won't like the answer, but in a short word, the Red Hat
is a CNA (CVE Numbering Authority) for Red Hat's products and the Linux
kernel and we've decided to assign this CVE.

Best regards,
