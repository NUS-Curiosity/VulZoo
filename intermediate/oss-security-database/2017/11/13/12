Oh, I must have guessed wrong.  I thought the long embargo periods were
correct and assumed that was because of inclusion of pre-distros time,
but according to what you're saying these are just two errors.

Your statistics appear to suggest that it was public on oss-security
exactly 22 days later, but actually it was public on oss-security at
most a day later with:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/10/10/3

I guess you'll correct this.

If you ever notice an embargo period exceeding 14 days, please
investigate and either correct whatever error you might have or sound
the alarm.  This shouldn't be happening.  Thanks!

Thank you!  This currently shows some fields as empty, including but
not only for CVE-2017-1000255, where I think you could add the missing
info easily.  Please do.

Meanwhile, I've added a link from:
