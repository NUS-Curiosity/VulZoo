Well, I'm working on fixing the "devices do not get updates" issue
through other means, so don't just give up on that one just yet :)

As for the "keep track of vulnerabilities", is that what is really
happening here?  Why pick a random bug fix from over a year ago for a
CVE vs. the 100 other bugfixes in the past few weeks/months?

I'm really curious as to what triggered this specific CVE request that
somehow misses the hundreds/thousands of other fixes that land in newer
kernel releases?
