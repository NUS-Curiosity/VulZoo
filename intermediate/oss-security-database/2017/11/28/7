    Open files with O_NOFOLLOW. (CVE-2017-16611)

    A non-privileged X client can instruct X server running under root
    to open any file by creating own directory with "fonts.dir",
    "fonts.alias" or any font file being a symbolic link to any other
    file in the system. X server will then open it. This can be issue
    with special files such as /dev/watchdog.
