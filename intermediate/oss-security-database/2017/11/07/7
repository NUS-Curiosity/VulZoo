Subject: CVE-2017-15102: Linux kernel: usb: NULL-deref due to a race
 condition in [legousbtower] driver

Heololo,

A race condition exists in Linux kernel since year 2003 through version 4.9-rc1
in [legousbtower] driver which allows a null pointer dereference caused by
not removing a device file interface on an error when the probe function is called.
This can cause a write-what-where condition by remapping dev->interrupt_out_buffer
in tower_write(), leading to privilege escalation.
