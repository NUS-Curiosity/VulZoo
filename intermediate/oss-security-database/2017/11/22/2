  Patch is sent against upstream Qemu git repository(below) and is merged 
after due review on the -devel list.

Reviewed patches soon show-up in the above master repository. In this case, it 
so happened that an earlier version v1 of the patch was more acceptable

It should make it upstream soon, I'll update here accordingly.

Thank you.
