FWIW, Robin Mills is moving away from exiv2, it is being handed over to
new developers and they have been rather responsive to the various
security issues that have been reported in the last months.

Search for CVE in https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues

So please file bugs on github, thank you.

I just add the CVE assigned through the Distributed Weakness Filing
Project.
