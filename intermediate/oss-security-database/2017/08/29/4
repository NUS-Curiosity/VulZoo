Another recent example by owl337:
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-13737 which points to:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1484196
There is an invalid free in the MagickFree function in magick/memory.c in 
GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 that will lead to a remote denial of service attack.


The maintainer of Graphicsmagick, Mr Bob Friesenhahn said to me:

"It looks like this problem is not a GM bug but it is already fixed in 
libtiff.  Using latest libtiff CVS sources I see this in the GM traces 
which are produced by libtiff:

08:41:48 0:01 0.000u 25164 tiff.c/unknown/2268/Coder:
   Allocating scanline buffer of 104 bytes

   TIFF Warning: Discarding 89 bytes to avoid buffer overrun.

   TIFF Warning: Discarding 1 bytes to avoid buffer overrun.
08:41:48 0:01 0.000u 25164 tiff.c/unknown/932/Coder:
   TIFF Warning: Terminating PackBitsDecode due to lack of data..
08:41:48 0:01 0.000u 25164 tiff.c/unknown/793/Coder:
   Not enough data for scanline 3. (PackBitsDecode)

I am not sure what libtiff Red Hat is using.  It may be that the 
changes are since the latest libtiff release.  I could help with that 
by making another libtiff release."
