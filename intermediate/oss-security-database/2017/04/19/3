Subject: CVE-2017-7874 versus CVE-2009-1185 ?

Hi


I stumbled across https://twitter.com/info_dox/status/854372066228932609
that is curious about an udev+kernel exploit
(https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/142152/Linux-Kernel-4.8.0-udev-232-Privilege-Escalation.html)

which claims to exploit a missing sender-check within udev. That makes
me wonder, as kernel 4.8.0 (and even earlier) no longer allow users
to send NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT messages. Our testcases fail,
as they should:

https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1034330


However, MITRE apparently assigned a valid CVE for it:

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7874

So either we miss some weird corner case or the CVE is invalid
and should be withdrawn?

Sebastian
