Subject: CVE-2017-5645: Apache Log4j socket receiver deserialization vulnerability

CVE-2017-5645: Apache Log4j socket receiver deserialization vulnerability

Severity: High

CVSS Base Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: all versions from 2.0-alpha1 to 2.8.1

Description: When using the TCP socket server or UDP socket server to
receive serialized log events from another application, a specially crafted
binary payload can be sent that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary
code.

Mitigation: Java 7+ users should migrate to version 2.8.2 or avoid using
the socket server classes. Java 6 users should avoid using the TCP or UDP
socket server classes, or they can manually backport the security fix from
2.8.2: <https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=logging-log4j2.
