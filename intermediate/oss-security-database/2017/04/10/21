Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2017-5651 Apache Tomcat Information Disclosure

CVE-2017-5651 Apache Tomcat Information Disclosure

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18
Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.12
Apache Tomcat 8.0.x and earlier are not affected

Description:
The refactoring of the HTTP connectors for 8.5.x onwards, introduced a
regression in the send file processing. If the send file processing
completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the
processor cache twice. This could result in the same Processor being
used for multiple requests which in turn could lead to unexpected errors
and/or response mix-up.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following
mitigations:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M19 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.13 or later
