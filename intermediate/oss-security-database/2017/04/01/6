Red Hat currently says all RHEL starting with RHEL5 are affected:

https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-7308

However, the corresponding Bugzilla entry has no mention of that:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1437404

So is it just a better-safe-than-sorry default to list products as
affected until known otherwise?  If so, maybe Unknown would be better?

RHEL5 doesn't yet include TPACKET_V3.  I did not check RHEL6.
