Subject: [CVE-2017-5661] Apache XML Graphics FOP information disclosure vulnerability

CVE-2017-5661:
        Apache XML Graphics FOP information disclosure vulnerability

Severity:
        Medium

Vendor:
        The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
        FOP 1.0 - 2.1

Description:
        Files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can
        be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG
        files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context
        in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root
        a full compromise of the server--including confidential or sensitive
        files--would be possible.

        XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server
        via denial of service as the references within a xml document
        can trivially trigger an amplification attack.

Mitigation:
        Users should upgrade to FOP 2.2+
