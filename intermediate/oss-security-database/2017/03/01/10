Subject: CVE-2016-10228: glibc iconv program can hang when invoked with the -c
 option

The iconv program (not the iconv function) provided by glibc can hang 
(enter an infinite loop) when invoked with the -c option and an invalid 
multi-byte sequence is encountered in the input:

   https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19519

We have received an independent report of this issue, so we are treating 
this as a (minor) security bug now on the glibc upstream side.

(Note to Red Hat Product Security: We already have a couple of product 
bugs for this.)

Thanks,
Florian
