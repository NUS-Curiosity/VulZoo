Subject: CVE-2016-9603 Qemu: cirrus: heap buffer overflow via vnc
 connection

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator and the VNC 
display driver support is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow issue. It could 
occur when Vnc client attempts to update its display after a vga operation is 
performed by a guest.

A privileged user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu 
process resulting in DoS OR potentially leverage it to execute arbitrary code 
on the host with privileges of the Qemu process.

Reference:
