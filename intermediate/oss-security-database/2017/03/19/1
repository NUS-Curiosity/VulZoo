While this CVE is not listed in the libtiff 4.0.7 release notes, that
version appears to resolve it via this release note item:
    'The libtiff tools rgb2ycbcr and thumbnail are only built in the build
     tree for testing.'

I still can't find a bug id specifically for this one in the libtiff bug
tracker, but for the similar CVE-2016-3634 this removal is listed as the
resolution in http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2547 .
