This issue fixed in 1.2.2 was assigned CVE id CVE-2008-3920:

  Unspecified vulnerability in BitlBee before 1.2.2 allows remote
  attackers to "recreate" and "hijack" existing accounts via unspecified
  vectors.

However, upstream released 1.2.3 in the meantime, fixing the incomplete
fix in 1.2.2.  Quoting news page:

  Unfortunately 1.2.2 did not fix all possible account hijacking
  loopholes. Another very similar flaw was found by Tero Marttila. In
  the migration to the user configuration storage abstraction layer, a
  few safeguards that prevent overwriting existing accounts disappeared.
  Over the week I went over all the related code to make sure that
  everything's done in a sane, safe and consistent way.

And changelog:

  Version 1.2.3 (released 2008-09-07) hilights:
    * Fixed a security issue similar to the previous account overwrite/hijack bug.

This should probably get a new id.
