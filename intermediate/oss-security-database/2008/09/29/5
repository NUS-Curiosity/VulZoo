Yes, only recently:

CVE-2008-4297 (http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-4297):
  Mercurial before 1.0.2 does not enforce the allowpull permission
  setting for a pull operation from hgweb, which allows remote
  attackers to read arbitrary files from a repository via an "hg pull"
  request.
