This issue (and CVE-2008-3904) have been resolved by r845, and released 
as 0.1.10:
http://lxde.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lxde?view=rev&sortby=date&revision=845

Interestingly, upstream also fixed a bug in the open_url() function 
where invoking the browser would allow for code execution via shell 
metacharacters in the URL. However, from what I see the function is 
only called with URLs in the "about" box. Unfortunately, upstream calls 
this non-issue CVE-2008-3904. Patch here:
http://lxde.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lxde?view=rev&sortby=date&revision=847
