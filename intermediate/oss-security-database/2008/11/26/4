These two issues have been resolved in the current "jhead-latest.tar.gz" 
distributed on the upstream site. Both Ubuntu and Debian have renamed 
one version of this file to be "2.85" whereas upstream has not yet 
released any 2.85 version. Upstream stated that they will release a 
2.85 not before next year, so anyone who has this issue open can either 
extract patches, package the snapshot or wait.
