Hmm, my brains aren't in a perfect shape today, so I could be missing
some important point, but I don't understand how swapping 'xsize' and
'ysize' can help to fix anything.  IIRC, the order of multiplication
isn't guaranteed and multiplication is commutative, so 'xsize' and
'ysize' both are equally good or bad and one can not prefer either.

What am I missing here?
