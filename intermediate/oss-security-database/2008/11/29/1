Subject:  CVE id request/update: mailscanner: many scripts allow local users to overwrite arbitrary files via symlink attacks

Hello,

A week ago I reported some more issues in mailscanner other than those mentioned
in CVE-2008-5140 at [1], but it looks like the mail copy sent to bugtraq was
never really delivered or got rejected.

Could the current CVE id be updated or a new one assigned please?

Thanks in advance.
