Sorry for not choosing word properly here.  I probably should have used
"looks like this *may* be a dupe of...".  My reasoning for calling it
dupe was that CVE-2007-0165 links BID-21964, which has the same exploit
attached as is available on milw0rm as 6775.  It's not clear when
exploit code was added to the BID, though.
