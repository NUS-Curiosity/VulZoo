Subject: Re: CVE Request - ecryptfs-utils


CVE practice in this case is to place fault on the program that's sending
the passwords over the command line.  Arguably it could go the other way,
but CVE generally doesn't cover what I call "design limitations" - issues
that are not fundamental security vulnerabilities in themselves, but which
make it easier for others to introduce them.  THe ecryptfs-setup-private
feature of accepting command-line password arguments isn't fundamentally
different than strcpy()'s feature of happily writing past the end of the
buffer if that's what it's told to do.  This line continues to get fuzzy,
however.

The (1) ecryptfs-setup-private, (2) ecryptfs-setup-confidential, and
(3) ecryptfs-setup-pam-wrapped.sh scripts in ecryptfs-utils 45 through
61 in eCryptfs place cleartext passwords on command lines, which
allows local users to obtain sensitive information by listing the
process.
