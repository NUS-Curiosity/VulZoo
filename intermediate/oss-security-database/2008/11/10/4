This appears to be the patch for 2.6.  The 2.5 maintenance patch was
one revision earlier:
  http://svn.python.org/view?rev=61349&view=rev

Given that there is a patch for 2.6 as well, it might be worth
expanding the impacted versions to include it.  (I believe 2.5.2 was
also affected where r61349 fixed it for 2.5.3.)

For patch validation purposes,
* string poc:
s = 'AA\t\n\tAAAAAAAA'
len(s.expandtabs(0x7ffffffe))

* unicode poc:
s = u'AA\t\n\tAAAAAAAA'
len(s.expandtabs(0x7ffffffe))


cheers, will
