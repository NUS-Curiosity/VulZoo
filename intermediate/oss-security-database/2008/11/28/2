One point yet -- this is perl-5.8.8-1+ specific issue (different than
CVE-2004-0452, CVE-2005-0448 and even different than recently fixed
CVE-2008-2827). Seems that upstream forgot to apply the fix for
CVE-2005-0448 to 5.8 perl after rebase. This newly reported issue
already fixed in perl-5.10.

CVE-2008-2827 affects only perl-5.10 (and it already applies additional
fix to CVE-2005-0448, which has been properly applied in perl-5.10).

Regards, Jan.
