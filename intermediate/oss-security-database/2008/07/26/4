My interpretation of this new advisory is that they meant to fix the
session fixation in 5.8, but they didn't.  The original advisory covered
multiple other issues as well.  So this new advisory might better be
considered a clarification of versions for the session fixation, rather
than a regression error or incomplete fix (which would require a new CVE).

Granted, the lack of specifics from Drupal makes it difficult to be
certain about what happened.
