Subject: Major DNS vulnerability announced  [CVE Question]


Since this is about to make VDB life complicated..

Microsoft has:
DNS Insufficient Socket Entropy Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1447
DNS Cache Poisoning Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1454

Cisco has:
CVE-2008-1447

Question: Is CVE going to keep those two identifiers for the fundamental 
issues, and load them up with affected vendors?

Vulnerability Note VU#800113
Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning

Overview

Deficiencies in the DNS protocol and common DNS implementations facilitate 
DNS cache poisoning attacks.

I. Description

The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating host names to 
IP addresses (and vice versa) and is critical for the normal operation of 
internet-connected systems. DNS cache poisoning (sometimes referred to as 
cache pollution) is an attack technique that allows an attacker to 
introduce forged DNS information into the cache of a caching nameserver. 
DNS cache poisoning is not a new concept; in fact, there are published 
articles that describe a number of inherent deficiencies in the DNS 
protocol and defects in common DNS implementations that facilitate DNS 
cache poisoning. The following are examples of these deficiencies and 
defects:

II. Impact

An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful cache poisoning 
attack can cause a nameserver's clients to contact the incorrect, and 
possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web 
traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to 
systems under the attacker's control.
