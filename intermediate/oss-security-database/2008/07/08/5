Btw, following is mentioned in the 0.93.2 changelog:

Thu Jul  3 16:15:23 CEST 2008
-----------------------------
  * libclamav/petite.c: fix another out of bounds memory read (bb#1000)
                        Reported by Secunia (CVE-2008-2713)

Referring to the same bug as before, which is now restricted (was it
publicly accessible before?).

The announcement mentions it too, but without specifying any
implications:

http://lurker.clamav.net/message/20080707.155612.ad411b00.en.html

The fix does not even seem to be committed in the public clamav SVN
(either trunk or 0.93 branch).

Does anyone have more info?  From commit message, it looks like DoS, so
probably worth new id for an incomplete fix.
