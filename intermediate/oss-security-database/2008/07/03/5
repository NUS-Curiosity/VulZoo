There are patches with the original advisory for these two.  Has anyone
had a chance to look at them to make sure they're ok?  I don't see any
references to any of these issues on the pidgin website and no vendors
have issued pidgin updates for these that I can see, so I'm wondering if
anyone has looked at these patches (be it vendors or upstream) to
determine whether or not they're sufficient and/or suitable to apply to
a security update.
