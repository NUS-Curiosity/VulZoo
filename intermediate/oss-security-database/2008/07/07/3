Subject: [oCERT-2008-007] libpoppler uninitialized pointer


2008/07/07 #2008-007 libpoppler uninitialized pointer

Description:

The poppler PDF rendering library suffers a memory management bug which leads
to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is present in the Page class constructor/destructor. The
pageWidgets object is not initialized in the Page constructor if specific
conditions are met, but it is deleted afterwards in the destructor regardless
of its initialization.

Specific PDF files can be crafted which allocate arbitrary memory to trigger
the vulnerability.

A new poppler version addressing the issue is scheduled to be released on
July 30th according to maintainer.

The following patch fixes the issue:


diff --git a/poppler/Page.cc b/poppler/Page.cc
