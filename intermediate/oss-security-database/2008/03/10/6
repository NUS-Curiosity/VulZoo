Subject: Re: CVE request: dovecot unauthorized login


I wrote this up as 1.0.x instead of 1.0.11 (skip_password_check's
introduction) since (perhaps) other fields could be inserted to do
something bad.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2008-1271
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1271
Reference: MLIST:[Dovecot-news] 20080309 v1.0.13 and v1.1.rc3 released
Reference: URL:http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2008-March/000065.html
Reference: MLIST:[Dovecot-news] 20080309 Security hole #6: Some passdbs allowed users to log in without a valid password
Reference: URL:http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2008-March/000064.html

Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and
1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote
attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB
characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the
skip_password_check field to be specified.
