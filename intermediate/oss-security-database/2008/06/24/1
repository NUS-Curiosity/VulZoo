It is not part of the latest release 3.2.1, as it was only introduced 
two days prior (May 13) here:
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/53195719f762

As mentioned, fixed here:
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/9044705960cb

As for the first commit, it does not fall under CVE-2008-1952 -- so I 
assume we need a new CVE, marking CVE-2008-1952 as an improper fix for 
it.
