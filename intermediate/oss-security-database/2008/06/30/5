Subject: Re: CVE id request mercurial:Insufficient input
 validation


Out of curiosity, what attack scenarios exist for this issue?  If an
attacker has control over the patch already, then code execution on the
system already seems likely.  Or is the impact mostly limited to "compile
farms" and limited-access user accounts?
