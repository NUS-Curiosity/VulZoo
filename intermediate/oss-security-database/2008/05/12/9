I've assigned CVE-2008-2149 to just deal with the "overflow in a long
command line" as reported for the searchwn function.  This is based on the
comment in the Gentoo bug report that "I have seen that Wordnet is
sometimes used as a backend in e.g. web applications," otherwise might
have dismissed it as just a regular command-line overflow.  (Increasing
application connectivity is making this distinction harder, though.)

If additional detailed research is performed, then other CVEs could be
assigned accordingly.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2008-2149
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2149
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211491

Stack-based buffer overflow in the searchwn function in Wordnet 2.0,
2.1, and 3.0 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a long command line option.  NOTE: this issue
probably does not cross privilege boundaries except in cases in which
Wordnet is used as a back end.
