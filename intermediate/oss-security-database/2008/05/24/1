Subject: CVE-2008-2292 net-snmp __snprint_value

Hi,
the CVE id states that PERL/SNMP.xs is vulnerable to
a buffer overflow "via a large OCTETSTRING in an attribute 
value pair (AVP)."

Unfortunately the same vulnerability applies to the python 
module as well. See python/netsnmp/client_intf.c

Please update your patches and the CVE id.

Cheers
Nico
