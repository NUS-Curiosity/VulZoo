Subject: CVE-2008-3526 Linux kernel sctp_setsockopt_auth_key() integer overflow

An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel
sctp_setsockopt_auth_key() function. The structure used for
SCTP_AUTH_KEY option contains a length that needs to be verified to
prevent integer overflow conditions.

This affects kernel versions since 2.6.24-rc1. The proposed upstream
commit is: 30c2235cbc477d4629983d440cdc4f496fec9246. Note that the
SCTP-AUTH extension is now disabled by default since last week with
upstream commit 5e739d17.

I have allocated this CVE-2008-3526.

Thanks, Eugene
