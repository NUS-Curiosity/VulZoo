It's hard to read into this one since I don't know what they mean by
"SSL-aware" here, or what apply_filters() is intended to do.

Use CVE-2008-3747, to be filled in later.

Presumably, only the admin would be able to install plugins.  So plugin
"hiding" isn't feasible.  The admin knows which plugins were installed,
unless there's some other exploit that installs the plugins, in which case
there's a different vuln.  So I don't think this deserves a CVE either.
