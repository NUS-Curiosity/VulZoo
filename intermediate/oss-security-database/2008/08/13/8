Use CVE-2008-3658, to be filled in later - I'm assuming this is a distinct
component that doesn't just affect PHP.

Use CVE-2008-3659.

For the FastCGI "foo..php" issue, use CVE-2008-3660.

These will be filled in later.

We use the term "context-dependent" to cover cases where the reachability
and remote/local nature of the issue can vary widely, depending on how the
product is used.  This term typically applies to libraries or interpreters
that are used by third-party applications.
