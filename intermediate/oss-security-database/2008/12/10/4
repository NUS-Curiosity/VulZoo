Umm... I can't parse the above paragraph. In short though, the removed
commands are removed *from the cgi's* because it's far too dangerous
to allow such things over the web. Nagios will still process them if
they are submitted to the command-pipe, but the CGI's can no longer
write such commands to said pipe.

3.0.5 is vulnerable to CSRF. 3.0.6 (which adds in-form session tokens to
cmd.cgi, which processes all commands from the web-forms), is not vulnerable
to CSRF.

3.0.5 fixes the authorization bypass discussed in CVE-2008-5027, where an
authenticated user can submit commands he/she was not supposed to be able
to submit. However, by blocking the CHANGE_ set of commands, the worst-case
impact of the CSRF was drastically reduced, and the change to blocking those
commands was also a part of 3.0.5.

I'm afraid Ethan (the Nagios maintainer) got it wrong in the changelog,
which is why, I presume, there's so much confusion right now.

I wrote the patches for it though, so I think it's safe to say I know what
patch (and version) fixed what.
