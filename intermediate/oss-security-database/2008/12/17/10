Neither can I.  I'm not sure if we need to clean up the CVE descriptions
or not.

Note that general CVE practice is - if you have vuln X in version 1, and
you don't completely fix X, then we give a separate CVE for version 2.

In this case, I'd probably want to modify CVE-2008-5028 to say it's
related to "submission of external commands" which is in the 3.0.6
changelog, then refer to the original, pre-3.0.5 CSRF as the "Tim
Starling" bug or something like that.
