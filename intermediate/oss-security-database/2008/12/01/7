CVE-2008-5286 - CUPS PNG overflow

CVE-2008-5301 - dovecot-managesieve directory traversal

CVE-2008-5302, CVE-2008-5303 - Perl issues (read details below)

CVE-2008-5285 - Wireshark SMTP DoS


Regarding the Perl issues: as seen in this list and elsewhere, there seems
to be a ton of confusion about which CVE's were originally fixed (or not),
and which CVE's have since reappeared (or not), and which versions of Perl
and File::Path are or are not affected, plus Eygene's commentary on other
race conditions.

I've chosen to anchor the CVE descriptions based on Niko Tyni's commentary
in http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/perl/porters/233695#233695 and
have blended in some other comments, so hopefully we have a reasonable
place to start from.

Wireshark 1.0.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service via a long SMTP request, which triggers an infinite loop.

Reference: BID:32518
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/32518

Integer overflow in the _cupsImageReadPNG function in CUPS 1.1.17
through 1.3.9 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
PNG image with a large height value, which bypasses a validation check
and triggers a buffer overflow.

Race condition in the rmtree function in File::Path 1.08 and 2.07
(lib/File/Path.pm) in Perl 5.8.8 and 5.10.0 allows local users to
create arbitrary setuid binaries via a symlink attack, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2005-0448, CVE-2004-0452, and CVE-2008-2827.
NOTE: this is a regression error related to CVE-2005-0448.  It is
different from CVE-2008-5303 due to affected versions.
