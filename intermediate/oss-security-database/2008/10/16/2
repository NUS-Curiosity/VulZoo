Subject: CVE request - Vim netrw.plugin

Hello Steve,


  summarizing till today known information about the Vim netrw.vim
plugin issues.

1. issue:
=========

* Original advisories: http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.html
                       http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-netrw.v2.html

* CVE id: CVE-2008-3076 already used in rPath advisory
          http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7

* Testcases: netrw.v2 (the 'mz' command issue)
             netrw.v3 (the 'mc' command issue)
             netrw.v4 (the "D' command issue)

* Steps to reproduce:

  1, The 'mz' command (testcase netrw.v2)
     a, Open directory containing a file with malicious name
     b, Point the cursor to line with this file
     c, In Vim shell type  ":normal mfmz" (selects this file to be compressed/decompressed)
     d, Close Vim ":q"

     Result: In vulnerable Vim versions file isn't (de)compressed and "pwned" file is
             created.

     Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.2alpha+
     Not affected Vim versions:
       -- Vim 7.0, 7.1 affected only in case you manually reinstall
          older version of netrw.vim via vimball.
                            manually reinstall older (vul
       -- Vim 6.0 not affected (netrw.vim not shipped there).
     Affected netrw.vim plugin versions: 111 <= x <= 123

     Proposed solution: Should stay as a part of CVE-2008-3076.

   2, The 'mc' command (testcase netrw.v3)
      a, Open directory containing a file with malicious name
      b, Select some directory as move/copy target (moving via ../)
      c, Mark this directory as move/copy target, i.e in Vim
         shell perform command ":normal mfmt"
         (new line containing "Copy/Move Tgt: selected_directory"
          should appear)
      d, In Vim return to directory containing file with malicious
         filename
      e, Point the cursor to line containing this filename
      f, In Vim perform copy command, i.e. in Vim shell
         "normal mfmc"
      g, Close Vim ":q"

      Result: Vulnerable Vim and netrw.vim versions don't copy the file,
              "pwned" file is created.

      Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.2alpha+
      Not affected Vim versions:
        -- Vim 7.0, Vim 7.1 affected only in case you manually reinstall
           older version of netrv.vim via vimball.
        -- Vim 6.0 not affected (netrw.vim not shipped there).
      Affected netrw.vim plugin versions: 113 <= x <= 122

      Proposed solution: Should stay as a part of CVE-2008-3076.

   3, The 'D' command (testcase netrw.v4)
      a, Open directory containing a file with malicious name
      b, Point the cursor to the "executable' part of the
         filename (i.e. "eval `echo 0:64617465203e3e2070776e6564 | xxd -r`)
      c, Press the 'D' key
      d, Confirm the deletion request with 'y'.
      e, Close Vim ":q"

      Result: Vulnerable Vim and netrw.vim versions don't delete the file,
              "pwned" file is created.

      Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.0, Vim 7.1 (affected every time,
                             no manual reinstallation of older netrw.vim
                             plugin needed).
      Not affected Vim versions:
        -- Vim.6.0 (netrw.vim not shipped there).
        -- Vim 7.2 (already fixed).
      Affected vim.netrw plugin versions: 102 <= x <= 123

      Proposed solution: Should be split into a new CVE id (and possibly
                         merged with netrw.v5 issue as it affects Vim 7.0,
                         Vim 7.1 and is fixed in Vim 7.2 as the netrw.v5 issue).

* Action: Formulate CVE-2008-3076 as covering the 'mz' and 'mc' command issues.
          Merge the 'D' command issue with new CVE id allocated to netrw.v5
          issue (as both of these issues affect Vim 7.0, 7.1 and are already
          fixed in Vim 7.2).

* Affected Vim versions: Vim 7.0, Vim 7.1
  Not affected Vim versions:

Hope has answered questions from: http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/01/1

Steve, could you please:  1, join netrw 'mz' and 'mc' commnad issues under CVE-2008-3076,
                          2, allocate a new CVE id and merge the 'D' command issue and
                             netrw.v5 issue under this new CVE (as these two both affect
                             Vim 7.0 and 7.1) and
                          3, allocate a new CVE id for the Vim netrw: FTP user credentials
                             disclosure issue?

Jan, your comments are appreciated.
