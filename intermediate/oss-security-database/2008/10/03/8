I usually wouldn't call it a vulnerability, either.  However, based on our
analysis, the String.fromCharCode(550) creates a Unicode string for
character 550, but the escape() for URL encoding can only cover 0 to 255,
so it seemed like something else was going on here, maybe the alert
function not working.

I don't know how Javascript manages large strings, but it seems like
somewhere around the "x4 += x4;" statement, you exceed multiple gigs.  So
maybe the alert function isn't even being reached...
