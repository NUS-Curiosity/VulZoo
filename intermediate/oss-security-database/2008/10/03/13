Subject: Re: CVE Request (xen)


We wrote this up as a libvirt issue, but is it really a Xen issue?

libvirt 0.3.3 relies on files located under subdirectories of
/local/domain in xenstore despite lack of protection against
modification by Xen guest virtual machines, which allows guest OS
users to have an unspecified impact, as demonstrated by writing to (1)
the text console (console/tty) or (2) the VNC port for the graphical
framebuffer.


Analysis:

There are two perspectives on the problem. First, one can argue that the
flaw is in libvirt, because libvirt relies on untrusted data from guest
VMs. Second, one can argue that the flaw is in Xen, because Xen makes it
possible for guest VMs to write the untrusted data. Because the CVE
request is associated with a Red Hat bug report for the libvirt product,
CVE takes the first perspective.
