Subject: libxml2 "ampproblem" DoS

Hey,

I did not look into this issue closely yet, but I can reproduce an OOM 
situation on libxml2 2.7.1, but not on 2.6.32.

The malicious XML file can be found on
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=554660

I'm not sure if and how this is related to CVE-2008-3281.
