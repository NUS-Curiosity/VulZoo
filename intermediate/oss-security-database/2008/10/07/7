This seems to be the case.  Josh Bressers, can you confirm? CVE-2007-3073
is associated with comment #16 in bug 367428, but later comments for bug
367428 seem to suggest it's the same (or almost the same) as bug 380994.

If these are dupes, then CVE-2008-4067 would be preferred due to usage by
more authoritative sources, and more commonly referenced.
