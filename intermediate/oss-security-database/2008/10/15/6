So the jhead changelog only acknowledges "potential string overflows".

John's comment in bug 271020 alludes to various other types of issues, but
specifics are unknown.  And there are some references to other overflows
that may or may not have been fixed by upstream.

So, we'd need multiple CVEs, but how many is unclear.

1 - long -cmd
2 - unsafe temp file creation
3 - "more unchecked buffers" and "unsafe buffer sized strcat's in
    ModifyDescriptComment"  [this assumes that upstream only fixed
    issue 1)
4 - shell escapes


Without knowing what exactly is being reported and fixed, it's pretty
difficult to assign CVEs, especially with phrases like "more unchecked
buffers" that could apply to anything.


Use CVE-2008-4575 for the "long -cmd" ONLY - and whatever other overflows
the upstream developer fixed.  (That is, CVE-2008-4575 is focusing on what
was fixed by upstream, not what's in the Ubuntu bug report).
