Subject: CVE Request: incomplete fix for CVE-2010-1000 in KDE network

A bug was filed in Ubuntu[1] for patches[2][3] that went into KDE
Network for an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-1000. The commit message is:

"Further addresses CVE-2010-1000. The file name of Metalink File is
checked a better way, making it work under more conditions."

While the previous patch fixed things like '../../tmp/gotcha', it did
not fix a single leading '../'.
