Subject: CVE Request -- oprofile -- Local privilege escalation via crafted
 opcontrol event parameter when authorized by sudo


Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   It was found that oprofile profiling system did not properly sanitize
the content of event argument, provided to oprofile profiling control
utility (opcontrol). If a local unprivileged user was authorized by
sudoers file to run the opcontrol utility, they could use the flaw
to escalate their privileges (execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the privileged system user, root). Different vulnerability than
CVE-2006-0576.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.

P.S.: Oprofile is not encouraged to be run under sudo, but still
       should not allow escalation of privileges.
