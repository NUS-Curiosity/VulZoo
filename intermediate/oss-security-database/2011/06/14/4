I'll come up with a patch... though I am not sure if it shouldn't be
done by distributions, which usually ship their own system-wide
gitweb config file.

Note that with $prevent_xss enabled gitweb is a bit poorer in features:
no support for $GIT_DIR/README.html, no using gitweb as deploy platform.
XSS threat level for gitweb isn't high, I think - there is nothing to
steal.

Already done in

  [PATCH] gitweb: Make $prevent_xss protection for 'blob_plain' more usable

  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/175057/focus=175604

It is in git repository as
