Subject: ffmpeg issues

Hi,

We're trying to figure out the status of ffmpeg in debian [0].  Does
anyone have any real info on CVE-2011-2160 (whose CVE page is in
essence completely empty) [1].  BTW, how is a link to the software's
homepage considered a confirmation of the issue?

Also, CVE-2011-2162 [2] seems to be a rehash of a bunch of CVE ids
that happened to be in the recent dump of Mandriva advisories.  
Shouldn't this get REJECTED since its just a collection of already
known and tracked issues?

Thanks,
Mike
