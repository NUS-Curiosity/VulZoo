Subject: Re: CVE Request: Missing input sanitation in various X GLX calls

For more information on this, please see our bugzilla entry:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-4818

I emailed ajax about this and it doesn't seem to be quite as scary as it sounds, and the bug has a good analysis of the various patches noted in the upstream bug report.
