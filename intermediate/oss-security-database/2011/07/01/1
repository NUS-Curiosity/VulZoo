Subject: Re: CVE request: Joomla unspecified information
 disclosure vulnerability

In 1.5.22, the following files trigger Path Disclosure issue:

1. /templates/system/error.php

because in 1.5.23, the following validation check was added:

if (!isset($this->error)) {
	$this->error = JError::raiseWarning( 403, JText::_('ALERTNOTAUTH') );
	$this->debug = false;
}

There must be some cases where $this->error might be undefined,
triggering path disclosure.


2. /administrator/components/com_media/views/media/view.html.php

There is another path disclosure in $base variable in com_media of
administrator backend.


/////////////////////////////////
		if(DS == '\\')
		{
			$base = str_replace(DS,"\\\\",COM_MEDIA_BASE);
		} else {
			$base = COM_MEDIA_BASE;
		}

		$js = "
			var basepath = '".$base."';
			var viewstyle = '".$style."';
		" ;
////////////////////////////////

COM_MEDIA_BASE is set to a part of JPATH_ROOT which is dirname(),
causing to reveal full path.

> I think this deserves own CVE-identifier as Joomla did announce security vulnerability. As far as I know the vulnerability was described as "Information Disclosure" not patch disclosure. Path disclosures should be fixed from software also, but usually it is a problem in web-server configuration. Do you have more information about issue CVE-2011-2488? Still no reply from Joomla security team regarding issue CVE-2011-2488. I asked more details nearly a week ago.
