These issues were found by Tarjei Mandt, and are described in this blog post:
http://mista.nu/blog/author/mista/

CVE-2011-2300 allows gaining elevated privileges within a Windows
guest due to a vulnerability in the Windows Guest Additions.
CVE-2011-2305 allows executing arbitrary code on the host due to a
vulnerability in the VirtualBox graphics stack.

Tarjei found these issues via code auditing, so it follows that they
affect the open source version of VirtualBox.
