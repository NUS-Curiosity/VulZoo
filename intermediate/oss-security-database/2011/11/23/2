Subject: CVE Request --  1) Namazu v2.0.21: XSS flaw by processing HTTP cookies
 2) Namazu v2.0.20: Stack-based buffer overflow by replacing blank "uri" field
 value

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   based on:
   [1] https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=391259
   [2] http://www.namazu.org/security.html.en

the following two issues (when compared against [3]) doesn't
seem to have CVE ids yet:
I) There is cross-site scripting vulnerability for IE 6,7 in version 
2.0.20 or older.

    References:
    http://www.namazu.org/#stable
    http://www.namazu.org/security.html#cross-site-scripting

    Further issue details are described in:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=756348

    Note: A CVE-2011-* identifier should be assigned for this.
    =====

II) To 2.0.19 or a version that is older than 2.0.19, there is a 
vulnerability of overrunning in the buffer. It recommends since Namazu 
2.0.20 to be used.

    Further issue details are described in:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=756341

    Note: A CVE-2009-* identifier should be assigned to this.
    =====

Could you allocate two CVE ids (one CVE-2011-*, the other CVE-2009-*)
for these two flaws?

According to:
[3] http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=namazu

the last CVE id, assigned for Namazu, was CVE-2008-1468 for the
"XSS UTF-7" issue, which corresponds to:

"To 2.0.17 or a version that is older than 2.0.17 There is a weakness of 
retrieval type by the misidentification of the encode automatic 
operation recognition of Web browser that is the UTF-7 encoding. It 
recommends since 2.0.18 as much as possible to be used." record
from [2].

Should you need any further details due these two, let me know.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
