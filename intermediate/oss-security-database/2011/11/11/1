Note the attached patch can still be exploited; if the file changes from
a standard file to a hard link / symlink between the lstat and the
fchown then lightdm can be fooled into thinking it's safe when it's
not.  A malicious program could sit there creating a file, deleting it,
then creating a link as fast as possible and eventually it would work. 
We need an atomic operation like lchown, and if that doesn't work the
only safe thing I can think of doing is a) nothing (requiring the user
to manually fix the bug) or b) delete the file (could delete information
set by other programs).
