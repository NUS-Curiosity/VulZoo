Subject: CVE assigned for gdb: arbitrary code execution via .debug_gdb_scripts

This issue is now public.

gdb: arbitrary code execution via .debug_gdb_scripts

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=703238

Vincent Danen 
It was discovered [1],[2] the the GNU Debugger (gdb) would load
untrusted files
from the current working directory when .debug_gdb_scripts was defined. 
While
this was a design decision, it is an insecure one and users who do not
pre-inspect untrusted files may execute arbitrary code with their
privileges.
