CVE-2011-2708 and CVE-2011-2710 are both about 20110701 XSS vulnerability: http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/357-20110701-xss-vulnerability.html and I have already contacted MITRE twice to get another one marked as obsolete.

This new is about: 20110601 XSS Vulnerabilities: http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/349-20110601-xss-vulnerabilities.html

Sorry, but I don't know where to find SVN/GIT/CVS logs.
