Yes, this one. It is not currently applied in the master branch yet:

It contains only a partial fix, mirroring what happened with CGI.pm.

That's not it, that's separate.

Lincoln is the primary maintainer of CGI.pm, but I have upload rights.
However, we haven't heard from recently. A week ago I asked again for
his input and notified him that I would upload a new release myself I
hadn't heard from him in another week. That time has come now-- I will
plan to upload a new release of CGI.pm in the next 24 hours.
