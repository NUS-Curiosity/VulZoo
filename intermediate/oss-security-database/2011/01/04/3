sctp: Fix a race between ICMP protocol unreachable and connect()

     ICMP protocol unreachable handling completely disregarded
     the fact that the user may have locked the socket.  It proceeded
     to destroy the association, even though the user may have
     held the lock and had a ref on the association.
[...]
     This was because the sctp_wait_for_connect() would aqcure the socket
     lock and then proceed to release the last reference count on the
     association, thus cause the fully destruction path to finish freeing
     the socket.

This affects kernels v2.6.11-rc2 and above.

Thanks, Eugene
