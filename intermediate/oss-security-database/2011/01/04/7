I'm going to give this four. We *might* be able to get away with two, but
since they're all in quite different bits of code, I'm betting the affected
versions are different, and it's likely upstream is going to fix these all
at different times in their SCM.

CVE-2010-4540 gimp LIGHTING EFFECTS > LIGHT plugin stack buffer overflow
CVE-2010-4541 gimp SPHERE DESIGNER plugin stack buffer overflow
CVE-2010-4542 gimp GFIG plugin stack buffer overflow
CVE-2010-4543 gimp heap overflow read_channel_data() in file-psp.c

Thanks.
