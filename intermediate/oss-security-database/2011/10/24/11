Indeed, the text on the CVE page is entirely bogus.  I'd recommend using this
text, from our advisory:

The places where the FreeBSD advisory mentions linux emulation relate only to
the non-security bugfix which we rolled into the patch for the sake of avoiding
breakage.

(Is there anyone on the list who can fix the CVE description?  If not, I'll
poke the CVE folks directly.)
