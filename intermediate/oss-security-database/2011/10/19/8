web site.

> 1, Session manipulation,

CVE-2011-4136

> 2, Denial of service attack via URLField,

CVE-2011-4137

> 3, URLField redirection,

3a. "no validation of the resulting redirected URL is performed,
    including basic checks for supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS
    and FTP) ... This issue is ultimately rooted in a bug in
    Python itself"

    CVE-2011-1521

3b. "although the initial request issued by Django uses the HEAD
    method for HTTP/HTTPS, the request to the target of the
    redirect is issued using GET. This may create further issues
    for systems which implicitly trust GET requests from the
    local machine/network."

    CVE-2011-4138

> 4, Host header cache poisoning,

CVE-2011-4139

> 5, Host header and CSRF,

CVE-2011-4140

This one is not a vulnerability for CVE.

> 7, DEBUG pages and sensitive POST data
