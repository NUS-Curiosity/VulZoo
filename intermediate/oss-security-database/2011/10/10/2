According to mentioned CVE, there is vulnerability in awredir.pl in AWStats before 6.95.
This vulnerability was fixed in 6.95 by adding key parameter which is generated from secret
$KEYFORMD5 and url so that awredir.pl is not open redirector by default any more.

Do you find the problem that key is md5 hash so that it might be somehow vulnerable
to dictionary attack? Or that administrator can blank $KEYFORMD5 and create open redirector?


Thanks,

Petr
