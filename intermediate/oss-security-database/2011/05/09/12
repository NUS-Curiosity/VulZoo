I'm not sure I'd call this one security. It's a crash only from what I can
see:

https://code.google.com/p/libarchive/source/detail?r=1984&path=/trunk/libarchive/archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c

It's just silly input to a format string. If you want one I'll assign it
though.

This one needs a 2010 ID.
Use CVE-2010-4666

> http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/source/detail?r=3160

Use CVE-2011-1778

I'm going to give this an ID, I'd rather have it revoked than not assigned.

Use CVE-2011-1779

Thanks.
