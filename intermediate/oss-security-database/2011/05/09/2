Subject: CVE-2011-1771 kernel: cifs oops when creating file with O_DIRECT
 set

CIFS does not do O_DIRECT, so when you open a file with it, you will 
trigger a NULL pointer dereference. This is a regression introduced with 
the patchset to clean up filehandle management in CIFS. The fix checks 
for a NULL filp->private_data before trying to dereference it.
