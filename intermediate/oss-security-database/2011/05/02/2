Subject: Re: CVE Request -- gnome-desktop3: Switching users
 dialog does not lock the screen for the original user account

Hi Steve, Josh,

It turned out that this issue is with gnome-screensaver-dialog, and this
does not kill the screensaver at all.
Hence is not a security issue.

Can we please have this CVE rejected? Thanks.
