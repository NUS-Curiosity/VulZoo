While I have not personally applied for the closed vendor list, our current
security contact has.  I thought I would attempt to explain briefly what we
publicly disclose and what we do not.  If this changes your stance on allowing
us into the closed list that is fine, if not then keep this as background
information for the future.

Wind River provides a public RSS feed with the advisories for our currently
supported products.  However, to get to the download you need to be a customer.
 The information in the RSS feed is accurate as to the description of the issue,
the only thing not published is the fixes themselves (note, these fixes don't
make sense if you are not a Wind River customer) along with installation notes.

The RSS feeds for our three currently support product versions are:

Wind River Linux 2.x : http://www.windriver.com/feeds/wrlinux_200.xml

Wind River Linux 3.x : http://www.windriver.com/feeds/wrlinux_300.xml

Wind River Linux 4.x : http://www.windriver.com/feeds/wrlinux_400.xml


What is in these RSS feeds?  We have two primary items in the list.

1) The first is a security bulletin.  The purpose of this is to simply tell
customers what issues we are aware of, if the issue affects our product(s), if
we are working on a fix [or not].  (This is similar to a CVE list...)

2) Individual patches for specific problems.  Note, not all of the issues here
are security related.  If they are we have always followed the rules of
disclosure according to how we have found our specific issues.  [i.e. CERT has
one set of rules, vendor-sec had another, customers may have a different set.. etc.]


I'll focus on the individual service packs, as that most closely represents an
update as mentioned above.

For example for the RSS feed for 4.x has the recent entry of:

By following the link to the customer support site (and logging in as a

the RSS feed:  (I apologize for the formatting, but this should explain what we
have...)
