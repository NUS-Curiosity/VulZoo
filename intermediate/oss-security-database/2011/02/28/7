Subject: CVE request: kernel: OOM-killer via argv expansion

Hi,

I think the flaw[1] with argv-expansion triggering the OOM-killer
incorrectly needs its own CVE.

While the stack guard page and the fixes[2] for CVE-2010-3858 certainly
improved things, argv expansion can still be tricked into OOM-killing the
entire system. Solutions were discussed on the original thread, but
were not finished. Recently a set of patches[3] has been re-proposed to fix
this issue. Regardless, it should probably get its own CVE assigned.

Thanks,

-Kees
