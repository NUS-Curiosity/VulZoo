Subject: CVE request: kernel: CAP_SYS_MODULE bypass via CAP_NET_ADMIN

Hi,

While not as bad as CVE-2010-4661 (unprivileged module loading)
I'd like to get a CVE assigned for this issue for tracking purposes:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/24/203

Basically "ifconfig $module" will load any module as long as the process
has CAP_NET_ADMIN (ignoring CAP_SYS_MODULE).
