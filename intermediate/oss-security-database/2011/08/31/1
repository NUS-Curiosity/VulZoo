Subject: Re: CVE request: heap overflow in tcptrack < 1.4.2


I'm wondering if this should have received a CVE.

https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=377917 quotes upstream:

    "This fixes a heap overflow in the parsing of the command line...
     this may have security repercussions if
     tcptrack is configured as a handler for other applications that can
     pass user-supplied command line input to tcptrack."

The "attack" is through a command line argument.  While it's listed as a 
sniffer, the above text suggests that tcptrack might not be 
setuid/privileged, since the only given scenario is "as a handler for 
other applications."  Unless this is a typical/known scenario, this seems 
like just another unprivileged application, in which case the control over 
a command line argument would not directly cross privilege boundaries, 
thus falling into the realm of "bug" and not "vulnerability."
