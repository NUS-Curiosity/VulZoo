Subject: CVE-2011-4862 is not BSD-specific

This is just a heads-up: CVE-2011-4862, a pre-authentication buffer
overflow in telnetd recently fixed by FreeBSD is not BSD-specific.  It
seems to have been added at MIT when the BSD telnetd was Kerberized,
and it ended up in the Heimdal recryptofication of Kerberos (from
where FreeBSD got it) and later in GNU inetutils.  I have reproduced a
pre-authentication segfault with both versions (as shipped by Debian).

The telnetd from netkit does not appear to be affected.
