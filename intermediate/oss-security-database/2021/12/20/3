Subject: CVE-2021-44224: Apache HTTP Server: Possible NULL dereference or SSRF in forward proxy
 configurations in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 and earlier 

Severity: moderate

Description:

A crafted URI sent to httpd configured as a forward proxy (ProxyRequests on) can cause a crash (NULL pointer dereference) or, for configurations mixing forward and reverse proxy declarations, can allow for requests to be directed to a declared Unix Domain Socket endpoint (Server Side Request Forgery).

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.7 up to 2.4.51 (included).
