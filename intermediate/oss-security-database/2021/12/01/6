Thunderbird 91.3.0 had shipped a workaround, that should protect against 
the most risky attack vector (executing the vulnerable code path when 
importing certificates contained in a received S/MIME message).

The workaround commits are here:
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/comm-esr91/rev/54507526da82
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/comm-esr91/rev/bea1eb4e98a3

We intend to add a separate CVE to the corresponding tracking bug
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1738501
and also amend the release notes of the 91.3.0 release.

In addition, to ensure that potential secondary attack vectors will be 
protected as well, it is recommended that Thunderbird uses NSS binaries 
that contain the NSS level patch. The Thunderbird team will ship NSS 
3.68.1 in the upcoming 91.4.0 release.
