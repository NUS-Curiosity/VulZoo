I think that this is an excellent point: RedHat shouldn't be reporting
issues for "Linux Kernel" then. Look at the subject of this mail:

	CVE-2021-20219 Linux kernel: improper synchronization in flush_to_ldisc() can lead to DoS

It doesn't say "Red Hat Linux kernel", it just says "Linux kernel",
right?

Red Hat runs on a forked version of the kernel that has it's own set of
backports, features, and bugs. As you pointed out I think it would make
a lot of sense if they would instead start assigning CVEs for "Red Hat
Linux Kernel".
