I'm really not sure how to respond to this. I don't own upstream, my
name isn't Linus, Greg, nor do I maintain a major subsystem. I don't
have any control over how upstream commits look like.

This isn't a claim that that process is perfect, this is just me saying
that you're barking up the wrong tree. I'd happily add that Linus's
"obfuscated" commit messages are making things more difficult for me,
but again - I can't control what he does.

Which is why I can type what I typed with a straight face: I'm trying to
improve the oss-sec process, I'm not in any way claiming the upstream is
superior or anything. I'm not sure why you're personally attacking me
here for the upstream process.

I don't usually discover security vulnerabilities these days. I did in
the past and those were assigned CVE numbers.

Otherwise, I don't do analysis of a security impact of a fix.

Could you specify what actions *I* did to hurt the world?

Can you please stop complaining about Greg's mails as if I was the one
who wrote them? I'm not his alter-ego, twin, or so on. If you have a
concern with what he writes take it up with him.

My concern with the notifications is that some of them don't even
include a commit id, I never claimed (nor will) claim that stable
already fixed them all. On the contrary, I want that commit id to make
sure we did.

Great, let's work together on making it better, but it's been following
the same pattern for quite a while now.
