Subject: CVE-2021-20219 Linux kernel: improper synchronization
 in flush_to_ldisc() can lead to DoS

Hello Team,

A denial of service vulnerability was found in n_tty_receive_char_special
in drivers/tty/n_tty.c of the Linux kernel.  In this flaw a local attacker
with a normal user privilege could delay the loop (due to a changing
ldata->read_head, and a missing sanity check) and cause a threat to the
system availability.

'CVE-2021-20219' was assigned by Red Hat.
