Subject: ISC has disclosed a vulnerability in BIND (CVE-2021-25218)

On August 18, 2021, we (Internet Systems Consortium) have disclosed a
vulnerability affecting our BIND software:

    CVE-2021-25218: A too-strict assertion check could be triggered when
    responses in BIND 9.16.19 and 9.17.16 require UDP fragmentation if
    RRL is in use

    https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2021-25218

New versions of BIND are available from https://www.isc.org/downloads

Operators and package maintainers who prefer to apply patches selectively can
find individual vulnerability-specific patches in the "patches" subdirectory
of the release directories for our two affected release branches (9.16 and 9.17)
The BIND 9.11 branch was not affected by CVE-2021-25218.

   9.16: https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.16.20/patches/
   9.17: https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.17.17/patches/

With the public announcement of this vulnerability, the embargo
period is ended and any updated software packages that have been
prepared may be released.
