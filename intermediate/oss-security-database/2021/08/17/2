I wonder if it would actually be better the other way around, but
leaving the decision to MITRE CNA and Red Hat: Several downstream
Linux distrubutions seem to have already used CVE-2021-3587 in their
advisories, so rejecting CVE-2021-38208 would seem to cause less
turnarounds). But I have a biased view here, at least Debian, Ubuntu,
Slackware, Fedora and Mageia used already accordingly CVE-2021-3587.
