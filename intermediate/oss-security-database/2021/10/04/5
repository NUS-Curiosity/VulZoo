Subject: Moby (Docker Engine) CVE-2021-41089

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy files
using docker cp into a specially-crafted container can result in Unix
file permission changes for existing files in the host's filesystem,
widening access to others. This bug does not directly allow files to be
read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process.

Patches
This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9. Users should
update to this version as soon as possible. Running containers do not
need to be restarted.

Workarounds
Ensure you only run trusted containers.
