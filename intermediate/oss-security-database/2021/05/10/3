It seems b166a20b07382b8bc1dcee2a448715c9c2c81b5b got reverted in the
follow-up commit
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/sctp/socket.c?id=01bfe5e8e428b475982a98a46cca5755726f3f7f
and so 34e5b01186858b36c4d7c87e1a025071e8e2401f would appear to be the
most correct fix from what I can tell.
