Thanks, Norbert!

I'm attaching files from the above link to this message for archival,
per this content guideline:

https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines

"At least the most essential part of your message (e.g., vulnerability
detail and/or exploit) should be directly included in the message itself
(and in plain text), rather than only included by reference to an
external resource.  Posting links to relevant external resources as well
is acceptable, but posting only links is not.  Your message should
remain valuable even with all of the external resources gone."
