Subject: Prometheus 2.26.1-2.27.1 released to fix an Open Redirect security
 issue

Hello,

The Prometheus team has released bugfix releases about an Open Redirect
(CWE-601) security issue.
The issue has been assigned the CVE number CVE-2021-29622.

---

In 2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui. To ensure a
seamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new redirect to /.
Due to a bug in the code, it is possible for an attacker to craft an URL
that can redirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint.

If a user visits a prometheus server with a specially crafted address
(e.g.: http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/new<url>), they can be redirected to an
arbitrary URL.

e.g. if a user visits
http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/newhttp://www.google.com/, they will be
redirected to http://google.com.

The security issue affects Prometheus v2.23.0 to v2.26.0, and v2.27.0.
