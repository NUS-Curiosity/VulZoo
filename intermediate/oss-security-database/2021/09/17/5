Subject: Re: Oracle Solaris membership in the distros list

Hi Alan,

Thank you for submitting a thorough application.  This provides a good
example for other projects applying for (linux-)distros membership.

Please consider this approved, and please e-mail me off-list with a list
of e-mail addresses and PGP keys to use for Oracle Solaris subscription
to the distros list.

Please do.  I've just listed Oracle Solaris for this task on the wiki.

Yes, I had thought of this problem too - and yes, I think it would be
helpful to the community if more issues were brought in here.  Please
feel free to help with that.  Thank you!

I'm not sure if we can/should list this as one of the contributing-back
tasks because it has no clear scope.
