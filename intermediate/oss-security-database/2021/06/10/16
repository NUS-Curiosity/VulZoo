This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

Hi,

in fact it was fixed in 2.4.47, BUT this version was never announced and 
has never been visible from the httpd.apache.org website.

So from an end-user point of view if was really fixed in 2.4.48 (and 
2.4.47 does not exist).

We'll clarify internally how we should proceed in such cases to avoid 
such questions.
The information should be consistent wherever you look for it.

Hope this clarify the situation.

Best regards,

CJ
