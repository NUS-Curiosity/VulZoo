Subject: CVE-2021-26697: Apache Airflow: Lineage API endpoint for Experimental
 API missed authentication check

Description:

The lineage endpoint of the deprecated Experimental API was not
protected by authentication in Airflow 2.0.0. This allowed
unauthenticated users to hit that endpoint.

This is low-severity CVE as the attacker needs to be aware of certain
parameters to pass to that endpoint and even after can just get some
metadata about a DAG and a Task.

This issue affects Apache Airflow 2.0.0.

Credit:

Apache Airflow would like to thank Ian Carroll for reporting this issue.
