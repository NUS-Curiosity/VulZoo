Subject: CVE-2021-20200: Linux kernel: close race between munmap() and expand_upwards()/downwards()

Hello Team,

A use-after-free flaw may be seen due to a race problem while in
detach_vmas_to_be_unmapped() in mm/mmap.c in VMA access while
munmap(). This flaw could allow a local attacker with a user privilege
to crash the system, because VMA with VM_GROWSDOWN or VM_GROWSUP flag
set may change their size under mmap_read_lock(). This vulnerability
could even lead to a kernel information leak problem.


'CVE-2021-20200' was assigned by Red Hat.
