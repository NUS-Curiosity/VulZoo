Subject: Vulnerability in the Linux Audit Framework Auditd

Dear Sir or Madam,

my name is Felix Kosterhon and i am Cyber Defense Analyst at SECUINFRA GmbH, Germany. 

We discovered a security vulnerability in the Linux Audit Framework (Auditd). During our research we discovered that the usage of a certain open-syscall (open_by_handle_at) is not covered by the current file watch implementation of Auditd. This allows a local attacker with elevated privileges (CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability) to read and modify files without being noticed by the implemented Auditd file watches.

We disclosed our finding to RedHat, Inc. in November and it will be published today, Feb 18, under CVE-2020-35501. As suggested by RedHat, Inc., we want to inform you about this security flaw. If you have any further questions, we are happy to help you.

We would also like to subscribe to your mailing list to stay informed about current security topics.

Best Regards,

 

Felix Kosterhon
