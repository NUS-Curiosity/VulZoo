Subject: CVE-2021-26720: avahi-daemon: 'avahi' to 'root' user privilege
 escalation through Debian specific if-up script avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh

Hello list,

the avahi-daemon package [1] in Debian Linux contains a Debian specific
script installed in

    /usr/lib/avahi/avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh

This script is run as 'root' via the if-up.d script in

    /etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-daemon

There are security issues in the code of the main shell script in this
context. The $RUNDIR "/run/avahi-daemon" is owned by the unprivileged
avahi:avahi user/group. This fact is also enforced in the script via its
`ensure_rundir()` function.

In line 136

    `touch ${DISABLE_TAG}`

symlinks are followed in "/run/avahi-daemon/disabled-for-unicast-local".
Thus the unprivileged 'avahi' user can trigger an arbitrary file to be
created or an arbitrary file's timestamp updated when this script runs.

Similarly in line 94

    `cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep "nameserver" | sort > ${TMP_CACHE} || return 0`

symlinks are followed in "/run/avahi-daemon/checked_nameservers.<PID>",
which is a predictable path. Content from /etc/resolv.conf will be
written to this location. This would allow for denial of service by
overwriting arbitrary existing files.

SUSE Linux distributions ship an outdated copy of this script in the avahi
package [2] that is also affected by these issues.

To fix these issues I consider it best to run the script as the avahi
user and group by dropping privileges in
"/etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-daemon" via tools like `setpriv` or `su`.

I privately reported this issue to the Debian security team on 2021-01-29. If
I understood correctly then Debian Linux will not ship this script in future
releases any more. A bugfix for Debian Buster will be included in the next
point release [3]. Affected packages in maintained SUSE Linux distributions
will also receive bugfixes [4].
