Subject: CVE-2021-35517: Apache Commons Compress 1.1 to 1.20 denial of
 service vulnerability 

Description:

When reading a specially crafted TAR archive, Compress can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out of memory error even for very small inputs. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' tar package.


Mitigation:

Commons Compress users should upgrade to 1.21 or later.
