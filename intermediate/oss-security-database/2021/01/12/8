I think this specific issue is relevant to projects providing container
virtualization with a security boundary, yet letting container root
manage the local iptables rules for the container.  Wade's posting is a
useful heads-up for such projects.  I've just forwarded it to
Virtuozzo/OpenVZ developers, so they don't miss it.

These are good questions.  My guess is most issues simply haven't been
analyzed enough, or not considered at all, for CVE ID (non-)allocation.

Visiting the URLs above, the upstream commit message does not make it
clear the issue's security relevance was understood back then.  Perhaps
it simply was not.  The two Bugzilla entries make the security relevance
much clearer, and are more recent.  So perhaps this is not sudden CVE ID
assignment to an old issue; this is recent new understanding and its
correspondingly timely assignment.

I have no idea why Red Hat in particular looked into this now.  My guess
is it's because the issue was recently reported to Red Hat by some means.
