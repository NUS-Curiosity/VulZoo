            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332
                              version 4

     Rogue guests can cause DoS of Dom0 via high frequency events

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The handling of Xen events in the Linux kernel runs with interrupts
disabled in a loop until no further event is pending.

Whenever an event has been accepted by the kernel, another event can
come in via the same event channel.  This can result in the event
handling loop running for an extended time if new events are coming in
at a high rate.  In extreme cases this can lead to a complete hang of
the kernel, resulting in a DoS situation of the host when dom0 is
affected.

IMPACT
======

Malicious guests can hang the host by sending events to dom0 at a high
frequency.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All systems with a Linux dom0 are affected.

All Linux kernel versions are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julien Grall from Arm

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
