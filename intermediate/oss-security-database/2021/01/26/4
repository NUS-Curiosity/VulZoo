Subject: Xen Security Advisory 360 v2 (CVE-2021-3308) - IRQ vector leak on x86

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2021-3308 / XSA-360
                              version 2

                        IRQ vector leak on x86

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation
of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X
capabilities enabled and entries setup.

Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the
guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the
system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly.

IMPACT
======

HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS)
attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the
hardware domain.  In the latter case this would affect the entire host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions 4.12.3, 4.12.4, and all versions from 4.13.1 onwards are
vulnerable.  Xen version 4.13.0 and all versions up to 4.12.2 are not
affected.

Only x86 systems running HVM guests with PCI pass through devices are
vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Not running HVM guests with PCI pass through devices will avoid the
vulnerability.  Note that even non-malicious guests can trigger this
vulnerability as part of normal operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.
