 of connection history visibility

CVE-2020-11997: Inconsistent restriction of connection history visibility

Versions affected:
Apache Guacamole 1.2.0 and earlier

Description:
Apache Guacamole 1.2.0 and older do not consistently restrict access
to connection history based on user visibility. If multiple users
share access to the same connection, those users may be able to see
which other users have accessed that connection, as well as the IP
addresses from which that connection was accessed, even if those users
do not otherwise have permission to see other users.

Mitigation:
Users of versions of Apache Guacamole 1.2.0 and older should upgrade to 1.3.0.

We would like to thank William Le Berre (Synetis) for reporting this issue.
