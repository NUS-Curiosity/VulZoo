Subject: CVE-2021-26118: Flaw in ActiveMQ Artemis OpenWire support

Description:

While investigating ARTEMIS-2964 it was found that the creation of

Artemis 2.15.0 bypassed policy based access control for the entire
session. Production of advisory messages was not subject to access
control in error.


This issue is being tracked as
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-2964

Mitigation:

Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis 2.16.0
