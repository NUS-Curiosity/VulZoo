Subject: CVE-2015-0224:  qpidd can be crashed by unauthenticated user

    Apache Software Foundation - Security Advisory

       qpidd can be crashed by unauthenticated user

CVE-2015-0224  CVS: 7.8

Severity: Moderate

Vendor:

The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

Apache Qpid's qpidd up to and including version 0.30

Description:

In CVE-2015-0203 it was announced that certain unexpected protocol
sequences cause the broker process to crash due to insufficient
checking, but that authentication could be used to restrict the
exploitation of this vulnerability.

It has now been discovered that in fact failing authentication does
not necessarily prevent exploitation of those reported
vulnerabilities.

Further, it was stated that one of the specific vulnerabilities was
that the qpidd broker can be crashed by sending it a sequence-set
containing an invalid range, where the start of the range is after the
end. This was an incorrect analysis of the vulnerability, which is in
fact caused by a sequence-set containing a single range expressing the
maximum possible gap.

Solution:

A further patch is available that handles a range expressing the
maximum possible gap without assertion
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-6310). The fix will be
included in subsequent releases, but can be applied to 0.30 if
desired.
