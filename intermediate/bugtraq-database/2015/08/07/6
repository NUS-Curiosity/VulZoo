                 CVE-2015-5707

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or
information leak.

CVE-2015-1333

    Colin Ian King discovered a flaw in the add_key function of the
    Linux kernel's keyring subsystem. A local user can exploit this flaw
    to cause a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.

CVE-2015-3212

    Ji Jianwen of Red Hat Engineering discovered a flaw in the handling
    of the SCTPs automatic handling of dynamic multi-homed connections.
    A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a crash or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-4692

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the
    kvm_apic_has_events function in the KVM subsystem. A unprivileged
    local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system kernel
    resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2015-4700

    Daniel Borkmann discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel implementation
    of the Berkeley Packet Filter which can be used by a local user to
    crash the system.

CVE-2015-5364

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
    cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid
    checksums.

CVE-2015-5366

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of
    service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single
    packet with an invalid checksum.

CVE-2015-5697

    A flaw was discovered in the md driver in the Linux kernel leading
    to an information leak.

CVE-2015-5706

    An user triggerable use-after-free vulnerability in path lookup in
    the Linux kernel could potentially lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-5707

    An integer overflow in the SCSI generic driver in the Linux kernel
    was discovered. A local user with write permission on a SCSI generic
    device could potentially exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u3. CVE-2015-1333, CVE-2015-4692 and
CVE-2015-5706 do not affect the wheezy distribution.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u3, except CVE-2015-5364 and CVE-2015-5366
which were fixed already in DSA-3313-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-1 or earlier versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
