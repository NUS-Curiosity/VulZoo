Package        : request-tracker4
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5475

It was discovered that Request Tracker, an extensible trouble-ticket
tracking system is susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack via the
user an group rights management pages (CVE-2015-5475) and via the
cryptography interface, allowing an attacker with a carefully-crafted
key to inject JavaScript into RT's user interface. Installations which
use neither GnuPG nor S/MIME are unaffected by the second cross-site
scripting vulnerability.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.7-5+deb7u4. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only
affected by CVE-2015-5475.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.8-3+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.11-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker4 packages.
