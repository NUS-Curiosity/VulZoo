Package        : icu
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-6585 CVE-2014-8146 CVE-2014-8147 CVE-2015-4760
Debian Bug     : 778511 784773

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the International Components
for Unicode (ICU) library.

CVE-2014-8146

    The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation does not properly
    track directionally isolated pieces of text, which allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow)
    or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text.

CVE-2014-8147

    The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation uses an integer
    data type that is inconsistent with a header file, which allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect malloc
    followed by invalid free) or possibly execute arbitrary code via
    crafted text.

CVE-2015-4760

    The Layout Engine was missing multiple boundary checks. These could
    lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption. A specially crafted
    file could cause an application using ICU to parse untrusted font
    files to crash and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

Additionally, it was discovered that the patch applied to ICU in DSA-3187-1
for CVE-2014-6585 was incomplete, possibly leading to an invalid memory
access. This could allow remote attackers to disclose portion of private
memory via crafted font files.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.8.1.1-12+deb7u3.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.1-8+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 52.1-10.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.1-10.

We recommend that you upgrade your icu packages.
