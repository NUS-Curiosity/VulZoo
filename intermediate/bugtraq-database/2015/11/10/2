Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5307 CVE-2015-7833 CVE-2015-7872 CVE-2015-7990

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service.

CVE-2015-5307

    Ben Serebrin from Google discovered a guest to host denial of
    service flaw affecting the KVM hypervisor. A malicious guest can
    trigger an infinite stream of "alignment check" (#AC) exceptions
    causing the processor microcode to enter an infinite loop where the
    core never receives another interrupt. This leads to a panic of the
    host kernel.

CVE-2015-7833

    Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke and Ralf Spenneberg discovered a
    flaw in the processing of certain USB device descriptors in the
    usbvision driver. An attacker with physical access to the system can
    use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2015-7872

    Dmitry Vyukov discovered a vulnerability in the keyrings garbage
    collector allowing a local user to trigger a kernel panic.

CVE-2015-7990

    It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2015-6937 was incomplete. A
    race condition when sending a message on unbound socket can still
    cause a NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker might be able to
    cause a denial of service (crash) by sending a crafted packet.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u6.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
