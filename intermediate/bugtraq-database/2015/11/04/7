Package        : freeimage
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-0852
Debian Bug     : 797165

Pengsu Cheng discovered that FreeImage, a library for graphic image
formats, contained multiple integer underflows that could lead to a
denial of service: remote attackers were able to trigger a crash by
supplying a specially crafted image.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.15.1-1.1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.15.4-4.2.

For the testing distribution (stretch) and unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 3.15.4-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your freeimage packages.
