Potential Security Impact: Remote Access Restriction Bypass, Increase in
Privilege

Source: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Product Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HPE Helion
Eucalyptus. The vulnerability could be exploited to bypass access permissions
by a remote authenticated user.

Notes:

  - In Eucalyptus, following the AWS model, IAM roles are used to temporarily
allow users or services to access resources within or across accounts. Access
to roles is determined by the role.s trust policy and a set of user
permissions. The trust policy is associated with a role and defines which
accounts or services are allowed to assume the role. User permissions are
defined by the policy associated with the user, and define a set of actions
and resources that the user is allowed to access.

  - An issue has been identified in how Eucalyptus checks user permissions
when allowing a user to assume a role. Given that the grant policy allows the
user.s account to assume the role, any user in that account would be able to
assume the role, even if the user.s policy does not explicitly grant the
AssumeRole permission for the role. As a result, in some cases authenticated
users could gain privileges by assuming an IAM role that they were not
intended to have access to. The impact is mitigated by the fact that the
role.s trust policy still has to explicitly authorize the user.s account to
access the role.
