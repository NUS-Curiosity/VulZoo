 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:063
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : openssl
 Date    : March 27, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in openssl:
 
 The ssl3_get_key_exchange function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL before
 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k allows remote SSL
 servers to conduct RSA-to-EXPORT_RSA downgrade attacks and facilitate
 brute-force decryption by offering a weak ephemeral RSA key in a
 noncompliant role, related to the FREAK issue. NOTE: the scope of
 this CVE is only client code based on OpenSSL, not EXPORT_RSA issues
 associated with servers or other TLS implementations (CVE-2015-0204).
 
 Use-after-free vulnerability in the d2i_ECPrivateKey function in
 crypto/ec/ec_asn1.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r,
 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a might allow remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
 malformed Elliptic Curve (EC) private-key file that is improperly
 handled during import (CVE-2015-0209).
 
 The ASN1_TYPE_cmp function in crypto/asn1/a_type.c in OpenSSL before
 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before
 1.0.2a does not properly perform boolean-type comparisons, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid read operation
 and application crash) via a crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint
 that uses the certificate-verification feature (CVE-2015-0286).
 
 The ASN1_item_ex_d2i function in crypto/asn1/tasn_dec.c in OpenSSL
 before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2
 before 1.0.2a does not reinitialize CHOICE and ADB data structures,
 which might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid
 write operation and memory corruption) by leveraging an application
 that relies on ASN.1 structure reuse (CVE-2015-0287).
 
 The X509_to_X509_REQ function in crypto/x509/x509_req.c in OpenSSL
 before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2
 before 1.0.2a might allow attackers to cause a denial of service
 (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via an invalid
 certificate key (CVE-2015-0288).
 
 The PKCS#7 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before
 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does not
 properly handle a lack of outer ContentInfo, which allows attackers to
 cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application
 crash) by leveraging an application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7
 data and providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, related to
 crypto/pkcs7/pk7_doit.c and crypto/pkcs7/pk7_lib.c (CVE-2015-0289).
 
 The SSLv2 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before
 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (s2_lib.c assertion failure and
 daemon exit) via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message (CVE-2015-0293).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the 1.0.0r version where
 these security flaws has been fixed.
