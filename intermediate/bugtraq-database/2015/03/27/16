 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:076
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : python3
 Date    : March 27, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated python3 packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 ZipExtFile.read goes into 100% CPU infinite loop on maliciously binary
 edited zips (CVE-2013-7338).
 
 A vulnerability was reported in Python&#039;s socket module, due to
 a boundary error within the sock_recvfrom_into() function, which
 could be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.  This could be used
 to crash a Python application that uses the socket.recvfrom_info()
 function or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions
 of the user running vulnerable Python code (CVE-2014-1912).
 
 It was reported that a patch added to Python 3.2 caused a race
 condition where a file created could be created with world read/write
 permissions instead of the permissions dictated by the original umask
 of the process. This could allow a local attacker that could win the
 race to view and edit files created by a program using this call. Note
 that prior versions of Python, including 2.x, do not include the
 vulnerable _get_masked_mode() function that is used by os.makedirs()
 when exist_ok is set to True (CVE-2014-2667).
 
 Python are susceptible to arbitrary process memory reading by a user
 or adversary due to a bug in the _json module caused by insufficient
 bounds checking. The bug is caused by allowing the user to supply a
 negative value that is used an an array index, causing the scanstring
 function to access process memory outside of the string it is intended
 to access (CVE-2014-4616).
 
 The CGIHTTPServer Python module does not properly handle URL-encoded
 path separators in URLs. This may enable attackers to disclose a CGI
 script&#039;s source code or execute arbitrary scripts in the server&#039;s
 document root (CVE-2014-4650).
