Package        : batik
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-0250
Debian Bug     : 780897

Nicolas Gregoire and Kevin Schaller discovered that Batik, a toolkit
for processing SVG images, would load XML external entities by
default. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a
specially crafted SVG file, an attacker could possibly obtain access
to arbitrary files or cause resource consumption.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7+dfsg-3+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.7+dfsg-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your batik packages.
