 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:181
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : drupal
 Date    : March 30, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated drupal packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 An information disclosure vulnerability was discovered in Drupal
 before 7.27. When pages are cached for anonymous users, form state
 may leak between anonymous users. Sensitive or private information
 recorded for one anonymous user could thus be disclosed to other
 users interacting with the same form at the same time (CVE-2014-2983).
 
 Multiple security issues in Drupal before 7.29, including a denial
 of service issue, an access bypass issue in the File module, and
 multiple cross-site scripting issues (CVE-2014-5019, CVE-2014-5020,
 CVE-2014-5021, CVE-2014-5022).
 
 A denial of service issue exists in Drupal before 7.31, due to XML
 entity expansion in a publicly accessible XML-RPC endpoint.
 
 An SQL Injection issue exists in Drupal before 7.32 due to the way
 the Drupal core handles prepared statements. A malicious user can
 inject arbitrary SQL queries, and thereby completely control the
 Drupal site. This vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers
 without any kind of authentication required (CVE-2014-3704).
 
 Aaron Averill discovered that a specially crafted request can give a
 user access to another user&#039;s session, allowing an attacker to hijack
 a random session (CVE-2014-9015).
 
 Michael Cullum, Javier Nieto and Andres Rojas Guerrero discovered
 that the password hashing API allows an attacker to send specially
 crafted requests resulting in CPU and memory exhaustion. This may lead
 to the site becoming unavailable or unresponsive (denial of service)
 (CVE-2014-9016). anonymous users (CVE-2014-9016).
 
 Password reset URLs can be forged under certain circumstances, allowing
 an attacker to gain access to another user&#039;s account without knowing
 the account&#039;s password (CVE-2015-2559).
 
 Under certain circumstances, malicious users can construct a URL
 that will trick users into being redirected to a 3rd party website,
 thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering attacks. In
 addition, several URL-related API functions in Drupal 6 and 7 can be
 tricked into passing through external URLs when not intending to,
 potentially leading to additional open redirect vulnerabilities
 (CVE-2015-2749, CVE-2015-2750).
 
 The drupal package has been updated to version 7.35 to fix this
 issue and other bugs.  See the upstream advisory and release notes
 for more details.
