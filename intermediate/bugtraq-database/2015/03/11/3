Package        : mod-gnutls
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-2091
Debian Bug     : 578663

Thomas Klute discovered that in mod-gnutls, an Apache module providing
SSL and TLS encryption with GnuTLS, a bug caused the server's client
verify mode not to be considered at all, in case the directory's
configuration was unset. Clients with invalid certificates were then
able to leverage this flaw in order to get access to that directory.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.10-1.1+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6-1.3.

We recommend that you upgrade your mod-gnutls packages.
