 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:142
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : nodejs
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated nodejs package fixes security vulnerabilities:
 
 A memory corruption vulnerability, which results in a
 denial-of-service, was identified in the versions of V8 that ship with
 Node.js 0.8 and 0.10. In certain circumstances, a particularly deep
 recursive workload that may trigger a GC and receive an interrupt may
 overflow the stack and result in a segmentation fault. For instance,
 if your work load involves successive JSON.parse calls and the parsed
 objects are significantly deep, you may experience the process aborting
 while parsing (CVE-2014-5256).
 
 Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Google V8 before 3.24.35.10,
 as used in Node.js before 0.10.31, allow attackers to cause a
 denial of service or possibly have other impact via unknown vectors
 (CVE-2013-6668).
 
 The nodejs package has been updated to version 0.10.33 to fix these
 issues as well as several other bugs.
