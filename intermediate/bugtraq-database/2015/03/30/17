 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:093
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : apache
 Date    : March 28, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated apache packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Apache HTTPD before 2.4.9 was vulnerable to a denial of service in
 mod_dav when handling DAV_WRITE requests (CVE-2013-6438).
 
 Apache HTTPD before 2.4.9 was vulnerable to a denial of service when
 logging cookies (CVE-2014-0098).
 
 A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
 was found in the mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to
 access a status page served by mod_status on a server using a threaded
 Multi-Processing Module (MPM) could send a specially crafted request
 that would cause the httpd child process to crash or, possibly,
 allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
 the apache user (CVE-2014-0226).
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in the mod_proxy httpd module. A
 remote attacker could send a specially crafted request to a server
 configured as a reverse proxy using a threaded Multi-Processing
 Modules (MPM) that would cause the httpd child process to crash
 (CVE-2014-0117).
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd&#039;s mod_deflate
 module handled request body decompression (configured via the DEFLATE
 input filter). A remote attacker able to send a request whose body
 would be decompressed could use this flaw to consume an excessive
 amount of system memory and CPU on the target system (CVE-2014-0118).
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd&#039;s mod_cgid module
 executed CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input. A
 remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would
 cause the httpd child process to hang indefinitely (CVE-2014-0231).
 
 A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod_cache
 httpd module handled Content-Type headers. A malicious HTTP server
 could cause the httpd child process to crash when the Apache HTTP
 server was configured to proxy to a server with caching enabled
 (CVE-2014-3581).
 
 mod_lua.c in the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server through
 2.4.10 does not support an httpd configuration in which the same
 Lua authorization provider is used with different arguments within
 different contexts, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
 access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging
 multiple Require directives, as demonstrated by a configuration that
 specifies authorization for one group to access a certain directory,
 and authorization for a second group to access a second directory
 (CVE-2014-8109).
 
 In the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.10, a
 maliciously crafted websockets PING after a script calls r:wsupgrade()
 can cause a child process crash (CVE-2015-0228).
 
 A flaw was found in the way httpd handled HTTP Trailer headers when
 processing requests using chunked encoding. A malicious client could
 use Trailer headers to set additional HTTP headers after header
 processing was performed by other modules. This could, for example,
 lead to a bypass of header restrictions defined with mod_headers
 (CVE-2013-5704).
 
 Note: With this update, httpd has been modified to not merge HTTP
 Trailer headers with other HTTP request headers. A newly introduced
 configuration directive MergeTrailers can be used to re-enable the
 old method of processing Trailer headers, which also re-introduces
 the aforementioned flaw.
 
 This update also fixes the following bug:
 
 Prior to this update, the mod_proxy_wstunnel module failed to set
 up an SSL connection when configured to use a back end server using
 the wss: URL scheme, causing proxied connections to fail. In these
 updated packages, SSL is used when proxying to wss: back end servers
 (rhbz#1141950).
