 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:155
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : gnupg
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated gnupg and libgcrypt packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 GnuPG before 1.4.19 is vulnerable to a side-channel attack which can
 potentially lead to an information leak (CVE-2014-3591).
 
 GnuPG before 1.4.19 is vulnerable to a side-channel attack on
 data-dependent timing variations in modular exponentiation, which
 can potentially lead to an information leak (CVE-2015-0837).
 
 The gnupg package has been patched to correct these issues.
 
 GnuPG2 is vulnerable to these issues through the libgcrypt library.
 The issues were fixed in libgcrypt 1.6.3.  The libgcrypt package in
 Mandriva, at version 1.5.4, was only vulnerable to the CVE-2014-3591
 issue.  It has also been patched to correct this issue.
