 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:100
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/

 Package : cups-filters
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated cups-filters packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Florian Weimer discovered that cups-filters incorrectly handled
 memory in the urftopdf filter. An attacker could possibly use this
 issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the lp user
 (CVE-2013-6473).
 
 Florian Weimer discovered that cups-filters incorrectly handled
 memory in the pdftoopvp filter. An attacker could possibly use this
 issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the lp user
 (CVE-2013-6474, CVE-2013-6475).
 
 Florian Weimer discovered that cups-filters did not restrict driver
 directories in in the pdftoopvp filter. An attacker could possibly
 use this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
 lp user (CVE-2013-6476).
 
 Sebastian Krahmer discovered it was possible to use malicious
 broadcast packets to execute arbitrary commands on a server running
 the cups-browsed daemon (CVE-2014-2707).
 
 In cups-filters before 1.0.53, out-of-bounds accesses in the
 process_browse_data function when reading the packet variable
 could leading to a crash, thus resulting in a denial of service
 (CVE-2014-4337).
 
 In cups-filters before 1.0.53, if there was only a single BrowseAllow
 line in cups-browsed.conf and its host specification was invalid, this
 was interpreted as if no BrowseAllow line had been specified, which
 resulted in it accepting browse packets from all hosts (CVE-2014-4338).
 
 The CVE-2014-2707 issue with malicious broadcast packets, which
 had been fixed in Mageia Bug 13216 (MGASA-2014-0181), had not been
 completely fixed by that update. A more complete fix was implemented
 in cups-filters 1.0.53 (CVE-2014-4336).
 
 Note that only systems that have enabled the affected feature
 by using the CreateIPPPrinterQueues configuration directive in
 /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf were affected by the CVE-2014-2707 /
 CVE-2014-4336 issue.
