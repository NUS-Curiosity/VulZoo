 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:033
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : java-1.7.0-openjdk
 Date    : February 6, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated java-1.7.0 packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 A flaw was found in the way the Hotspot component in OpenJDK verified
 bytecode from the class files. An untrusted Java application or applet
 could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions
 (CVE-2014-6601).
 
 Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the
 JAX-WS, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application
 or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions
 (CVE-2015-0412, CVE-2015-0408).
 
 A flaw was found in the way the Hotspot garbage collector handled
 phantom references. An untrusted Java application or applet could
 use this flaw to corrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and,
 possibly, execute arbitrary code, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions
 (CVE-2015-0395).
 
 A flaw was found in the way the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules)
 decoder in the Security component in OpenJDK handled negative length
 values. A specially crafted, DER-encoded input could cause a Java
 application to enter an infinite loop when decoded (CVE-2015-0410).
 
 It was discovered that the SSL/TLS implementation in the JSSE component
 in OpenJDK failed to properly check whether the ChangeCipherSpec was
 received during the SSL/TLS connection handshake. An MITM attacker
 could possibly use this flaw to force a connection to be established
 without encryption being enabled (CVE-2014-6593).
 
 An information leak flaw was found in the Swing component in
 OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw
 to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2015-0407).
 
 A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MulticastSocket
 implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. An untrusted
 Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass
 certain Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2014-6587).
 
 Multiple boundary check flaws were found in the font parsing code
 in the 2D component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could
 allow an untrusted Java application or applet to disclose portions
 of the Java Virtual Machine memory (CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6591).
 
 Multiple insecure temporary file use issues were found in the way the
 Hotspot component in OpenJDK created performance statistics and error
 log files. A local attacker could possibly make a victim using OpenJDK
 overwrite arbitrary files using a symlink attack (CVE-2015-0383).
 
 Note: This update disables SSL 3.0 by default to mitigate the POODLE
 issue, also known as CVE-2014-3566. The jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms
 security property can be used to re-enable SSL 3.0 support if
 needed. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Bugzilla
 bug linked to in the References section.
