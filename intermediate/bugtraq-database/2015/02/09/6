 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:029
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : binutils
 Date    : February 5, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in binutils:
 
 Multiple integer overflows in the (1) _objalloc_alloc function in
 objalloc.c and (2) objalloc_alloc macro in include/objalloc.h in GNU
 libiberty, as used by binutils 2.22, allow remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (crash) via vectors related to the addition of
 CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE to the length, which triggers a heap-based buffer
 overflow (CVE-2012-3509).
 
 The srec_scan function in bfd/srec.c in libdbfd in GNU binutils
 before 2.25 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds read) via a small S-record (CVE-2014-8484).
 
 The setup_group function in bfd/elf.c in libbfd in GNU binutils 2.24
 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted section group
 headers in an ELF file (CVE-2014-8485).
 
 The _bfd_XXi_swap_aouthdr_in function in bfd/peXXigen.c in GNU binutils
 2.24 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds write) and possibly have other unspecified impact via a
 crafted NumberOfRvaAndSizes field in the AOUT header in a PE executable
 (CVE-2014-8501).
 
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the pe_print_edata function in
 bfd/peXXigen.c in GNU binutils 2.24 and earlier allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly have
 other unspecified impact via a truncated export table in a PE file
 (CVE-2014-8502).
 
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the ihex_scan function in bfd/ihex.c
 in GNU binutils 2.24 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (crash) and possibly have other unspecified impact
 via a crafted ihex file (CVE-2014-8503).
 
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the srec_scan function in bfd/srec.c
 in GNU binutils 2.24 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (crash) and possibly have other unspecified impact
 via a crafted file (CVE-2014-8504).
 
 Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in GNU binutils 2.24 and
 earlier allow local users to delete arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot)
 or full path name in an archive to (1) strip or (2) objcopy or create
 arbitrary files via (3) a .. (dot dot) or full path name in an archive
 to ar (CVE-2014-8737).
 
 The _bfd_slurp_extended_name_table function in bfd/archive.c in GNU
 binutils 2.24 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (invalid write, segmentation fault, and crash) via a crafted
 extended name table in an archive (CVE-2014-8738).
 
 The updated packages provides a solution for these security issues.
