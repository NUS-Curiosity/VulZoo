Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an

and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-9472

    Christian Loos discovered a remote denial of service vulnerability,
    exploitable via the email gateway and affecting any installation
    which accepts mail from untrusted sources. Depending on RT's
    logging configuration, a remote attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause CPU and excessive disk usage.

CVE-2015-1165

    Christian Loos discovered an information disclosure flaw which may
    reveal RSS feeds URLs, and thus ticket data.

CVE-2015-1464

    It was discovered that RSS feed URLs can be leveraged to perform
    session hijacking, allowing a user with the URL to log in as the
    user that created the feed.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.7-5+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.8-3.
