Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, information leaks or privilege
escalation.

CVE-2013-7421 / CVE-2014-9644

    It was discovered that the Crypto API allowed unprivileged users
    to load arbitrary kernel modules. A local user can use this flaw
    to exploit vulnerabilities in modules that would not normally be
    loaded.

CVE-2014-7822

    Akira Fujita found that the splice() system call did not validate
    the given file offset and length. A local unprivileged user can use
    this flaw to cause filesystem corruption on ext4 filesystems, or
    possibly other effects.

CVE-2014-8160

    Florian Westphal discovered that a netfilter (iptables/ip6tables) rule
    accepting packets to a specific SCTP, DCCP, GRE or UDPlite
    port/endpoint could result in incorrect connection tracking state.
    If only the generic connection tracking module (nf_conntrack) was
    loaded, and not the protocol-specific connection tracking module,
    this would allow access to any port/endpoint of the specified
    protocol.

CVE-2014-8559

    It was found that kernel functions that iterate over a directory
    tree can dead-lock or live-lock in case some of the directory
    entries were recently deleted or dropped from the cache. A local
    unprivileged user can use this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2014-9585

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that address randomisation for the vDSO
    in 64-bit processes is extremely biased. A local unprivileged user
    could potentially use this flaw to bypass the ASLR protection
    mechanism.

CVE-2014-9683

    Dmitry Chernenkov discovered that eCryptfs writes past the end of
    the allocated buffer during encrypted filename decoding, resulting
    in local denial of service.

CVE-2015-0239

    It was found that KVM did not correctly emulate the x86 SYSENTER
    instruction. An unprivileged user within a guest system that has
    not enabled SYSENTER, for example because the emulated CPU vendor
    is AMD, could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of
    service or privilege escalation in that guest.

CVE-2015-1420

    It was discovered that the open_by_handle_at() system call reads
    the handle size from user memory a second time after validating
    it. A local user with the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability could use
    this flaw for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-1421

    It was found that the SCTP implementation could free an
    authentication state while it was still in use, resulting in heap
    corruption. This could allow remote users to cause a denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-1593

    It was found that address randomisation for the initial stack in
    64-bit processes was limited to 20 rather than 22 bits of entropy.
    A local unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to
    bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.65-1+deb7u2. Additionally this update fixes regressions
introduced in versions 3.2.65-1 and 3.2.65-1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon (a subset is fixed already).

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon
(a subset is fixed already).

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
