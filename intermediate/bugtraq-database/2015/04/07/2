RESOLUTION

HP recommends the following software updates or workarounds to resolve the
vulnerabilities for HP IceWall SSO MCRP, SSO Dfw, and SSO Agent.

  Workaround for HP IceWall SSO MCRP:

    - If possible, do not use the CLIENT_CERT and CLIENT_CERTKEY settings in
the host configuration file. Not setting these will prevent MCRP from using
those client certificates for communicating with the back-end web servers.

    - If the CLIENT_CERT and CLIENT_CERTKEY settings must be used, then there
is no workaround other than applying a vendor patch for OpenSSL for these
vulnerabilities.

  Workaround for HP IceWall SSO Dfw and SSO Agent:

    - If possible, do not use client certificates for SSL communication
between the client and server which are running HP IceWall SSO Dfw or SSO
Agent.

    - If client certificates for SSL communication between the client and
server must be used, then there is no workaround other than applying a vendor
patch for OpenSSL for these vulnerabilities.

  Software updates to resolve the vulnerabilities for OpenSSL:

   1. IceWall SSO Dfw 10.0 running on RHEL could be using either the OS
bundled OpenSSL library or the OpenSSL bundled with HP IceWall. If still
using the OpenSSL bundled with HP IceWall, please switch to the OpenSSL
library bundled with the OS, and then follow the instructions in step 3.

      Documents are available at the following location with instructions to
switch to the OS bundled OpenSSL library:

      http://www.hp.com/jp/icewall_patchaccess

    2. For IceWall SSO Dfw 8.0, 8.0 R1, 8.0 R2, 8.0 R3 which bundle OpenSSL,
please download the updated OpenSSL at the following location:

      http://www.hp.com/jp/icewall_patchaccess

    3. For HP IceWall products running on RHEL and are using the OS bundled
OpenSSL, Red Hat has provided an updated OpenSSL package and information at
the following location:

      https://access.redhat.com/articles/1384453

      Note: The update for OpenSSL is available for RHEL6 only. Red Hat
determined that the OpenSSL that comes with RHEL5 will not be updated. Please
ask Red Hat for details.

    4. For IceWall products running on HP-UX which are using the OS bundled
OpenSSL, please apply the HP-UX OpenSSL update for openssl-0.9.8zf when it is
available from the following location:

      https://h20392.www2.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayInstallInfo.do?product
Number=OPENSSL11I

Note: The HP IceWall product is only available in Japan.
