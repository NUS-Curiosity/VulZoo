Package        : xen
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3209 CVE-2015-4103 CVE-2015-4104 CVE-2015-4105
                 CVE-2015-4106 CVE-2015-4163 CVE-2015-4164

Multiple security issues have been found in the Xen virtualisation
solution:
           
CVE-2015-3209

    Matt Tait discovered a flaw in the way QEMU's AMD PCnet Ethernet
    emulation handles multi-TMD packets with a length above 4096 bytes.
    A privileged guest user in a guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card
    enabled can potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on
    the host with the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-4103

    Jan Beulich discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not properly
    restrict write access to the host MSI message data field, allowing
    a malicious guest to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4104

    Jan Beulich discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not properly
    restrict access to PCI MSI mask bits, allowing a malicious guest to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4105

    Jan Beulich reported that the QEMU Xen code enables logging for PCI
    MSI-X pass-through error messages, allowing a malicious guest to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4106

    Jan Beulich discovered that the QEMU Xen code does not properly restrict
    write access to the PCI config space for certain PCI pass-through devices,
    allowing a malicious guest to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive
    information or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2015-4163

    Jan Beulich discovered that a missing version check in the
    GNTTABOP_swap_grant_ref hypercall handler may result in denial of service.
    This only applies to Debian stable/jessie.

CVE-2015-4164

    Andrew Cooper discovered a vulnerability in the iret hypercall handler,
    which may result in denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.1.4-3+deb7u8. 

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-9+deb8u1. CVE-2015-3209, CVE-2015-4103, CVE-2015-4104,
CVE-2015-4105 and CVE-2015-4106 don't affect the Xen package in stable
jessie, it uses the standard qemu package and has already been fixed in
DSA-3284-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
