Subject: CVE-2015-4674 - TimeDoctor autoupdate over plain-HTTP

TimeDoctor claims to be a software that helps to improve the
productivity of teams, reduce time spent on distractions [1]

Vulnerability:
TimeDoctor autoupdate feature downloads and executes files over plain
HTTP and doesn't perform any check with the files. An attacker with
MITM capabilities (i.e., when user connects to a public wifi) could
override the Timedoctor subdomain and then execute custom binaries on
the machine where the application is running.

The update mechanisms first downloads update.xml [2] which has
the version number, url and a filename for the new
installer.
