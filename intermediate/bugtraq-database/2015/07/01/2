Package        : jackrabbit
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-1833

It was discovered that the Jackrabbit WebDAV bundle was susceptible to a
XXE/XEE attack. When processing a WebDAV request body containing XML,
the XML parser could be instructed to read content from network
resources accessible to the host, identified by URI schemes such as
"http(s)" or "file". Depending on the WebDAV request, this could not
only be used to trigger internal network requests, but might also be
used to insert said content into the request, potentially exposing it to
the attacker and others.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.3.6-1+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.6-1+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.10.1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your jackrabbit packages.
