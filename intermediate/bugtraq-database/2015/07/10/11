RESOLUTION

HP recommends applying the latest OS vendor security patches for OpenSSL to
resolve the vulnerabilities for HP IceWall Products.

  HP IceWall SSO Dfw v10.0 and Certd v10.0, which are running on RHEL, could
be using either the OS bundled OpenSSL library or the OpenSSL bundled with HP
IceWall. If still using the OpenSSL bundled with HP IceWall, please apply the
latest OS vendor security patches for OpenSSL and switch to the OpenSSL
library bundled with the OS.

  Documents are available at the following location with instructions to
switch to the OS bundled OpenSSL library:

  Note: The HP IceWall product is only available in Japan.
