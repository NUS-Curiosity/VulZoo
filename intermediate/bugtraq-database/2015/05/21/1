Package        : libmodule-signature-perl
Debian Bug     : 785701

The update for libmodule-signature-perl issued as DSA-3261-1 introduced
a regression in the handling of the --skip option of cpansign. Updated
packages are now available to address this regression. For reference,
the original advisory text follows.

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libmodule-signature-perl, a
Perl module to manipulate CPAN SIGNATURE files. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2015-3406

    John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature could parses the
    unsigned portion of the SIGNATURE file as the signed portion due to
    incorrect handling of PGP signature boundaries.

CVE-2015-3407

    John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handles
    files that are not listed in the SIGNATURE file. This includes some
    files in the t/ directory that would execute when tests are run.

CVE-2015-3408

    John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature uses two argument
    open() calls to read the files when generating checksums from the
    signed manifest. This allows to embed arbitrary shell commands into
    the SIGNATURE file that would execute during the signature
    verification process.

CVE-2015-3409

    John Lightsey discovered that Module::Signature incorrectly handles
    module loading, allowing to load modules from relative paths in
    @INC. A remote attacker providing a malicious module could use this
    issue to execute arbitrary code during signature verification.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.68-1+deb7u3.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.73-1+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.79-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libmodule-signature-perl packages.
