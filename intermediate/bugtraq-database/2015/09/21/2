Package        : qemu-kvm
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5278 CVE-2015-5279 CVE-2015-6815 CVE-2015-6855

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.

CVE-2015-5278

    Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in
    the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).

CVE-2015-5279

    Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw
    in the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or
    potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
    privileges of the hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-6815

    Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in
    the e1000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
    to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).

CVE-2015-6855

    Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a flaw in the IDE
    subsystem in QEMU occurring while executing IDE's
    WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX command to determine the maximum size of a
    drive. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to mount a
    denial of service (QEMU process crash).

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u11.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
