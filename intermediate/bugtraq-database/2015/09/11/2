Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issue has been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Login names longer than 127 characters can be corrupted, which could
  lead to the creation of a user account with an unexpected email
  address.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Unauthorized Account Creation
Versions:    Bugzilla 2.0 to 4.2.14, 4.3.1 to 4.4.9, 4.5.1 to 5.0
Fixed In:    4.2.15, 4.4.10, 5.0.1
Description: Login names (usually an email address) longer than 127
             characters are silently truncated in MySQL which could
             cause the domain name of the email address to be
             corrupted. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
             create an account with an email address different from the
             one originally requested. The login name could then be
             automatically added to groups based on the group's regular
             expression setting.
