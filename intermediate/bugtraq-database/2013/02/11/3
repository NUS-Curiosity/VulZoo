Package        : ircd-ratbox
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-6084

This update to the previous ircd-ratbox DSA only raises the version number
to ensure that a higher version is used than a previously binNMU on some
architectures.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.6.dfsg-2+squeeze1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ircd-ratbox packages.
