Package        : ffmpeg
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0858 CVE-2012-2777 CVE-2012-2783 CVE-2012-2784 
                 CVE-2012-2788 CVE-2012-2801 CVE-2012-2803

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg, a multimedia 
player, server and encoder. Multiple input validations in the decoders/ 
demuxers for Shorten, Chines AVS video, VP5, VP6, AVI, AVS and MPEG-1/2
files could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Most of these issues were discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael 
Coldwind.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:0.5.10-1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid), 
these problems have been fixed in version 6:0.8.5-1 of the source package
libav.

We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.
