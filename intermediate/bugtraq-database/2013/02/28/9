Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in Geeklog that can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Geeklog: CVE-2013-1470

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in "calendar_type" HTTP POST parameter passed to "/calendar/index.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in his browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display user's cookies: 


<form action="http://[host]/submit.php?type=calendar" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="mode" value="Submit">	
<input type="hidden" name="calendar_type" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>'>
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
