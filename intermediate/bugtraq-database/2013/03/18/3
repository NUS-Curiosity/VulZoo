Package        : libvirt-bin
Vulnerability  : files and device nodes ownership change to kvm group
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: yes
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1766
Debian Bug     : 701649

Bastian Blank discovered that libvirtd, a daemon for management of virtual
machines, network and storage, would change ownership of devices files so they
would be owned by user `libvirt-qemu` and group `kvm`, which is a general
purpose group not specific to libvirt, allowing unintended write access to
those devices and files for the kvm group members.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.3-5+squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.12-11.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.12-11.

We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt-bin packages.
