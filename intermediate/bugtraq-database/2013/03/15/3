CVE ID         : CVE-2010-2529
Debian Bug     : 

Ovidiu Mara reported in 2010 a vulnerability in the ping util, commonly used by
system and network administrators. By carefully crafting ICMP responses, an
attacker could make the ping command hangs.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.6-3.1+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.9-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.9-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your inetutils packages.
