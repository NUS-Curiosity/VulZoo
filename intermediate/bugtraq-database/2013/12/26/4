Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in Ad-minister Wordpress plugin, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Ad-minister Wordpress plugin: CVE-2013-6993

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data in "key" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/wp-admin/tools.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display "immuniweb" word:

http://[host]/wp-admin/tools.php?page=ad-minister&tab=positions&action=delete&key=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28immuniweb%29;%3C/script%3E
