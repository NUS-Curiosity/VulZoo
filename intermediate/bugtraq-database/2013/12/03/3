Package        : openjpeg
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1447 CVE-2013-6045 CVE-2013-6052 CVE-2013-6054

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJPEG, a JPEG 2000
image library, that may lead to denial of service (CVE-2013-1447) via
application crash or high memory consumption, possible code execution
through heap buffer overflows (CVE-2013-6045), information disclosure
(CVE-2013-6052), or yet another heap buffer overflow that only appears
to affect OpenJPEG 1.3 (CVE-2013-6054).

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3+dfsg-4+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3+dfsg-4.7.

For the testing distribution (jessie), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjpeg packages.
