 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:189
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : wordpress
 Date    : July 2, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated wordpress package fixes security vulnerabilities:
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in the way Wordpress, a blog tool
 and publishing platform, performed hash computation when checking
 password for password protected blog posts. A remote attacker could
 provide a specially- crafted input that, when processed by the password
 checking mechanism of Wordpress would lead to excessive CPU consumption
 (CVE-2013-2173).
 
 Inadequate SSRF protection for HTTP requests where the user can provide
 a URL can allow for attacks against the intranet and other sites. This
 is a continuation of work related to CVE-2013-0235, which was specific
 to SSRF in pingback requests and was fixed in 3.5.1 (CVE-2013-2199).
 
 Inadequate checking of a user&#039;s capabilities could allow them to
 publish posts when their user role should not allow for it; and to
 assign posts to other authors (CVE-2013-2200).
 
 Inadequate escaping allowed an administrator to trigger a cross-site
 scripting vulnerability through the uploading of media files and
 plugins (CVE-2013-2201).
 
 The processing of an oEmbed response is vulnerable to an XXE
 (CVE-2013-2202).
 
 If the uploads directory is not writable, error message data returned
 via XHR will include a full path to the directory (CVE-2013-2203).
 
 Content Spoofing in the MoxieCode (TinyMCE) MoxiePlayer project
 (CVE-2013-2204).
 
 Cross-domain XSS in SWFUpload (CVE-2013-2205).
