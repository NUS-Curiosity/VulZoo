Package        : php-radius
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2220
Debian Bug     : 714362

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the Radius extension for PHP.
The function handling Vendor Specific Attributes assumed that the
attributes given would always be of valid length. An attacker could
use this assumption to trigger a buffer overflow.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5-2+squeeze1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5-2.3+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5-2.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-radius packages.
