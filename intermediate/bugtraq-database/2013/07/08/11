Advisory Details:
It is possible to bypass authentication to gain administrator level access to the web management console by navigating directly to any web page while a legitimate session is still active. During this window of opportunity, session cookies are not validated and an attacker with or without a session cookie can gain unfettered access to view and change all configurable settings on the device, including the addition / modification of user accounts for persistent access. This is not possible once a legitimate session has expired.
