Subject: [oCERT-2013-001] File Roller path sanitization errors


#2013-001 File Roller path sanitization errors

Description:

The File Roller archive manager for the GNOME desktop suffers from a
path traversal vulnerability caused by insufficient path sanitization.

A specially crafted archive file can be used to trigger creation of
arbitrary files in any location, writable by the user executing the extraction,
outside the current working directory. This behaviour is triggered when the
option 'Keep directory structure' is selected from the application 'Extract'
dialog.

The issue is present on File Roller installations which have been
compiled with libarchive support, used to handle tar, cpio, lha, 7zip, ar
archiving formats and ISO images. The libarchive support is enabled by
default.

Affected version:
File Roller >= 3.6.0, >= 3.8.0, >= 3.9.1

Fixed version:
File Roller >= 3.6.4, >= 3.8.3, >= 3.9.3
