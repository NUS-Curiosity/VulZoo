Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab has discovered buffer overflow vulnerability in Samsung Kies, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable system.


1) Buffer overflow in Samsung Kies: CVE-2012-6429

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of input data in the PrepareSync() method within the ActiveX control SyncService.dll, GUID { EA8A3985-F9DF-4652-A255-E4E7772AFCA8 }, located by default in "C:\Program Files\Samsung\Kies\External\DeviceModules\SyncService.dll".
A remote attacker can pass an arbitrary value to the "password" argument of the PrepareSync() method and trigger an ACCESS_VIOLATION exception, which could be exploited to successfully overwrite the EIP register and the SEH structure. 

Taking into consideration the Unicode Format nature of this vulnerability,
an attacker should rely on a predictable Unicode module loaded at crash time
in order to efficiently exploit the vulnerability.


Crash details:

(9b4.720): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.
