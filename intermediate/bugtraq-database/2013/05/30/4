Package        : gnutls26
Vulnerability  : out-of-bounds array read
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2116
Debian Bug     : 709301

It was discovered that a malicious client could crash a GNUTLS server
and vice versa, by sending TLS records encrypted with a block cipher
which contain invalid padding.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected because the
security fix that introduced this vulnerability was not applied to it.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.20-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.23-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.
