Multiple security issues have been found in iceweasel, Debian's version 
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: multiple memory safety errors, and
other implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

The iceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no
longer supported with security updates.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.10esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
