 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:037
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : fetchmail
 Date    : April 5, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in fetchmail:
 
 Fetchmail version 6.3.9 enabled all SSL workarounds (SSL_OP_ALL) which
 contains a switch to disable a countermeasure against certain attacks
 against block ciphers that permit guessing the initialization vectors,
 providing that an attacker can make the application (fetchmail) encrypt
 some data for him -- which is not easily the case (aka a BEAST attack)
 (CVE-2011-3389).
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in the way Fetchmail, a remote mail
 retrieval and forwarding utility, performed base64 decoding of certain
 NTLM server responses. Upon sending the NTLM authentication request,
 Fetchmail did not check if the received response was actually part
 of NTLM protocol exchange, or server-side error message and session
 abort. A rogue NTML server could use this flaw to cause fetchmail
 executable crash (CVE-2012-3482).
 
 This advisory provides the latest version of fetchmail (6.3.22)
 which is not vulnerable to these issues.
