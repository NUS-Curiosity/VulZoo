 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:056
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libxml2
 Date    : April 8, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities was found and corrected in libxml2:
 
 A heap-buffer overflow was found in the way libxml2 decoded certain
 XML entitites. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
 XML file, which once opened in an application linked against libxml
 would cause that application to crash, or, potentially, execute
 arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application
 (CVE-2012-5134).
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2 performed string
 substitutions when entity values for entity references replacement
 was enabled. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
 file that, when processed by an application linked against libxml2,
 would lead to excessive CPU consumption (CVE-2013-0338).
 
 An Off-by-one error in libxml2 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via unknown vectors (CVE-2011-3102).
 
 Multiple integer overflows in libxml2, on 64-bit Linux platforms
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via unknown vectors (CVE-2012-2807).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
