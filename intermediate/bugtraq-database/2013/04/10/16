 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:108
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : openconnect
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated openconnect packages fix security vulnerability:
 
 A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way OpenConnect,
 a client for Cisco&#039;s AnyConnect VPN, performed processing of certain
 host names, paths, or cookie lists, received from the VPN gateway. A
 remote VPN gateway could provide a specially-crafted host name, path
 or cookie list that, when processed by the openconnect client would
 lead to openconnect executable crash (CVE-2012-6128).
