Subject: Netgear ProSafe switches: Unauthenticated startup-config
 disclosure and Denial of Service

1. BACKGROUND

According to the vendor, Netgear ProSafe is a cost-effective line of smart switches for Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs). The products cover an essential set of network features and easy-to-use web-based management. Power over Ethernet (PoE) and Stacking versions are also available.


2. SUMMARY

A range of ProSafe switches are affected by two different vulnerabilities:
CVE-2013-4775: Unauthenticated startup-config disclosure.
CVE-2013-4776: Denial of Service vulnerability.


3. AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE

CVE-2013-4775

GS724Tv3 and GS716Tv2 - firmware 5.4.1.13
GS724Tv3 and GS716Tv2 - firmware 5.4.1.10
GS748Tv4              - firmware 5.4.1.14
GS510TP               - firmware 5.4.0.6
GS752TPS and GS728TPS - firmware 5.3.0.17
GS728TS and GS725TS   - firmware 5.3.0.17
GS752TXS and GS728TXS - firmware 6.1.0.12


CVE-2013-4776

GS724Tv3 and GS716Tv2 - firmware 5.4.1.13
GS724Tv3 and GS716Tv2 - firmware 5.4.1.10
GS748Tv4              - firmware 5.4.1.14
GS510TP               - firmware 5.0.4.4


4. VULNERABILITIES

The list below describes the vulnerabilities discovered in the affected software.


4.1 CVE-2013-4775: Unauthenticated startup-config disclosure

The web management application fails to restrict URL access to different application areas.
Remote, unauthenticated attackers could exploit this issue to download the device�s startup-config, 
which contains administrator credentials in encrypted form.

[Proof of Concept]
The vulnerability can be exploited with a simple HTTP (GET) request.
Open a browser and visit http://Target-IP/filesystem/startup-config


4.2 CVE-2013-4776: Denial of Service vulnerability

The affected products are prone to a Denial of Service vulnerability. Remote, unauthenticated
attackers could exploit this issue to cause a switch reboot or crash, resulting in a loss of
network connectivity for all devices connected to the switch.

[Proof of Concept]
The vulnerability can be exploited with a simple HTTP (GET) request.
Open a browser and visit http://Target-IP/filesystem/

5. REMEDIATION

No firmware updates or fixes have been released yet.
As a mitigation, the vendor recommends configuring a separate management VLAN and configure
access control via �Security::Access::Access Control� or �Security::ACL::Advanced::IP Extended Rules�.
