Internal reference: 29315 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: CWE-200 (Information Exposure)
Vulnerable version: prior to 7.4.0
Vulnerable component: backend
Fixed version: 7.2.2-rev25, 7.4.0-rev14
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Vendor notification: 2013-10-16
Solution date: 2013-10-21
Public disclosure: 2013-11-06
CVE reference: CVE-2013-6241
CVSSv2: 6.2 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:POC/RL:U/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:H/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND)

Vulnerability Details:
Information of contacts (birthday, surname, firstname, displayname) are exposed through the “Birthday” widget using the api/contacts?action=birthdays call. This affects contact information where the birthday date is at the next year and the contact information is stored at the same database schema. Additionally, this is limited to contacts of users that share the same user-id within different contexts. If birthdays are due at the following year, the decision tree uses an incorrect SQL statement that bypasses context isolation.

Risk:
Users from different contexts may gain unauthorized access to a subset of contact data.


Solution:
Users should update to the latest available patch releases.
