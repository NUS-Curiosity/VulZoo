Hi,

Disclosure: I work for IBM, but not on DB2.

If you have an IBM support agreement, file a PMR. There's a 1-800
number and an online form to do this. This should be easy to find, you
can probably search for "IBM technical support" or something.

If DB2 6.1 (that's quite an old version) is end of service, then upgrade.

If you don't have support from IBM, check the list of published iFixes
on Fix Central, and see if you can find one related to that CVE number
(maybe use your favourite search engine to search for "DB2
CVE-2001-0052 Fix Central")

Hope this helps,

Jonathan
