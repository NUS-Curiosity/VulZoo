 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:267
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : java-1.7.0-openjdk
 Date    : November 19, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Multiple input checking flaws were found in the 2D component native
 image parsing code. A specially crafted image file could trigger
 a Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to
 arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the
 Java Virtual Machine (CVE-2013-5782).
 
 The class loader did not properly check the package access for
 non-public proxy classes. A remote attacker could possibly use this
 flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
 the Java Virtual Machine (CVE-2013-5830).
 
 Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the
 2D, CORBA, JNDI, and Libraries components in OpenJDK. An untrusted
 Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java
 sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-5829, CVE-2013-5814, CVE-2013-5817,
 CVE-2013-5842, CVE-2013-5850, CVE-2013-5838).
 
 Multiple input checking flaws were discovered in the JPEG image reading
 and writing code in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application
 or applet could use these flaws to corrupt the Java Virtual Machine
 memory and bypass Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-5809).
 
 The FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING setting was not properly honored by
 the javax.xml.transform package transformers. A remote attacker could
 use this flaw to supply a crafted XML that would be processed without
 the intended security restrictions (CVE-2013-5802).
 
 Multiple errors were discovered in the way the JAXP and Security
 components processes XML inputs. A remote attacker could create a
 crafted XML that would cause a Java application to use an excessive
 amount of CPU and memory when processed (CVE-2013-5825, CVE-2013-4002,
 CVE-2013-5823).
 
 Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the
 Libraries Swing, JAX-WS, JAXP, JGSS, AWT, Beans, and Scripting
 components in OpenJDK An untrusted Java application or applet
 could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions
 (CVE-2013-3829, CVE-2013-5840, CVE-2013-5774, CVE-2013-5783,
 CVE-2013-5820, CVE-2013-5851, CVE-2013-5800, CVE-2013-5849,
 CVE-2013-5790, CVE-2013-5784).
 
 It was discovered that the 2D component image library did not properly
 check bounds when performing image conversions. An untrusted Java
 application or applet could use this flaw to disclose portions of
 the Java Virtual Machine memory (CVE-2013-5778).
 
 Multiple input sanitization flaws were discovered in javadoc. When
 javadoc documentation was generated from an untrusted Java source
 code and hosted on a domain not controlled by the code author, these
 issues could make it easier to perform cross-site scripting attacks
 (CVE-2013-5804, CVE-2013-5797).
 
 Various OpenJDK classes that represent cryptographic keys could
 leak private key information by including sensitive data in strings
 returned by toString() methods. These flaws could possibly lead to
 an unexpected exposure of sensitive key data (CVE-2013-5780).
 
 The Java Heap Analysis Tool (jhat) failed to properly escape all
 data added into the HTML pages it generated. Crafted content in the
 memory of a Java program analyzed using jhat could possibly be used
 to conduct cross-site scripting attacks (CVE-2013-5772).
 
 The Kerberos implementation in OpenJDK did not properly parse KDC
 responses. A malformed packet could cause a Java application using
 JGSS to exit (CVE-2013-5803).
 
 This updates IcedTea to version 2.4.3, which fixes these issues,
 as well as several others.
