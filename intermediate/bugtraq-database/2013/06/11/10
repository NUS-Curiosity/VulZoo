Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the chromium web
browser. 

CVE-2013-2855

    The Developer Tools API in Chromium before 27.0.1453.110 allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or
    possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2856

    Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.110
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of
    input.

CVE-2013-2857

    Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.110
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of
    images.

CVE-2013-2858

    Use-after-free vulnerability in the HTML5 Audio implementation in
    Chromium before 27.0.1453.110 allows remote attackers to cause
    a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
    unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2859

    Chromium before 27.0.1453.110 allows remote attackers to bypass
    the Same Origin Policy and trigger namespace pollution via
    unspecified vectors.

CVE-2013-2860

    Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.110
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    have unspecified other impact via vectors involving access to a
    database API by a worker process.

CVE-2013-2861

    Use-after-free vulnerability in the SVG implementation in Chromium
    before 27.0.1453.110 allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
    unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2862

    Skia, as used in Chromium before 27.0.1453.110, does not
    properly handle GPU acceleration, which allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have
    unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2013-2863

    Chromium before 27.0.1453.110 does not properly handle SSL
    sockets, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via unspecified
    vectors.

CVE-2013-2865

    Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Chromium before
    27.0.1453.110 allow attackers to cause a denial of service or
    possibly have other impact via unknown vectors.
