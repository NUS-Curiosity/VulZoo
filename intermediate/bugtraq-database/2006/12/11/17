4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in MailEnable, which
can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when processing
data sent to the IMAP server. This can be exploited to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow by first sending a command in the "Not
Authenticated" state (e.g. "login" command) with a specially crafted
parameter to make the IMAP service wait for more incoming data and
then sending an overly long string (greater than 512 bytes).

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

5) Solution 

Apply hotfix ME-10025:
