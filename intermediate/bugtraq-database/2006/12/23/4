ZDI-06-053: Novell NetMail IMAP Verb Literal Heap Overflow Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-06-053.html
December 22, 2006

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2006-6424

-- Affected Vendor:
Novell

-- Affected Products:
Novell NetMail 3.5.2

TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since December 21, 2006 by Digital Vaccine protection
filter ID 4543. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
affected versions of Novell NetMail. Authentication is not required to
exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the NetMail IMAP service, imapd.exe. The
service does not sufficiently validate user-input length values when
literals are appended to IMAP verbs to specify a command continuation
request. The memory allocated to store the additional data may be
insufficient, leading to an exploitable heap-based buffer overflow.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
