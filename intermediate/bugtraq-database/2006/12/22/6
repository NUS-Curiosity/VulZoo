Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0074

Package names:	   kernel, proftpd
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-12-22
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of
  your Trustix Secure Linux operating system. The kernel handles the
  basic functions of the operating system: memory allocation, process
  allocation, device input and output, etc.

  proftpd
  ProFTPd is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity,
  security, and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like
  configuration syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure,
  including support for multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP,
  and permission-based directory visibility.

Problem description:
  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - New upstream.
  - SECURITY FIX: A vulnerability has been identified which could be
    exploited by malicious users to bypass security restrictions.
    This issue is due to an error in the "do_coredump()" [fs/exec.c]
    function where the "flag" variable is set but never used, which
    could be exploited by attackers to manipulate certain files.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2006-6304 to this issue. 

  proftpd < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Alfredo Ortega has reported a vulnerability in the
    mod_ctrls module for ProFTPD, caused due to a boundary error within
    the "pr_ctrls_recv_request()" function in src/ctrls.c. This can be
    exploited to cause a buffer overflow by sending specially crafted
    control messages to the module.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2006-6563 to this issue.
