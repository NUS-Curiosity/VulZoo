Published: 2006-11-30
Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Minor
Exposure Level Classification:
    Indirect Non-deterministic Unauthorized Access
Updated Versions:
    gnupg=/conary.rpath.com@rpl:devel//1/1.4.5-1.1-1

    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-826

Description:
    Previous versions of the gnupg package contain a weakness that may
    enable an attacker to create a malformed message that causes gnupg
    to crash or execute arbitrary code provided by the attacker.  This
    weakness exists only in interactive mode; other applications which
    call gpg in batch mode are not susceptible.
