Subject: [CAID 34876]: CA CleverPath Portal Session Inheritance Vulnerability


Title: CAID 34876: CA CleverPath Portal Session Inheritance
Vulnerability

CA Vulnerability ID (CAID): 34876

CA Advisory Date: 2006-12-19

Discovered By: CA customer and CA Technical Support

Impact: Remote attackers can potentially gain access to a user's 
Portal session.

Summary: CA CleverPath Portal and other CA solutions that embed 
Portal technology contain a session verification vulnerability.  
In certain multiple Portal server configurations, a user who 
connects through one Portal server could conceivably inherit the 
Portal session and associated security authentication of a user 
running on another Portal server.

Mitigating Factors: This problem only occurs when multiple Portal 
servers are sharing a common data store, and two of the Portal 
servers are started at exactly the same time. Typically, customers 
deploy multiple Portal servers in this type of configuration to 
utilize high-availability failover and load balancing. A multi 
CleverPath Portal server environment is not a default deployment, 
but it is an optional post installation configuration. None of the 
CA solutions that embed the Portal technology install into this 
scenario, or offer a multiple Portal server environment as a 
configurable option. However, it is conceivable that a 
knowledgeable administrator could have modified an embedded Portal 
environment to leverage multiple Portal servers.

Severity: CA has given this vulnerability a Low risk rating.

Affected platforms:
All supported operating systems (Windows, Linux, and supported 
UNIX platforms).

Status and Recommendation: 
The most prudent course of action for affected customers is to 
download and apply the corrective maintenance. If the maintenance 
cannot be applied right away, CA Technical Support recommends 
implementing interim operational process controls to ensure, when 
multiple Portal servers are sharing a common data store, that the 
server start times are duly staggered by at least one minute.

Determining if you are affected: 
Affected Portal installations must meet both of the following 
criteria:
1) You are not at Portal maintenance version 4.71.001_179_060830 
   or higher. To determine your portal version:
   a. Login as a Portal Administrator.
   b. Choose "My Profile" from the upper right-hand portion of the 
      main workplace.
   c. Click on the "Portal Administration" link.
   d. The Portal version will be displayed in the right-hand pane 
      under Statistics.
2) You are running CA's Portal technology in a multi-server 
   environment. To determine if you are running a multi-server 
   environment:
   a. Login as a Portal Administrator.
   b. Choose "My Profile" from the upper right-hand portion of the 
      main workplace.
   c. Click on the "Portal Administration" link.
   d. If the "Jump to Portal" menu appears in the left Portal 
      Administration pane, you are using a multiple-server 
      environment. If you do not see the "Jump to Portal" section, 
      then Portal is not running in a multi-server environment and 
      is not affected by this vulnerability.
