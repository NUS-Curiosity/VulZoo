Synopsis
========

An integer overflow in koffice-libs allows for a Denial of Service and
possibly the execution of arbitrary code when viewing malicious
PowerPoint files.

Background
==========

KOffice is an integrated office suite for KDE. koffice-libs is a
package containing shared librares used by KOffice programs.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/koffice-libs       < 1.5.0                    >= 1.5.0

Description
===========

Kees Cook of Ubuntu discovered that 'KLaola::readBigBlockDepot()' in
klaola.cc fills 'num_of_bbd_blocks' while reading a .ppt (PowerPoint)
file without proper sanitizing, resulting in an integer overflow
subsequently overwriting the heap with parts of the file being read.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted PowerPoint file, an
attacker could crash the application and possibly execute arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running KOffice.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All koffice-libs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/koffice-libs-1.5.0"

==========
