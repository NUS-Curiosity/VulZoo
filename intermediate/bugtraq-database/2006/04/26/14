Synopsis
========

Format string vulnerabilities in xine-ui may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

xine-ui is a skin-based user interface for xine. xine is a free
multimedia player. It plays CDs, DVDs, and VCDs, and can also decode
other common multimedia formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/xine-ui      < 0.99.4-r5                 >= 0.99.4-r5

Description
===========

Ludwig Nussel discovered that xine-ui incorrectly implements formatted
printing.

Impact
======

By constructing a malicious playlist file, a remote attacker could
exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the rights
of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-ui users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/xine-ui-0.99.4-r5"
