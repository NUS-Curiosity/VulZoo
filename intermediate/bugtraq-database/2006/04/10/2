Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libphp-adodb, the
'adodb' database abstraction layer for PHP, which is embedded in
cacti, a frontend to rrdtool for monitoring systems and services.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2006-0146

    Andreas Sandblad discovered that improper user input sanitisation
    results in a potential remote SQL injection vulnerability enabling
    an attacker to compromise applications, access or modify data, or
    exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
    This requires the MySQL root password to be empty.  It is fixed by
    limiting access to the script in question.

CVE-2006-0147

    A dynamic code evaluation vulnerability allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary PHP functions via the 'do' parameter.

CVE-2006-0410

    Andy Staudacher discovered an SQL injection vulnerability due to
    insufficient input sanitising that allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2006-0806

    GulfTech Security Research discovered multiple cross-site
    scripting vulnerabilities due to improper user-supplied input
    sanitisation.  Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to
    cause arbitrary scripts to be executed in the browser of an
    unsuspecting user's machine, or result in the theft of
    cookie-based authentication credentials.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6c-7sarge3.

For the unstable distribution these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your cacti package.


Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

  its next update.
