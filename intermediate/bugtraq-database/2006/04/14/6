Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ADOdb layer
included in Cacti, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

Cacti is a complete web-based frontend to rrdtool. ADOdb is a PHP-based
database abstraction layer which is included in Cacti.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package /        Vulnerable        /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  cacti      < 0.8.6h_p20060108-r2           >= 0.8.6h_p20060108-r2

Description
===========

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the copy of ADOdb
included in Cacti. Andreas Sandblad discovered a dynamic code
evaluation vulnerability (CVE-2006-0147) and a potential SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2006-0146). Andy Staudacher reported another SQL
injection vulnerability (CVE-2006-0410), and Gulftech Security
discovered multiple cross-site-scripting issues (CVE-2006-0806).

Impact
======

Remote attackers could trigger these vulnerabilities by sending
malicious queries to the Cacti web application, resulting in arbitrary
code execution, database compromise through arbitrary SQL execution,
and malicious HTML or JavaScript code injection.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cacti users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=net-analyzer/cacti-0.8.6h_p20060108-r2"
