Synopsis
========

Format string vulnerabilities in Doomsday may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Doomsday is a modern gaming engine for popular ID games like Doom,
Heretic and Hexen.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-fps/doomsday      <= 1.8.6-r1                   Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma discovered that Doomsday incorrectly implements
formatted printing.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the Doomsday server
or client by sending specially crafted strings.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Doomsday has been masked in Portage pending the resolution of these
issues. All Doomsday users are advised to uninstall the package until
further notice.

    # emerge --ask --verbose --unmerge games-fps/doomsday
