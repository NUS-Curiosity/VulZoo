1. Systems affected:

        Kaffeine 0.4.2 up to including Kaffeine 0.7.1. Kaffeine
        0.8.0 not affected.


2. Overview:

        Kaffeine can produce a buffer overflow in http_peek() while
        creating HTTP request headers for fetching remote playlists,
        which under certain circumstances could be used to crash the
        application and/or execute arbitrary code.


3. Impact:

        Remotely supplied playlists can be used to execute arbitrary
        code on the local machine.


4. Solution:

        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
