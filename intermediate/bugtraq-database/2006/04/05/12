               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated tar package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:183571-2
Issue date:        2006-04-04
Product:           Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix, Security
CVE Names:         CVE-2006-0300
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated tar package that fixes a buffer overflow bug is now
available.

The GNU tar program saves many files together in one archive and can
restore individual files (or all of the files) from that archive.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 3 - i386, x86_64

3. Problem description:

Jim Meyering discovered a buffer overflow bug in the way GNU tar
extracts malformed archives. By tricking a user into extracting a
malicious tar archive, it is possible to execute arbitrary code as the
user running tar. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) assigned the name CVE-2006-0300 to this issue.

Users of tar should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
backported patch to correct this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
