Subject: Re: ArGoSoft FTP server remote heap overflow



A buffer overflow in DELE was originally reported to Bugtraq by CorryL
in March 2005, for ArGoSoft FTP 1.4.2.8 (CVE-2005-0696):

  http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/392653

According to CorryL's disclosure timeline, no patch had been released
by the disclosure date.

So, is this a rediscovery of that older issue, for the most recent
version?
