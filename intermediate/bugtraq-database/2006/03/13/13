3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in Dwarf HTTP
Server, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose
potentially sensitive information and to conduct cross-site scripting
attacks.

1) The vulnerability is caused due to a validation error of the
filename extension supplied by the user in the URL. This can be
exploited to retrieve the source code of JSP files from the server
via specially crafted requests containing dot, space, slash and NULL
characters.

2) Input passed to the URL is not sansitised before being return to
the user in an error message. This can be exploited to execute
arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context
of an affected site.
