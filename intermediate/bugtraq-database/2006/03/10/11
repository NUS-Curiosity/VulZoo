Synopsis
========

A malicious tar archive could trigger a Buffer overflow in GNU tar,
potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GNU tar is the standard GNU utility for creating and manipulating tar
archives, a common format used for creating backups and distributing
files on UNIX-like systems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /   Vulnerable   /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/tar      < 1.15.1-r1                        >= 1.15.1-r1

Description
===========

Jim Meyering discovered a flaw in the handling of certain header fields
that could result in a buffer overflow when extracting or listing the
contents of an archive.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could construct a malicious tar archive that could
potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running GNU tar.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU tar users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/tar-1.15.1-r1"
