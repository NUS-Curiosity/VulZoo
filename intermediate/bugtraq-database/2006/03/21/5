Synopsis
========

PeerCast is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

PeerCast is a Peer to Peer broadcasting technology for listening to
radio and watching video on the Internet.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/peercast      < 0.1217                      >= 0.1217

Description
===========

INFIGO discovered a problem in the URL handling code. Buffers that are
allocated on the stack can be overflowed inside of nextCGIarg()
function.

Impact
======

By sending a specially crafted request to the HTTP server, a remote
attacker can cause a stack overflow, resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PeerCast users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/peercast-0.1217"
