Synopsis
========

Pngcrush is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Pngcrush is an optimizer for PNG files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/pngcrush       < 1.6.2                         >= 1.6.2

Description
===========

Carsten Lohrke of Gentoo Linux reported that Pngcrush contains a
vulnerable version of zlib (GLSA 200507-19).

Impact
======

By creating a specially crafted data stream, attackers can overwrite
data structures for applications that use Pngcrush, resulting in a
Denial of Service and potentially arbitrary code execution.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Pngcrush users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/pngcrush-1.6.2"
