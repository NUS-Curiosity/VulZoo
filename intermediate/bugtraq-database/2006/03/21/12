Synopsis
========

libcurl is affected by a buffer overflow in the handling of URLs for
the TFTP protocol, which could be exploited to compromise a user's
system.

Background
==========

cURL is a command line tool for transferring files with URL syntax,
supporting numerous protocols. libcurl is the corresponding client-side
library.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1  net-misc/curl      < 7.15.3                         *>= 7.15.1-r1
                                                              >= 7.15.3
                                                              <= 7.14.1

Description
===========

Ulf Harnhammar reported a possible buffer overflow in the handling of
TFTP URLs in libcurl due to the lack of boundary checks.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to compromise a user's
system by enticing the user to request a malicious URL with
cURL/libcurl or to use a HTTP server redirecting to a malicious TFTP
URL.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All cURL users should upgrade to the latest version:

     # emerge --sync
     # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/curl-7.15.1-r1"
