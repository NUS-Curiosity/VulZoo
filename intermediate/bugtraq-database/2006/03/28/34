Threat Severity
Critical;
There is currently no known vendor patch released for this vulnerability. 
Determina is aware
of multiple exploits circulating on the Internet that can compromise 
vulnerable systems.

This fix can be applied to:

Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01
Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0
Overview
This is a runtime fix for the IE createTextRange() vulnerability. It can be 
applied to Windows
2000, XP and 2003 systems running Internet Explorer 5.01 and 6.0. The 
vulnerability lies in the
MSHTML.DLL rendering engine which is loaded into many applications for HTML 
rendering, including
but not limited to Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office.

The installation of the fix consists of adding the fix DLL to the 
AppInit_DLLs registry key in

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows

The MSI installer will do this automatically. This will enable loading this 
fix DLL into all the
vulnerable applications. The fix does not modify any file or application on 
the disk. It will only
modify the vulnerable applications and DLLs in memory. The fix will not be 
applied to any processes
that are running at the time of the installation. To enable the patch, you 
have to restart IE, Outlook
and any other process that need to be protected. After the installation, run 
status.exe to verify that
your system is protected. If you have a version of MSHTML.DLL that the patch 
does not support,
status.exe will report that the protection is not active.

Once Microsoft releases an official patch and it is installed by the user, 
the Determina Shield will
not be applied any more. Determina recommends uninstalling this fix even 
though keeping it active will
not affect the system. To uninstall the fix, use "Add Remove Programs" in 
the Control Panel. To uninstall
it manually, remove the DLL from the AppInit_DLLs key and restart your 
machine. You can then safely delete
the DLL.

This tool requires administrative privileges on the vulnerable machines in 
order to install the fix.
