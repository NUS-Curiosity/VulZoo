Networksecurity.fi Security Advisory (30-03-2006)

Title: McAfee VirusScan DUNZIP32.dll Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Criticality: High (3/3)
Affected software: McAfee VirusScan versions 10 Build 10.0.21 and prior
Author: Juha-Matti Laurio
Date: 30th March, 2006
Advisory ID: Networksecurity.fi Security Advisory (30-03-2006) (#16)
CVE reference: CVE-2004-1094

- From the vendor:
"VirusScan - Always-updated protection against PC viruses. Safeguard 
your hard drive, email, attachments and downloads from known and unknown 
viruses, mass-mailing worms, Trojans and potentially unwanted programs 
(PUPs) like spyware."

- Description:
McAfee ViruScan anti-virus software is confirmed as affected to remote 
type buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused due to a 
boundary error in a 3rd-party
compression library's (DUNZIP32.dll) old, vulnerable version used when 
handling packed signature files. InnerMedia DynaZip compression library 
mentioned is responsible for virus description file unpacking 
operations. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow via a 
specially crafted signature file. When a specially crafted virus
definition package containing a file with an overly long filename (a 
file name or files inside a package) is opened the attacker may be able 
to execute arbitrary code on user's system (see VU#582498 reference). 
Opening of signature file is an automatic operation of product's 
SecurityCenter.

version 3.x. According to InnerMedia company versions 5.00.03 and prior
