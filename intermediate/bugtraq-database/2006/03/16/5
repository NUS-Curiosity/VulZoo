Synopsis
========

A memory allocation bug in Freeciv allows a remote attacker to perform
a Denial of Service attack.

Background
==========

Freeciv is an open source turn-based multiplayer strategy game, similar
to the famous Civilization series.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-strategy/freeciv       < 2.0.8                     >= 2.0.8

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma discovered that Freeciv could be tricked into the
allocation of enormous chunks of memory when trying to uncompress
malformed data packages, possibly leading to an out of memory condition
which causes Freeciv to crash or freeze.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this issue to cause a Denial of Service
by sending specially crafted data packages to the Freeciv game server.

Workaround
==========

Play solo games or restrict your multiplayer games to trusted parties.

Resolution
==========

All Freeciv users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-strategy/freeciv-2.0.8"
