Subject: trusting SMTP [was: SendGate: Sendmail Multiple
	Vulnerabilities]


Oh, sorry for not mentioning earlier -
Operators that want to patch Sendmail, I'd suggest doing it soon. Now we
not only do we face risk to our mail servers, but rather trusting other
servers as well.

This may sound as a joke as SMTP is a not trusted service with no trust in
it, but servers that employ different trust models can potentially be
compromised now.
