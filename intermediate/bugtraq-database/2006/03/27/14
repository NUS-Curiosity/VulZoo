http://www.tippingpoint.com/security/advisories/TSRT-06-01.html
March 27, 2006

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2006-0991

-- Affected Vendor:
Symantec VERITAS

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable Symantec VERITAS NetBackup client and server installations.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

This specific flaw exists within specially crafted messages to the
vnetd service, listening on TCP port 13724 via opcode 6 (Request
Service).  An attacker can overrun two fixed size buffers, one on the
stack, and the other in the .data section of the executable.

In the main function of bpspsserver, a call to get_adaptable_string()
at 0x0040243A reads in a variable length string from the network in the
form of '[len][string]'. This string is then copied via a sprintf() at
0x00402458, and a swprintf() at 0x00402479 into two different fixed
sized buffers. The first buffer is on the stack and the second buffer
is a global variable.

-- Vendor Response:
Symantec engineers have addressed these issues in all currently
supported versions of NetBackup. Symantec engineers did additional
reviews and will continue on-going reviews of related file
functionality to further enhance the overall security of Veritas
NetBackup products and to eliminate any additional potential concerns.

Security updates are available for all supported products. Symantec
strongly recommends all customers immediately apply the latest
cumulative Security Pack updates or Maintenance Pack releases as
indicated for their supported product versions to protect against
threats of this nature.
