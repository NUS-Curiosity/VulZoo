http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-06-005.html
March 27, 2006

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2006-0989

-- Affected Vendor:
Symantec VERITAS

-- Affected Products:
VERITAS NetBackup v6.0

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since December 19, 2005 by Digital Vaccine protection
filter ID 3976. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable Symantec VERITAS NetBackup installations. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

This specific flaw exists within the volume manager daemon (vmd.exe)
due to incorrect bounds checking during a call to sscanf() that copies
user-supplied data to a stack-based buffer. The vulnerable daemon listens
on TCP port 13701.

-- Vendor Response:
Symantec engineers have addressed these issues in all currently
supported versions of NetBackup. Symantec engineers did additional
reviews and will continue on-going reviews of related file
functionality to further enhance the overall security of Veritas
NetBackup products and to eliminate any additional potential concerns.
 
Security updates are available for all supported products. Symantec
strongly recommends all customers immediately apply the latest
cumulative Security Pack updates or Maintenance Pack releases as
indicated for their supported product versions to protect against
threats of this nature.
