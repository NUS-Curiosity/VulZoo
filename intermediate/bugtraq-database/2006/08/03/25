Synopsis
========

The Mozilla Foundation has reported numerous security vulnerabilities
related to Mozilla Firefox.

Background
==========

Mozilla Firefox is a redesign of the Mozilla Navigator component. The
goal is to produce a cross-platform stand-alone browser application.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                         /  Vulnerable  /       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla-firefox          < 1.5.0.5          >= 1.5.0.5
  2  www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin      < 1.5.0.5          >= 1.5.0.5
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Benjamin Smedberg discovered that chrome URL's could be made to
  reference remote files.

* Developers in the Mozilla community looked for and fixed several
  crash bugs to improve the stability of Mozilla clients.

* "shutdown" reports that cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks could be
  performed using the construct XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...),
  which created a function that appeared to belong to the window in
  question even after it had been navigated to the target site.

* "shutdown" reports that scripts granting the UniversalBrowserRead
  privilege can leverage that into the equivalent of the far more
  powerful UniversalXPConnect since they are allowed to "read" into a
  privileged context.

* "moz_bug_r_a4" reports that A malicious Proxy AutoConfig (PAC)
  server could serve a PAC script that can execute code with elevated
  privileges by setting the required FindProxyForURL function to the
  eval method on a privileged object that leaked into the PAC sandbox.

* "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that Named JavaScript functions have a
  parent object created using the standard Object() constructor
  (ECMA-specified behavior) and that this constructor can be redefined
  by script (also ECMA-specified behavior).

* Igor Bukanov and shutdown found additional places where an untimely
  garbage collection could delete a temporary object that was in active
  use.

* Georgi Guninski found potential integer overflow issues with long
  strings in the toSource() methods of the Object, Array and String
  objects as well as string function arguments.

* H. D. Moore reported a testcase that was able to trigger a race
  condition where JavaScript garbage collection deleted a temporary
  variable still being used in the creation of a new Function object.

* A malicious page can hijack native DOM methods on a document object
  in another domain, which will run the attacker's script when called
  by the victim page.

* Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability which is caused due
  to an memory corruption error within the handling of simultaneously
  happening XPCOM events. This leads to use of a deleted timer object.

* An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day
  Initiative showed that when used in a web page Java would reference
  properties of the window.navigator object as it started up.

* Thilo Girmann discovered that in certain circumstances a JavaScript
  reference to a frame or window was not properly cleared when the
  referenced content went away.

Impact
======

A user can be enticed to open specially crafted URLs, visit webpages
containing malicious JavaScript or execute a specially crafted script.
These events could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, or the
installation of malware on the user's computer.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.5"

Users of the binary package should upgrade as well:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.5"
