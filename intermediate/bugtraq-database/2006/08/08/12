Synopsis
========

A heap-based buffer overflow in DUMB could result in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

DUMB (Dynamic Universal Music Bibliotheque) is an IT, XM, S3M and MOD
player library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/dumb     < 0.9.3-r1                        >= 0.9.3-r1

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma found a heap-based buffer overflow in the
it_read_envelope function which reads the envelope values for volume,
pan and pitch of the instruments referenced in a ".it" (Impulse
Tracker) file with a large number of nodes.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to load a malicious ".it" (Impulse Tracker) file, an
attacker may execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
the application that uses a vulnerable DUMB library.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All users of DUMB should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/dumb-0.9.3-r1"
