Synopsis
========

Motor uses a vulnerable ktools library, which could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Motor is a text mode based programming environment for Linux, with a
syntax highlighting feature, project manager, makefile generator, gcc
and gdb front-end, and CVS integration.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-util/motor     < 3.4.0-r1                        *>= 3.3.0-r1
                                                           >= 3.4.0-r1

Description
===========

In November 2005, Zone-H Research reported a boundary error in the
ktools library in the VGETSTRING() macro of kkstrtext.h, which may
cause a buffer overflow via an overly long input string.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to use a malicious file or input,
which could lead to the crash of Motor and possibly the execution of
arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Motor 3.3.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/motor-3.3.0-r1"

All motor 3.4.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/motor-3.4.0-r1"
