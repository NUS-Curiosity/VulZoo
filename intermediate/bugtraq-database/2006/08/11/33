Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0046

Package names:	   clamav, kernel 
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-08-11
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  clamav
  Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose 
  of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment 
  scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded
  daemon, a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via
  Internet. The programs are based on a shared library distributed with
  package, which you can use with your own software. Most importantly,
  the virus database is kept up to date .

  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of 
  your Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the
  basic functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process
  allocation, device input and output, etc.

Problem description:
  clamav < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Damian Put has discovered a vulnerability in ClamAV,
    which is caused due to an boundary error in the "pefromupx()"
    function in libclamav/upx.c when unpacking PE executable files
    compressed with UPX. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow via a specially crafted UPX compressed file.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-4018 this issue.


  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - New upstream.
  - SECURITY FIX: Linux kernel 2.6.x, when using both NFS and EXT3,
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (file system
    panic) via a crafted UDP packet with a V2 lookup procedure that
    specifies a bad file handle (inode number), which triggers an error
    and causes an exported directory to be remounted read-only.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2006-3468 to this issue.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
