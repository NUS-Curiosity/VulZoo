Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package are subject to several
    vulnerabilities.  Certain malformed UDF filesystems can cause the
    system to crash (denial of service).  Malformed CDROM firmware or
    USB storage devices (such as USB keys) could cause system crash
    (denial of service), and if they were intentionally malformed, can
    cause arbitrary code to run with elevated privileges.  In addition,
    the SCTP protocol is subject to a remote system crash (denial of
    service) attack, but rPath Linux does not include the tools required
    to configure the SCTP protocol, so rPath Linux is not configured
    by default to be vulnerable to this attack.
    
    This update requires a system reboot to implement the fixes.
