Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0044

Package names:	   apache, gnupg, libtiff 
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-08-04
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  apache
  Apache is a full featured web server that is freely available, and also
  happens to be the most widely used. Built with loadable modules
  (all standard modules enabled). This verion is intended as a
  replacement for a standard apache, the configuration files provided
  with apache and apache-ssl are unchanged.

  gnupg
  GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because it does not
  use IDEA it can be used without any restrictions. GnuPG is in compliance
  with the OpenPGP specification (RFC2440).

  libtiff
  The libtiff package contains a library of functions for manipulating
  TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files.  TIFF is a widely
  used file format for bitmapped images.  TIFF files usually end in the
  .tif extension and they are often quite large.

Problem description:
  apache < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in Apache HTTP Server,
    which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise
    a vulnerable system. The vulnerability is caused by a off-by-one error
    in mod_rewrite within the ldap scheme handling and can be exploited
    to cause a one-byte buffer overflow.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-3747 to this issue.


  gnupg < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Evgeny Legerov has reported a vulnerability in GnuPG,
    caused due to an input validation error in parse_packet.c when
    handling certain message packets. This can be exploited to cause
    GnuPG to consume large amounts of memory or crash via an overly
    long comment length in a message packet. This can further be
    exploited to cause an integer overflow, which leads to possible
    memory corruption and crashes GnuPG.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-3746 to this issue.

  libtiff < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team has reported some
    vulnerabilities in libTIFF, which can be exploited by malicious people
    to cause a DoS or potentially compromise a vulnerable system. The
    vulnerabilities are caused due to various heap and integer overflows
    when processing TIFF images and can be exploited via a specially
    crafted TIFF image.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-3459, CVE-2006-3460, CVE-2006-3461,
    CVE-2006-3462, CVE-2006-3463, CVE-2006-3464 and CVE-2006-3465
    these issues.
