Synopsis
========

Warzone 2100 Resurrection server and client are vulnerable to separate
buffer overflows, potentially allowing remote code execution.

Background
==========

Warzone 2100 Resurrection is a real-time strategy game, developed by
Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos Interactive.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                     /  Vulnerable  /           Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-strategy/warzone2100      <= 2.0.3              Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma discovered two buffer overflow vulnerabilities in
Warzone 2100 Resurrection. The recvTextMessage function of the Warzone
2100 Resurrection server and the NETrecvFile function of the client use
insufficiently sized buffers.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending
specially crafted input to the server, or enticing a user to load a
specially crafted file from a malicious server. This may result in the
execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
Warzone 2100 Resurrection.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround for this issue.

Resolution
==========

Warzone 2100 Resurrection has been masked in Portage pending the
resolution of these issues. Warzone 2100 Resurrection players are
advised to uninstall the package until further notice:
    # emerge --ask --unmerge "games-strategy/warzone2100"
