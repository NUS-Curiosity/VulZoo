Synopsis
========

The fbgs script provided by fbida allows the execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

fbida is a collection of image viewers and editors for the framebuffer
console and X11. fbgs is a PostScript and PDF viewer for the linux
framebuffer console.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/fbida      < 2.03-r4                         >= 2.03-r4

Description
===========

Toth Andras has discovered a typographic mistake in the "fbgs" script,
shipped with fbida if the "fbcon" and "pdf" USE flags are both enabled.
This script runs "gs" without the -dSAFER option, thus allowing a
PostScript file to execute, delete or create any kind of file on the
system.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can entice a vulnerable user to view a malicious
PostScript or PDF file with fbgs, which may result with the execution
of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All fbida users with the "fbcon" and "pdf" USE flags both enabled
should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/fbida-2.03-r4"
