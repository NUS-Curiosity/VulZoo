Description:
    Previous versions of the krb5 packages are vulnerable to local
    root privilege escalation caused by not checking the return
    code from the setuid() function in several utilities.  These
    vulnerabilities are not exposed in the default configuration on
    rPath Linux, but some rPath Linux users may have configured krb5
    to expose the vulnerabilities by enabling the kerberos krsh and
    kerberos ftp services, or by making the ksu or v4rcp binaries
    setuid root.  These vulnerabilities have been resolved in the
    new versions of the krb5 packages.
