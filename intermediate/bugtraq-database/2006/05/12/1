Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a critical vulnerability in
QuickTime Player. There is a integer overflow in the way QuickTime
processes fpx format files. An attacker can create a fpx file and send
it to the user via email, web page, or fpx file with activex.

Technical Description:
In an fpx file, there is a field that figures out how many blocks of
data there are in that file. One block data size is 0x200, QuickTime
Player will allocate memory relying on (number*0x200) but does not check
the size value and an integer overflow can occur.  If you set the block
value to 0x800000 an integer overflow will occur which will then cause a
heap overflow and write invalid memory.
