3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Eserv/3, which
can be exploited by malicious users to bypass certain security
restrictions and to disclose potentially sensitive information, and
by malicious people to gain access to potentially sensitive information.

1) Directory traversal errors exist in the CREATE, SELECT, DELETE,
RENAME, COPY and APPEND commands of the IMAP service. This can be
exploited by an authenticated user to read other users' emails,
create/rename arbitrary directories on the system, and delete empty
directories.

2) A validation error of the filename extension supplied by the user
in the URL can be exploited to retrieve the source code of script
files (e.g. PHP, PL) from the HTTP server via specially crafted requests
containing dot, space and slash characters.

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Update to version 3.26 or apply patch.
