Synopsis
========

Quagga's RIP daemon allows the injection of routes and the disclosure
of routing information. The BGP daemon is vulnerable to a Denial of
Service.

Background
==========

The Quagga Routing Suite implements three major routing protocols: RIP
(v1/v2/v3), OSPF (v2/v3) and BGP4.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/quagga      < 0.98.6-r1                     >= 0.98.6-r1

Description
===========

Konstantin V. Gavrilenko discovered two flaws in the Routing
Information Protocol (RIP) daemon that allow the processing of RIP v1
packets (carrying no authentication) even when the daemon is configured
to use MD5 authentication or, in another case, even if RIP v1 is
completely disabled. Additionally, Fredrik Widell reported that the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) daemon contains a flaw that makes it lock
up and use all available CPU when a specific command is issued from the
telnet interface.

Impact
======

By sending RIP v1 response packets, an unauthenticated attacker can
alter the routing table of a router running Quagga's RIP daemon and
disclose routing information. Additionally, it is possible to lock up
the BGP daemon from the telnet interface.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Quagga users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/quagga-0.98.6-r1"
