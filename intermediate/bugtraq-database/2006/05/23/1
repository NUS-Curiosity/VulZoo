Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0028

Package names:	   kernel, mysql
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-05-19
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.

  mysql 
  MySQL is a true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL (Structured Query
  Language) database server. MySQL is a client/server implementation
  that consists of a server daemon (mysqld) and many different client
  programs/libraries. 

Problem description:
  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Memory leak in __setlease in fs/locks.c allows
    attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via
    unspecified actions related to an "uninitialised return value,"
    aka "slab leak."
  - lease_init in fs/locks.c allows attackers to cause a denial of
    service (fcntl_setlease lockup) via actions that cause lease_init
    to free a lock that might not have been allocated on the stack.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2006-1859 and CVE-2006-1860 to these issue.

  mysql < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Stefano Di Paola has reported some vulnerabilities in
    MySQL, which can be exploited by malicious users to disclose
    potentially sensitive information and compromise a vulnerable system.
  - The check_connection function in sql_parse.cc in MySQL allows remote
    attackers to read portions of memory via a username without a trailing
    null byte, which causes a buffer over-read.
  - sql_parse.cc in MySQL allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
    information via a COM_TABLE_DUMP request with an incorrect packet
    length, which includes portions of memory in an error message.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-1516 and CVE-2006-1517 to these issues.
