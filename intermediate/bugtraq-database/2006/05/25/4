Product Description:

> From the pdf-tools.com website[1]:

 "PDF Tools AG is a world leader in PDF (The Adobe Portable Document Format) 
  programming technology, delivering reliable PDF products to international 
  customers in virtually all market segments."

 "PDF Form Filling and Flattening Tool is a command line tool that can
  create, edit, fill in and delete form fields in a PDF document."


Vulnerability Overview:

On April 18th, 2006 VSR has identified a stack overflow in the PDF Tools AG
PDF Form Filling and Flattening tool.  Although this is a traditional 
command line utility there may be a risk to those users of the application 
who use it within web application or a network service, particularly when 
relying on user supplied input to generate the PDF form field name or value 
pairs.

In situations where user supplied input is used to populate a control file 
of name value pairs without sufficient input validation the form field 
names are susceptible to overflow.  The buffer overflow occurs as a 
direct result of unsafe string copy operations to a 256 byte fixed length 
buffer. The binary is also susceptible to overflows of the PDF form field 
names when specified on the command line instead of within a control file.

The following command may be used to check for the existence of the 
vulnerability in the PDF form filling and flattening tool:

./pdformp.exe input.pdf output.pdf `perl -e 'print "A"x260;'`=foo
