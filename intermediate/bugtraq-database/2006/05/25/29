Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Critical

Updated Versions:
    vixie-cron=/conary.rpath.com@rpl:devel//1/4.1-5.2-1

    http://bugs.rpath.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1166

Description:
    In previous versions of the vixie-cron package, when the
    /etc/security/limits.conf file has been set up with limits for
    any user, and that user has permission to use the cron facility,
    that user can use vixie-cron to run arbitrary programs as root by
    exceeding the limits set in /etc/security/limits.conf.
    
    By default, rPath Linux does not include any limits configured
    in the /etc/security/limits.conf file.  The /etc/security/limits.conf
    file is provided by the pam:data component, so to determine whether
    it has been changed in any way, run the command:
    
    # conary verify pam:data | grep /etc/security/limits.conf
