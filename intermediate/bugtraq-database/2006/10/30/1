Synopsis
========

PHP is vulnerable to an integer overflow potentially allowing the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/php     < 5.1.6-r6                          *>= 4.4.4-r6
                                                           >= 5.1.6-r6

Description
===========

A flaw in the PHP memory handling routines allows an unserialize() call
to be executed on non-allocated memory due to a previous integer
overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the rights of the web
server user or the user running a vulnerable PHP script.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PHP 5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-5.1.6-r6"

All PHP 4.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-4.4.4-r6"
