    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-734

Description:
    In previous versions of the screen package, the screen program had
    a bug which is known to make screen vulnerable to a minor denial of
    service attack in which the screen program would crash if presented
    with particular output.  It is possible that this attack could also
    allow a user-complicit attacker to assume the privileges of the
    complicit user.  The screen program is not setuid in rPath Linux,
    so any attack is limited to the complicit user.
