Description:
    Previous versions of the qt-x11-free package include Qt libraries
    contain an integer overflow flaw that causes them not to properly
    bound pixmap image data.  This may enable a user-complicit denial of
    service attack (application crash), or possibly unauthorized access
    via arbitrary code execution, in applications which use vulnerable
    versions of the Qt libraries.
    
    Previous versions of the KDE khtml library use Qt in a way that
    allows unchecked pixmap image input to be provided to Qt, triggering
    this integer overflow flaw in older versions of the Qt library.
    
    25 October 2006 Update:  The initial announcement of this update
    included only the KDE khtml library; this update adds the fix for
    the Qt library itself.
