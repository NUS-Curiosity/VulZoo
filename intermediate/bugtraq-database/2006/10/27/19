Subject: IE7 status: 8 days after release, 3 unfixed issues

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

It's difficult to believe, well, no, actually it's not.

CVE-2005-3312, which is based on information released as early as
September 2005, is still unfixed in Internet Explorer 7 (and any IE6).

POC: http://moritz-naumann.com/tests/xss2.jpg

Whoever doesn't consider this a vulnerability, please direct your
comments to a null device of your choice.

Combined with http://secunia.com/product/12366/?task=advisories
this makes 3 unfixed issues in IE7 within less than ten days.

Maybe some of the 19 unpatched issues listed for IE6 on
  http://secunia.com/product/11/?task=advisories
apply for IE7, too? No, this is not meant to be a secunia promo.

Who got more unfixed IE7 (stable) issues to add to the list?

Moritz
