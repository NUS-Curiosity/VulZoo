-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell eDirectory. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the httpstk.dll library within the
dhost.exe web interface of the eDirectory Host Environment. The web
interface does not validate the length of the HTTP Host header prior to
using the value of that header in an HTTP redirect. This results in an
exploitable stack-based buffer overflow.

Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
