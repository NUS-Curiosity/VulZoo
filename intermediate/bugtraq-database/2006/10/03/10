Oct 02, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Novell Messenger is a corporate, cross-platform instant messaging
product that is based on Novell eDirectory. More information is
available at the following site:

    http://www.novell.com/documentation/nm2/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a DoS vulnerability in Novell Inc.'s GroupWise
Messenger could allow attackers to crash the Messenger server.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper handling of a an
HTTP POST request with a modified 'val' paramater. When such a request
is received, a NULL pointer dereference occurs, leading to a crash of
the service.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would result in the server
crashing, rendering it unusable until it is restarted. Further
exploitation does not appear possible. In order to exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker must send a specially constructed HTTP
request to the server on TCP port 8300.

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in Novell GroupWise Messenger
version 2. All previous versions are suspected vulnerable.
