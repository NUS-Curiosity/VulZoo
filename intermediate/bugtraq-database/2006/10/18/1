rPath Security Advisory: 2006-0194-1
Published: 2006-10-17
Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Major
Exposure Level Classification:
    Remote Deterministic Denial of Service
Updated Versions:
    kernel=/conary.rpath.com@rpl:devel//1/2.6.17.14-0.1-1

    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-721

Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package are vulnerable to remote
    denial of service attacks if the dvb-core module is loaded and
    configured to enable IP traffic over Digital Video Broadcast ISO
    MPEG-2 Transport Streams (RFC4326, RFC4259).  The tools to configure
    it are not included in rPath Linux, so rPath Linux in its default
    configuration is not vulnerable.
