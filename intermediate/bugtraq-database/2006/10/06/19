    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-680

Description:
    Previous versions of the nss_ldap package do not properly handle
    accounts locked using the PasswordPolicyResponse control response,
    allowing potential unauthorized access from locked accounts when
    systems are configured to use LDAP authentication.  rPath Linux
    is not configured to use LDAP authentication by default.
