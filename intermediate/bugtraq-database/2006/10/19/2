    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-723

Description:
    Previous versions of the KDE khtml library use Qt in a way that
    allows unchecked pixmap image input to be provided to Qt, triggering
    an integer overflow flaw in Qt.  This enables a user-complicit denial
    of service attack (application crash), or possibly unauthorized access
    via arbitrary code execution.
