Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.13.06: Apache HTTP Server mod_tcl set_var
 Format String Vulnerability

Apache HTTP Server mod_tcl set_var Format String Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.13.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 13, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

The mod_tcl module for the Apache httpd v2.x is a scripting module that
allows a TCL developer to create server side script pages in TCL. It is
available as a contrib package for several distributions.  For more
information, see http://tcl.apache.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a format string vulnerability in the mod_tcl
module for the Apache httpd v2.x could allow attackers to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the httpd. 

Due to programmer error, user supplied data is passed as the format
string specifier to several calls to an internally defined variable
argument function.  The function 'set_var' is declared as follows:

  mod_tcl.h:117:void set_var(Tcl_Interp *interp, char *var1,
                             char *var2, const char *fmt, ...);

Several insecure calls to this function are made through out the code,
as seen below:

  tcl_cmds.c:437:         set_var(interp, nm_var, (char*) key,
                                  (char*) val);
  tcl_cmds.c:2231:                set_var(interp, nm_env, env[i],
                                          sptr + 1);
  tcl_core.c:650:                         set_var(interp, namespc,
                                                  vl[i].var2,
                                                  vl[i].var3);

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to gain local access to
the vulnerable system in the context of the affected httpd. To exploit
this vulnerability, the attacker must know the location of at least one
tcl server script that is configured to use this module for processing.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in version
1.0 of mod_tcl for Apache 2.x.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
