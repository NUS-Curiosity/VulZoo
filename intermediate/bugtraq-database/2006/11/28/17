Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-11-28
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0

Package description:
  openldap
  OpenLDAP is an open-source suite of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol) applications and development tools. LDAP is a set of
  protocols for accessing directory services (usually phone book style
  information, but other information is possible) over the Internet,
  similar to the way DNS (Domain Name System) information is propagated
  over the Internet. This package contains the slapd and slurpd servers,
  migration scripts, and related files.

  proftpd
  ProFTPd is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity,
  security, and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like
  configuration syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure,
  including support for multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP,
  and permission-based directory visibility.

Problem description:
  openldap  < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Evgeny Legerov has reported a vulnerability in
    OpenLDAP, caused due to an error when processing certain BIND
    requests. This can be exploited to cause a crash by sending specially
    crafted BIND requests to an OpenLDAP server.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-5779 to this issue.

  proftpd < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Evgeny Legerov has reported a vulnerability in ProFTPD,
    caused due to a buffer overflow error in the "main.c" file where the
    "cmd_buf_size" size of the buffer used to handle FTP commands sent
    by clients is not properly set to the size configured via the
    "CommandBufferSize" directive. This can be exploited by malicious
    people to compromise a vulnerable system.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2006-5815 to this issue.
  - Security fix in mod_tls.
