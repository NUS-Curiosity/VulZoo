Synopsis
========

Mono is vulnerable to linking attacks, potentially allowing a local
user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

Mono provides the necessary software to develop and run .NET client and
server applications.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/mono     < 1.1.13.8.1                      >= 1.1.13.8.1

Description
===========

Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team discovered that the
System.CodeDom.Compiler classes of Mono create temporary files with
insecure permissions.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create links in the temporary file directory,
pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When an affected
class is called, this could result in the file being overwritten with
the rights of the user running the script.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mono users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/mono-1.1.13.8.1"

References
==========
