4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in My Firewall Plus,
which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated
privileges.

The vulnerability is caused due to the application windows running
with SYSTEM privileges and the application not checking if 
explorer.exe is running before performing certain actions. This can be
exploited to launch iexplore.exe with SYSTEM privileges by terminating
explorer.exe and then use the "Test Your Firewall" functionality.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary commands with
SYSTEM privileges.
