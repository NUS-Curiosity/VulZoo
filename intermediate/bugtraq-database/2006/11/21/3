Synopsis
========

The Ruby cgi.rb CGI library is vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack.

Background
==========

Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on
simplicity and productivity.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/ruby     < 1.8.5-r3                          >= 1.8.5-r3

Description
===========

Zed Shaw, Jeremy Kemper, and Jamis Buck of the Mongrel project reported
that the CGI library shipped with Ruby is vulnerable to a remote Denial
of Service by an unauthenticated user.

Impact
======

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending the cgi.rb library an
HTTP request with multipart MIME encoding that contains a malformed
MIME boundary specifier beginning with "-" instead of "--". Successful
exploitation of the vulnerability causes the library to go into an
infinite loop waiting for additional non-existent input.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.5-r3"

==========
