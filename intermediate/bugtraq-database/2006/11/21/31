Synopsis
========

Texinfo is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Texinfo is the official documentation system of the GNU project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-apps/texinfo      < 4.8-r5                          >= 4.8-r5

Description
===========

Miloslav Trmac from Red Hat discovered a buffer overflow in the
"readline()" function of texindex.c. The "readline()" function is
called by the texi2dvi and texindex commands.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted Texinfo file, an
attacker could execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user
running Texinfo.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Texinfo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/texinfo-4.8-r5"
