-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of AOL ICQ. User interaction is not required
to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the DownloadAgent function of the
ICQPhone.SipxPhoneManager ActiveX control with the following CLSID:

    54BDE6EC-F42F-4500-AC46-905177444300

The vulnerable function takes a single URI argument of a file to
download and execute under the context of the running user. A malicious
ICQ avatar can be used as an exploitation vector, allowing attackers to
exploit this vulnerability by simply messaging a target ICQ user.

-- Vendor Response:
AOL has issued an update to correct this vulnerability on 10/31/2006.
The update is automatically applied once connected to the ICQ service.
