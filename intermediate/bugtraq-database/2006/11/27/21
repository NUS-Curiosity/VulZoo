Synopsis
========

Kile uses default permissions for backup files, potentially leading to
information disclosure.

Background
==========

Kile is a TeX/LaTeX editor for KDE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-editors/kile     < 1.9.2-r1                       >= 1.9.2-r1

Description
===========

Kile fails to set the same permissions on backup files as on the
original file. This is similar to CVE-2005-1920.

Impact
======

A kile user may inadvertently grant access to sensitive information.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Kile users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/kile-1.9.2-r1"
