    http://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-760

Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package are vulnerable to a local
    denial of service attack; allows local users can cause the kernel
    to hang in an infinite loop or to crash.  The vulnerability requires
    IPv6 to be enabled, and IPv6 is enabled by default on rPath Linux
    systems.
    
    A system reboot is required to resolve this vulnerability.
    
    In addition, starting with this version, Xen dom0 and Xen domU
    kernels with PAE support have been added for the x86 platform.
    To install them, add "kernel.pae" to the flavor.  For example:
    "conary update kernel[xen,dom0,kernel.pae]"
