Synopsis
========

Several Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been identified in
OpenSSH.

Background
==========

OpenSSH is a complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/openssh      < 4.4_p1-r5                    >= 4.4_p1-r5

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team has discovered a
pre-authentication vulnerability, causing sshd to spin until the login
grace time has been expired. Mark Dowd found an unsafe signal handler
that was vulnerable to a race condition. It has also been discovered
that when GSSAPI authentication is enabled, GSSAPI will in certain
cases incorrectly abort.

Impact
======

The pre-authentication and signal handler vulnerabilities can cause a
Denial of Service in OpenSSH. The vulnerability in the GSSAPI
authentication abort could be used to determine the validity of
usernames on some platforms.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenSSH users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/openssh-4.4_p1-r5"
