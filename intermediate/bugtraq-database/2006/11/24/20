Synopsis
========

GNU gv improperly handles user-supplied data possibly allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GNU gv is a viewer for PostScript and PDF documents.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/gv     < 3.6.2-r1                            >= 3.6.2-r1

Description
===========

GNU gv does not properly boundary check user-supplied data before
copying it into process buffers.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted document
with GNU gv and execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user on
the system.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All gv users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/gv-3.6.2-r1"
