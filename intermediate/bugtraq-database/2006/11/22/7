4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a security issue in PassGo SSO Plus,
which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated
privileges.

The problem is that the application sets insecure default permissions
(grants "Everyone" group "Full Control") on the "PassGo Technologies"
directory and all child objects. This can be exploited to remove,
manipulate, and replace any of the application's files.

======================================================================

Set proper permissions on the application directory and all child
objects.

Grant only trusted users access to affected systems.
