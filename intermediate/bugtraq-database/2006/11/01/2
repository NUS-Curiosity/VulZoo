Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.31.06: Novell iManager Tomcat DoS Vulnerability

Novell iManager Tomcat DoS Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.31.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 31, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

iManager is a management portal for Novell's eDirectory server. More
information about iManager is available at the link shown.

    http://www.novell.com/products/consoles/imanager/overview.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a DoS vulnerability in Novell Inc.'s iManager
could allow attackers to crash the iManager Tomcat server.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper handling of a an
HTTP POST request with a long TREE parameter. When such a request is
received, a NULL pointer dereference occurs, leading to a crash of the
service. iDefense Labs testing has indicated that any string longer than
256 bytes will be effective.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation requires that an attacker send a specially constructed HTTP
request to the server. This crashes the server, making it unusable until
it is restarted.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in Novell iManager 2.5. All
previous versions are suspected vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Novell has addressed this vulnerability within iManager version 2.6.
Upgrading to this version will alleviate exposure to the vulnerability.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2006-4517 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for
security problems.
