Synopsis
========

ISC BIND contains two vulnerabilities allowing a Denial of Service
under certain conditions.

Background
==========

ISC BIND is the Internet Systems Consortium implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/bind     < 9.3.2-r4                           >= 9.3.2-r4
                                                          *>= 9.2.6-r4

Description
===========

Queries for SIG records will cause an assertion error if more than one
SIG RRset is returned. Additionally, an INSIST failure can be triggered
by sending multiple recursive queries if the response to the query
arrives after all the clients looking for the response have left the
recursion queue.

Impact
======

An attacker having access to a recursive server can crash the server by
querying the SIG records where there are multiple SIG RRsets, or by
sending many recursive queries in a short time. The exposure can be
lowered by restricting the clients that can ask for recursion. An
attacker can also crash an authoritative server serving a DNSSEC zone
in which there are multiple SIG RRsets.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All BIND 9.3 users should update to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.3.2-r4"

All BIND 9.2 users should update to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.2.6-r4"
