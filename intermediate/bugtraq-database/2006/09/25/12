Synopsis
========

gzip is affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including buffer
overflows and infinite loops, possibly allowing the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

gzip, the GNU zip compression utility, is a free and patent
unencumbered replacement for the standard compress utility.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/gzip     < 1.3.5-r9                          >= 1.3.5-r9

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team has reported multiple
vulnerabilities in gzip. A stack buffer modification vulnerability was
discovered in the LZH decompression code, where a pathological data
stream may result in the modification of stack data such as frame
pointer, return address or saved registers. A static buffer underflow
was discovered in the pack decompression support, allowing a specially
crafted pack archive to underflow a .bss buffer. A static buffer
overflow was uncovered in the LZH decompression code, allowing a data
stream consisting of pathological huffman codes to overflow a .bss
buffer. Multiple infinite loops were also uncovered in the LZH
decompression code.

Impact
======

A remote attacker may create a specially crafted gzip archive, which
when decompressed by a user or automated system exectues arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user id invoking gzip. The infinite loops
may be abused by an attacker to disrupt any automated systems invoking
gzip to handle data decompression.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All gzip users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/gzip-1.3.5-r9"
