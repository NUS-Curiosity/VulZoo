Synopsis
========

xine-lib is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows that could be
exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

xine is a high performance, portable and reusable multimedia playback
engine. xine-lib is xine's core engine.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xine-lib     < 1.1.2-r2                    >= 1.1.2-r2

Description
===========

xine-lib contains buffer overflows in the processing of AVI.
Additionally, xine-lib is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the HTTP
plugin (xineplug_inp_http.so) via a long reply from an HTTP server.

Impact
======

An attacker could trigger the buffer overflow vulnerabilities by
enticing a user to load a specially crafted AVI file in xine. This
might result in the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the
user running xine. Additionally, a remote HTTP server serving a xine
client a specially crafted reply could crash xine and possibly execute
arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.2-r2"
