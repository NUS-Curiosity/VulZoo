Subject: LedgerSMB 1.0.0 and SQL-Ledger 2.6.18 and earler arbitrary code execution

Hi all;

Summary:
A directory transversal issue was found in LedgerSMB 1.0.0 involving the 
terminal variable.  This vulnerability was inherited from the SQL-Ledger 
codebase.  Due to the fact that SQL-Ledger has a built-in text editor, 
this issue could result in arbitrary code execution on the server.  The 
SQL-Ledger and LedgerSMB teams have both released patches to these 
vulnerabilities.

Software affected:
SQL-Ledger, all versions prior to 2.6.19.
LedgerSMB 1.0.0
Other SQL-Ledger derivatives should presume themselves vulnerable (we 
have not checked).

Patched versions:
SQL-Ledger 2.6.19
LedgerSMB 1.0.0p1
SQL-Ledger 2.4.4-2.4.17 are particularly vulnerable due to CVE-2006-4244.

Mitigating factors:
Authentication is required (only for LedgerSMB 1.0.0 and SQL-Ledger 
2.4.3 and lower, or 2.6.18).

Detailed description:
The "terminal" query variable is insufficiently checked in the login.pl 
and admin.pl files for validity and can lead to directory transversal 
and arbitrary code execution in SQL-Ledger (2.6.18 and earlier) and 
LedgerSMB (1.0.0 only).  In particular, an attacker could upload a file 
called "login.pl" using these facilities.  The attacher could then pass 
a specially malformed url to the web server that would cause it to 
execute the code.   The form of the url might be:
http://hostname/path/login.pl?termina=../css

In the course of our disclosure, we sent a notification to the developer 
of SQL-Ledger who quickly patched his software.

All customers should upgrade to the newest versions of these packages at 
their earliest convenience.

Credit for this disclosure should go to Chris Murtagh (a private 
individual) and Richard Patterson of Quickhelp.

Best Wishes,
Chris Travers
