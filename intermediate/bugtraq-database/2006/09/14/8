3) Vendor's Description of Software

Tagger LE is a tagboard (mini message board) that will add visitor 
interactivity with your website and a form of communication to one 
and another. Tagger's many features include an Administration panel, 
IP Banning, Smart Auto Refresh, Smilies, Imposter prevention, and 
more. A perfect addition to a website lacking interactivity. This 
solution uses a Flat File Database (MySQL is not required).

4) Description of Vulnerabilities

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Tagger LE, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable 
system.

Input passed via the query string in tags.php, sign.php, and 
admin/index.php isn't properly sanitised before being used in an 
"eval()" call. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary 
PHP code via a specially crafted parameter name or value.

Examples:
http://[host]/tags.php?foo=%22.[code].%22
http://[host]/sign.php?foo=%22.[code].%22
http://[host]/admin/index.php?foo=%22.[code].%22
http://[host]/taggerLE/tags.php?foo;[code];$foo=foo
http://[host]/taggerLE/sign.php?foo;[code];$foo=foo
http://[host]/admin/index.php?foo;[code];$foo=foo

======================================================================
5) Solution

Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
