Synopsis
========

Vulnerabilities in some accessory scripts of DokuWiki allow remote code
execution.

Background
==========

DokuWiki is a wiki targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small
companies. It does not use a database backend.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /   Vulnerable   /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/dokuwiki      < 20060309d                   >= 20060309d

Description
===========

"rgod" discovered that DokuWiki doesn't sanitize the X-FORWARDED-FOR
HTTP header, allowing the injection of arbitrary contents - such as PHP
commands - into a file. Additionally, the accessory scripts installed
in the "bin" DokuWiki directory are vulnerable to directory traversal
attacks, allowing to copy and execute the previously injected code.

Impact
======

A remote attacker may execute arbitrary PHP (and thus probably system)
commands with the permissions of the user running the process serving
DokuWiki pages.

Workaround
==========

Disable remote access to the "bin" subdirectory of the DokuWiki
installation. Remove the directory if you don't use the scripts in
there.

Resolution
==========

All DokuWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/dokuwiki-20060309d"
