    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-475

Description:
    Previous versions of the openoffice.org packages are susceptible
    to several vulnerabilities, including a denial of service (application
    crash) and a user-complicit unauthorized access attack that enables
    an attacker to cause arbitrary code to be run.  These versions are
    not susceptible to CVE-2006-2199 because Java is not enabled in
    those builds.
    
    Because Java support could not be disabled in the initial release
    of OpenOffice.org 2.0.3, and because Java support is not included
    within rPath Linux 1, this update was delayed until non-Java builds
    were re-enabled in OpenOffice.org.
