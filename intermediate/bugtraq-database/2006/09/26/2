Synopsis
========

GnuTLS fails to handle excess data which could allow an attacker to
forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature.

Background
==========

GnuTLS is an implementation of SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-libs/gnutls       < 1.4.4                            >= 1.4.4

Description
===========

verify.c fails to properly handle excess data in
digestAlgorithm.parameters field while generating a hash when using an
RSA key with exponent 3. RSA keys that use exponent 3 are commonplace.

Impact
======

Remote attackers could forge PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures that are signed
with an RSA key, preventing GnuTLS from correctly verifying X.509 and
other certificates that use PKCS.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GnuTLS users should update both packages:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --update --ask --verbose ">=net-libs/gnutls-1.4.4"

References
==========
