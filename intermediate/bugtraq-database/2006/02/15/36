NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted

Potential Security Impact: Remote Unauthorized Privileged Access

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company,
        HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential vulnerability has been identified with the HP-UX
operating system running DNS BIND4 or BIND8 configured as
forwarders. The vulnerability could be exploited remotely to gain
unauthorized privileged access to the DNS clients.

References: CVE-2006-0527

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
Servers running HP-UX releases B.11.00, B.11.11 running BIND4
or BIND8.

BACKGROUND

Internet Software Consortium's Berkeley Internet Name Domain
(BIND) is a popular DNS server used on many operating systems
including HP-UX.

- From the Internet Software Consortium's website
http://www.isc.org:

  BIND4/BIND8 Unsuitable for Forwarder Use

  If a nameserver -- any nameservEr, whether BIND or otherwise --
  is configured to use "forwarders", then none of the target
  forwarders can be running BIND4 or BIND8. Upgrade all
  nameservers used as "forwarders" to BIND9. There is a current,
  wide scale Kashpureff-style DNS cache corruption attack which
  depends on BIND4 and BIND8 as "forwarders" targets.

Due to architectural limitations BIND4/BIND8 will never be
suitable for use as a forwarder target. BIND9 should be used
instead.

To determine if a system has an affected version, search the
output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset" for one of the filesets
listed below. For affected systems verify that the recommended
action has been taken.

AFFECTED VERSIONS

HP-UX B.11.00
=============
bind.INETSVCS-RUN
upgrade_bind812.INETSVCS-RUN
InternetSrvcs.INETSVCS-RUN
