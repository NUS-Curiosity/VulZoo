VULNERABILITY SUMMARY

Potential security vulnerabilities have been identified with HP
Systems Insight Manager (SIM) versions 4.0 and 5.0 running on
Microsoft Windows. The potential vulnerabilities could be
exploited to allow remote unauthorized access to files via
directory traversal.

References: CVE-2005-2006

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.

HP SIM 4.2, HP SIM 4.2 SP1, HP SIM 4.2 SP2,
HP SIM 5.0, HP SIM 5.0 SP1, HP SIM 5.0 SP2, HP SIM 5.0 SP3
running on Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows 2003, Windows XP.

BACKGROUND

The Hewlett-Packard Company thanks
Matthew Cook (http://escarpment.net/), Loughborough University and
Paul Whitton (http://splurby.net/), Loughborough University
for reporting this vulnerability to security-alert@...com.

Two potential directory traversal vulnerabilities have been
identified within HP Systems Insight Manager.

The first is a potential vulnerability associated with the use of
JBOSS 3.2.7 which could allow an unauthorized user access to files
on the local file system. This issue is identified by the
following candidate for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE):

CVE-2005-2006 - JBOSS 3.2.2 through 3.2.7 and 4.0.2 allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information via a GET request.

The following URL at the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE)
website can be used to find more detailed information regarding
the above listed CVE numbers: http://www.cve.mitre.org/

The affected versions for the first potential vulnerability
related to CVE-2005-2006 are:

HP SIM 5.0
HP SIM 5.0 SP1
HP SIM 5.0 SP2
HP SIM 5.0 SP3
Only for Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows 2003, Windows XP.

The affected versions for the second potential vulnerability are:

HP SIM 4.2
HP SIM 4.2 SP1
HP SIM 4.2 SP2
HP SIM 5.0
HP SIM 5.0 SP1
HP SIM 5.0 SP2
HP SIM 5.0 SP3
Only for Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows 2003, Windows XP.

RESOLUTION

 -> HP has made a new release of HP SIM available: HP SIM 5.0 SP4.
 -> This release addresses both the potential vulnerabilities.
 -> HP SIM 5.0 SP4 is available as a full installation package or
 -> an update package from this location:

     http://h18013.www1.hp.com/products/servers/management/
     hpsim/dl_windows.html

As an alternative these issues can be addressed by manually
editing configuration files in the HP SIM installation as
described below.

==============================
First Issue (CVE-2005-2006):
==============================

This requires a single line modification to an XML configuration
file. The affected file is located in the
<installdir>/jboss/server/hpsim/conf
directory and is called jboss-service.xml

Note: <installdir> is the base directory where HP SIM is
installed.  A typical default installation would be
"C:\program files\hp\Systems Insight Manager"ï¿½.

First, copy the file to a backup location. If there are problems
in the editing process, the original file can be restored.

Next edit the jboss-service.xml file.
Search for 50013 to find the following text:

<mbean code="org.jboss.web.WebService"
  name="jboss:service=WebService">
  <attribute name="Port">50013</attribute>
  <!-- Should resources and non-EJB classes be downloadable -->
  <attribute name="DownloadServerClasses">true</attribute>
  <attribute name="Host">${jboss.bind.address}</attribute>
  <attribute name="BindAddress">${jboss.bind.address}</attribute>
</mbean>

Change the following line:

  <attribute name="DownloadServerClasses">true</attribute>

To:

  <attribute name="DownloadServerClasses">false</attribute>

The text should now appear as follows:

<mbean code="org.jboss.web.WebService"
  name="jboss:service=WebService">
  <attribute name="Port">50013</attribute>
  <!-- Should resources and non-EJB classes be downloadable -->
  <attribute name="DownloadServerClasses">false</attribute>
  <attribute name="Host">${jboss.bind.address}</attribute>
  <attribute name="BindAddress">${jboss.bind.address}</attribute>
</mbean>

Save the jboss-service.xml file.

==============================
Second Issue:
==============================

This requires a single line modification to a resource file.
The affected file is located in the
<installdir>\hpwebadmin\webapps\mxhelp\WEB-INF\cgi
directory and is called .namazurc

Note: <installdir> is the base directory where HP SIM is
installed.  A typical default installation would be
"C:\program files\hp\Systems Insight Manager".

First, copy the file to a backup location. If there are problems
in the editing process, the original file can be restored.

Next edit the .namazurc file and search for #Lang.
The following text will be seen:

#Lang ja

If the HP SIM installation is an English language installation,
change the line to:

Lang en

If the HP SIM installation is a Japanese language installation,
change the line to:

Lang ja_JP.SJIS

Note: Remove the # at the beginning of the line.

Save the .namazurc file.

==============================
Restart HP SIM:
==============================

After editing the files, restart HP SIM.
The changes will not take effect until HP SIM has been restarted.

==============================
Summary:
==============================

For HP SIM 5.0, 5.0 SP1, HP SIM 5.0 SP2, and HP SIM 5.0 SP3

   1. Edit jboss-service.xml
   2. Edit .namazurc
   3. Restart HP SIM


For HP SIM 4.2, HP SIM 4.2 SP1, and HP SIM4.2 SP2

   1. Edit .namazurc
   2. Restart HP SIM
