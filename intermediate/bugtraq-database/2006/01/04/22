Synopsis
========

KPdf and KWord both include vulnerable Xpdf code to handle PDF files,
making them vulnerable to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

KPdf is a KDE-based PDF viewer included in the kdegraphics package.
KWord is a KDE-based word processor also included in the koffice
package.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     4 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.

Description
===========

KPdf and KWord both include Xpdf code to handle PDF files. This Xpdf
code is vulnerable to several heap overflows (GLSA 200512-08) as well
as several buffer and integer overflows discovered by Chris Evans.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF file
with Kpdf or KWord, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running the affected application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All kdegraphics users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdegraphics-3.4.3-r3"

All Kpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kpdf-3.4.3-r3"

All KOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/koffice-1.4.2-r6"

All KWord users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/kword-1.4.2-r6"
