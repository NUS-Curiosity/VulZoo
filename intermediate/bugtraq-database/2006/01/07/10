Synopsis
========

VMware guest operating systems can execute arbitrary code with elevated
privileges on the host operating system through a flaw in NAT
networking.

Background
==========

VMware Workstation is a powerful virtual machine for developers and
system administrators.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /    Vulnerable    /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  vmware-workstation      < 5.5.1.19175              >= 5.5.1.19175
                                                       *>= 4.5.3.19414

Description
===========

Tim Shelton discovered that vmnet-natd, the host module providing
NAT-style networking for VMware guest operating systems, is unable to
process incorrect 'EPRT' and 'PORT' FTP requests.

Impact
======

Malicious guest operating systems using the NAT networking feature or
local VMware Workstation users could exploit this vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code on the host system with elevated privileges.

Workaround
==========

Disable the NAT service by following the instructions at
http://www.vmware.com/support/kb, Answer ID 2002.

Resolution
==========

All VMware Workstation users should upgrade to a fixed version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose app-emulation/vmware-workstation
