Synopsis
========

ClamAV is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which may lead to remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav       < 0.88                         >= 0.88

Description
===========

Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) reported a heap buffer overflow
vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect boundary check
of the user-supplied data prior to copying it to an insufficiently
sized memory buffer. The flaw occurs when the application attempts to
handle compressed UPX files.

Impact
======

For example by sending a maliciously crafted UPX file into a mail
server that is integrated with ClamAV, a remote attacker's supplied
code could be executed with escalated privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.88"
