-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Mozilla Firefox web browser. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page.

The flaw exists when assigning specific values to the window.navigator
object. A lack of checking on assignment causes user supplied data to
be later used in the creation of other objects leading to eventual code
execution.

Mozilla has addressed this issue in the latest versions of the affected
product. More information is detailed in MFSA2006-45:
