Debian Bug     : 368835

The Drupal update in DSA 1125 contained a regression. This update corrects
this flaw. For completeness, the original advisory text below:

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Drupal web site
platform, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary web script. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2006-2742

    A SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the "count" and
    "from" variables of the database interface.

CVE-2006-2743

    Multiple file extensions were handled incorrectly if Drupal ran on
    Apache with mod_mime enabled.

CVE-2006-2831

    A variation of CVE-2006-2743 was adressed as well.

CVE-2006-2832

    A Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in the upload module has been
    discovered.

CVE-2006-2833

    A Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in the taxonomy module has been
    discovered.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.3-6.1sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.8-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your drupal packages.
