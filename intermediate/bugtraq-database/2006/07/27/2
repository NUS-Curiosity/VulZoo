Summary
=========

NSFocus Security Team discovered a remote DoS vulnerability in ISS RealSecure/
BlackICE products lines' detection of MailSlot Heap Overflow (MS06-035). By
sending a specific SMB MailSlot packet it's possible to cause DoS in ISS
protection products.

Description
============

There is a DoS vulnerability in ISS protection products' detection of SMB_MailSlot_Heap_Overflow
(MS06-035/KB917159). By sending a specific SMB MailSlot packet it's possible
to cause an infinite loop to occur in the detection code, and the ISS product 
or even the operating system will stop to respond. For example, for BlackICE 
the vulnerability might cause the inerruption of the network traffic, 
and an approximately 100% CPU utilization. STOP BlackICE engine will not restore
normal operation. Instead OS restart is required. 

This vulnerability can be triggered by a single packet. The establishment of 
a real SMB session is not required.  

Workaround
=============

Block ports TCP/445 and TCP/139 at the firewall.
