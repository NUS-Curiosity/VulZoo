-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the WebEx Downloader Plug-in. Successful
exploitation requires that the target user browse to a malicious web
page.

The specific flaws exists due to the lack of input validation on
various ActiveX/Java control parameters and configuration directives.
The "GpcUrlRoot" and "GpcIniFileName" ActiveX/Java control parameters
allow an attacker to specify the location of a configuration file
containing further control directives. This allows an attacker to
transfer arbitrary files and executables to the target. The attacker
can then leverage available configuration directives to execute the
newly created executables thereby compromising the underlying system.

-- Vendor Response:
WebEx has addressed this issue in the latest release of the Downloader
plug-in. More informaton is available from the vendor advisory
