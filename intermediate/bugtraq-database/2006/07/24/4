Synopsis
========

GIMP is prone to a buffer overflow which may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code when loading specially crafted XCF files.

Background
==========

GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. XCF is the native image
file format used by GIMP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/gimp      < 1.2.12                            >= 1.2.12

Description
===========

Henning Makholm discovered that the "xcf_load_vector()" function is
vulnerable to a buffer overflow when loading a XCF file with a large
"num_axes" value.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code by
enticing a user to open a specially crafted XCF file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GIMP users should update to the latest stable version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/gimp-1.2.12"
