Advisory ID   : SYMSA-2006-007
Advisory Title: Microsoft Office Malformed String Parsing
		Vulnerability
Author        : Elia Florio / elia_florio@...antec.com
Release Date  : 07-11-2006
Application   : Microsoft Office 2000, Office XP (2002),
		Office 2003
Platform      : Windows
Severity      : Remotely exploitable / User access
Vendor status : Duplicated and verified by Microsoft,
		patch available
CVE Number    : CVE-2006-1540
Reference     : http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18889


Overview:

	There exists an overflow condition in Microsoft Office
	when a malformed string included in an Office file is
	parsed by any of the affected Office applications.


Details:

	The problem resides in the code of MSO.DLL, a shared
	library used by Office applications, so the vulnerability
	can be exploited using different attack vectors.
	For example, the vulnerability can be exploited using a
	malformed Excel 2003 file. By changing the size of the
	Unicode "Sheet Name" string with an incorrect size, it is
	possible to generate an integer overflow condition. Excel
	2003 will crash while opening the malformed file due to an
	access violation error with an invalid value of
	EAX=0xFFFFFFFC.

	MOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX-4]
	ADD EAX,-4
	ADD EDX,4


Vendor Response:

	The above vulnerability was addressed for the affected
	platforms via Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-38. If
	there are any further questions about this statement,
	please contact secure@...rosoft.com.


Recommendation:
	Follow your organization's testing procedures before
	applying patches or workarounds.  Customers should apply
	Microsoft's update as soon as possible.
