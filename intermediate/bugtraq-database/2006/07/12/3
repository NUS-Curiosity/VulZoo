Vendor
Microsoft Inc.

Products affected:
Microsoft Office 2000 Service Pack 3
Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3
Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2
maybe some others


Remote: YES
Exploitable: YES

CVE: CVE-2006-1306

Overview:

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the logged in user. An array boundary condition may be
violated by a malicious .xls file in order to redirect execution into
attacker-supplied data. Exploitation requires that the attacker coerce or
persuade the victim to open a malicious .XLS file.


Details:

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of the BIFF file format used
by Microsoft Excel.


A function pointer is not validated and insecurely affected by some user
supplied data, thus resulting code execution.


The disassembly code:


.text:300ABAFC sub_300ABAFC    proc near               ; CODE XREF:
sub_3008FEA4+B5.p
.text:300ABAFC                                         ; sub_30096EC8-5F2.p ...
.text:300ABAFC
.text:300ABAFC arg_0           = dword ptr  4
.text:300ABAFC arg_4           = dword ptr  8
.text:300ABAFC arg_8           = dword ptr  0Ch
.text:300ABAFC
.text:300ABAFC                 mov     eax, [esp+arg_0]		
.text:300ABB00                 movsx   ecx, word ptr [eax]  --> [eax]
read from the XLS file
.text:300ABB03                 push    [esp+arg_8]
.text:300ABB07                 imul    ecx, 14h
.text:300ABB0A                 push    [esp+4+arg_4]
.text:300ABB0E                 push    eax
.text:300ABB0F                 mov     eax, dword_308792C4  -->
[eax]=00e17638,always, maybe different in the language SYSTEM
.text:300ABB14                 call    dword ptr [ecx+eax]  --> ****
Here! call your CODE.
.text:300ABB17                 retn    0Ch
.text:300ABB17 sub_300ABAFC    endp


eax is the index and always set to 00e17638h(?), and the ecx can vary
from a very wide range, so we the attacker can plant specific data
somewhere and CALL it.



The supplied data will be used to some operate and after some caculate
(such as imul) will be used for direct memory access, in this case,
we can caculate and specially choose some value which contains data we
can control, will easily lead to remote code execution.


POC:

No POC will be supplied
