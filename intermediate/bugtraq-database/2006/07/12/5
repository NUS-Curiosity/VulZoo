Microsoft Office GIF Filter Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Release Date: 2006-07-12

Summary
=========

NSFocus Security Team discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft Office
GIF filter, which could allow attackers to run arbitrary code via a carefully crafted
GIF image. 

Description
============

GIFIMP32.FLT is a GIF image filter shipped with Microsoft Office, which is 
installed by default in %CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\Grphflt\GIFIMP32.FLT. 

GIFIMP32.FLT contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of some
malformed GIF images, which allows attackers to run arbitrary code. Any application
that calls GIFIMP32.FLT is affected by this vulnerability. For example, mspaint.exe
will call the filter automatically when opening files in .gif format, if Microsoft
Office is installed. Attackers could gain control over a system by alluring users to
open a malicious GIF image.

Workaround
=============

1. Do not open any GIF image from untrusted sources. 
2. Temporarily remove GIFIMP32.FLT.
