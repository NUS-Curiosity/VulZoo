Description:
    In previous versions of the kernel package, a local root privilege
    escalation and a separate denial of service vulnerability are known
    to exist.
    
    The local root privilege escalation allows any local user to use
    the /proc/self/environ file to reliably subvert the root user.
    The local root privilege escalation has a known and publically
    available exploit in current active use.
    
    The denial of service applies if the ftdi_sio module that drives
    a usb-serial hardware device is loaded, in which case any user
    allowed to access the device can consume all the memory on the
    system by producing data faster than the device can consume it,
    either as an intentional attack or unintentionally, leading to a
    denial of service.
    
    A system reboot is required to resolve these vulnerabilities.
    rPath recommends that you update your systems immediately.
