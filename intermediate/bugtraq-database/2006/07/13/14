This is an important note, IMO.   While the original advisory states
that only kernels >= 2.6.13 and <= 2.6.17.4 are vulnerable, it looks
like, somehow, the same vulnerable code is present in patched Redhat
kernels.  The previous poster had a 2.6.9 version, and I've just
verified that 2.6.9-11.ELsmp (provided with RH EL 4 update 1) is also
vulnerable.

If this is the case of backporting, this should come as no surprise.  If
it is not a backport issue, what vulnerability is being exploited on
these supposedly older kernels?
