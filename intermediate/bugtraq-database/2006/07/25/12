RESOLUTION

HP has made patches and product updates available to resolve the
issue. After installing the recommended patches for B.11.00, B.11.04,
and B.11.11 a system parameter must be set. A utility, sqmax, must
be downloaded and installed to set the required system parameter as
discussed below.

B.11.00 install PHNE_33395 or subsequent,
             then install sqmax as discussed below

B.11.04 install PHNE_33427 or subsequent,
             then install sqmax as discussed below

B.11.11 install PHNE_31091 or subsequent,
             then install sqmax as discussed below

B.11.23 install PHKL_31500 or subsequent,
             sqmax not required

The patches are available from http://itrc.hp.com

For B.11.00, B.11.04, and B.11.11:
 ->After the patches listed above are installed an internal system parameter
 ->must be set. A utility, sqmax, has been provided to set the parameter.
 ->The parameter must be set whenever the system is rebooted.
 ->An initialization file (sqmax.init.d) is included with the sqmax utility.
 ->The instructions in sqmax.readme show how in install the initialization file
 ->so that the system parameter is set automatically when the system is rebooted.

The sqmax utility is available via ftp:
System: hprc.external.hp.com (192.170.19.100)
Login: sqmax
Password: sqmax

FTP Access:
ftp://sqmax:sqmax@...c.external.hp.com/
or:
ftp://sqmax:sqmax@....170.19.100/

   1. Download sqmax.tar from the ftp site into a secure directory.
   2. Verify the cksum or md5sum:
      ->cksum 987961878 30720
      ->md5sum 5a140635ac216fe580d7edc0f68a417a
   3. Unpack the archive:
      tar -xvf sqmax.tar
   4. Refer to sqmax.readme for further instructions.
   5. ->After installing sqmax, run "/usr/contrib/bin/sqmax 1000".
   6. ->As discussed in sqmax.readme, "/usr/contrib/bin/sqmax 1000" 
       ->can be run automatically when the system is rebooted.



 ->The version of sqmax cited in rev.1 of this Security Bulletin will exit with 
 ->a failure message when executed on a B.11.04 system. A new version has 
 ->been provided which functions correctly on B.11.00, B.11.04, and B.11.11. 
 ->The previous version functions correctly on B.11.00 and B.11.11. There is 
 ->no need to download the new version for B.11.00 and B.11.11 systems.

 ->The new sqmax has the following what(1) string:
$Revision: 92453-07 linker linker crt0.o B.11.33 020605 $
sqmax: $Revision: 3.0 $ $Date: 07/17/2006 WTEC TSO Supported - MW $

 ->The previous sqmax has the following what(1) string:
$Revision: 92453-07 linker linker crt0.o B.11.33 020605 $
sqmax: $Revision: 2.0 $ $Date: 10/11/2004 WTEC TSO Supported - MW $

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
