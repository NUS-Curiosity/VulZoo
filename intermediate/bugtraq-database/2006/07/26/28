4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in FileCOPA, which can
be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to an integer underflow error in the
FTP service (filecpnt.exe) when processing directory arguments passed
to certain FTP commands (e.g. "CWD", "DELE", "MDTM", and "MKD"). This
can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by passing a
specially crafted, overly long argument to one of the affected FTP 
commands.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
