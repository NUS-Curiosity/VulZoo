Synopsis
========

A security issue in shadow allows a local user to perform certain
actions with escalated privileges.

Background
==========

shadow provides a set of utilities to deal with user accounts.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-apps/shadow      < 4.0.15-r2                     >= 4.0.15-r2

Description
===========

When the mailbox is created in useradd, the "open()" function does not
receive the three arguments it expects while O_CREAT is present, which
leads to random permissions on the created file, before fchmod() is
executed.

Impact
======

Depending on the random permissions given to the mailbox file which is
at this time owned by root, a local user may be able to open this file
for reading or writing, or even executing it, maybe as the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All shadow users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/shadow-4.0.15-r2"

References
==========
