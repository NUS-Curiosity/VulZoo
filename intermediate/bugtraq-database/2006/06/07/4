Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated squirrelmail package that fixes three security issues is now
available.

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386
Fedora Core 3 - i386, x86_64

3. Problem description:

A bug was found in the way SquirrelMail presents the right frame to the
user. If a user can be tricked into opening a carefully crafted URL, it
is possible to present the user with arbitrary HTML data.
(CVE-2006-0188)

A bug was found in the way SquirrelMail filters incoming HTML email. It
is possible to cause a victim's web browser to request remote content by
opening a HTML email while running a web browser that processes certain
types of invalid style sheets. Only Internet Explorer is known to
process such malformed style sheets. (CVE-2006-0195)

A bug was found in the way SquirrelMail processes a request to select an
IMAP mailbox. If a user can be tricked into opening a carefully crafted
URL, it is possible to execute arbitrary IMAP commands as the user
viewing their mail with SquirrelMail. (CVE-2006-0377)

Users of SquirrelMail are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which contains SquirrelMail version 1.4.6 and is not vulnerable to these
issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
