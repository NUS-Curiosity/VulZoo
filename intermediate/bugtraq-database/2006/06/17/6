 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDKSA-2006:106
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 Package : mdkkdm
 Date    : June 15, 2006
 Affected: Corporate 3.0
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 Problem Description:
 
 A problem with how kdm manages the ~/.dmrc file was discovered by
 Ludwig Nussel.  By using a symlink attack, a local user could get kdm
 to read arbitrary files on the system, including privileged system
 files and those belonging to other users.
 
 Mandriva's mdkkdm also suffers from this same problem and has been
 patched to correct it.  Only Corporate 3 is affected; in Mandriva Linux
 2006, mdkkdm is in contribs.
