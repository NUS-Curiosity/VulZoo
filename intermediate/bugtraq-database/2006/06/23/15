Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0037

Package names:	   kernel, netpbm
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-06-23
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process 
  allocation, device input and output, etc.

  netpbm
  The netpbm package contains a library of functions which support
  programs for handling various graphics file formats, including .pbm
  (portable bitmaps), .pgm (portable graymaps), .pnm (portable anymaps),
  .ppm (portable pixmaps) and others.

Problem description:
  kernel < TSL 3.0 > 
  - New upstream.
  - Module qlogicfc successfully replaced with qla2xxx.
  - Added scsi_transport_spi to initrd module list.
  - SECURITY FIX: A race condition error in the "posix-cpu-timers.c"
    script that does not prevent another CPU from attaching the timer
    to an exiting process, which could be exploited by attackers to
    cause a denial of service.
  - Flaw due to errors in "powerpc/kernel/signal_32.c" and
    "powerpc/kernel/signal_32.c", which could allow userspace to
    provoke a machine check on 32-bit kernels.
  - An infinite loop in "netfilter/xt_sctp.c", which could be exploited
    by attackers to exhaust all available memory resources, creating
    a denial of service condition.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2006-2445, CVE-2006-2448 and
    CVE-2006-3085 to this issue.

  netpbm < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in NetPBM, caused due
    to an off-by-one boundary error within "pamtofits". This can be
    exploited to cause a single byte buffer overflow when processing
    a specially crafted input file.
