There are at least three separate Excel issues that were published in
the past week.  These references suggest that it's the "zero-day"
exploit from last Friday (CVE-2006-3059).

However, the Microsoft blog and CERT advisories do not provide any
details about that issue, not even about the bug type.

So, it's not clear to me whether this is really an exploit for last
Friday's zero-day, or if this is actually a brand new vulnerability.

Any clarification would be appreciated.
