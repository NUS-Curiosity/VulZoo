Subject: Advisory: Authentication bypass in phpBannerExchange

Advisory: Authentication bypass in phpBannerExchange

RedTeam identified two SQL injections in phpBannerExchange. It is
possible to bypass user authentication with them.


Details
=======

Product: phpBannerExchange
Affected Versions: All versions up to phpBannerExchange 2.0 RC5
Fixed Versions: 2.0 RC6
Vulnerability Type: SQL injections
Security-Risk: medium
Vendor-URL: http://www.eschew.net/scripts/phpbe/2.0/
Vendor-Status: informed, fixed version released
Advisory-URL: http://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2006-004.txt
Advisory-Status: public
CVE: CVE-2006-3012
CVE-URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3012


Introduction
============

From the vendor's homepage:
phpBannerExchange is a PHP/mySQL script that allows virtually anyone
with minimal knowledge of PHP, mySQL and web hosting to run their own
banner exchange.


More Details
============

In file "client/stats.php" the variables $login and $pass are not
sanitized at all.

[...]
42    $login=$_REQUEST['login'];
43    $pass=$_REQUEST['pass'];
[...]

If plaintext password are allowed ($usemd5 != "Y"), following SQL query
is used:

[...]
59    $result = mysql_query("select * from banneruser where
                             login='$login' AND pass='$pass'");
[...]

By passing the special character "'" it is possible to alter the SQL
query and bypass authentication.

A similar vulnerability exists in "admin/stats.php":

[...]
49    $login=$_SESSION['login'];
50    $pass=$_SESSION['pass'];
[...]
54    $result = mysql_query("select * from banneradmin where 
                             adminuser='$login' 
                             AND adminpass='$encpw'");
[...]


Proof of Concept
================

User login or administrator login:
Use "'or''='" for both login name and password. You will be
authenticated as the first user/admin in the database.


Workaround
==========

Use PHP Magic Quotes.


Fix
===

Upgrade to version 2.0 RC6


Security Risk
=============

The security risk is high because an attacker could gain access to an
administrator account and view and alter the database and hereby
compromise the whole application.
