Description:
    In previous versions of arts, the artswrapper program has a
    vulnerability which enables a local users to escalate to root
    privileges if the artswrapper program is setuid root. In rPath Linux,
    artswrapper is not setuid root, but if users or derivative
    distributions have modified artswrapper to make it setuid root, they
    may be vulnerable to this attack.
