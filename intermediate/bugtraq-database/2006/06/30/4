1. Topic:

An updated thunderbird package that fixes various bugs is now available
for Fedora Core 3.

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 3 - i386, x86_64

3. Problem description:

Several bugs were found in the way Thunderbird processes malformed
javascript. A malicious HTML mail message could modify the content of a
different open HTML mail message, possibly stealing sensitive
information or conducting a cross-site scripting attack. Please note
that JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird.
(CVE-2006-1731, CVE-2006-1732, CVE-2006-1741)

Several bugs were found in the way Thunderbird processes certain
javascript actions. A malicious HTML mail message could execute
arbitrary javascript instructions with the permissions of 'chrome',
allowing the page to steal sensitive information or install browser
malware. Please note that JavaScript support is disabled by default in
Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-0292, CVE-2006-0296, CVE-2006-1727,
CVE-2006-1728, CVE-2006-1733, CVE-2006-1734, CVE-2006-1735,
CVE-2006-1742)

Several bugs were found in the way Thunderbird processes malformed HTML
mail messages. A carefully crafted malicious HTML mail message could
cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2006-0748, CVE-2006-0749, CVE-2006-1724, CVE-2006-1730,
CVE-2006-1737, CVE-2006-1738, CVE-2006-1739, CVE-2006-1790)

A bug was found in the way Thunderbird processes certain inline content
in HTML mail messages. It may be possible for a remote attacker to send
a carefully crafted mail message to the victim, which will fetch remote
content, even if Thunderbird is configured not to fetch remote content.
(CVE-2006-1045)

A bug was found in the way Thunderbird executes in-line mail forwarding.
If a user can be tricked into forwarding a maliciously crafted mail
message as in-line content, it is possible for the message to execute
javascript with the permissions of "chrome". (CVE-2006-0884)

Users of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to these updated packages
containing Thunderbird version 1.0.8, which is not vulnerable to these
issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
