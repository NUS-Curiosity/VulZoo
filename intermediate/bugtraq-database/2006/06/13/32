-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. Successful
exploitation requires that the target user browse to a malicious web
page.

The specific flaw exists in the Microsoft ActiveX object
DXImageTransform.Microsoft.MMSpecialEffect1Input. Due to improper
garbage collection when another object is assigned to any property,
code execution is possible. This object implements the IObjectSafety
interface and thus the default Internet Explorer settings allow for
arbitrary code execution without any further user interaction.

Several related ActiveX objects suffer from the same problem
including:

    * DXImageTransform.Microsoft.MMSpecialEffect1Input.1
    * DXImageTransform.Microsoft.MMSpecialEffect2Inputs
    * DXImageTransform.Microsoft.MMSpecialEffect2Inputs.1
    * DXImageTransform.Microsoft.MMSpecialEffectInplace1Input
    * DXImageTransform.Microsoft.MMSpecialEffectInplace1Input.1


-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
