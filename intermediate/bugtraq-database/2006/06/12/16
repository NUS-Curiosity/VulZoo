    http://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-429

Description:
    Previous versions of the freetype library contain multiple integer
    overflow weaknesses which allow remote providers of font files
    (which may include fonts embedded in documents such as PDF files)
    to cause applications to crash, and may possibly also allow them
    to execute arbitrary code as the user accessing the files.
