 Overflow Vulnerability

IBM AIX bellmail Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.30.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 30, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

bellmail is a mail user-agent (MUA) and is commonly used for accessing
locally stored electronic mail messages. Under AIX, the bellmail
program is installed by default and is set-uid root. More information
can be found at the URL shown.

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/topic/com.ibm.aix.commadmn/doc/commadmndita/mail_bellmail.htm

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the bellmail
program of IBM Corp.'s AIX operating system allows attackers to execute
arbitrary code with root privileges.

The problem specifically exists within sendrmt function. This function
is called when a user tries to send mail using the "m" command. Within
this function, several sprintf calls are made to concatenate
user-supplied input with static strings. No bounds checking is
performed to ensure that the resulting string will fit in the
destination buffer located on the stack. By supplying a long parameter,
an attacker is able to overwrite program control data located on the
stack and take control of the affected process.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges. Local access is required to execute and interact with the
bellmail program.

It should be noted that the bellmail program does initially set its user
(both saved and effective) to that of the calling user. Generally, it
would be sufficient to drop these privileges. However, in this case,
the bellmail program uses the AIX-specific setpriv functionality to
retain the ability chown arbitrary files on the system.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability within AIX
version 5.3 (5300-06) and 5.2. Previous versions are suspected to be
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Removing the set-uid bit from the bellmail program will protect against
exploitation. However, doing so will render the program unusable.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

IBM Corp. has addressed this vulnerability by releasing interim fixes.
