Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.30.07: IBM AIX lqueryvg Stack Buffer
 Overflow Vulnerability

IBM AIX lqueryvg Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.30.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 30, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

The lqueryvg utility is used to examine the properties of disk volume
groups. It is installed set-uid root by default on multiple versions of
AIX.

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in IBM
Corp.'s AIX operating system may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code with root privileges.

The vulnerability exists within the parsing of the '-p' command line
option. The argument to this option is copied into a fixed size stack
buffer using the sprintf() function without properly validating the
length. This leads to an exploitable stack buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with root privileges. The binary may be executed by any user with a
local account, no special group membership is needed.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in AIX
version 5.2 and 5.3. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Removing the set-uid bit from the binary will prevent exploitation, but
may make the program unusable by non-root users.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

IBM Corp. has addressed this vulnerability by releasing interim fixes.
