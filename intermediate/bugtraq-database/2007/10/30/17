Synopsis
========

Opera contains multiple vulnerabilities, which may allow the execution
of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/opera       < 9.24                             >= 9.24

Description
===========

Michael A. Puls II discovered an unspecified flaw when launching
external email or newsgroup clients (CVE-2007-5541). David Bloom
discovered that when displaying frames from different websites, the
same-origin policy is not correctly enforced (CVE-2007-5540).

Impact
======

An attacker could potentially exploit the first vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Opera by
enticing a user to visit a specially crafted URL. Note that this
vulnerability requires an external e-mail or newsgroup client
configured in Opera to be exploitable. The second vulnerability allows
an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser
session in context of other sites or the theft of browser credentials.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time for all these
vulnerabilities.

Resolution
==========

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.24"
