Synopsis
========

OpenSSL contains a vulnerability allowing execution of arbitrary code
or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/openssl      >= 0.9.8f                          < 0.9.8f

Description
===========

Andy Polyakov reported a vulnerability in the OpenSSL toolkit, that is
caused due to an unspecified off-by-one error within the DTLS
implementation.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code or
cause a Denial of Service. Only clients and servers explicitly using
DTLS are affected, systems using SSL and TLS are not.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8f"

References
==========
