====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in CUPS, which can be 
exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the 
"ippReadIO()" function in cups/ipp.c when processing IPP (Internet 
Printing Protocol) tags. This can be exploited to overwrite one byte 
on the stack with a zero by sending an IPP request containing 
specially crafted "textWithLanguage" or "nameWithLanguage" tags.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Patches for various Linux distributions should be available shortly.
