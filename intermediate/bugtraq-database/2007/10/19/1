Synopsis
========

PDFKit and ImageKits are vulnerable to an integer overflow and a stack
overflow allowing for the user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

PDFKit is a framework for rendering of PDF content in GNUstep
applications. ImageKits is a collection of frameworks to support
imaging in GNUstep applications.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /     Vulnerable     /         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  gnustep-libs/pdfkit        <= 0.9_pre062906           Vulnerable!
  2  gnustep-libs/imagekits          <= 0.6                Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Maurycy Prodeus discovered an integer overflow vulnerability possibly
leading to a stack-based buffer overflow in the XPDF code which PDFKit
is based on. ImageKits also contains a copy of PDFKit.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to view a specially crafted PDF file with a viewer
based on ImageKits or PDFKit such as Gentoo's ViewPDF, a remote
attacker could cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

PDFKit and ImageKits are not maintained upstream, so the packages were
masked in Portage. We recommend that users unmerge PDFKit and
ImageKits:

    # emerge --unmerge gnustep-libs/pdfkit
    # emerge --unmerge gnustep-libs/imagekits

As an alternative, users should upgrade their systems to use PopplerKit
instead of PDFKit and Vindaloo instead of ViewPDF.
