-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of EMC RepliStor Server. User interaction is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the RepliStor Server Service that listens
by default on TCP port 7144. The vulnerable function trusts a
user-supplied size value allowing an attacker to create an undersized
buffer. A later call to recv() overflows that buffer allowing for
arbitrary code execution in the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
EMC has issued updates to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found in knowledge base article emc168869 available from
powerlink.emc.com. EMC customers can further contact EMC Software
Technical Support at 1-877-534-2867.
