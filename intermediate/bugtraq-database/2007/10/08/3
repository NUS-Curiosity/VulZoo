Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in Tk.

Background
==========

Tk is a toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /   Vulnerable   /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/tk      < 8.4.15-r1                         >= 8.4.15-r1

Description
===========

Reinhard Max discovered a boundary error in Tk when processing an
interlaced GIF with two frames where the second is smaller than the
first one.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted GIF
image with a Tk-based software, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tk users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/tk-8.4.15-r1"
