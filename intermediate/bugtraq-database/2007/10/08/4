Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability and several memory corruptions have
been discovered in libvorbis.

Background
==========

libvorbis is the reference implementation of the Xiph.org Ogg Vorbis
audio file format. It is used by many applications for playback of Ogg
Vorbis files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libvorbis       < 1.2.0                       >= 1.2.0

Description
===========

David Thiel of iSEC Partners discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in
the _01inverse() function in res0.c and a boundary checking error in
the vorbis_info_clear() function in info.c (CVE-2007-3106 and
CVE-2007-4029). libvorbis is also prone to several Denial of Service
vulnerabilities in form of infinite loops and invalid memory access
with unknown impact (CVE-2007-4065 and CVE-2007-4066).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by enticing a
user to open a specially crafted Ogg Vorbis file or network stream with
an application using libvorbis. This might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code with privileges of the user playing the file or a Denial
of Service by a crash or CPU consumption.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libvorbis users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libvorbis-1.2.0"
