Synopsis
========

An off-by-one vulnerability has been discovered in Qt, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Qt is a cross-platform GUI framework, which is used e.g. by KDE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/qt     < 3.3.8-r4                            >= 3.3.8-r4

Description
===========

Dirk Mueller from the KDE development team discovered a boundary error
in file qutfcodec.cpp when processing Unicode strings.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted Unicode string to a
vulnerable Qt application, possibly resulting in the remote execution
of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. Note that the boundary error is present but reported to be
not exploitable in 4.x series.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Qt 3.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/qt-3.3.8-r4"

==========
