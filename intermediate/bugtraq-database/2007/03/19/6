Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Thunderbird,
some of which may allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

Background
==========

Mozilla Thunderbird is a popular open-source email client from the
Mozilla Project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mozilla-thunderbird         < 1.5.0.10                >= 1.5.0.10
  2  mozilla-thunderbird-bin     < 1.5.0.10                >= 1.5.0.10
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Georgi Guninski reported a possible integer overflow in the code
handling text/enhanced or text/richtext MIME emails. Additionally,
various researchers reported errors in the JavaScript engine
potentially leading to memory corruption. Additionally, the binary
version of Mozilla Thunderbird includes a vulnerable NSS library which
contains two possible buffer overflows involving the SSLv2 protocol.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to read a specially crafted email that
could trigger one of the vulnerabilities, some of them being related to
Mozilla Thunderbird's handling of JavaScript, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
some of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript. Note that the
execution of JavaScript is disabled by default and enabling it is
strongly discouraged.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.10"

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.10"
