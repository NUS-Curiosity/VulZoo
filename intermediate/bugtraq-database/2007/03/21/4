4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in InterActual Player
and CinePlayer, which can be exploited by malicious people to
compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the
IASystemInfo.dll ActiveX control when processing the "ApplicationType"
property. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow
via an overly long string (more than 260 bytes).

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when e.g.
visiting a malicious website.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Set the kill-bit on the ActiveX control.

The vendor is reportedly working on fixed versions.
