 OVTrace Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

Hewlett-Packard OpenView Operations OVTrace Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 08.09.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 09, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

OpenView Operations software is a suite of network management tools used
to monitor events on, and evaluate the performance of, hosts on the
network. The OVTrace component of this suite is used to log the actions
being taken by the other components of the suite in order to debug any
problems that may be occurring. More information can be found at the
following link.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple stack-based buffer overflow
vulnerabilities in Hewlett-Packard Development Co.'s OpenView
Operations for Windows OVTrace service may allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

The vulnerabilities exist within functions responsible for handling
requests. These functions take a string from the request and copy it
into fixed-size stack buffers. Since the length has not been properly
validated, this results in an exploitable stack-based buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in arbitrary code
execution with SYSTEM privileges.

The OVTrace service, while not crucial to normal operations, is started
by default. The OVTrace service is also present on systems that have
only the management console installed as well as systems that have a
full installation of the server and console installed.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities in HP
OpenView version A.07.50 for Windows, with all patches applied as of
Jun 27, 2007. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Employing firewalls to limit access to the affected service will
mitigate exposure to these vulnerabilities.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Hewlett-Packard Co. has addressed these vulnerabilities by releasing
patches for all HP OpenView products that contain the Shared Trace
Service component. For more information consult the following HP
