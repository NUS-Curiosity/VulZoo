Synopsis
========

Format string vulnerabilities in Qt 3 may lead to the remote execution
of arbitrary code in some Qt applications.

Background
==========

Qt is a cross-platform GUI framework, which is used e.g. by KDE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/qt     < 3.3.8-r3                            >= 3.3.8-r3

Description
===========

Tim Brown of Portcullis Computer Security Ltd and Dirk Mueller of KDE
reported multiple format string errors in qWarning() calls in files
qtextedit.cpp, qdatatable.cpp, qsqldatabase.cpp, qsqlindex.cpp,
qsqlrecord.cpp, qglobal.cpp, and qsvgdevice.cpp.

Impact
======

An attacker could trigger one of the vulnerabilities by causing a Qt
application to parse specially crafted text, which may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Qt 3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "=x11-libs/qt-3*"
