 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Trend Micro SSAPI Long Path Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 08.20.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 20, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Trend Micro AntiSpyware is a spyware detection and removal application
designed to help protect home users computers, networks and account
information. More information is available on the vendor's site at the
following URL.

http://us.trendmicro.com/us/products/personal/antispyware/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerability in Trend Micro
Inc.'s SSAPI Engine could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
with system level privileges.

Trend Micro products which include the VST functionality are vulnerable
to a stack-based buffer overflow in the vstlib32.dll library. This
overflow is triggered when an attacker creates a file on the local file
system with an overly long path. When vstlib32 receives the
ReadDirectoryChangesW callback notification from the Operating System,
a stack based buffer overflow will occur.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with system
level privilege.

Exploitation requires that attackers are able to create a specially
constructed file path on the machine running the Trend Micro product.
This could be the local machine to gain SYSTEM level privileges, or
could be conducted remotely by writing a file to an accessible network
share.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in vstlib32.dll
version 1.2.0.1012. This file is known to be included in several of
