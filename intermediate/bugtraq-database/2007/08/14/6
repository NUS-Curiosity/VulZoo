CVE-2007-3382: Handling of cookies containing a ' character

Severity:
Low (Session Hi-jacking)

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
6.0.0 to 6.0.13
5.5.0 to 5.5.24
5.0.0 to 5.0.30
4.1.0 to 4.1.36
3.3 to 3.3.2

Description:
Tomcat incorrectly treats a single quote character (') in a cookie

leaking of information such as session ID to an attacker.

Mitigation:
Upgrade to 6.0.14

This issue was discovered by Tomasz Kuczynski, Poznan Supercomputing
and Networking Center, who worked with the CERT/CC to report the
