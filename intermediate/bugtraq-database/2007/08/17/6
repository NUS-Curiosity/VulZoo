Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package are vulnerable to a local
    root privilege escalation if running the X Window System server
    with DRM enabled on Intel 965 video chipsets.  They also
    inappropriately allow unpriviledged users to send signals to
    setuid processes that they start, which may in some circumstances
    allow either denial of service or privilege escalation attacks.
    
    This is the first release of the 2.6.22.x kernel for rPath Linux 1,
    which enables significant additional hardware support.  This includes
    support for new hardware in existing drivers, as well as additional
    drivers.
    
    This update requires a system reboot to implement the fixes.
