Description:
    Previous versions of multiple packages are vulnerable to multiple
    attacks involving PDF files, the worst of which may allow an
    authenticated or user-assisted attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    Note that in the case of CUPS, authentication may be as simple as
    being connected to a trusted network.
    
    In addition, a minor Denial of Service attack against the cups
    daemon is ameliorated in this update.
