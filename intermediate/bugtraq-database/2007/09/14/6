    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1710

Description:
    Previous versions of the httpd package are vulnerable to multiple
    Denial of Service attacks, one of which allows a remote attacker
    to crash mod_proxy using a maliciously crafted HTTP request.
    
    In its default configuration, rPath Linux 1 is not vulnerable to
    these attacks.
    
    Note that two additional vulnerabilities fixed in httpd 2.0.61,
    CVE-2007-1863 and CVE-2006-5752, were already fixed in a previous
    update to rPath Linux.
