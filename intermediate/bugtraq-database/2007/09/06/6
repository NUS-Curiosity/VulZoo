Description:
    Previous versions of the krb5 package are vulnerable to an
    unauthenticated remote arbitrary code execution attack against
    the kadmind server.  rPath Linux systems are not automatically
    configured with kadmind enabled.  Systems configured as kerberos
    administrative servers are vulnerable.
