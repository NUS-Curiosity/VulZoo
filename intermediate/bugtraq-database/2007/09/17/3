Synopsis
========

A directory traversal vulnerability has been discovered in GNU Tar.

Background
==========

The GNU Tar program provides the ability to create tar archives, as
well as various other kinds of manipulation.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/tar      < 1.18-r2                            >= 1.18-r2

Description
===========

Dmitry V. Levin discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in the
contains_dot_dot() function in file src/names.c.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to extract a specially crafted tar archive, a remote
attacker could extract files to arbitrary locations outside of the
specified directory with the permissions of the user running GNU Tar.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU Tar users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/tar-1.18-r2"
