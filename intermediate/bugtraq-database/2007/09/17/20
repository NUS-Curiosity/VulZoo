 File Parsing Multiple Integer Overflow Vulnerabilities

Multiple Vendor OpenOffice TIFF File Parsing Multiple Integer Overflow
Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 09.17.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Sep 17, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

OpenOffice is an open-source desktop office suite for many of today's
popular operating systems. Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) is a widely
supported image file format. More information about these technologies
are available from the following URLs.

http://www.openoffice.org/

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiff

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities within
OpenOffice, as included in various vendors' operating system
distributions, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

These vulnerabilities exist within the TIFF parsing code of the
OpenOffice suite. When parsing the TIFF directory entries for certain
tags, the parser uses untrusted values from the file to calculate the
amount of memory to allocate. By providing specially crafted values, an
integer overflow occurs in this calculation. This results in the
allocation of a buffer of insufficient size, which in turn leads to a
heap overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the file.

Exploitation requires that an attacker persuade a targeted user into
opening a maliciously crafted document. This could be accomplished by
hosting the document on a web site, sending the document via electronic
mail, or other means.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities in
OpenOffice version 2.0.4. All versions prior to version 2.3 are
suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The OpenOffice.org team has addressed these vulnerabilities with the
release of version 2.3. For more information, consult the OOo Security
Bulletin at the following URL.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2007-2834 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
security problems.
