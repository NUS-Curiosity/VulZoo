   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2007-009
Advisory Title: RemoteDocs R-Viewer Code Execution and Sensitive
                  Information Disclosure
        Author: Adam Baldiwn / adam_baldwin@...antec.com
  Release Date: 17-09-2007
   Application: RemoteDocs R-Viewer 1.6.2836
      Platform: Windows
      Severity: Remotely exploitable / User access
 Vendor status: Update available
    CVE Number: CVE-2007-4750 CVE-2007-4751
     Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/25591


Overview:

RemoteDocs R-Viewer is a secure document viewer used by remotedocs.com.
There exists a design flaw in RemoteDocs R-Viewer where code can be executed
upon opening the RDZ file without any knowlege or warning to the user.
Additionally, temporary files are not properly removed of disk exposing the
encrypted data.


Details:

The problem is due to a design flaw in the R-Viewer application. It is
possible to replace the normal encrypted RDZ file with a specially
crafted RDZ file. The first file in this archive will be executed with
current user privledges by the R-Viewer application based strictly on file
extension alone.

To further compound this issue it may be possible for an attacker to gain
other sensitive information from the R-Viewer application through easily
predictable temporary directories that don't appear to expire content
regularily. Included inside of these temorary directories are the unecnrypted
copies of the documents the R-Viewer application has opened in the past.

Example:
C:\Program Files\RemoteDocs\Viewer\tmp\31325193(1)   <-- First opening
C:\Program Files\RemoteDocs\Viewer\tmp\31325193(2)   <-- Second opening


Vendor Response:

RemoteDocs Engineers have verified these issues and have resolved them in
the latest product release R-Viewer 1.6.3768. RemoteDocs recommends all
customers immediately obtain the newest version of R-Viewer to protect against
these types of threats. RemoteDocs is unaware of any adverse customer impact
from these issues. There are no known publicly available exploits.


Recommendation:

All users should upgrade to the latest version of R-Viewer 1.6.3768.
