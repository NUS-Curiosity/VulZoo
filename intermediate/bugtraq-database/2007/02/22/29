Dear Andres Tarasco,

Agree,  but  actually,  I  mean  to  store  sensitive  data in different
location (different network share).

There  will  be  one  more  advisory,  it  will demonstrate symlink-like
attacks  on  Windows.  In the same advisory I plan to discuss problem of
secure data in insecure folder mode deeply.

E.g.  it's  quite impossible for administrator to _create_ secure folder
in  insecure  one  without not-quite-race conditions this folder will be
available  for  different bad things (without deleting network share, of
cause).  Under  POSIX  system  this  problem is solvable with umask, for
Windows it seems it was never discussed.

>> Intro:
>>
>> It's  very simple yet interesting vulnerability. ReadDirectoryChangesW()
>> API  allows  application  to  monitor  directory  changes  in real time.
>> bWatchSubtree  parameter  of  this  functions  allows to monitor changes

>> Vulnerability:
>>
>> ReadDirectoryChangesW()  doesn't  check  user's  permissions  for child
>> child  objects,  making  it's  possible  to  retrieve  information about
>> objects user has no "LIST" permissions.
>>
>> Impact:
>>
>> Any  unprivileged  user with LIST access to parent directory can monitor
