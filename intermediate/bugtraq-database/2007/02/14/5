4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in MailEnable Web
Mail Client, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct
cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, and script insertion
attacks.

1) Scripts in email messages are not properly sanitised before being
displayed in the email message. This can be exploited to insert
arbitrary HTML and script code, which is executed in a user's browser
session in context of an affected site when a user views a specially
crafted email message.

2) Input passed to the "ID" parameter in
mewebmail/base/default/lang/EN/right.asp,
mewebmail/base/default/lang/EN/Forms/MAI/list.asp, and
mewebmail/base/default/lang/EN/Forms/VCF/list.asp is not properly
sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to
execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in
context of an affected site.

Successful exploitation requires that the target user is logged in.

3) The application allows users to send messages via HTTP requests
without performing any validity checks to verify the request. This can
be exploited to change a user's settings by e.g. tricking a target user
into visiting a malicious website.
