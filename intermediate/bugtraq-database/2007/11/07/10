Synopsis
========

MadWifi does not correctly process beacon frames which can lead to a
remotely triggered Denial of Service.

Background
==========

The MadWifi driver provides support for Atheros based IEEE 802.11
Wireless Lan cards.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-wireless/madwifi-ng      < 0.9.3.3                 >= 0.9.3.3

Description
===========

Clemens Kolbitsch and Sylvester Keil reported an error when processing
beacon frames with an overly large "length" value in the "xrates"
element.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could act as an access point and send a specially
crafted packet to an Atheros based wireless client, possibly resulting
in a Denial of Service (kernel panic).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MadWifi users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/madwifi-ng-0.9.3.3"

==========
