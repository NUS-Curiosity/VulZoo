Synopsis
========

A flaw has been discovered in OpenSSH which could allow a local
attacker to bypass security restrictions.

Background
==========

OpenSSH is a complete SSH protocol implementation that includes an SFTP
client and server support.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/openssh        < 4.7                              >= 4.7

Description
===========

Jan Pechanec discovered that OpenSSH uses a trusted X11 cookie when it
cannot create an untrusted one.

Impact
======

An attacker could bypass the SSH client security policy and gain
privileges by causing an X client to be treated as trusted.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenSSH users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/openssh-4.7"

References
==========
