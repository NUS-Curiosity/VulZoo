Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 11.05.07: Apple QuickTime Panorama Sample
 Atom Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 11.05.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Nov 05, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

QuickTime is Apple's media player product used to render video and other
media. For more information visit http://www.apple.com/quicktime/

QuickTime VR (virtual reality) is a type of image file format supported
by Apple's QuickTime. It allows the creation and viewing of
photographically captured panoramas and the exploration of objects
through images taken at multiple viewing angles.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in Apple Inc.'s
QuickTime media player could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
in the context of the targeted user.

The vulnerability specifically exists in QuickTime Player's handling of
Panorama Sample atoms in QuickTime Virtual Reality movie. When
processing panorama sample atoms, the size field in the atom header is
not validated. QuickTime will copy the specified amount of memory to a
fixed-size heap buffer, causing heap corruption.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the
context of the current user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker
must persuade a user into using QuickTime to open a specially crafted
QuickTime movie file. This could be accomplished by persuading the user
to click a direct link to a malicious VR movie file. Additionally, this
vulnerability could be exploited within a malicious web page.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense Labs confirmed this vulnerability exists in QuickTime VR
extension 7.2.0.240 as included in QuickTime Player 7.2. Previous
versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling the QuickTime plug-in for browsers can mitigate Web page
attack vectors. To do this, uncheck the "Play movies automatically"
setting within the QuickTime preferences Browser->Playback tab.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Apple has released QuickTime 7.3 which resolves this issue. More
