Description:
    Previous versions of the cups, poppler, and tetex packages contain
    multiple vulnerabilities due to flaws in code included from Xpdf.
    These flaws allow user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code
    using maliciously crafted PDF files.
    
    Note that applications linked against libpoppler may also be affected
    by these vulnerabilities, and will be fixed by this update.
