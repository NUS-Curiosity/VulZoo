Synopsis
========

Several vulnerabilities were found in Ruby on Rails allowing for file
disclosure and theft of user credentials.

Background
==========

Ruby on Rails is a free web framework used to develop database-driven
web applications.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-ruby/rails       < 1.2.5                             >= 1.2.5

Description
===========

candlerb found that ActiveResource, when processing responses using the
Hash.from_xml() function, does not properly sanitize filenames
(CVE-2007-5380). The session management functionality allowed the
"session_id" to be set in the URL (CVE-2007-5380). BCC discovered that
the to_json() function does not properly sanitize input before
returning it to the user (CVE-2007-3227).

Impact
======

Unauthenticated remote attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to
determine the existence of files or to read the contents of arbitrary
XML files; conduct session fixation attacks and gain unauthorized
access; and to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's
browser session in context of an affected site by enticing a user to
browse a specially crafted URL.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ruby on Rails users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-ruby/rails-1.2.5"
