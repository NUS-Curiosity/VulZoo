Subject: Solaris finger bug

Hi all:

Recently, we monitored a cracker from Eastern Europe, who ran 'finger
9@...t' against a Solaris 7 box, and got the following result:

Login          Name     TTY     Idle    When    Where
daemon          ???              < .  .  .  . >
bin             ???      pts/1   <Oct  2, 2002> xxx.lbl.gov
sys             ???                         < .  .  .  . >
account1        ???      pts/8    <Jul 20, 2000> yyy.lbl.gov
account2        ???      pts/5    <Dec 17, 1999> zzz.lbl.gov
account3        ???      pts/2    <Jun 30, 2000> aaa.lbl.gov
account4        ???      pts/1    <Feb 17, 2005> bbb.lbl.gov
account5        ???      pts/5    <May  6, 2005> ccc.lbl.gov
account6        ???      pts/9    <Mar  7 15:18> ddd.lbl.gov

This is on a Solaris 7 box with the latest recommended patch set.
This is not the same bug as described here:

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2001-1503

Below are snippets of Sun's response:

At this time there aren't any plans to address 4432153 in Solaris 8 or
9.  As you may know Solaris 7 is no longer supported.  If a service call
was raised with Sun then patches for Solaris 8 and 9 could be generated.

There isn't a way to disable such behaviour as far as we can tell
despite the SHOULD in the RFC.  We agree the the behaviour of 'finger
9@...t' returning information about accounts with "unusual" whitespace
in the GECOS field is non-intuitive and was also considered incorrect
which is why 4432153 was filed.

Hope this helps.

Does anyone know of other platforms which exhibit this odd behavior?
