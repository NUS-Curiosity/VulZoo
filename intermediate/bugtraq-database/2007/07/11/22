Synopsis
========

XnView is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow and possible
remote code execution when handling XPM image files.

Background
==========

XnView is software to view and convert graphics files. XPixMap (XPM) is
a simple ascii-based graphics format.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-misc/xnview       < 1.70                          Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Package 1 only applies to x86 users.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

XnView is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow while processing
an XPM file with an overly long section string (greater than 1024
bytes).

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted XPM file
with XnView that could trigger the vulnerability and possibly execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running XnView.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

No update appears to be forthcoming from the XnView developer and
XnView is proprietary, so the XnView package has been masked in
Portage. We recommend that users select an alternate graphics viewer
and conversion utility, and unmerge XnView:

    # emerge --unmerge xnview
