 Heap Overflow Vulnerability

Symantec Backup Exec RPC Remote Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.11.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 11, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Symantec Backup Exec is a data recovery solution. It provides backup
services and includes agents that provide protection and recovery.
Additionally, it facilitates management of local and remote server
backups. More information is available at the URL shown below.

http://www.symantec.com/smb/products/overview.jsp?pcid=bu_rec&pvid=bewin_svr

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in Symantec Backup
Exec could allow an unauthenticated attacker to create a denial of
service condition or potentially execute arbitrary code.

The flaw specifically exists within the RPC server that listens on TCP
port 6106. When handling requests using the "ncacn_ip_tcp" protocol,
the service will copy a user supplied amount of data into a fixed-size
heap buffer.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to cause the affected service to
terminate. This vulnerability has the potential to lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

No authentication is required to access the affected RPC service. An
attacker only needs the ability to establish a TCP session.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Symantec
Backup Exec 10d with all current hot-fixes and service packs applied.
Other versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Employing firewalls to limit access to the affected service will
mitigate exposure to this vulnerability.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Symantec has addressed this vulnerability by releasing a HotFix. More
