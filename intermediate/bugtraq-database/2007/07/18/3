Computer Associates Alert Notification Server Multiple Buffer Overflow
Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 07.17.07

Jul 17, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Computer Associates Alert Notification Server is used by several CA
products, including eTrust Integrated Threat Management, to provide
notifications to console users.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in
Computer Associates International Inc.'s (CA) Threat Manager allows
attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

When Computer Associates Threat Manager is installed, it also installs
the Alert Notification Server (alert.exe) which registers an RPC
interface with the GUID 3d742890-397c-11cf-9bf1-00805f88cb72. This
interface contains stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities within
the handling code for several RPC operation codes.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute code with SYSTEM privileges
on the targeted host.

The vulnerable code can be reached remotely using the SMB protocol. As
such, valid credentials are required to exploit this vulnerability on
Windows XP and newer systems. Windows 2000 based installations do not
require credentials.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed that the Alert Notification Server included with
Computer Associates International Inc.'s eTrust Integrated Threat
Management r8 for Windows is vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
