Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in MPlayer, possibly
allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

MPlayer is a media player incuding support for a wide range of audio
and video formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /    Vulnerable    /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/mplayer     < 1.0.20070622            >= 1.0.20070622

Description
===========

Stefan Cornelius and Reimar DÃ¶ffinger of Secunia Research discovered
several boundary errors in the functions cddb_query_parse(),
cddb_parse_matches_list() and cddb_read_parse(), each allowing for a
stack-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
with malicious CDDB entries, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running MPlayer.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0.20070622"
