Release Date: 2007-12-14
Last Updated: 2007-12-14

Potential Security Impact: Remote execution of arbitrary code, gain privileged access

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with the HP Quick Launch Button (QLB) software running on Windows. The vulnerability could be exploited remotely to execute arbitrary code or to gain privileged access.

References: CVE-2007-6331, CVE-2007-6332, CVE-2007-6333

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP Compaq business notebook PCs running Microsoft Windows operating system with HP Quick Launch Button software v6.3 or earlier installed 

HP Pavilion and Compaq Presario consumer notebook PCs running Microsoft Windows operating system with HP Quick Launch Button software v6.0 through v6.3 installed

BACKGROUND

HP Compaq business notebook PCs and HP Pavilion and Compaq Presario consumer notebook PCs ship with Quick Launch Button (QLB) software preinstalled. Quick Launch Buttons enable and control features such as Function (Fn) shortcut keys and dedicated program buttons (i.e. Presentation Mode and HP Info buttons) that vary by model. The Quick Launch Button software package also includes the HP Info Center application that enables quick access to pertinent system information on HP Compaq business notebook PC models.

RESOLUTION

HP has provided the following software patch to resolve this vulnerability: HP SoftPaq SP38166

The patch is available for download from ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp38001-38500/. 

Removing or un-installing Quick Launch Button software does not eliminate the vulnerability. HP suggests that _all_ HP notebook PCs have the security patch promptly applied. Installing the security patch will cause a known script error when launching HP Info Center. After installing the security patch, do _not_ install any version of Quick Launch Button software except v6.4 or later (to be available at a future date). This Security Bulletin will be revised when Quick Launch Button software v6.4 is available. If the security patch is installed and Quick Launch Button software v6.3 or earlier is subsequently installed, the notebook PC will again become vulnerable to this concern and the security patch should be re-installed. Other HP Quick Launch Buttons and features are not affected by the installation of this security patch and should continue to function as designed.
