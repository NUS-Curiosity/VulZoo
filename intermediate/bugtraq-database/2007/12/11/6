References:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5497

Description:
    Previous versions of the e2fsprogs package are vulnerable to multiple
    integer overflows that may be exploited by crafted filesystem images.
    In particular, this may allow a user with elevated privileges in a
    Xen guest domain to execute arbitrary code as root in domain 0 via
    a maliciously crafted filesystem image if e2fsck is run in domain 0
    on the guest-domain filesystem.
