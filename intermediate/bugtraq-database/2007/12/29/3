Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in exiftags possibly allow for the execution
of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

exiftags is a library and set of tools for parsing, editing and saving
Exif metadata from images. Exif, the Exchangeable image file format,
specifies the addition of metadata tags to JPEG, TIFF and RIFF files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/exiftags       < 1.01                           >= 1.01

Description
===========

Meder Kydyraliev (Google Security) discovered that Exif metadata is not
properly sanitized before being processed, resulting in illegal memory
access in the postprop() and other functions (CVE-2007-6354). He also
discovered integer overflow vulnerabilities in the parsetag() and other
functions (CVE-2007-6355) and an infinite recursion in the readifds()
function caused by recursive IFD references (CVE-2007-6356).

Impact
======

An attacker could entice the user of an application making use of
exiftags or an application included in exiftags to load an image file
with specially crafted Exif tags, possibly resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All exiftags users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/exiftags-1.01"
