Subject: Re: Design flaw in AS3 socket handling allows port probing

Adobe released an article at their knowledge base regarding this issue.

# Socket connection timing can reveal information about network  
configuration
   http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb402956

The fix is to disable socket functionality for Flash Players version  
 >= 9.0.115 by configuration.


Take care,
