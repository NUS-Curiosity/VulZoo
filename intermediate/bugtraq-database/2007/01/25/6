RESOLUTION

HP has made the following software updates available to resolve the issue.
Software updates for the Apache-based Web Server are available from:
http://h20293.www2.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE

HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11 and HP-UX B.11.23 require the Apache-based Web Server v.2.0.58.01 or subsequent.

Apache Update Procedure

Check for Apache Installation
 -----------------------------
To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on your system, use Software Distributor's swlist command. All three revisions of the product may co-exist on a single system.
For example, the results of the command swlist -l product | grep -I apache
hpuxwsAPACHE B.2.0.55.00 HP-UX Apache-based Web Server

Stop Apache
 -------------
Before updating, make sure the previous Apache binary is stopped. If Apache is not stopped, the installation would be successful but the new version would be prevented from starting until a later time.
After determining which Apache is installed, stop Apache with the following commands:
for hpuxwsAPACHE: /opt/hpws/apache[32]/bin/apachectl stop

Download and Install Apache
 --------------------------
Download Apache from Software Depot. http://h20293.www2.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE
Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the value specified on the installation web page.
Use SD to swinstall the depot. Installation of this new revision of HP Apache over an existing HP Apache installation is supported, while installation over a non-HP Apache is NOT supported.

Removing Apache Installation
 ---------------------------
The potential vulnerability can also be resolved by removing Apache rather than installing a newer revision. To remove Apache use both Software Distributor's "swremove" command and also "rm -rf" the home location as specified in the rc.config.d file "HOME" variables.
%ls /etc/rc.config.d | \ grep apache hpapache2conf hpws_apache[32]conf

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - Update plus other actions
Install the revision of the product.
