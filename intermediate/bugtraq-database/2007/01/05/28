Subject Name:            bzip2
Subject Summary:         Compression Tool
Subject Home:            http://www.bzip.org/
Subject Versions:        * <= 1.0.3

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2005-0953, CVE-2005-0758
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           local system
Attack Impact:           manipulation of data, arbitrary code execution

Description:
    Together with two portability and stability issues, two older
    security issues were fixed in the compression tool BZip2 [0], versions
    up to and including 1.0.3.
    
    The first issue is a race condition which allows local users to
    modify permissions of arbitrary files via a hard link attack on a
    file while it is being decompressed, whose permissions are changed
    by bzip2 after the decompression is complete.
    
    The second issue affects the script bzgrep(1). It does not properly
    sanitize arguments, which allows local users to execute arbitrary
    commands via filenames that are injected into a sed(1) script.
