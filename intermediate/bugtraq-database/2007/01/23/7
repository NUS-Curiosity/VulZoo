Synopsis
========

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities have been identified in Sun Java
Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

Background
==========

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

Affected packages

Description
===========

Chris Evans has discovered multiple buffer overflows in Sun JDK and Sun
JRE possibly related to various AWT or font layout functions. Tom
Hawtin has discovered an unspecified vulnerability in Sun JDK and Sun
JRE relating to unintended applet data access. He has also discovered
multiple other unspecified vulnerabilities in Sun JDK and Sun JRE
allowing unintended Java applet or application resource acquisition.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted Java applet
or application that could read, write, or execute local files with the
privileges of the user running the JVM; access data maintained in other
Java applets; or escalate the privileges of the currently running Java
applet or application allowing for unauthorized access to system
resources.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Sun Java Development Kit users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/sun-jdk"

All Sun Java Runtime Environment users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/sun-jre-bin"
