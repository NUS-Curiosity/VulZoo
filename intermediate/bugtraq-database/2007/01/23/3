Synopsis
========

Fetchmail has been found to have numerous vulnerabilities allowing for
Denial of Service and password disclosure.

Background
==========

Fetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/fetchmail       < 6.3.6                         >= 6.3.6

Description
===========

Neil Hoggarth has discovered that when delivering messages to a message
delivery agent by means of the "mda" option, Fetchmail passes a NULL
pointer to the ferror() and fflush() functions when refusing a message.
Isaac Wilcox has discovered numerous means of plain-text password
disclosure due to errors in secure connection establishment.

Impact
======

An attacker could deliver a message via Fetchmail to a message delivery
agent configured to refuse the message, and crash the Fetchmail
process. SMTP and LMTP delivery modes are not affected by this
vulnerability. An attacker could also perform a Man-in-the-Middle
attack, and obtain plain-text authentication credentials of users
connecting to a Fetchmail process.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All fetchmail users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/fetchmail-6.3.6"
