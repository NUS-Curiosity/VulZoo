Subject Name:            bind
Subject Summary:         DNS Server
Subject Home:            http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/
Subject Versions:        * < 9.3.4

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2007-0493, CVE-2007-0494
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           denial of service

Description:
    As confirmed by vendor security advisories [0][1], two security
    issues exist in the DNS server BIND [2], versions up to 9.3.4.
    
    The first issue is a "use after free" vulnerability which allows
    remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via unspecified
    vectors that cause BIND to "dereference (read) a freed fetch
    context".
    
    The second issue allows remote attackers to cause a Denial of
    Service (DoS) via a type "*" (ANY) DNS query response that contains
    multiple resource record (RR) sets in the answer section, which
    triggers an assertion error. To be vulnerable you need to have
    enabled DNSSEC validation in the configuration by specifying
    "trusted-keys".
