Subject: Arbitrary Code Execution in SQL-Ledger and LedgerSMB through redirects

Separate from CVE-2006-5872, there is a possibility of causing arbitrary 
code execution during redirects.  This requires a valid login to exploit 
and was discovered and brought to the attention of both the SQL-Ledger 
and LedgerSMB team in November.  LedgerSMB 1.1.5 corred the problem, but 
it is still not corrected in SQL-Ledger.

There is no workaround to prevent the problem except to hope that those 
who are using vulnerable software can be trusted.

I will be sending a full disclosure of the problem, as well as an 
unofficial patch to SQL-Ledger in a week.

Best Wishes,
