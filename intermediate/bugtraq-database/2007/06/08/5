Description:
    Previous versions of the gd and php packages are vulnerable to a Denial
    of Service attack in which an attacker can use a truncated PNG image to
    cause unbounded CPU consumption.  The libgd library is not exposed via
    any privileged or remote interfaces within rPath Linux per se, but it is
    exposed by some web applications, such as php (which provides its own
    internal version of libgd).
