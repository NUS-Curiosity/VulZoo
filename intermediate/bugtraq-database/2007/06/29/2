Package names:	   kerberos5
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2007-06-29

Package description:
  kerberos5
  (MIT) Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to
  provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using
  secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is
  available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is
  available in many commercial products as well.

Problem description:
  kerberos5 < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Kerberos,
    which can be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable
    system.
  - An error exists within the "gssrpc__svcauth_gssapi" function in the
    RPC library, which can cause kadmind and possibly other third-party
    products to free an uninitialised pointer when receiving an RPC
    credential with a length of zero.
  - A signedness error exists within the "gssrpc__svcauth_unix()"
    function in the RPC library, which is used by kadmind and possibly
    other third-party products. This can be exploited to cause a
    stack-based buffer overflow.
  - Fixes stack-based buffer overflow error in kadmind within the
    rename_principal_2_svc function which could allow remote 
    authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request
    to rename a principal.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2007-2442, CVE-2007-2443 and CVE-2007-2798
    to these issues.
