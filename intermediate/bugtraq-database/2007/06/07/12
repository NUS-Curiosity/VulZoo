Title: [CAID 35395, 35396]: CA Anti-Virus Engine CAB File Buffer 
Overflow Vulnerabilities

CA Vuln ID (CAID): 35395, 35396

CA Advisory Date: 2007-06-05

Impact: Remote attackers can cause a denial of service or 
potentially execute arbitrary code.

Summary: CA Anti-Virus engine contains multiple vulnerabilities 
that can allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service or 
possibly execute arbitrary code. CA has issued an update to 
address the vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability, 
CVE-2007-2863, is due to insufficient bounds checking on filenames 
contained in a CAB archive. The second vulnerability, 
CVE-2007-2863, is due to insufficient bounds checking on the 
"coffFiles" field. By using a specially malformed CAB file, an 
attacker can cause a crash or take unauthorized action on an 
affected system.
