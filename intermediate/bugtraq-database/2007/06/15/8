Synopsis
========

ClamAV contains several vulnerabilities leading to a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.90.3                      >= 0.90.3

Description
===========

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in ClamAV by various
researchers:

* Victor Stinner (INL) discovered that the OLE2 parser may enter in
  an infinite loop (CVE-2007-2650).

* A boundary error was also reported by an anonymous researcher in
  the file unsp.c, which might lead to a buffer overflow
  (CVE-2007-3023).

* The file unrar.c contains a heap-based buffer overflow via a
  modified vm_codesize value from a RAR file (CVE-2007-3123).

* The RAR parsing engine can be bypassed via a RAR file with a header
  flag value of 10 (CVE-2007-3122).

* The cli_gentempstream() function from clamdscan creates temporary
  files with insecure permissions (CVE-2007-3024).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted file to the scanner,
possibly triggering one of the vulnerabilities. The two buffer
overflows are reported to only cause Denial of Service. This would lead
to a Denial of Service by CPU consumption or a crash of the scanner.
The insecure temporary file creation vulnerability could be used by a
local user to access sensitive data.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.90.3"
