    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1500

Description:
    Previous versions of the httpd package contain two vulnerabilities
    that affect only non-default configurations.  One enables a
    cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack if ExtendedStatus is enabled
    and the server status page is publically accessible (not generally
    recommended), the other allows remote attackers to cause the httpd
    process to crash by sending a maliciously-crafted request if caching
    is enabled (CacheEnable).
