Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in Quagga allowing for a Denial of
Service.

Background
==========

Quagga is a free routing daemon, supporting RIP, OSPF and BGP
protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/quagga      < 0.98.6-r2                     >= 0.98.6-r2

Description
===========

The Quagga development team reported a vulnerability in the BGP routing
deamon when processing NLRI attributes inside UPDATE messages.

Impact
======

A malicious peer inside a BGP area could send a specially crafted
packet to a Quagga instance, possibly resulting in a crash of the
Quagga daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Quagga users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/quagga-0.98.6-r2"
