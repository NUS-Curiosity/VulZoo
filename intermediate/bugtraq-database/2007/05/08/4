    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1036

Description:
    Previous versions of the tetex package are vulnerable to a minor
    user-complicit attack in which running makeindex with untrusted
    input may modify unexpected files or run attacker-provided
    code.  In general, since TeX will run arbitrary commands in TeX
    input, running TeX-related commands on untrusted input is generally
    not advised.
