Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in MPlayer, each one could
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

MPlayer is a media player incuding support for a wide range of audio
and video formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /    Vulnerable    /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/mplayer     < 1.0.20070321            >= 1.0.20070321

Description
===========

A buffer overflow has been reported in the DMO_VideoDecoder_Open()
function in file loader/dmo/DMO_VideoDecoder.c. Another buffer overflow
has been reported in the DS_VideoDecoder_Open() function in file
loader/dshow/DS_VideoDecoder.c.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted video
file, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running MPlayer.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0.20070321"
