Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflows have been discovered in ImageMagick allowing
for the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ImageMagick is a collection of tools allowing various manipulations on
image files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/imagemagick       < 6.3.3                      >= 6.3.3

Description
===========

iDefense Labs has discovered multiple integer overflows in ImageMagick
in the functions ReadDCMImage() and ReadXWDImage(), that are used to
process DCM and XWD files.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open specially crafted XWD or DCM
file, resulting in heap-based buffer overflows and possibly the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
ImageMagick. Note that this user may be httpd or any other account used
by applications relying on the ImageMagick tools to automatically
process images.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ImageMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/imagemagick-6.3.3"
