Description:
    Previous versions of the shadow package have a weakness in the
    useradd program; it may in some cases create new mail spool files
    with a mode that may be vulnerable to reading and/or writing by
    attackers with local system access.  Note that, despite the clear bug
    in the source code, we have seen no instances in practice of mail
    spool files being created with insecure permissions.  This update
    will not fix permissions on existing system mailbox files, since it
    is not possible to determine if any particular set of permissions
    was chosen intentionally.  Mail spool files are normally mode 660.
