Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package have several vulnerabilities
    resolved in this release.  The most severe is a remotely triggerable
    system crash (denial of service) in the appletalk protocol module,
    but the tools to configure appletalk are not included in rPath Linux,
    and it is not a commonly-used protocol, so the module is not normally
    loaded and thus rPath Linux systems are not normally vulnerable.
    The other vulnerabilities involve local users; one that applies
    only if the driver for the Omnikey CardMan 4040 is loaded, and
    two involving IPv6, one of which enables local users to cause a
    system crash.
    
    A system reboot is required to resolve this vulnerability.
