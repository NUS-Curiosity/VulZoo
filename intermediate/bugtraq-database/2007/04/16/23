Synopsis
========

The Gentoo implementation of Vixie Cron is vulnerable to a local Denial
of Service.

Background
==========

Vixie Cron is a command scheduler with extended syntax over cron.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-process/vixie-cron      < 4.1-r10                  >= 4.1-r10

Description
===========

During an internal audit, Raphael Marichez of the Gentoo Linux Security
Team found that Vixie Cron has weak permissions set on Gentoo, allowing
for a local user to create hard links to system and users cron files,
while a st_nlink check in database.c will generate a superfluous error.

Impact
======

Depending on the partitioning scheme and the "cron" group membership, a
malicious local user can create hard links to system or users cron
files that will trigger the st_link safety check and prevent the
targeted cron file from being run from the next restart or database
reload.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Vixie Cron users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-process/vixie-cron-4.1-r10"

References
==========
