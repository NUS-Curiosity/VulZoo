xine-lib=/orleans.rpath.org@rpl:devel//foresight.rpath.org@fl:1-devel//1/1.1.6-1.1-1

Description:
     Previous versions of the xine-lib package were vulnerable to a buffer 
overflow which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the target 
machine. This can be exploited by a remote user only in a locally-assisted 
fashion - by enticing the user to open a specially crafted file.
