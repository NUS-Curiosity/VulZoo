Debian Bug     : 770425

Multiple security issues have been discovered in Wordpress, a web
blogging tool, resulting in denial of service or information disclosure.
More information can be found in the upstream advisory at
https://wordpress.org/news/2014/11/wordpress-4-0-1/

CVE-2014-9031

    Jouko Pynnonen discovered an unauthenticated cross site scripting
    vulnerability (XSS) in wptexturize(), exploitable via comments or
    posts.

CVE-2014-9033

    Cross site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the password
    changing process, which could be used by an attacker to trick an
    user into changing her password.

CVE-2014-9034

    Javier Nieto Arevalo and Andres Rojas Guerrero reported a potential
    denial of service in the way the phpass library is used to handle
    passwords, since no maximum password length was set.

CVE-2014-9035

    John Blackbourn reported an XSS in the "Press This" function (used
    for quick publishing using a browser "bookmarklet").

CVE-2014-9036

    Robert Chapin reported an XSS in the HTML filtering of CSS in posts.

CVE-2014-9037

    David Anderson reported a hash comparison vulnerability for
    passwords stored using the old-style MD5 scheme. While unlikely,
    this could be exploited to compromise an account, if the user had
    not logged in after a Wordpress 2.5 update (uploaded to Debian on 2
    Apr, 2008) and the password MD5 hash could be collided with due to
    PHP dynamic comparison.

CVE-2014-9038

    Ben Bidner reported a server side request forgery (SSRF) in the core
    HTTP layer which unsufficiently blocked the loopback IP address
    space.

CVE-2014-9039

    Momen Bassel, Tanoy Bose, and Bojan Slavkovic reported a
    vulnerability in the password reset process: an email address change
    would not invalidate a previous password reset email.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1+dfsg-1~deb7u5.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.0.1+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
