 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:249
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : qemu
 Date    : December 14, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated qemu packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 During migration, the values read from migration stream during ram load
 are not validated. Especially offset in host_from_stream_offset() and
 also the length of the writes in the callers of the said function. A
 user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the
 wire during migration) could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU
 process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially
 result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges
 of the QEMU process (CVE-2014-7840).
 
 Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat discovered that the blit region checks were
 insufficient in the Cirrus VGA emulator in qemu. A privileged guest
 user could use this flaw to write into qemu address space on the host,
 potentially escalating their privileges to those of the qemu host
 process (CVE-2014-8106).
