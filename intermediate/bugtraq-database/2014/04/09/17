Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA Software

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20140409-asa

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2014 April 9 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

  Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities:
  Cisco ASA ASDM Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
  Cisco ASA SSL VPN Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
  Cisco ASA SSL VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
  Cisco ASA SIP Denial of Service Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are independent of one another; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA ASDM Privilege Escalation Vulnerability and the Cisco ASA SSL VPN Privilege Escalation Vulnerability may allow an attacker or an unprivileged user to elevate privileges and gain administrative access to the affected system.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA SSL VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability may allow an attacker to obtain unauthorized access to the internal network via SSL VPN.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA SIP Denial of Service Vulnerability may cause the exhaustion of available memory. This may cause system instability and in some cases lead to a reload of the affected system, creating a denial of service (DoS) condition. 

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. 
Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available for some of the vulnerabilities.
