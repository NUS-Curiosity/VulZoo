Thank you for reporting this plugin. We're looking into it right now.

In the case of any security exploits, it greatly helps if you can provide us with how you verified this is an exploit (links to the plugin listing on sites like Secuina are perfect).

If you provided a link to your report, DO NOT delete it! We have passed it on directly to the developers of the plugin.

Please note: You may not receive further communication from us on this matter, simply due to the volume of emails we get a day. We do greatly appreciate the report.
