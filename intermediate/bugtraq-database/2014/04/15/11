Package        : strongswan
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-2338

An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in charon, the daemon
handling IKEv2 in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite. The state machine
handling the security association (IKE_SA) handled some state transitions
incorrectly.

An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by rekeying an unestablished
IKE_SA during the initiation itself. This will trick the IKE_SA state to
'established' without the need to provide any valid credential.

Vulnerable setups include those actively initiating IKEv2 IKE_SA (like
”clients” or “roadwarriors”) but also during re-authentication (which
can be initiated by the responder). Installations using IKEv1 (pluto
daemon in strongSwan 4 and earlier, and IKEv1 code in charon 5.x) is not
affected.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.5.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
