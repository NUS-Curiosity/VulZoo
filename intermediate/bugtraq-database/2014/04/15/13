Public release date: April 14, 2014

TITLE

OpenSSL 1.0.1 library's "Heart bleed" vulnerability - CVE-2014-0160


SUMMARY

OpenSSL library is used in Ruckus products to implement various
security related features. A vulnerability has been discovered in
OpenSSL library which may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
retrieve memory in chunks of 64 kilobytes from a connected client or
server.  An exploit could disclose portions of memory containing
sensitive security material such as passwords and private keys.

DETAILS

A vulnerability has been discovered in the popular OpenSSL
cryptographic software library. This weakness exists in OpenSSL's
implementation of the TLS/DTLS (transport layer security protocols)
heartbeat extension (RFC6520). This vulnerability is due to a missing
bounds check in implementation of the handling of the heartbeat
extension. When exploited, this issue may lead to leak of memory
contents from the server to the client and from the client to the
server. These memory contents could contain sensitive security
material such as passwords and private keys.


IMPACT

Ruckus devices incorporate OpenSSL library to implement various
security related features. Below is list of the affected components:

- -  Administrative HTTPS Interface (Port 8443)


CVSS v2 Base Score:5.0 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)


   
WORKAROUNDS

Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch(es)
as soon as practical.  However, in the event that a patch cannot
immediately be applied, the following suggestions might help reduce
the risk:

 - Do not expose administrative interfaces of Ruckus devices to
untrusted networks such as the Internet.

 - Use a firewall to limit traffic to/from Ruckus device's
administrative interface to trusted hosts.

 

SOLUTION

Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch(es)
as soon as practical.

The following software builds have the fix (any later builds will also
have the fix):


Branch            Software Build
- -------        ------------------
1.1.x            1.1.2.0.142
