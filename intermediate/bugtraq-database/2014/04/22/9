APPLE-SA-2014-04-22-2 iOS 7.1.1

iOS 7.1.1 is now available and addresses the following:

CFNetwork HTTPProtocol
Available for:  iPhone 4 and later,
iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  An attacker in a privileged network position can obtain web
site credentials
Description:  Set-Cookie HTTP headers would be processed even if the
connection closed before the header line was complete. An attacker
could strip security settings from the cookie by forcing the
connection to close before the security settings were sent, and then
obtain the value of the unprotected cookie. This issue was addressed
by ignoring incomplete HTTP header lines.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-1296 : Antoine Delignat-Lavaud of Prosecco at Inria Paris

IOKit Kernel
Available for:  iPhone 4 and later,
iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  A local user can read kernel pointers, which can be used to
bypass kernel address space layout randomization
Description:  A set of kernel pointers stored in an IOKit object
could be retrieved from userland. This issue was addressed through
removing the pointers from the object.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-1320 : Ian Beer of Google Project Zero working with HP's
Zero Day Initiative

Security - Secure Transport
Available for:  iPhone 4 and later,
iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  An attacker with a privileged network position may capture
data or change the operations performed in sessions protected by SSL
Description:  In a 'triple handshake' attack, it was possible for an
attacker to establish two connections which had the same encryption
keys and handshake, insert the attacker's data in one connection, and
renegotiate so that the connections may be forwarded to each other.
To prevent attacks based on this scenario, Secure Transport was
changed so that, by default, a renegotiation must present the same
server certificate as was presented in the original connection.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-1295 : Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, Karthikeyan Bhargavan and
Alfredo Pironti of Prosecco at Inria Paris

WebKit
Available for:  iPhone 4 and later,
iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an
unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution
Description:  Multiple memory corruption issues existed in WebKit.
These issues were addressed through improved memory handling.
