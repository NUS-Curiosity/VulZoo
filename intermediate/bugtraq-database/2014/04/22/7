APPLE-SA-2014-04-22-1 Security Update 2014-002

Security Update 2014-002 is now available and addresses the
following:

CFNetwork HTTPProtocol
Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5,

by ignoring incomplete HTTP header lines.

Security - Secure Transport
Available for:  OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.2
Impact:  An attacker with a privileged network position may capture
data or change the operations performed in sessions protected by SSL
Description:  In a 'triple handshake' attack, it was possible for an
attacker to establish two connections which had the same encryption
keys and handshake, insert the attacker's data in one connection, and
renegotiate so that the connections may be forwarded to each other.
To prevent attacks based on this scenario, Secure Transport was
changed so that, by default, a renegotiation must present the same
server certificate as was presented in the original connection. This
issue does not affect Mac OS X 10.7 systems and earlier.
