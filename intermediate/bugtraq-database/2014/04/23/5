Package        : openjpeg

A regression in the decoding of chroma-subsampled images in OpenJPEG
was introduced by one of the patches for CVE-2013-6045. This update
fixes the regression.

For reference, the original text of DSA-2808-1 is reproduced below:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJPEG, a JPEG 2000
image library, that may lead to denial of service (CVE-2013-1447) via
application crash or high memory consumption, possible code execution
through heap buffer overflows (CVE-2013-6045), information disclosure
(CVE-2013-6052), or yet another heap buffer overflow that only appears
to affect OpenJPEG 1.3 (CVE-2013-6054).

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3+dfsg-4+squeeze3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3+dfsg-4.8.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjpeg packages.
