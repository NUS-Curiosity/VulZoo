Package        : openssh
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-2532 CVE-2014-2653
Debian Bug     : 742513

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSH, an implementation of the
SSH protocol suite. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-2532

    Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled wildcards in
    AcceptEnv lines. A remote attacker could use this issue to trick
    OpenSSH into accepting any environment variable that contains the
    characters before the wildcard character.

CVE-2014-2653

    Matthew Vernon reported that if a SSH server offers a
    HostCertificate that the ssh client doesn't accept, then the client
    doesn't check the DNS for SSHFP records. As a consequence a
    malicious server can disable SSHFP-checking by presenting a
    certificate.

    Note that a host verification prompt is still displayed before
    connecting.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:5.5p1-6+squeeze5.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:6.0p1-4+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:6.6p1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.
