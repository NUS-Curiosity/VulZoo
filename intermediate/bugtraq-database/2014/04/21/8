Package        : wordpress
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0165 CVE-2014-0166
Debian Bug     : 744018

The update for wordpress in DSA 2901 caused a regression in the Quick
Drafts functionality. This update corrects that problem. For reference,
the original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2014-0165

    A user with a contributor role, using a specially crafted
    request, can publish posts, which is reserved for users of the
    next-higher role.

CVE-2014-0166

    Jon Cave of the WordPress security team discovered that the
    wp_validate_auth_cookie function in wp-includes/pluggable.php does
    not properly determine the validity of authentication cookies,
    allowing a remote attacker to obtain access via a forged cookie.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.6.1+dfsg-1~deb6u3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1+dfsg-1~deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8.3+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
