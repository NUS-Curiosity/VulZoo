Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in BlackCat CMS, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in BlackCat CMS: CVE-2014-5259

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the "msg" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/modules/lib_jquery/plugins/cattranslate/cattranslate.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an attacker to steal sensitive information, alter website pages and perform phishing attacks.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display "immuniweb" word:

http://[host]/modules/lib_jquery/plugins/cattranslate/cattranslate.php?msg=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28/immuniweb/%29;%3C/script%3E
