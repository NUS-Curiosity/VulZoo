Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in MyWebSQL, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in MyWebSQL: CVE-2014-4735

The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the "table" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/index.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of vulnerable website. Further exploitation of this vulnerability may grant an attacker full access to the website's databases and get complete control over it.

The following exploitation example uses the alert() JavaScript function to display "immuniweb" word:

http://[host]/?q=wrkfrm&type=exporttbl&table=%27;%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27immuniweb%27%29;%3C/script%3E
