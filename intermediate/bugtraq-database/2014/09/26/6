 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:190
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : bash
 Date    : September 26, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-6271 was incomplete, and
 Bash still allowed certain characters to be injected into other
 environments via specially crafted environment variables. An
 attacker could potentially use this flaw to override or bypass
 environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain
 services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to
 provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue
 (CVE-2014-7169).
 
 Additionally bash has been updated from patch level 37 to 48 using
 the upstream patches at ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.2-patches/
 which resolves various bugs.
