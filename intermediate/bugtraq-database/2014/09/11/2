This update corrects DSA 3021-1, which introduced a regression in the
detection of a some "Composite Document Files" (CDF), marking them look
as corrupted, with the error: "Can't expand summary_info".

On additional information, 5.11-2+deb7u4 changed the detection of
certain text files in the same way php5 did this in 5.4.4-14+deb7u13.
Since the new output is more accurate and this change also restored
the better detection as seen in the squeeze version of file, this is
not being reverted.

For reference, the original advisory text follows:

 Multiple security issues have been found in file, a tool to determine
 a file type. These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service, via resource consumption or application crash.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.11-2+deb7u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your file packages.
