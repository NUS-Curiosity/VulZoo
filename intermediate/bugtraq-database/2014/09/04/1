NOTE: The Virtual Connect Manager software is an OpenSSL client when it
communicates with Onboard Administrator, Virtual Connect Fiber Channel
modules, and LDAP servers. There is no plan to update either Virtual Connect
v3.61 or v4.01. Neither of these products have a vulnerable OpenSSL server.
They are vulnerable to CVE-2014-0224 as OpenSSL clients. Please ensure that
all LDAP servers with which these products communicate are secure and that
the latest version of Onboard Administrator is installed. The Virtual Connect
Fiber Channel module does not have a vulnerable OpenSSL server.
