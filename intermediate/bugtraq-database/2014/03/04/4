Subject: [CVE-2014-0072] Apache Cordova File-Transfer insecure defaults

CVE-2014-0072: Apache Cordova File-Transfer insecure defaults

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Cordova File-Transfer iOS plugin from Cordova versions 2.4.0 to 2.9.0
Cordova File-Transfer iOS standalone plugin (org.apache.cordova.file-transfer) versions 0.1.0 to 0.4.1

Description:
The default value of the trustAllHosts was set to true on iOS. This has
been the case since Cordova 2.4.0 and has now been rectified in the latest
version of the plugin (v0.4.2). We recommend affected projects update their
plugin, or work around the issue by explicitly setting the parameter to
false when using the FileTransfer API.

Upgrade path:
Developers using the File-Transfer plugin in their applications should
upgrade to version 0.4.2
