Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in CMSimple, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in CMSimple: CVE-2014-2219

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data in "d" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/whizzywig/wb.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the JavaScript "alert()" function to display "immuniweb" word:

http://[host]/whizzywig/wb.php?d=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27immuniweb%27%29;%3C/script%3E


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Fixed by vendor on February 26, 2014 directly in the source code without version modification/new release. Update to the version 3.54 released after February 26, 2014.
