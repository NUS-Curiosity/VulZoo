Subject: CVE-2014-2595 - Authentication Bypass in Barracuda Web Application
 Firewall

Vulnerability title: Authentication Bypass in Barracuda Web Application
Firewall
CVE: CVE-2014-2595
Vendor: Barracuda
Product: Web Application Firewall
Affected version: Firmware v7.8.1.013
Fixed version: N/A
Reported by: Nick Hayes

Details:

It is possible to re-use a link which includes a non-expiring
authentication token in the query string to gain access to the interface
of the Barracuda Web Application Firewall (WAF) firmware version 7.8.1.013.

Example:

http://waf.ptest.cudasvc.com/cgi-mod/index.cgi?auth_type=Local&et=99999999996locale=en_US&password=5a2fd48b65c5d80881eeb0f738bcc6dc&primary_tab=SECURITY%20POLICIES&secondary_tab=request_limits&user=guest

The above link opens up the Request Limit Policies on the Barracuda labs
WAF test host as the Guest user. This has been confirmed to work on
actual devices and with administrative accounts.
