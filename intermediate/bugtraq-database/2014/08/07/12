Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3505 CVE-2014-3506 CVE-2014-3507 CVE-2014-3508 
                 CVE-2014-3509 CVE-2014-3510 CVE-2014-3511 CVE-2014-3512 
                 CVE-2014-5139

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit, that may result in denial of service
(application crash, large memory consumption), information leak,
protocol downgrade. Additionally, a buffer overrun affecting only
applications explicitly set up for SRP has been fixed (CVE-2014-3512).

Detailed descriptions of the vulnerabilities can be found at:
https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt

It's important that you upgrade the libssl1.0.0 package and not just
the openssl package.

All applications linked to openssl need to be restarted. You can use
the "checkrestart" tool from the debian-goodies package to detect
affected programs. Alternatively, you may reboot your system.


For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u12.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1i-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
