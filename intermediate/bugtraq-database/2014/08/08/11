 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:158
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : openssl
 Date    : August 8, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in openssl:
 
 A flaw in OBJ_obj2txt may cause pretty printing functions such as
 X509_name_oneline, X509_name_print_ex et al. to leak some information
 from the stack. Applications may be affected if they echo pretty
 printing output to the attacker. OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers
 themselves are not affected (CVE-2014-3508).
 
 If a multithreaded client connects to a malicious server using a
 resumed session and the server sends an ec point format extension it
 could write up to 255 bytes to freed memory (CVE-2014-3509).
 
 An attacker can force an error condition which causes openssl to crash
 whilst processing DTLS packets due to memory being freed twice. This
 can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack (CVE-2014-3505).
 
 An attacker can force openssl to consume large amounts of memory
 whilst processing DTLS handshake messages. This can be exploited
 through a Denial of Service attack (CVE-2014-3506).
 
 By sending carefully crafted DTLS packets an attacker could cause
 openssl to leak memory. This can be exploited through a Denial of
 Service attack (CVE-2014-3507).
 
 OpenSSL DTLS clients enabling anonymous (EC)DH ciphersuites are subject
 to a denial of service attack. A malicious server can crash the client
 with a null pointer dereference (read) by specifying an anonymous
 (EC)DH ciphersuite and sending carefully crafted handshake messages
 (CVE-2014-3510).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the 1.0.0n version where
 these security flaws has been fixed.
