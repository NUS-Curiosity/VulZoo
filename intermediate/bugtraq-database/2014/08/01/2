 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:146
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : file
 Date    : July 31, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been found and corrected in file:
 
 file before 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read
 during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers
 backtracking during processing of an awk rule. NOTE: this vulnerability
 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345 (CVE-2014-3538).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.
