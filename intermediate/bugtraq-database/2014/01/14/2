RESOLUTION

HP has provided the following workaround to temporarily resolve this
vulnerability. This bulletin will be revised when a General Release patch is
available.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes

To prevent the "monlist" DoS vulnerability, configure the following:

Verify the NTPv4 version.

For example:
/usr/sbin/ntpd --version
ntpd 4.2.6p5
ntpd 4.2.6 Revision 0.0 Tue Nov 5 14:21:22 UTC 2012

Modify the ntp.conf on your time server and add the following.

# Block all control queries from external systems, allows time services

restrict default noquery

# Allow local queries

restrict 127.0.0.1

Cycle the ntpd daemon.

/sbin/init.d/ntpd stop
/sbin/init.d/ntpd start

Verification of the workaround.

Test on the local time server using the "ntpq -p" command.
Verify proper operation with output similar to:
remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset disp
======================================
*LOCAL(1) .LOCL. 6 l 13 16 377 0.000 0.000 0.233

On a remote time client, execute ntpdc or xntpdc as follows
# ntpdc -c monlist server.name.with.restrict
A timeout error should occur.
# xntpdc -c monlist xyz.hp.com
xyz.hp.com: timed out, nothing received
***Request timed out
