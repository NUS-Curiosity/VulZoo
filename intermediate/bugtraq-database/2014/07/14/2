 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:137
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : apache-mod_wsgi
 Date    : July 11, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in
 apache-mod_wsgi:
 
 It was found that mod_wsgi did not properly drop privileges if
 the call to setuid\(\) failed. If mod_wsgi was set up to allow
 unprivileged users to run WSGI applications, a local user able to
 run a WSGI application could possibly use this flaw to escalate their
 privileges on the system (CVE-2014-0240).
 
 It was discovered that mod_wsgi could leak memory of a hosted web
 application via the Content-Type header. A remote attacker could
 possibly use this flaw to disclose limited portions of the web
 application&#039;s memory (CVE-2014-0242).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
