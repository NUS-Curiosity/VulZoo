 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:139
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : nss
 Date    : July 29, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been found and corrected in mozilla NSS:
 
 Use-after-free vulnerability in the CERT_DestroyCertificate function
 in libnss3.so in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.x, as used
 in Firefox before 31.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.7, and Thunderbird
 before 24.7, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 vectors that trigger certain improper removal of an NSSCertificate
 structure from a trust domain (CVE-2014-1544).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the latest NSS (3.16.3)
 versions which is not vulnerable to this issue.
 
 The nss 3.16.1 update done as part of MDVSA-2014:125 introduced a
 regression because of the upstream change: &#039;Imposed name constraints
 on the French government root CA ANSSI (DCISS)&#039; The change wont work
 as currently implemented as the French government root CA signs more
 than &#039;gouv.fr&#039; domains. So for now we revert that change until its
 properly fixed upstream (mga#13563).
 
 Additionally the rootcerts package has also been updated to the
 latest version as of 2014-07-03, which adds, removes, and distrusts
 several certificates.
