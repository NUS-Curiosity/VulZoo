Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in e107, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in e107: CVE-2014-4734

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of "type" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/e107_admin/db.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and scripting code in administrator’s browser. 

Using advanced XSS techniques a remote attacker can gain complete access over administrator’s session and perform arbitrary actions as web application administrator. 

The following exploitation example displays JS pop-up with "immuniweb" word when the administrator hits the "submit" button:

http://[host]/e107_admin/db.php?mode=pref_editor&type=123%27%20onsubmit=%22alert%28%27immuniweb%27%29%3b%22%20a=%27

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Update e107_admin/db.php file from GitHub.
