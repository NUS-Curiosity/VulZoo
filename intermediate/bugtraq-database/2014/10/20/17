APPLE-SA-2014-10-20-2 Apple TV 7.0.1

Apple TV 7.0.1 is now available and addresses the following:

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 3rd generation and later
Impact:  A malicious Bluetooth input device may bypass pairing
Description:  Unencrypted connections were permitted from Human
Interface Device-class Bluetooth Low Energy accessories. If a device
had paired with such an accessory, an attacker could spoof the
legitimate accessory to establish a connection. The issue was
addressed by denying unencrypted HID connections.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-4428 : Mike Ryan of iSEC Partners

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 3rd generation and later
Impact:  An attacker may be able to decrypt data protected by SSL
Description:  There are known attacks on the confidentiality of SSL
3.0 when a cipher suite uses a block cipher in CBC mode. An attacker
could force the use of SSL 3.0, even when the server would support a
better TLS version, by blocking TLS 1.0 and higher connection
attempts. This issue was addressed by disabling CBC cipher suites
when TLS connection attempts fail.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-3566 : Bodo Moeller, Thai Duong, and Krzysztof Kotowicz of
Google Security Team
