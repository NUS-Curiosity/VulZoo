 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:204
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libxml2
 Date    : October 23, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been found and corrected in libxml2:
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in libxml2, a library providing
 support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker
 could provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by
 an application using libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption
 (denial of service) based on excessive entity substitutions, even if
 entity substitution was disabled, which is the parser default behavior
 (CVE-2014-3660).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.
