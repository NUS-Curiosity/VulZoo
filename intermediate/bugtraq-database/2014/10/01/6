VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP Remote Device
Access: Virtual Customer Access System (vCAS) running Bash Shell . This is
the Bash Shell vulnerability known as "ShellShock" which could be exploited
remotely to allow execution of code.

    NOTE: The vCAS product is vulnerable only if DHCP is enabled.

RESOLUTION

HP is actively working to address this vulnerability for the impacted product
versions of HP Remote Device Access: Virtual Customer Access System (vCAS)
running Bash Shell. This bulletin will be revised when the software update is
released.

NOTE: HP recommends to not power-down or disconnect the vCAS until the update
is available.

MITIGATION INFORMATION

A Shellshock attack requires the definition of an environment variable
introduced into Bash. The vCAS has three attack vectors: SSH, the lighttpd
web server, and the DHCP client.

  - The exploit does not elevate privileges.
  - The SSH and webserver exploits require vCAS credentials so there is no
risk for unauthorized access or code execution through this vulnerability.

The DHCP client uses Bash scripts and is vulnerable to Shellshock. The DHCP
exploit can be mitigated by ensuring that DHCP is disabled on the vCAS.

  Note: HP strongly discourages the use of DHCP on the vCAS.

The web UI forces the vCAS user to assign a static IP address and change the
hp-admin password. A vCAS user must manually configure DHCP for use on the
vCAS.

A vCAS user can verify that DHCP is disabled by inspecting the file
"/etc/network/interfaces" and ensuring that the "iface" line for device
"eth0" is set for a static IP.

  Example of a static IP configuration:

    # The primary network interface
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 172.27.1.68
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 172.27.1.1
