 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:201
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : kernel
 Date    : October 21, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in the Linux
 kernel:
 
 The try_to_unmap_cluster function in mm/rmap.c in the Linux kernel
 before 3.14.3 does not properly consider which pages must be locked,
 which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by
 triggering a memory-usage pattern that requires removal of page-table
 mappings (CVE-2014-3122).
 
 Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the magicmouse_raw_event
 function in drivers/hid/hid-magicmouse.c in the Magic Mouse HID driver
 in the Linux kernel through 3.16.3 allow physically proximate attackers
 to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted device that provides a large amount of
 (1) EHCI or (2) XHCI data associated with an event (CVE-2014-3181).
 
 Array index error in the logi_dj_raw_event function in
 drivers/hid/hid-logitech-dj.c in the Linux kernel before 3.16.2 allows
 physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
 denial of service (invalid kfree) via a crafted device that provides
 a malformed REPORT_TYPE_NOTIF_DEVICE_UNPAIRED value (CVE-2014-3182).
 
 The report_fixup functions in the HID subsystem in the Linux
 kernel before 3.16.2 might allow physically proximate attackers
 to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted
 device that provides a small report descriptor, related to
 (1) drivers/hid/hid-cherry.c, (2) drivers/hid/hid-kye.c,
 (3) drivers/hid/hid-lg.c, (4) drivers/hid/hid-monterey.c, (5)
 drivers/hid/hid-petalynx.c, and (6) drivers/hid/hid-sunplus.c
 (CVE-2014-3184).
 
 Multiple buffer overflows in the command_port_read_callback function in
 drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c in the Whiteheat USB Serial Driver in
 the Linux kernel before 3.16.2 allow physically proximate attackers
 to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption and system crash) via a crafted device that provides a large
 amount of (1) EHCI or (2) XHCI data associated with a bulk response
 (CVE-2014-3185).
 
 Buffer overflow in the picolcd_raw_event function in
 devices/hid/hid-picolcd_core.c in the PicoLCD HID device driver in the
 Linux kernel through 3.16.3, as used in Android on Nexus 7 devices,
 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service
 (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted device
 that sends a large report (CVE-2014-3186).
 
 arch/s390/kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel before 3.15.8 on the s390
 platform does not properly restrict address-space control operations
 in PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA requests, which allows local users to obtain
 read and write access to kernel memory locations, and consequently gain
 privileges, via a crafted application that makes a ptrace system call
 (CVE-2014-3534).
 
 The kvm_iommu_map_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c in the Linux
 kernel through 3.16.1 miscalculates the number of pages during the
 handling of a mapping failure, which allows guest OS users to (1)
 cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact by triggering a large gfn value or (2)
 cause a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) by triggering a
 small gfn value that leads to permanently pinned pages (CVE-2014-3601).
 
 The sctp_assoc_update function in net/sctp/associola.c in the
 Linux kernel through 3.15.8, when SCTP authentication is enabled,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
 dereference and OOPS) by starting to establish an association between
 two endpoints immediately after an exchange of INIT and INIT ACK
 chunks to establish an earlier association between these endpoints
 in the opposite direction (CVE-2014-5077).
 
 The do_remount function in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through
 3.16.1 does not maintain the MNT_LOCK_READONLY bit across a remount of
 a bind mount, which allows local users to bypass an intended read-only
 restriction and defeat certain sandbox protection mechanisms via a
 mount -o remount command within a user namespace (CVE-2014-5206).
 
 Stack consumption vulnerability in the parse_rock_ridge_inode_internal
 function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allows
 local users to cause a denial of service (uncontrolled recursion, and
 system crash or reboot) via a crafted iso9660 image with a CL entry
 referring to a directory entry that has a CL entry (CVE-2014-5471).
 
 The parse_rock_ridge_inode_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in
 the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to cause a denial
 of service (unkillable mount process) via a crafted iso9660 image
 with a self-referential CL entry (CVE-2014-5472).
 
 The __udf_read_inode function in fs/udf/inode.c in the Linux kernel
 through 3.16.3 does not restrict the amount of ICB indirection, which
 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service
 (infinite loop or stack consumption) via a UDF filesystem with a
 crafted inode (CVE-2014-6410).
 
 The do_umount function in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through
 3.17 does not require the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability for do_remount_sb
 calls that change the root filesystem to read-only, which allows
 local users to cause a denial of service (loss of writability) by
 making certain unshare system calls, clearing the / MNT_LOCKED flag,
 and making an MNT_FORCE umount system call (CVE-2014-7975).
 
 The updated packages provides a solution for these security issues.
