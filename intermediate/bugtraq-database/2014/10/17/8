APPLE-SA-2014-10-16-4 OS X Server v3.2.2

OS X Server v3.2.2 is now available and addresses the following:

Server
Available for:  OS X Mavericks v10.9.5 or later
Impact:  An attacker may be able to decrypt data protected by SSL
Description:  There are known attacks on the confidentiality of SSL
3.0 when a cipher suite uses a block cipher in CBC mode. An attacker
could force the use of SSL 3.0, even when the server would support a
better TLS version, by blocking TLS 1.0 and higher connection
attempts. This issue was addressed by disabling SSL 3.0 support in
Web Server, Calendar & Contacts Server, and Remote Administration.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-3566 : Bodo Moeller, Thai Duong, and Krzysztof Kotowicz of
Google Security Team


OS X Server v3.2.2 may be obtained from the Mac App Store.

Information will also be posted to the Apple Security Updates
