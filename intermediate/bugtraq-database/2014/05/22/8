Subject: [KIS-2014-06] Dotclear <= 2.6.2 (Media Manager) Unrestricted File
 Upload Vulnerability

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dotclear <= 2.6.2 (Media Manager) Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability
------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://dotclear.org/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 2.6.2 and probably prior versions.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability exists because of the filemanager::isFileExclude() method not properly verifying the extension of
uploaded files. This method just checks whether the uploaded file name matches the “exclude_pattern” regular expression,
which by default is set to “/\.php$/i”. This could be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a file with
multiple extensions or other extensions (like .php5 or .phtml) which might be handled as PHP scripts. Successful
exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with permissions to manage media items.


[-] Solution:

Apply the vendor workaround or define a more secure “media_exclusion” setting (PCRE value).
