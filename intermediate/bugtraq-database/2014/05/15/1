Package        : libxfont
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0209 CVE-2014-0210 CVE-2014-0211

Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive discovered several security issues in the
X.Org libXfont library, which may allow a local, authenticated user to
attempt to raise privileges; or a remote attacker who can control the
font server to attempt to execute code with the privileges of the X
server.

CVE-2014-0209

    Integer overflow of allocations in font metadata file parsing could
    allow a local user who is already authenticated to the X server to
    overwrite other memory in the heap.

CVE-2014-0210

    libxfont does not validate length fields when parsing xfs protocol
    replies allowing to write past the bounds of allocated memory when
    storing the returned data from the font server.

CVE-2014-0211

    Integer overflows calculating memory needs for xfs replies could
    result in allocating too little memory and then writing the returned
    data from the font server past the end of the allocated buffer.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.4.1-5.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.4.5-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.4.7-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxfont packages.
