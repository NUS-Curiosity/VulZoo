Subject: CVE-2014-0930 - Kernel Memory Leak And Denial Of Service Condition
 in IBM AIX

Vulnerability title: Kernel Memory Leak And Denial Of Service Condition
in IBM AIX
CVE: CVE-2014-0930
Vendor: IBM
Product: AIX
Affected version:  5.3, 6.1 and 7.1 releases VIOS 2.2.*
Fixed version: Interim version
Reported by: Tim Brown

Details:

It has been identified that the ptrace() system call can be manipulated
by an unprivileged user into leaking uninitialised kernel memory and
that the method by which this is achieved may also lead to a denial of
service condition. This can be achieved by manipulating the parameters
that are passed to the ptrace() system call when performing the
PT_LDINFO operation.

By calling ptrace(PT_LDINFO, childpid, leakbuffer, maximumleak, NULL)
with a value of maximumleak that greater than that required for the
expected result of the PT_LDINFO operation, the AIX kernel will
xmalloc() this space (without initialising it), populate it and then
perform a copy operation that returns the result within leakbuffer.
