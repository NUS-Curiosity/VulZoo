APPLE-SA-2014-05-15-2 iTunes 11.2

iTunes 11.2 is now available and addresses the following:

iTunes
Available for:  Windows 8, Windows 7, Vista, XP SP3 or later
Impact:  An attacker in a privileged network position can obtain
iTunes credentials
Description:  Set-Cookie HTTP headers would be processed even if the
connection closed before the header line was complete. An attacker
could strip security settings from the cookie by forcing the
connection to close before the security settings were sent, and then
obtain the value of the unprotected cookie. This issue was addressed
by ignoring incomplete HTTP header lines.
