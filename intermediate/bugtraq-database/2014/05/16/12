 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:100
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : java-1.7.0-openjdk
 Date    : May 16, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 An input validation flaw was discovered in the medialib library in the
 2D component. A specially crafted image could trigger Java Virtual
 Machine memory corruption when processed. A remote attacker, or an
 untrusted Java application or applet, could possibly use this flaw
 to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
 the Java Virtual Machine (CVE-2014-0429).
 
 Multiple flaws were discovered in the Hotspot and 2D components in
 OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these
 flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and possibly
 bypass Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2014-0456, CVE-2014-2397,
 CVE-2014-2421).
 
 Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the
 Libraries component in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or
 applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions
 (CVE-2014-0457, CVE-2014-0455, CVE-2014-0461).
 
 Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the
 AWT, JAX-WS, JAXB, Libraries, Security, Sound, and 2D components in
 OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these
 flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2014-2412,
 CVE-2014-0451, CVE-2014-0458, CVE-2014-2423, CVE-2014-0452,
 CVE-2014-2414, CVE-2014-2402, CVE-2014-0446, CVE-2014-2413,
 CVE-2014-0454, CVE-2014-2427, CVE-2014-0459).
 
 Multiple flaws were identified in the Java Naming and Directory
 Interface (JNDI) DNS client. These flaws could make it easier for a
 remote attacker to perform DNS spoofing attacks (CVE-2014-0460).
 
 It was discovered that the JAXP component did not properly prevent
 access to arbitrary files when a SecurityManager was present. This
 flaw could cause a Java application using JAXP to leak sensitive
 information, or affect application availability (CVE-2014-2403).
 
 It was discovered that the Security component in OpenJDK could leak
 some timing information when performing PKCS#1 unpadding. This could
 possibly lead to the disclosure of some information that was meant
 to be protected by encryption (CVE-2014-0453).
 
 It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2013-5797 did not properly
 resolve input sanitization flaws in javadoc. When javadoc documentation
 was generated from an untrusted Java source code and hosted on a
 domain not controlled by the code author, these issues could make it
 easier to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks (CVE-2014-2398).
 
 An insecure temporary file use flaw was found in the way the unpack200
 utility created log files. A local attacker could possibly use this
 flaw to perform a symbolic link attack and overwrite arbitrary files
 with the privileges of the user running unpack200 (CVE-2014-1876).
 
 Note that the CVE-2014-0459 issue is in the lcms2 library, which has
 been patched to correct this flaw.
