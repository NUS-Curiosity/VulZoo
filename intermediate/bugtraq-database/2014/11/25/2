Subject: [oCERT 2014-008] libFLAC multiple issues


Description:

FLAC is an open source lossless audio codec supported by several software
and music players.

The libFLAC project, an open source library implementing reference
encoders and decoders for native FLAC and Ogg FLAC audio content,
suffers from multiple implementation issues.

In particular, a stack overflow and a heap overflow condition, which may
result in arbitrary code execution, can be triggered by passing a maliciously
crafted .flac file to the libFLAC decoder.

Affected version:

libFLAC <= 1.3.0

The following packages were identified as affected as they statically
include libFLAC in their own packages.

Max <= 0.9.1
Cog <= 0.07
cinelerra <= 4.6
JUCE <= 3.1.0 (juce_audio_formats module)

Fixed version:

libFLAC >= 1.3.1

Max N/A
Cog N/A
cinelerra N/A
JUCE N/A
