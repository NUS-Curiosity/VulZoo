Subject: Docker 1.3.2 - Security Advisory [24 Nov 2014]

Today, we are releasing Docker 1.3.2 in order to address two critical
security issues. This release also includes several bugfixes,
including changes to the insecure-registry option. Below are CVE
descriptions for the vulnerabilities addressed in this release.

Docker 1.3.2 is available immediately for all supported platforms:

Docker Security Advisory [24 Nov 2014]
=================================================================

=====================================================
[CVE-2014-6407] Archive extraction allowing host privilege escalation
=====================================================
Severity: Critical
Affects: Docker up to 1.3.1

The Docker engine, up to and including version 1.3.1, was vulnerable
to extracting files to arbitrary paths on the host during ‘docker
pull’ and ‘docker load’ operations. This was caused by symlink and
hardlink traversals present in Docker's image extraction. This
vulnerability could be leveraged to perform remote code execution and
privilege escalation.

Docker 1.3.2 remedies this vulnerability. Additional checks have been
added to pkg/archive and image extraction is now performed in a
chroot. No remediation is available for older versions of Docker and
users are advised to upgrade.

Product Security and independent researcher, Tõnis Tiigi.

=================================================================
[CVE-2014-6408] Security options applied to image could lead to
container escalation
=================================================================
Severity: Critical
Affects: Docker 1.3.0-1.3.1

Docker versions 1.3.0 through 1.3.1 allowed security options to be
applied to images, allowing images to modify the default run profile
of containers executing these images. This vulnerability could allow a
malicious image creator to loosen the restrictions applied to a
container’s processes, potentially facilitating a break-out.

Docker 1.3.2 remedies this vulnerability. Security options applied to
images are no longer consumed by the Docker engine and will be
ignored. Users are advised to upgrade.

=================================================================
Other changes:
=================================================================

Besides the above CVEs, the 1.3.2 release allows administrators to
pass a CIDR-formatted range of addresses for '—insecure-registry'. In
addition, allowing a cleartext registry to exist on localhost is now
default behavior. This change was made due to user feedback following
the changes made in 1.3.1 to resolve CVE-2014-5277.
