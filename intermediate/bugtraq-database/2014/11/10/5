Subject: CVE-2014-3629: Apache Qpid's qpidd can be induced to make http requests

    Apache Software Foundation - Security Advisory

       Apache Qpid's qpidd can be induced to make http requests

CVE-2014-3629  CVS: 3

Severity: Low

Vendor:

The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

Apache Qpid's qpidd up to and including version
0.30, where xml exchange module is loaded

Description:

The XML exchange type is an optional, dynamically loaded module for
qpidd that allows creation of exchanges that route messages based on
evaluating an xquery expression against them.

On parsing a message sent to an XML exchange, whose body is XML
containing a link to a DTD, the broker process will attempt to
retrieve the referenced resource(s). I.e. the broker process may be
induced to make outgoing HTTP connections by publishing a message
containing links to an XML exchange.

Solution:

A patch is available that prevents any retrieval of external entities 
referenced in the XML. This will be included in subsequent releases, but 
can be applied to 0.30 if desired. 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12680198/QPID-6218.patch

Common Vulnerability Score information:

If the XML exchange functionality is not required, the module in
question need not be loaded at all. This can be done either by moving
the module - named xml.so - out of the module directory, or by setting
the --no-module-dir option and adding an explicit --load-module
argument for every required module.

Where the XML exchange functionality is required, authorisation may be
enabled to prevent all but trusted users from creating or publishing
to xml exchanges.
