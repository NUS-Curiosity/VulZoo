PHPMemcachedAdmin stores data in the server's filesystem. 
Part of the serialized data and the last part of the concatenated filename may be specified by the user, which can lead to remote code execution e.g. if a php script is created and placed within the webserver's document root.

All versions prior and including the current version 1.2.2 are affected as far as we know.
