RESOLUTION

HP is actively working on a firmware update to resolve the vulnerability in
HP StoreFabric H-series switches. This bulletin will be revised when the
update is available.

  MITIGATION INFORMATION

    HP recommends the following steps to reduce the risk of this
vulnerability:

      - Place the HP StoreFabric H-series switch and other data center
critical infrastructure behind a firewall to disallow access from the
Internet.
      - Change all HP StoreFabric switch default account passwords, including
the root passwords, from the default factory passwords.
      - Examine the list of accounts, including ones on the switch and those
existing on remote authentication servers such as RADIUS, LDAP, and TACAS+,
to ensure only necessary personnel can gain access to HP StoreFabric H-series
switches. Delete guest accounts and temporary accounts created for one-time
usage needs.
      - To avoid possible exploit through the embedded web GUI, QuickTools,
disable the web server with the following procedure:

        NOTE: After completing this procedure, the user will not be able to
manage the switch using QuickTools.

        1. Login to the Command Line Interface (CLI).
        2. Execute the "admin start" command to enter into an admin session.
        3. Execute the "set setup services" command and change setting for
EmbeddedGUIEnabled to "False".
