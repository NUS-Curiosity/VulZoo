Subject: CVE-2014-5439 - Root shell on Sniffit [with exploit]

CVE-2014-5439 - Root shell on Sniffit

Sniffit is a packet sniffer and monitoring tool.

The attacker can create a specially-crafted sniffit configuration file, 
which is able
to bypass all three protection mechanisms:

   -  Non-eXecutable bit NX
   -  Stack Smashing Protector SSP
   -  Address Space Layout Randomisation ASLR

And execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
