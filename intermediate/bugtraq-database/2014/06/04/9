Package        : chkrootkit
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0476

Thomas Stangner discovered a vulnerability in chkrootkit, a rootkit
detector, which may allow local attackers to gain root access when /tmp
is mounted without the noexec option.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.49-4.1+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.49-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your chkrootkit packages.
