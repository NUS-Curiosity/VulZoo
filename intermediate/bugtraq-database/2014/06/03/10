CVE-2014-2233
===================
"Server-Side Request Forgery" (CWE-918) vulnerability in "infoware MapSuite"


Vendor
===================
infoware GmbH


Product
===================
MapSuite


Affected versions
===================
This vulnerability affects versions of MapSuite MapAPI prior to 1.0.36 and 1.1.49


Fixed versions
===================
MapSuite MapAPI 1.0.36 and 1.1.49 
Both patches are available since 2014-03-26.


Reported by
===================
This issue was reported to the vendor by Christian Schneider (@cschneider4711) 
following a responsible disclosure process.


Severity
===================
Medium


Exploitability
===================
No authentication required


Description
===================
Using a specially crafted URL to access the MapAPI it is possible to issue 
HTTP(S) GET requests originating from the attacked server (behind the firewall) 
and to read the response. This enables attackers to access web servers that are not
exposed to be accessed from the internet and thus allows to pivot further into the
targeted network.


Proof of concept
===================
Due to the responsible disclosure process chosen and to not harm unpatched systems, 
no concrete exploit code will be presented in this advisory.


Migration
===================
MapSuite MapAPI 1.0.x users should upgrade to 1.0.36 or later as soon as possible.
MapSuite MapAPI 1.1.x users should upgrade to 1.1.49 or later as soon as possible.
