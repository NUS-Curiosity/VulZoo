Vulnerable	FCKeditor <= 2.6.10

FCKeditor is prone to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequately sanitised user input. An attacker may leverage this issue to run JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser.

FCKeditor 2.6.10 is known to be vulnerable; older versions may also be vulnerable. 

Note that this issue is related to CVE-2012-4000, which was a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the values of the textinputs[] array passed to the spellchecker.php page. To resolve this issue the values of this array were encoded with htmlspecialchars() before being output to the page; however the array keys were still echoed unencoded.

PoC:

POST http://[target]/editor/dialog/fck_spellerpages/spellerpages/server-scripts/spellchecker.php
textinputs[1</script><script>alert(document.cookie);//</script>]=zz

The vendor was notified of this issue, and FCKeditor 2.6.11 was released to address this vulnerability. See the following vendor announcement:
