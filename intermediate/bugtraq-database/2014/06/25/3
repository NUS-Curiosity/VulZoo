RESOLUTION

HP has provided the following guidance to resolve these vulnerabilities.

DMA uses the operating systems communication protocols, which are based on
OpenSSL. OpenSSL is an external product embedded in HP products.

Both DMA Core and DMA targets need to have vulnerable OpenSSL versions
running on them in order for DMA to be vulnerable.

Only the DMA Core needs to be protected by upgrading OpenSSL as follows:

Run the following command on your DMA Core and DMA targets to determine what
version of OpenSSL is being used by the operating system:

$ rpm -qa | grep OpenSSL

Upgrade the Client and/or Server to the following versions:

OpenSSL 0.9.8 (All versions) to 0.9.8za
OpenSSL 1.0.0 (all versions) to 1.0.0m
OpenSSL 1.0.1(all versions) to 1.0.1h
