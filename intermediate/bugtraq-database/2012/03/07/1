CVE ID         : CVE-2010-4540 CVE-2010-4541 CVE-2010-4542 CVE-2010-4543

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in GIMP, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program.

CVE-2010-4540
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the load_preset_response
	function in plug-ins/lighting/lighting-ui.c in the "LIGHTING
	EFFECTS > LIGHT" plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers
	to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
	execute arbitrary code via a long Position field in a plugin
	configuration file.

CVE-2010-4541
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the loadit function in
	plug-ins/common/sphere-designer.c in the SPHERE DESIGNER
	plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial
	of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
	code via a long "Number of lights" field in a plugin
	configuration file.

CVE-2010-4542
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the gfig_read_parameter_gimp_rgb
	function in in the GFIG plugin allows user-assisted remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
	possibly execute arbitrary code via a long Foreground field in a
	plugin configuration file.

CVE-2010-4543
	Heap-based buffer overflow in the read_channel_data function in
	file-psp.c in the Paint Shop Pro (PSP) plugin allows remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
	possibly execute arbitrary code via a PSP_COMP_RLE (aka RLE
	compression) image file that begins a long run count at the end
	of the image.

CVE-2011-1782
	The correction for CVE-2010-4543 was incomplete.

CVE-2011-2896
	The LZW decompressor in the LZWReadByte function in
	plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c does not properly handle code
	words that are absent from the decompression table when
	encountered, which allows remote attackers to trigger an
	infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly
	execute arbitrary code, via a crafted compressed stream.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.10-1+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.6.11-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.
