Potential Security Impact: Local compromise of system integrity

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with certain HP ProCurve 5400 zl switches using a compact flash card which may contain malware content that is a PC trojan executable. The ProCurve switch operating system is not infected with the malware and the content on the compact flash card has no impact on the operation of the switch. Reuse of the compact flash card in a personal computer and manual execution of the malware content could result in a compromise of that system's integrity.

RESOLUTION

The vulnerability can be resolved by any of the three following options:

Software Purge Option : HP provides a script that is run by the switch manager using the show tech custom command. This script will delete the fi(s) and directory without exposing a personal computer to the files on the compact flash. The operation of the switch is not impacted. This option is best for customers wanting to maximize the uptime of their network.

Hardware Replacement Option : For those customers who have 5400 zl switch inventory that is not on their network and must be purged, this option allows for the Management Module to be replaced. Also, any customer that feels uncomfortable performing the Software Purge Option can choose the Hardware Replacement Option as well. An advanced replacement Management Module will be sent to the customer. Once it arrives, the original Management Module is returned to HP after the new one is installed. The downside to this option is that the 5400 zl switch must be powered down in order to replace the Management Module, resulting in downtime.

Software Update Option (recommended) : The following Early Availability software update K.15.08.00007 is available which will automatically delete the malware trojan contents on the compact flash card if present. The software update also contains many other features and functionality enhancements for the switch. Note that updating the switch software should always be done with care and with an analysis of any potential impacts. Please refer to the release notes provided with the software update location below.
