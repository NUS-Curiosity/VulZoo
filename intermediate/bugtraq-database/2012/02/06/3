Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : multiple issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3607 CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2011-3639 CVE-2011-4317 
                 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0053 

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:

CVE-2011-3607:

  An integer overflow in ap_pregsub() could allow local attackers to
  execute arbitrary code at elevated privileges via crafted .htaccess
  files.

CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2011-3639 CVE-2011-4317:

  The Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the request URI for
  proxied requests. In certain reverse proxy configurations using the
  ProxyPassMatch directive or using the RewriteRule directive with the
  [P] flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy connect to an
  arbitrary server. The could allow the attacker to access internal
  servers that are not otherwise accessible from the outside.

  The three CVE ids denote slightly different variants of the same
  issue.

  Note that, even with this issue fixed, it is the responsibility of
  the administrator to ensure that the regular expression replacement
  pattern for the target URI does not allow a client to append arbitrary
  strings to the host or port parts of the target URI. For example, the
  configuration

    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(.*)  http://internal-host$1

  is still insecure and should be replaced by one of the following
  configurations:

    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(/.*)  http://internal-host$1
    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail/(.*)  http://internal-host/$1

CVE-2012-0031:

  An apache2 child process could cause the parent process to crash
  during shutdown. This is a violation of the privilege separation
  between the apache2 processes and could potentially be used to worsen
  the impact of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2012-0053:

  The response message for error code 400 (bad request) could be used to
  expose "httpOnly" cookies. This could allow a remote attacker using
  cross site scripting to steal authentication cookies.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.9-10+lenny12.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.16-6+squeeze6

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

This update also contains updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which have
been recompiled against the updated apache2 packages. The new version
number for the oldstable distribution is 2.2.6-02-1+lenny7. In the
stable distribution, apache2-mpm-itk has the same version number as
apache2.
