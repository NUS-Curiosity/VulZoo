RESOLUTION

HP has made the following procedures available to resolve the vulnerabilities.

Disable JBoss WebConsole

For BAC 8.7 Running on Windows

Delete the browser history
Close the browser
Stop BAC
Rename \HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\management\console-mgr.sar\web-console.war
to \HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\management\console-mgr.sar\web-console.war.disable
Delete work directory entries: \HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\work\jboss.web\localhost\web-console
Restart BAC
Open the browser

Note: Revision 1 of this Security Bulletin recommended renaming \HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\jmx-console.war to \HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\jmx-console.war.disable. This is not necessary. The file name should be restored. The procedure above can be used where restoring the original name is done in step 4.

For BSM 9.x prior to BSM 9.10 Running on Windows

Delete the browser history
Close the browser
Stop BSM
Rename \HPBSM\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\management\console-mgr.sar\web-console.war
to \HPBSM\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\management\console-mgr.sar\web-console.war.disable
Delete work directory entries: \HPBSM\EJBContainer\server\mercury\work\jboss.web\localhost\web-console
Restart BSM
Open the browser

Note: The JBoss WebConsole is disabled in BSM v9.10 and subsequent. The changes above are only needed for versions prior to v9.10.

Note: Revision 1 of this Security Bulletin recommended renaming \HPBSM\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\jmx-console.war to \HPBSM\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\jmx-console.war.disable. This is not necessary. The file name should be restored. The procedure above can be used where restoring the original name is done in step 4.

Disable Status Servlet

Edit this file
BAC 8.7 Running on Windows: \HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\jbossweb-tomcat55.sar\ROOT.war\WEB-INF\web.xml
BSM 9.x Running on Windows: \HPBSM\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\jboss-web.deployer\ROOT.war\WEB-INF\web.xml
to add <!- and -> as follows:

<!--

<servlet>
<servlet-name>Status Servlet</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>org.jboss.web.tomcat.tc5.StatusServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>Status Servlet</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/status</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

- -->

After making the change, stop and restart BAC or BSM.

For Solaris

For Solaris the procedure is the same as for Windows.

The Solaris files are:

BAC 8.7: /opt/HPBAC/EJBContainer/server/mercury/deploy/management/console-mgr.sar/web-console.war
BSM 9.x prior to BSM 9.10: /opt/HPBSM/EJBContainer/server/mercury/deploy/management/console-mgr.sar/web-console.war
BAC 8.7: /opt/HPBAC/EJBContainer/server/mercury/deploy/jbossweb-tomcat55.sar/ROOT.war/WEB-INF/web.xml
