Package        : libmodplug
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1761 CVE-2011-2911 CVE-2011-2912 CVE-2011-2913
                 CVE-2011-2914 CVE-2011-2915

Several vulnerabilities that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code
have been discovered in libmodplug, a library for mod music based on
ModPlug.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:

CVE-2011-1761

    epiphant discovered that the abc file parser is vulnerable to several
    stack-based buffer overflows that potentially lead to the execution
    of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2911

    Hossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadWav
    function is vulnerable to an integer overflow which leads to a
    heap-based buffer overflow.  An attacker can exploit this flaw to
    potentially execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening
    crafted WAV files.

CVE-2011-2912

    Hossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadS3M
    function is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow.  An attacker
    can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code by
    tricking a victim into opening crafted S3M files.

CVE-2011-2913

    Hossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadAMS
    function suffers from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to 
    memory corruption.  An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially
    execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening crafted AMS
    files.

CVE-2011-2914

    It was discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadDSM function suffers
    from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to memory corruption.
    An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary
    code by tricking a victim into opening crafted DSM files.

CVE-2011-2915

    It was discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadAMS2 function suffers
    from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to memory corruption.
    An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary
    code by tricking a victim into opening crafted AMS files.


For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.8.8.1-1+squeeze2.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
has been fixed in version 1:0.8.8.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libmodplug packages.
