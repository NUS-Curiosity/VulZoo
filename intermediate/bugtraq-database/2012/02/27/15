Package        : postgresql-8.4
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0866 CVE-2012-0867 CVE-2012-0868

Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in PostgreSQL, an 
object-relational SQL database. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2012-0866

   It was discovered that the permissions of a function called by a 
   trigger are not checked. This could result in privilege escalation.

CVE-2012-0867

   It was discovered that only the first 32 characters of a host name 
   are checked when validating host names through SSL certificates. 
   This could result in spoofing the connection in limited 
   circumstances.

CVE-2012-0868

   It was discovered that pg_dump did not sanitise object names.
   This could result in arbitrary SQL command execution if a
   malformed dump file is opened.   

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.11-0squeeze1. 

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.4 packages.
