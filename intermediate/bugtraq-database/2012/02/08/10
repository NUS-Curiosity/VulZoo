- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of EMC Networker. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the way the indexd.exe handles rpc calls
with opcode 0x1 for program 0x0005F3D9. While processing this message a
user supplied string is copied into a fixed size stack buffer. This can
result in a buffer overflow which can lead to remote code execution
under the context of the current process.
