- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Server. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the mod_ipp apache module component of the
iprint-server, which listens by default on 631/tcp. During the handling
of get-printer-attributes requests containing a
attributes-natural-language attribute cause a validation routine to be
hit. When validating this parameter the contents of the attribute are
copied, without validation, to a fixed length buffer on the stack.  A
remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code
under the context of the process.

- -- Vendor Response:

Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
