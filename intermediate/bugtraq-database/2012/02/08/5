RESOLUTION

CERT VU#864643 documents workarounds.

Prioritize RC4 Ciphers over CBC Ciphers

The vulnerability can be worked around by prioritizing RC4 ciphers over CBC ciphers.

By default SMH already does prioritize the RC4 ciphers over CBC ciphers. The default configuration is:

'ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:!EXPORT40:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:-SSLv2:+EXP:-LOW:+eNULL'

The list of available ciphers in SMH can be further restricted. The following command specifies only one cipher:

smhconfig -Z 'RC4-SHA.

After issuing the command, the SMH service must be restarted to make the change effective. The change should be tested with the browser.

Update the Browser

Certain browsers have implemented a protocol change to work around the vulnerability. CERT VU#864643 lists some of those browsers.
