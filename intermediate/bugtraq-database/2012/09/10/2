Package        : beaker
Vulnerability  : information disclosure
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3458
Debian Bug     : 684890

It was discovered that Beaker, a cache and session library for Python,
when using the python-crypto backend, is vulnerable to information
disclosure due to a cryptographic weakness related to the use of the
AES cipher in ECB mode.

Systems that have the python-pycryptopp package should not be
vulnerable, as this backend is preferred over python-crypto.

After applying this update, existing sessions will be invalidated.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.4-4+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.6.3-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your beaker packages.
