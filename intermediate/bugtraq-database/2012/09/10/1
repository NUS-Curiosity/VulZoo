Package        : mahara
Vulnerability  : cross-site scripting
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2237

Emanuel Bronshtein discovered that Mahara, an electronic portfolio,
weblog, and resume builder, contains multiple cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities due to missing sanitization and insufficient encoding
of user-supplied data.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.1-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.
