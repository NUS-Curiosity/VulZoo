- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the EMC Autostart ftAgent, which is deployed on
machines managed by EMC Autostart by default. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing routines for op-codes used by
EMC Autostart ftAgent's proprietary network protocol. This ftAgent.exe
service listens on TCP port 8045, and performs arithmetic for memory size
calculation using values read from the network without validation. This
arithmetic is susceptible to integer overflow, causing the memory
allocation to be undersized, ultimately allowing for heap-based memory
corruption. An attacker can exploit this condition to gain remote code
execution as user SYSTEM.

- -- Vendor Response:
EMC has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be
