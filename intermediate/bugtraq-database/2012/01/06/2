- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of OpenView Network Node Manager.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within ov.dll. When processing a user supplied
file name for the textFile option, there exists an insufficient boundary
check before supplying the value to a format string within _OVBuildPath,
causing a stack overflow. This can lead to memory corruption which can
be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the target
service.
