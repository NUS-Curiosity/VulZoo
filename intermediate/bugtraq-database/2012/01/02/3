Package        : cyrus-imapd-2.2
Vulnerability  : NULL pointer dereference
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-3481

It was discovered that cyrus-imapd, a highly scalable mail system designed
for use in enterprise environments, is not properly parsing mail headers
when a client makes use of the IMAP threading feature.  As a result, a NULL
pointer is dereferenced which crashes the daemon.  An attacker can trigger
this by sending a mail containing crafted reference headers and access the
mail with a client that uses the server threading feature of IMAP.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-14+lenny6.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-19+squeeze3.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem has been
fixed in cyrus-imapd-2.4 version 2.4.11-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.
