Synopsis
========

A debugging functionality in the X.Org X Server that is bound to a
hotkey by default can be used by local attackers to circumvent screen
locking utilities.

Background
==========

The X Keyboard Configuration Database provides keyboard configuration
for various X server implementations.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-misc/xkeyboard-config
                                 < 2.4.1-r3               >= 2.4.1-r3 
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Package 1 only applies to users of these architectures:
       amd64, arm, hppa, x86

Description
===========

Starting with the =x11-base/xorg-server-1.11 package, the X.Org X
Server again provides debugging functionality that can be used
terminate an application that exclusively grabs mouse and keyboard
input, like screen locking utilities.

Gu1 reported that the X Keyboard Configuration Database maps this
functionality by default to the Ctrl+Alt+Numpad * key combination.

Impact
======

A physically proximate attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
gain access to a locked X session without providing the correct
credentials.

Workaround
==========

Downgrade to any version of x11-base/xorg-server below
x11-base/xorg-server-1.11:

  # emerge --oneshot --verbose "<x11-base/xorg-server-1.11"

Resolution
==========

All xkeyboard-config users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=x11-misc/xkeyboard-config-2.4.1-r3"

NOTE: The X.Org X Server 1.11 was only stable on the AMD64, ARM, HPPA,
and x86 architectures. Users of the stable branches of all other
architectures are not affected and will be directly provided with a
fixed X Keyboard Configuration Database version.
