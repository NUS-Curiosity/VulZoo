Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1528 CVE-2011-1529 

It was discovered that the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in Kerberos 5
crashes when processing certain crafted requests:

CVE-2011-1528
	When the LDAP backend is used, remote users can trigger
	a KDC daemon crash and denial of service.

CVE-2011-1529
	When the LDAP or Berkeley DB backend is used, remote users
	can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the KDC daemon
	and a denial of service.
	
The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.8.3+dfsg-4squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.10+dfsg~alpha1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.
