Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in MIT Kerberos 5
Applications, the most severe of which may allow execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

A suite of applications that implement the Kerberos 5 network protocol
from MIT.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/mit-krb5-appl     < 1.0.2-r1               >= 1.0.2-r1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in MIT Kerberos 5
Applications:

* An error in the FTP daemon prevents it from dropping its initial
  effective group identifier (CVE-2011-1526).
* A boundary error in the telnet daemon and client could cause a buffer
  overflow (CVE-2011-4862).

Impact
======

An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the telnet daemon or
client. Furthermore, an authenticated remote attacker may be able to
read or write files owned by the same group as the effective group of
the FTP daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MIT Kerberos 5 Applications users should upgrade to the latest
version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-appl-1.0.2-r1"
