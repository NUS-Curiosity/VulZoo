Debian Bug     : 681454

Several vulnerabilities were found in libexif, a library used to parse EXIF
meta-data on camera files.

CVE-2012-2812: A heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the
exif_entry_get_value function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or possibly obtain potentially sensitive information from process
memory via an image with crafted EXIF tags.

CVE-2012-2813: A heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the
exif_convert_utf16_to_utf8 function allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service or possibly obtain potentially sensitive information from process
memory via an image with crafted EXIF tags. 

CVE-2012-2814: A buffer overflow in the exif_entry_format_value function
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute
arbitrary code via an image with crafted EXIF tags.

CVE-2012-2836: A heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the
exif_data_load_data function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or possibly obtain potentially sensitive information from process
memory via an image with crafted EXIF tags.

CVE-2012-2837: A divide-by-zero error in the mnote_olympus_entry_get_value
function while formatting EXIF maker note tags allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via an image with crafted EXIF tags.

CVE-2012-2840: An off-by-one error in the exif_convert_utf16_to_utf8 function
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute
arbitrary code via an image with crafted EXIF tags. 

CVE-2012-2841: An integer underflow in the exif_entry_get_value function can
cause a heap overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution while
formatting an EXIF tag, if the function is called with a buffer size
parameter equal to zero or one.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.19-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.20-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.20-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libexif packages.
