Package        : libproxy
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4505

The Red Hat Security Response Team discovered that libproxy, a library
for automatic proxy configuration management, applied insufficient
validation to the Content-Length header sent by a server providing a
proxy.pac file. Such remote server could trigger an integer overflow
and consequently overflow an in-memory buffer.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.1-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.3.1-5.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libproxy packages.
