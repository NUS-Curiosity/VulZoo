libexif project security advisory
July 12, 2012

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

A number of remotely exploitable issues were discovered in libexif
and exif, with effects ranging from information leakage to potential
remote code execution. The issues are:

CVE-2012-2812: A heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the
exif_entry_get_value function in libexif/exif-entry.c in libexif 0.6.20
and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
possibly obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory
via an image with crafted EXIF tags.

CVE-2012-2813: A heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the
exif_convert_utf16_to_utf8 function in libexif/exif-entry.c in libexif
0.6.20 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
or possibly obtain potentially sensitive information from process
memory via an image with crafted EXIF tags. 

CVE-2012-2814: A buffer overflow in the exif_entry_format_value function
in libexif/exif-entry.c in libexif 0.6.20 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via an
image with crafted EXIF tags.

CVE-2012-2836: A heap-based out-of-bounds array read in the
exif_data_load_data function in libexif 0.6.20 and earlier allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly obtain potentially
sensitive information from process memory via an image with crafted
EXIF tags.

CVE-2012-2837: A divide-by-zero error in the
mnote_olympus_entry_get_value function while formatting EXIF maker note
tags in libexif 0.6.20 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service via an image with crafted EXIF tags.

CVE-2012-2840: An off-by-one error in the exif_convert_utf16_to_utf8
function in libexif/exif-entry.c in libexif 0.6.20 and earlier allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute
arbitrary code via an image with crafted EXIF tags. 

CVE-2012-2841: An integer underflow in the exif_entry_get_value function
can cause a heap overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution while
formatting an EXIF tag, if the function is called with a buffer size
parameter equal to zero or one.

CVE-2012-2845: An integer overflow in the function jpeg_data_load_data
in the exif program could cause a data read beyond the end of a buffer,
causing an application crash or leakage of potentially sensitive
information when parsing a crafted JPEG file.

There are no known public exploits of these issues.

AFFECTED VERSIONS

All of the described vulnerabilities affect libexif
version 0.6.20, and most affect earlier versions as well.

SOLUTION

Upgrade to version 0.6.21 which is not vulnerable to
these issues.
