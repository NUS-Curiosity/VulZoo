         CVE Name       CVE-2012-3812                                         

    Description  If a single voicemail account is manipulated by two parties  
                 simultaneously, a condition can occur where memory is freed  
                 twice causing a crash.                                       

    Resolution  Management of the memory in question has been reworked so     
                that double frees and out of bounds array access do not       
                occur. Upgrade to the latest release.
