APPLE-SA-2012-07-25-2 Xcode 4.4

Xcode 4.4 is now available and addresses the following:

neon
Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7.4 and later
Impact:  An attacker may be able to decrypt data protected by SSL
Description:  There are known attacks on the confidentiality of SSL
3.0 and TLS 1.0 when a cipher suite uses a block cipher in CBC mode.
The neon library (used by Subversion) disabled the 'empty fragment'
countermeasure which prevented these attacks. This issue is addressed
by enabling the countermeasure.
CVE-ID
CVE-2011-3389

Xcode
Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7.4 and later
Impact:  Helper tools built with Xcode allow any App Store
application to read their keychain entries
Description:  All signed programs contain a designated requirement
(DR) which states, from the perspective of the developer of the
program, what constraints a program needs to satisfy in order to be
considered an instance of this program. When a Developer ID was used
with Xcode to sign a product that did not have a bundle identifier,
such as a command-line tool or an embedded helper, the generated DR
for the product did not include the developer's ID in the part of the
DR that applies to apps signed by the App Store. As a result, any App
Store app may have accessed keychain items created by the product.
This is addressed by generating a DR with improved checks. Affected
products need to be re-signed with this version of Xcode to include
the improved DR.
CVE-ID
CVE-2012-3698
