> =====================
> 
> Code Audit Labs http://www.vulnhunt.com has discovered a website
> spoof vulnerability in Opera .When a user types a new URL for the
> browser to load, the currently active page may detect when the
> new page is about to load and prevent the navigation, while still
> leaving the new URL displayed in the address bar. This can then be
> used to spoof the URL of the target page. The malicious page would
> need to employ social engineering tactics in order to guess what
> page the user is likely to try to load next, as it cannot see what
>  URL the user has typed.
