Security Advisory - Checkpoint Endpoint Connect VPN - DLL Hijack
================================================================================
Summary           : Checkpoint Endpoint Connect VPN is prone to DLL hijacking
Date              : 12 June 2012
Affected versions : Endpoint Security VPN R75
					Remote Access Clients E75.x
					Endpoint Security R73.x/E80.x (VPN blade)
ID                : sk76480
CVE reference     : CVE-2012-2753

Details
==========
A vulnerability in Checkpoint Endpoint Connect VPN causes the client to be
susceptible to an attack that result in arbitrary dynamic-library loading.

A user with local disk access can carefuly construct a DLL that suits a pattern
that is being traversed by the client and implement it somewhere along the
search path and the client will load it seamlessly.

Impact
==========
After the DLL has been implemented, an unsuspected user that will run the
program will cause it to load, resulting in arbitrary code execution with
user's privilege level.

Solution
==========
