ZDI-12-101 : IBM Cognos tm1admsd.exe Multiple Operations Remote Code
Execution Vulnerabilities
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-101
June 27, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0202

- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
IBM

- -- Affected Products:
IBM Cognos

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Cognos. Authentication is not required to
exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the tm1admsd.exe component. This process listens on
TCP port 5498 by default. Requests to the service include a request type
field, a data length field, and a data field. Multiple request types
(opcodes) fail to validate user supplied length and data fields before
copying their contents to a fixed length buffer on the stack. A remote
attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the
context of the system.
