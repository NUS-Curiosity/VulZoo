Subject: CVE-2012-2381: Apache Roller Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

Severity: important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Roller 4.0.0 to Roller 4.0.1
Roller 5.0
The unsupported Roller 3.1 release is also affected

Description:
Roller trusts bloggers to post HTML and JavaScript code in the weblog
and for some sites this can be a problem because users are untrusted
and could post malicious code and exploit XSS. This issue has be
addressed by added a new configiration property weblogAdminsUntrusted
flag that, when set to 'true' will cause all weblog content to be HTML
sanitized.

Mitigation
Roller 4.0 and 4.0.1 users should upgrade to Roller 5.0.1
Roller 5.0 users should upgrade to Roller 5.0.1
Roller 3.1 users should upgrade to Roller 5.0.1
