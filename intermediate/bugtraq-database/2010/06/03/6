Synopsis
========

The GD library is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Background
==========

GD is a graphic library for fast image creation.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/gd      < 2.0.35-r1                       >= 2.0.35-r1

Description
===========

Tomas Hoger reported that the _gdGetColors() function in gd_gd.c does
not properly verify the colorsTotal struct member, possibly leading to
a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted image
file with a program using the GD library, possibly resulting in the
remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application, or a Denial of Service condition.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GD users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/gd-2.0.35-r1"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since November 21, 2009. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
