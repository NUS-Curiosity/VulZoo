Synopsis
========

A flaw in sudo's -e option may allow local attackers to execute
arbitrary commands.

Background
==========

sudo allows a system administrator to give users the ability to run
commands as other users.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/sudo     < 1.7.2_p6                         >= 1.7.2_p6

Description
===========

The command matching functionality does not properly handle when a file
in the current working directory has the same name as a pseudo-command
in the sudoers file and the PATH contains an entry for ".".

Impact
======

A local attacker with the permission to run sudoedit could, under
certain circumstances, execute arbitrary commands as whichever user he
has permission to run sudoedit as, typically root.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All sudo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/sudo-1.7.2_p6"
