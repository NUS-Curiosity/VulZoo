Cisco Security Advisory: Hard-Coded SNMP Community Names in Cisco
Industrial Ethernet 3000 Series Switches Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100707-snmp

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 July 07 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Industrial Ethernet 3000 (IE 3000) Series switches running
Cisco IOS Software releases 12.2(52)SE or 12.2(52)SE1, contain a
vulnerability where well known SNMP community names are hard-coded
for both read and write access. The hard-coded community names are
"public" and "private."

Cisco recommends that all administrators deploy the mitigation
measures outlined in the Workarounds section or perform a Cisco IOS
Software upgrade.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100707-snmp.shtml

Affected Products
=================

The following product is affected by this vulnerability:

  * Cisco Industrial Ethernet 3000 Series Switches

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The Cisco Industrial Ethernet 3000 Series switches are vulnerable
when running any of the following Cisco IOS Software releases:

  * Cisco IOS Software release 12.2(52)SE or 12.2(52)SE1

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Other hardware models of Cisco switching products that are running
the vulnerable Cisco IOS Software versions are not affected by this
vulnerability.

Cisco Industrial Ethernet 3000 Series switches that are not running
the Cisco IOS Software releases that is listed above are not
vulnerable.

Details
=======

Cisco Industrial Ethernet 3000 Series switches that are running
affected versions of Cisco IOS Software contain hard-coded SNMP
read-write community names.

The Cisco Industrial Ethernet 3000 Series is a family of switches
that provide a rugged, easy-to-use, secure infrastructure for harsh
environments.

SNMP is used for managing and monitoring the device and community
names are the equivalent to a password.

The hard-coded SNMP community names are:

    snmp-server community public RO
    snmp-server community private RW

The SNMP community names can be removed; however, the hard-coded
community names are reapplied to the running configuration when the
device reloads. Cisco has provided a workaround that ensures the
community names are removed when the device reloads.

Note: Configuring an access list or a restricted mib view:

    snmp-server community public RO 99
    snmp-server community private RW 99
    snmp-server community public view <mib> RO 99
    snmp-server community private view <mib> RO 99
    
    access-list 99 deny   any

The proceeding works as a workaround until the device is reloaded.
Once the device is reloaded the original configuration is inserted
without the access lists or mib views assigned to the community
names. Consult the workarounds section of this advisory.

This vulnerability was introduced as part of a new feature integrated
into the affected releases called PROFINET. At the time of the
publication of this advisory, PROFINET was only supported on Cisco
Industrial Ethernet 3000 Series switches.

This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug ID CSCtf25589.
This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2010-1574.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to ensure the devices
to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware
and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by
the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance
provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
release train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the
earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the
anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed
in the "First Fixed Release" column of the table. A device running a
release in the given train that is earlier than the release in a
specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be
vulnerable. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or later
than the release specified in the "First Fixed Release" column of the
table.

Workarounds
===========

Manually Remove SNMP Community Names
+-----------------------------------

Note: The following workaround is only effective until the device is
reloaded. Upon each reload of the device this workaround must be
re-applied. Cisco encourages performing a Cisco IOS Software upgrade
as a permanent fix for this vulnerability.

Log in to the device, and enter configuration mode. Enter the
following configuration commands:

    no snmp-server community public RO
    no snmp-server community private RW

Saving the configuration will update the start-up configuration
files; however the hard-coded community names will be reinserted to
the running configuration when the device reloads. This workaround
must be applied each time the device is reloaded.

Automatically Remove SNMP Community Names
+----------------------------------------

By creating an Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy, it is possible to
automatically remove the hard-coded SNMP community names each time
the device is reloaded. The following example shows an EEM policy
that runs each time the device is reloaded and removes the hard-coded
SNMP community names.

    event manager applet cisco-sa-20100707-snmp
     event timer countdown time 30 
     action 10 cli command "enable"
     action 20 cli command "configure terminal"
     action 30 cli command "no snmp-server community public RO"
     action 40 cli command "no snmp-server community private RW"
     action 50 cli command "end"
     action 60 cli command "disable"
     action 70 syslog msg "Hard-coded SNMP community names as per Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20100707-snmp removed"

For more information on EEM policies consult the Cisco IOS Network
Management Configuration Guide - Embedded Event Manager Overview at
the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/netmgmt/configuration/guide/nm_eem_overview_ps6441_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html

Infrastructure Access Control Lists
+----------------------------------

Although it is often difficult to block traffic that transits a
network, it is possible to identify traffic that should never be
allowed to target infrastructure devices and block that traffic at
the device interface or the border of networks.

If SNMP management is not required on the IE3000, then dropping all
SNMP traffic to the device is a sufficient workaround. The iACL below
shows an example of an IE3000 with two interfaces configured with
layer 3 access, dropping all SNMP queries destined to the IE3000:

    
    !---
    !--- Deny SNMP traffic from all other sources destined to 
    !--- configured IP addresses on the IE3000.
    !---
    
    
    access-list 150 deny udp any host 192.168.0.1 eq snmp
    access-list 150 deny udp any host 192.168.1.1 eq snmp
    
    
    !---
    !--- Permit/deny all other Layer 3 and Layer 4 traffic in 
    !--- accordance with existing security policies and configurations
    !--- Permit all other traffic to transit the device.
    !---
    
    
    access-list 150 permit ip any any
    
    
    !---
    !--- Apply access-list to all Layer 3 interfaces 
    !--- (only two examples shown)
    !---
    
    
    interface Vlan1
     ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
     ip access-group 150 in
    
    interface GigabitEthernet1/1
     ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
     ip access-group 150 in
