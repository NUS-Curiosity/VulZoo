Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player might allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

The Adobe Flash Player is a renderer for the SWF file format, which is
commonly used to provide interactive websites.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /   Vulnerable   /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-plugins/adobe-flash     < 10.0.42.34            >= 10.0.42.34

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Flash Player:

* An anonymous researcher working with the Zero Day Initiative
  reported that Adobe Flash Player does not properly process JPEG files
  (CVE-2009-3794).

* Jim Cheng of EffectiveUI reported an unspecified data injection
  vulnerability (CVE-2009-3796).

* Bing Liu of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs reported multiple
  unspecified memory corruption vulnerabilities (CVE-2009-3797,
  CVE-2009-3798).

* Damian Put reported an integer overflow in the
  Verifier::parseExceptionHandlers() function (CVE-2009-3799).

* Will Dormann of CERT reported multiple unspecified Denial of
  Service vulnerabilities (CVE-2009-3800).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted SWF
file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of
Service via unknown vectors.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
    ">=www-plugins/adobe-flash-10.0.42.34"
