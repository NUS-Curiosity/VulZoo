            in HP Customer Notice: HPSN-2008-002

HP Web Jetadmin requires the use of an SQL database. Starting with HP Web Jetadmin v10.2 a remote SQL Server can be configured.

The remote SQL Server is not authenticated.
Most data exchanged with a remote SQL Server are not encrypted.

Note: Stored device and user credentials with the exception of the database login credentials are encrypted. The database login credentials are obfuscated to prevent casual inspection, but they are not encrypted.

RESOLUTION

If HP Web Jetadmin is used on an untrusted network, the vulnerabilities can be avoided by using an SQL Server on the HP Web Jetadmin system. In that configuration data exchanged between HP Web Jetadmin and the SQL Server are not transmitted on the network.
