-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Safari's Webkit. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the library's support of an element
containing the run-in property. When a block box is appended as the
sibling of a run-in box, the run-in box will be promoted to the first
inline box. This implies that the first inline box will be destroyed.
Later when the application attempts to destroy this element, it will
access memory that has been freed. If an attacker can substitute an
alternate type in the element's place, the attacker will have code
execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
