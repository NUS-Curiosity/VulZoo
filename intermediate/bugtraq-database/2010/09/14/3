-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Data Protector.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the function DtbClsLogin defined in the
module dpwindtb.dll on Windows and libdplindtb.so on Linux. This
function takes user supplied input and copies it directly to a stack
buffer. By providing a large enough string this buffer can be overrun
and may result in arbitrary code execution dependent on the underlying
operating system.
