____________________________________________________________________________

Overview:
--------
Part of the Alcatel Omnivista 4760 administration software of the Alcatel
4400 PBX is an HTTP proxy. It is used to tunnel ssh-connections to the
ssh-ports 
of the PBX within the internal network. 
This proxy is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow.

Description:
--------
By sending a long HTTP GET request it is possible to overwrite CPU
registers.
Due to this vulnerability, an attacker can control the execution path
remotely.

Impact:
--------
Arbitray code can be executed on the proxy server from remote. 
On a normal setup the HTTP proxy is running on the same machine as the 4760
management system.
Due to this vulnerability an attacker can gain access to administrative
functions of the PBX and to the internal network, possibly a DMZ.


Solution
--------
Mitigation
Protect the HTTP proxy function on the 4760 server with the Windows internal

firewall by restricting access to workstations with a known pre-declared 
IP address:
In the windows firewall configuration, for the exception concerning the 4760

Communication Server, modify the extent of allowed systems by removing the 
authorization for any IP system with the precise list of the specifically 
allowed IP addresses. 
Note: include the 4760 server own address in this list to enable the
embedded 
4760 client as well.

Fixed Software Versions/Patches and how to obtain them
OmniVista 4760 version R5.1: install the Patch3 for version
5.1.06.03.c_Patch2 
(or the full delivery 5.1.06.03.c_Patch3 when it is available).
OmniVista 4760 version R5.0 and prior: upgrade to OmniVista 4760 version
R5.1 
and installation of patch is recommended.
