This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager
versions 6.1(5)SU1, 7.0(2a)SU3, 7.1(3b)SU2, 7.1(5) and 8.0(1). Cisco
Unified Communications Manager version 4.x is not affected.

The second SIP DoS vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID
CSCtf66305 and has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2010-2838.
The second vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager versions 7.0(2a)SU3, 7.1(5) and 8.0(3). Cisco Unified
Communications Manager versions 4.x and 6.x are not affected.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities that are described in
this advisory could result in the interruption of voice services.
Cisco Unified Communications Manager will restart the affected
processes, but repeated attacks may result in a sustained DoS
Condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult:

http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt

and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a
complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities described in this
advisory.

It is possible to mitigate this vulnerability by implementing
filtering on screening devices and permitting access to TCP ports
5060 and 5061 and to UDP ports 5060 and 5061 only from networks that
require SIP access to Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers.

If Cisco Unified Communications Manager does not need to provide SIP
services, administrators can configure the Cisco Unified
Communications Manager to listen for SIP messages on non-standard
ports. Use the following instructions to change the ports from their
default values:

Step 1: Log into the Cisco Unified Communications Manager
Administration web interface.

Step 2: Navigate to System > Cisco Unified CM and locate the
appropriate Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

Step 3: Change the SIP Phone Port and SIP Phone Secure Port fields to
a non-standard port and click Save.

The SIP Phone Port, which is set to 5060 by default, refers to the
TCP and UDP ports on which the Cisco Unified Communications Manager
listens for normal SIP messages. SIP Phone Secure Port, which is set
to 5061 by default, refers to the TCP port on which the Cisco Unified
Communications Manager listens for SIP over Transport Layer Security
(TLS) messages. For additional information about this procedure,
refer to the "Updating a Cisco Unified Communications Manager"
section of the "Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration
Guide" at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucmbe/admin/7_0_1/ccmcfg/b02ccm.html#wp1057513

Note: For a SIP port change to take effect, the Cisco CallManager
Service must be restarted. For information on how to restart the
service, refer to the "Restarting the Cisco CallManager Service"
section of the administration guide at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucmbe/admin/7_0_1/ccmcfg/b03dpi.html#wp1075124
