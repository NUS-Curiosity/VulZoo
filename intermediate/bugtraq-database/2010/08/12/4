-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Safari's Webkit. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the library's process for handling
floating elements within an SVG document. During layout of the element,
the application will mismanage references to the floating element. Later
the application will attempt to destroy this reference triggering
corruption. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the
context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple states:
Fixed in Safari 5.0.1: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4276
