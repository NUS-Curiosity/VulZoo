ZDI-10-048: Mozilla Firefox nsTreeContentView Dangling Pointer Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-048
April 2, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-0176

-- Affected Vendors:
Mozilla Firefox

-- Affected Products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x


-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required in that the victim must visit a malicious website or be coerced
into opening a malicious document.

The specific flaw exists within the way that Mozilla's Firefox parses
.XUL files. While appending a particular tag to a treechildren
container, the application will create more than one reference to a
particular element without increasing its reference count. Upon removal
of one of the elements, the refcount will be decreased causing the
application to free the memory associated with the object. Due to the
rogue reference occurring, the next time the application attempts to
reference that container, the application will access memory that has
been freed which can lead to code execution under the context of the
application.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
