 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2010:078-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : sudo
 Date    : April 28, 2010
 Affected: 2009.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been found and corrected in sudo:
 
 The command matching functionality in sudo 1.6.8 through 1.7.2p5 does
 not properly handle when a file in the current working directory has
 the same name as a pseudo-command in the sudoers file and the PATH
 contains an entry for ., which allows local users to execute arbitrary
 commands via a Trojan horse executable, as demonstrated using sudoedit,
 a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-0426 (CVE-2010-1163).
 
 Packages for 2008.0 are provided for Corporate Desktop 2008.0
 customers.
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.

 Update:

 Packages for 2009.0 are provided due to the Extended Maintenance
 Program.
