-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists during the parsing of a malformed SubImage
Header Stream from a malicious FlashPix image. The application takes the
NumberOfTiles field from this data structure, multiplies it by 16, and
then uses it in an allocation. If this result is larger than 32-bits the
value will wrap leading to an under-allocated buffer. Later when the
application copies data into this buffer, a buffer overflow will occur
leading to code execution within the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
