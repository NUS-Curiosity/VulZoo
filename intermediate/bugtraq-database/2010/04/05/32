ZDI-10-057: Sun Java Runtime Environment JPEGImageDecoderImpl Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-057
April 5, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-0849

-- Affected Vendors:
Sun Microsystems

-- Affected Products:
Sun Microsystems Java Runtime

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sun's Java Runtime. User interaction is
required in that a user must be coerced into executing a malicious java
application via visiting a website.

The specific flaw exists within the JPEGImageDecoderImpl interface used
by the image processing library to decode JPEG Imagery. By abusing an
object meant to specify parameters used by the underlying jpeg decoder a
malicious attacker can influence the decoding routine resulting in a
heap overflow. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code in the
context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
