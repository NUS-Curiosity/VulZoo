-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required in that a target must open a malicious media file or visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of H.263 media files. The
code within QuickTime trusts various values from MDAT structures and
uses them during operations on heap memory. By crafting specific values
the corruption can be leveraged to execute remote code under the context
of the user running the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
