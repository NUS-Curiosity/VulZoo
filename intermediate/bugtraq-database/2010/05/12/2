-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing
Director files. When the application parses the pami RIFF chunk, it
trusts an offset value and seeks into the file data. If provided with
signed values in the data at the given offset, the process can be made
to incorrectly calculate a pointer and operate on the data at it's
location. This can be abused by an attacker to execute arbitrary code
under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
