ZDI-10-087: Adobe Shockwave Invalid Offset Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-087
May 11, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-1281

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave. User interaction is
required in that a target visit a malicious website.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing
Director files. The vulnerable function is exported as an ordinal from
the iml32.dll module. Ordinal 1409 trusts a value from the file as an
offset and updates pointers accordingly. By crafting a large enough
value and seeking the file pointer past the end of a buffer this can be
abused to corrupt heap memory. An attacker can abuse this to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
