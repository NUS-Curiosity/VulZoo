pmwiki: persistent cross site scripting (XSS), CVE-2010-1481

Description

The table feature of pmwiki is vulnerable to persistent cross site scripting 
(XSS). The value of the width-parameter is not proberly escaped on output, so 
one can put quotes in it. This makes it possible to use a JavaScript event 
handler inside the first table field to inject code.

Example:

||width="
|| " onMouseOver=alert(1) " ||test||

The vendor has been contacted, but has not replied to my report.
