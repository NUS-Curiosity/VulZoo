 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2010:089
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : gnutls
 Date    : May 3, 2010
 Affected: Corporate 4.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in gnutls:
 
 The TLS protocol, and the SSL protocol 3.0 and possibly earlier, as
 used in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0, mod_ssl
 in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.14 and earlier, OpenSSL before 0.9.8l,
 GnuTLS 2.8.5 and earlier, Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS)
 3.12.4 and earlier, and other products, does not properly associate
 renegotiation handshakes with an existing connection, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to insert data into HTTPS sessions,
 and possibly other types of sessions protected by TLS or SSL, by
 sending an unauthenticated request that is processed retroactively
 by a server in a post-renegotiation context, related to a plaintext
 injection attack, aka the Project Mogul issue (CVE-2009-3555).
 
 The gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial function in the GnuTLS library before
 1.2.1, when running on big-endian, 64-bit platforms, calls the
 asn1_read_value with a pointer to the wrong data type and the wrong
 length value, which allows remote attackers to bypass the certificate
 revocation list (CRL) check and cause a stack-based buffer overflow
 via a crafted X.509 certificate, related to extraction of a serial
 number (CVE-2010-0731).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
