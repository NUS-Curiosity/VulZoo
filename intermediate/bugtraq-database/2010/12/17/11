Apple Quicktime Memory Corruption when parsing FPX files
CVE-2010-3801


INTRODUCTION

Apple Quicktime is a "powerful media technology that works on Mac and PC with just about 
every popular video or audio format you come across. So you can play the digital media 
you want to play".

Apple Quicktime is available as plugin to different browsers, and thus the vulnerability
can be remotely triggered.

QuickTime player does not properly parse .fpx media files, which causes a memory corruption by 
opening a malformed file with an invalid value located in PoC repro.fpx at offset 0x49.

This problem was confirmed in the following versions of Apple Quicktime and browsers, other 
versions may be also affected.

QuickTime Player version 7.6.8 (1675) in all Operating Systems
QuickTime Player version 7.6.6 (1671) in all Operating Systems

CVSS Scoring System

The CVSS score is: 9
	Base Score: 10
	Temporal Score: 9
We used the following values to calculate the scores:
	Base score is: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C
	Temporal score is: E:POC/RL:U/RC:C


TRIGGERING THE PROBLEM

The problem is triggered by PoC repro.fpx which causes invalid memory access in all the 
refered versions and is available to interested parties only.
