Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-4329 CVE-2010-4480 CVE-2010-4481

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-4329

  Cross site scripting was possible in search, that allowed
  a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2010-4480

  Cross site scripting was possible in errors, that allowed
  a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2010-4481

  Display of PHP's phpinfo() function was available to world, but only
  if this functionality had been enabled (defaults to off). This may
  leak some information about the host system.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.8.1-5+lenny7.

For the testing (squeeze) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems
have been fixed in version 3.3.7-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.
