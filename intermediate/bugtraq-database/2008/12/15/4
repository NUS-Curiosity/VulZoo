Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the Dovecot mailserver.

Background
==========

Dovecot is an IMAP and POP3 server written with security primarily in
mind.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/dovecot     < 1.1.7-r1                       >= 1.1.7-r1

Description
===========

Several vulnerabilities were found in Dovecot:

* The "k" right in the acl_plugin does not work as expected
  (CVE-2008-4577, CVE-2008-4578)

* The dovecot.conf is world-readable, providing improper protection
  for the ssl_key_password setting (CVE-2008-4870)

* A permanent Denial of Service with broken mail headers is possible
  (CVE-2008-4907)

Impact
======

These vulnerabilities might allow a remote attacker to cause a Denial
of Service, to circumvent security restrictions or allow local
attackers to disclose the passphrase of the SSL private key.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Dovecot users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/dovecot-1.1.7-r1"

Users should be aware that dovecot.conf will still be world-readable
after the update. If employing ssl_key_password, it should not be used
in dovecot.conf but in a separate file which should be included with
"include_try".
