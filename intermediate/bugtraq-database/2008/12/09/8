4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 
Word, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow error when 
calculating the space required for the specified number of points in 
a polyline or polygon. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based 
buffer overflow during parsing of objects in Rich Text Format (.rtf) 
files e.g. when a user opens a specially crafted .rtf file with Word 
or previews a specially crafted e-mail.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
