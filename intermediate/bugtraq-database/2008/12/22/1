4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Trend Micro 
HouseCall, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in the HouseCall
ActiveX control (Housecall_ActiveX.dll). This can be exploited to 
dereference previously freed memory by tricking the user into opening 
a web page containing a specially crafted "notifyOnLoadNative()"
callback function.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

5) Solution 

Remove the ActiveX control and install version 6.6.0.1285.
