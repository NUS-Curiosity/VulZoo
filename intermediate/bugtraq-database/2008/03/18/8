1. Summary:

~   Several critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed
~   in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line.

2. Relevant releases:

~   VMware Workstation 6.0.2 and earlier
~   VMware Workstation 5.5.4 and earlier
~   VMware Player 2.0.2 and earlier
~   VMware Player 1.0.4 and earlier
~   VMware ACE 2.0.2 and earlier
~   VMware ACE 1.0.2 and earlier
~   VMware Server 1.0.4 and earlier
~   VMware Fusion 1.1 and earlier

3. Problem description:

~ a.  Host to guest shared folder (HGFS) traversal vulnerability

~     On Windows hosts, if you have configured a VMware host to guest
~     shared folder (HGFS), it is possible for a program running in the
~     guest to gain access to the host's file system and create or modify
~     executable files in sensitive locations.

NOTE: VMware Server is not affected because it doesn't use host to
~      guest shared folders.  No versions of ESX Server, including
~      ESX Server 3i, are affected by this vulnerability.  Because
~      ESX Server is based on a bare-metal hypervisor architecture
~      and not a hosted architecture, and it doesn't include any
~      shared folder abilities.  Fusion and Linux based hosted
~      products are unaffected.

~     VMware would like to thank CORE Security Technologies for
~     working with us on this issue.  This addresses advisory
~     CORE-2007-0930.

~     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
~     has assigned the name CVE-2008-0923 to this issue.

~     Hosted products
~     ---------------
~     VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004)
~     VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404)
~     VMware Player      2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004)
~     VMware Player      1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.6 (Build# 80404)
~     VMware ACE         2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004)
~     VMware ACE         1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 79846)

~ b.  Insecure named pipes

~     An internal security audit determined that a malicious Windows
~     user could attain and exploit LocalSystem privileges by causing
~     the authd process to connect to a named pipe that is opened and
~     controlled by the malicious user.

~     The same internal security audit determined that a malicious
~     Windows user could exploit an insecurely created named pipe
~     object to escalate privileges or create a denial of service
~     attack.  In this situation, the malicious user could
~     successfully impersonate authd and attain privileges under
~     which Authd is executing.

~     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
~     has assigned the names CVE-2008-1361, CVE-2008-1362 to these
~     issues.

~     Windows Hosted products

~ c.  Updated libpng library to version 1.2.22 to address various
~     security vulnerabilities

~     Several flaws were discovered in the way libpng handled various PNG
~     image chunks. An attacker could create a carefully crafted PNG
~     image file in such a way that it could cause an application linked
~     with libpng to crash when the file was manipulated.

~     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
~     has assigned the name CVE-2007-5269 to this issue.

~     Hosted products
~     ---------------
~     VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004)
~     VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404)

~ d.  Updated OpenSSL library to address various security vulnerabilities

~     Updated OpenSSL fixes several security flaws were discovered
~     in previous versions of OpenSSL.

~     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
~     assigned the following names to these issues: CVE-2006-2940,
~     CVE-2006-2937, CVE-2006-4343, CVE-2006-4339.

~     Hosted products
~     ---------------
~     VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004)
~     VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404)
~     VMware Player      2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004)

~     NOTE: Fusion is not affected by this issue.

~ e.  VIX API default setting changed to a more secure default value

~     Workstation 6.0.2 allowed anonymous console access to the guest by
~     means of the VIX API. This release, Workstation 6.0.3, disables
~     this feature. This means that the Eclipse Integrated Virtual
~     Debugger and the Visual Studio Integrated Virtual Debugger will now
~     prompt for user account credentials to access a guest.

~     Hosted products
~     ---------------
~     VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004)
~     VMware Player      2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004)
~     VMware ACE         2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004)

~ f.  Windows 2000 based hosted products privilege escalation
~     vulnerability

~     This release addresses a potential privilege escalation on
~     Windows 2000 hosted products.  Certain services may be improperly
~     registered and present a security vulnerability to Windows 2000
~     machines.

~     VMware would like to thank Ray Hicken for reporting this issue and
~     David Maciejak for originally pointing out these types of
~     vulnerabilities.

~           issue.

~ g.  DHCP denial of service vulnerability

~     A potential denial of service issue affects DHCP service running
~     on the host.

~     VMware would like to thank Martin O'Neal for reporting this issue.

~     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
~     assigned the name CVE-2008-1364 to this issue.

~ h.  Local Privilege Escalation on Windows based platforms by
~     Hijacking VMware VMX configuration file

~     VMware uses a configuration file named "config.ini" which
~     is located in the application data directory of all users.
~     By manipulating this file, a user could gain elevated
~     privileges by hijacking the VMware VMX process.

~     VMware would like to thank Sun Bing for reporting the issue.

~     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
~     assigned the name CVE-2008-1363 to this issue.

~ i.  Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) memory corruption
~     resulting in denial of service

~     VMCI was introduced in VMware Workstation 6.0, VMware Player 2.0,
~     and VMware ACE 2.0.  It is an experimental, optional feature and
~     it may be possible to crash the host system by making specially
~     crafted calls to the VMCI interface.  This may result in denial
~     of service via memory exhaustion and memory corruption.

~     VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of
~     Defense for reporting this issue.

~     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
~     assigned the name CVE-2008-1340 to this issue.
