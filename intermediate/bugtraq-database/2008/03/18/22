Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 03.18.08: Multiple Vendor CUPS CGI Heap
 Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.18.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 18, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

The Common UNIX Printing System, more commonly referred to as CUPS,
provides a standard printer interface for various Unix based operating
systems. For more information, visit the vendor's website at the
following URL.

http://www.cups.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap based buffer overflow vulnerability in
CUPS, as included in various vendors' operating system distributions,
could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the affected service.

CUPS listens on TCP port 631 for requests. This interface provides
access to several CGI applications used to administer CUPS and provide
information about print jobs. By passing a specially crafted request,
an attacker can trigger a heap based buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the affected service. Depending on the
underlying operating system and distribution, CUPS may run as the lp,
daemon, or a different user.

In order to exploit this vulnerability remotely, the targeted host must
be sharing a printer(s) on the network. If a printer is not being
shared, where CUPS only listens on the local interface, this
vulnerability could only be used to elevate privileges locally.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in CUPS
version 1.3.5. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling printer sharing will prevent this vulnerability from being
exploited remotely. However, local users will still be able to obtain
the privileges of the CUPS service user.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Apple Inc. has addressed this vulnerability within Security Update
