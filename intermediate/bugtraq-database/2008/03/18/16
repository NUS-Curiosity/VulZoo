Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in PCRE, allowing
for the execution of arbitrary code and Denial of Service.

Background
==========

PCRE is a Perl-compatible regular expression library. GLib includes a
copy of PCRE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/libpcre      < 7.6-r1                          >= 7.6-r1
  2  dev-libs/glib         < 2.14.6                          >= 2.14.6
                                                              < 2.14.0
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

PCRE contains a buffer overflow vulnerability when processing a
character class containing a very large number of characters with
codepoints greater than 255.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
specially crafted regular expression to an application making use of
the PCRE library, which could possibly lead to the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PCRE users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libpcre-7.6-r1"

All GLib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/glib-2.14.6"
