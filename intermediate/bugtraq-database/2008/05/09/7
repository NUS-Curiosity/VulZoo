Synopsis
========

Firebird allows remote connections to the administrative account
without verifying credentials.

Background
==========

Firebird is a multi-platform, open source relational database.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /      Vulnerable      /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/firebird     < 2.0.3.12981.0-r6        >= 2.0.3.12981.0-r6

Description
===========

Viesturs reported that the default configuration for Gentoo's init
script ("/etc/conf.d/firebird") sets the "ISC_PASSWORD" environment
variable when starting Firebird. It will be used when no password is
supplied by a client connecting as the "SYSDBA" user.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can authenticate as the "SYSDBA" user without
providing the credentials, resulting in complete disclosure of all
databases except for the user and password database (security2.fdb).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Firebird users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=dev-db/firebird-2.0.3.12981.0-r6"

Note: /etc/conf.d is protected by Portage as a configuration directory.
Do not forget to use "etc-update" or "dispatch-conf" to overwrite the
"firebird" configuration file, and then restart Firebird.
