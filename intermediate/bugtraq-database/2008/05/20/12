Title: CA ARCserve Backup caloggerd and xdr Functions 
Vulnerabilities


CA Advisory Date: 2008-05-19


Reported By: An anonymous researcher working with the iDefense VCP
             Damian Put working with ZDI/TippingPoint


Impact: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service or execute 
arbitrary code.


Summary: CA ARCserve Backup contains multiple vulnerabilities that 
can allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service or 
execute arbitrary code. CA has issued patches to address the 
vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability, CVE-2008-2241, is due to 
insufficient path verification by the logging service, caloggerd. 
An attacker can append data to arbitrary files, which can lead to 
system compromise. The second vulnerability, CVE-2008-2242, is due 
to insufficient bounds checking by multiple xdr functions. An 
attacker can cause an overflow and execute arbitrary code.


Mitigating Factors: These issues affect only the server 
installation.


Severity: CA has given these vulnerabilities a maximum risk rating 
of High.

How to determine if you are affected:

For Windows:

   1. Using Windows Explorer, locate the file "caloggerd.exe". By 
      default, the file is located in the 
      "C:\Program Files\CA\BrightStor ARCserve Backup" directory.

   2. Right click on the file and select Properties.

   3. Select the General tab.

   4. If the file timestamp is earlier than indicated in the below 
      table, the installation is vulnerable.

Product Version  File Name      Timestamp            File Size
11.5             caloggerd.exe  05/18/2007 10:55:48  299008 bytes
11.1             caloggerd.exe  05/18/2007 11:30:52  286720 bytes

* For Protection Suites r2 , use the file timestamp for CA 
ARCserve Backup r11.5.


For Linux/x86/IA-64/x86_64, Tru64, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux/s390:

Examine the file RELVERSION to determine the version. This can be 
done with the following command from a shell:

cat $BAB_HOME/data/RELVERSION

If the build number is below 2427, the installation is vulnerable.
