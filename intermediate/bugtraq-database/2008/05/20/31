Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV may result in the remote execution
of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus is a free anti-virus toolkit for UNIX, designed
especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav       < 0.93                         >= 0.93

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Damian Put reported a heap-based buffer overflow when processing
  PeSpin packed PE binaries (CVE-2008-0314).

* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a buffer overflow in the
  cli_scanpe() function when processing Upack PE binaries
  (CVE-2008-1100).

* Hanno Boeck reported an infinite loop when processing ARJ archives
  (CVE-2008-1387).

* Damian Put and Thomas Pollet reported a heap-based buffer overflow
  when processing WWPack compressed PE binaries (CVE-2008-1833).

* A buffer over-read was discovered in the rfc2231() function when
  producing a string that is not NULL terminated (CVE-2008-1836).

* An unspecified vulnerability leading to "memory problems" when
  scanning RAR files was reported (CVE-2008-1837).

* Thierry Zoller reported that scanning of RAR files could be
  circumvented (CVE-2008-1835).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to scan a
specially crafted file, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running ClamAV (either a system
user or the "clamav" user if clamd is compromised), or a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.93"
