Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 05.07.08: Multiple Vendor rdesktop channel_process()
 Integer Signedness Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 05.07.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 07, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

rdesktop is an open source client that speaks the Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP). This allows Unix-based users to login to Windows
Terminal Servers. More information is available at the following URL.

http://www.rdesktop.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer signedness vulnerability in rdesktop,
as included in various vendors' operating system distributions, allows
attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
logged-in user.

The vulnerability exists within the code responsible for reallocating
dynamic buffers. The rdesktop xrealloc() function uses a signed
comparison to determine if the requested allocation size is less than
1. When this occurs, the function will incorrectly set the allocation
size to be 1. This results in an improperly sized heap buffer being
allocated, which can later be overflowed.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the logged in user. In order to exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker must persuade a targeted user to connect to a
malicious RDP server.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in rdesktop
version 1.5.0. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The rdesktop maintainer has addressed this vulnerability with CVS
revision 1.162 of rdesktop.c. For more information, visit the following
