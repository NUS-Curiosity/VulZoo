Details
=======

CiscoWorks Common Services represents a common set of management
services that are shared by CiscoWorks applications. CiscoWorks is a
family of products based on Internet standards for managing networks
and devices. Many CiscoWorks products use and depend on Common
Services.

CiscoWorks Common Services contains a vulnerability that could allow
a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is
documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsm77245, and has been assigned the
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2008-2054.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

* CSCsm77245 - CiscoWorks URL Misbehavior

CVSS Base Score - 9.3
   Access Vector -             Network
   Access Complexity -         Medium
   Authentication -            None
   Confidentiality Impact -    Complete
   Integrity Impact -          Complete
   Availability Impact -       Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 7.7
   Exploitability -            Functional
   Remediation Level -         Official-Fix
   Report Confidence -         Confirmed

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user client machine.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

This vulnerability has been corrected in CiscoWorks Common Services
version 3.2 and in the following software patches:

cwcs3.x-sol-CSCsm77245-0.tar.gz - for Solaris versions

cwcs3.x-win-CSCsm77245-0.zip - for Windows versions

The CiscoWorks Common Services patches can be downloaded from:

http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/cw2000-cd-one

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

Filters such as Transit ACLs (tACLs) can be used to allow access to
the Administration Workstation from only trusted hosts.

Filters that deny HTTP packets using HTTPS packets using TCP port 443
and TCP port 1741 should be deployed throughout the network as part
of a tACL policy to protect the network from traffic that enters the
network at ingress access points. This policy should be configured to
protect the network device where the filter is applied and other
devices that are behind it. Filters for HTTPS packets that use TCP
port 443 and TCP port 1741 should also be deployed in front of
vulnerable network devices so only traffic from trusted clients is
allowed.

Note: Additional information about tACLs is available in "Transit
Access Control Lists: Filtering at Your Edge":

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_warranties_item09186a008088e31f.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml
for additional TAC contact information, including localized telephone
numbers, and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various
languages.
