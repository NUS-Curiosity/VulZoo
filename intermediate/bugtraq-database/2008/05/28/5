The descriptions are below - for CVE-2008-2006, we merged on the rough
criteria of "insufficient validation of a length field".

CVE-2008-2006 intentionally corresponds to both.

I am not sure where CORE got CVE-2008-1035 from - that number was part of
a pool of numbers that were allocated to Apple, for them to assign
to issues in Apple products (this makes them effectively a CNA; see
http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html for more info).

CORE obtained CVE-2008-2006 and CVE-2008-2007 directly from MITRE.  It's
most likely that during CORE's collaboration with Apple, Apple might have
given them CVE-2008-1035 from Apple's own pool, to cover one or more of
those issues.  This type of "reservation duplicate" happens periodically
when both researcher/coordinator and vendor use CVEs.  BUT - this is just
a guess, either CORE or Apple would need to provide a more concrete
answer.  We are currently keeping CVE-2008-1035 blank until there's more
clarity.

Apple iCal 3.0.1 on Mac OS X allows remote CalDAV servers, and
user-assisted remote attackers, to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via a .ics file containing (1) a large 16-bit integer
on a TRIGGER line, or (2) a large integer in a COUNT field on an RRULE
line.  NOTE: this might be a duplicate of CVE-2008-1035.

Apple iCal 3.0.1 on Mac OS X allows remote CalDAV servers, and
user-assisted remote attackers, to trigger memory corruption or
possibly execute arbitrary code via an "ATTACH;VALUE=URI:S=osumi" line
in a .ics file, which triggers a "resource liberation" bug.
