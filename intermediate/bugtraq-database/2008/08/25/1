4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a security issue in Novell iPrint 
Client, which can be exploited by malicious people to gain knowledge 
of potentially sensitive information.

The insecure "GetFileList()" method returns a list of images (".jpg",
".jpeg", ".gif", and ".bmp") in a directory specified as argument to
the method. This can be exploited to gain knowledge of any image file
names in arbitrary directories on a user's system, including e.g. the
user's "My Pictures" / "Pictures" folder without knowledge of the
user's username.
