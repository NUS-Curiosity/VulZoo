====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in Interact, which
can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site request
forgery and SQL injection attacks.

1) Input passed to the "email_user_key" parameter in 
spaces/emailuser.php is not properly sanitised before being used in 
SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by 
injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows e.g. retrieval of
super administrator usernames and password hashes, but requires
knowledge of the database table prefix.

2) The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP
requests without performing any validity checks to verify the request.
This can be exploited to e.g. add new super administrator users by
enticing a logged-in super administrator to visit a malicious web 
page.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution

Apply the vendor's official patch for vulnerability #1:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2208205&
group_id=69681&atid=525406
