Subject: Re: php create_function commond injection vulnerability


There are two main takeaways from this advisory:

1) PHP application programmers can and will misuse this function
   (CVE-2008-4096, CVE-2007-5423), but most PHP code auditors probably
   don't check for it yet.  So it's good for awareness.

2) Any language that has an equivalent capability for creating
   anonymous functions will probably have application programmers that
   abuse it.
