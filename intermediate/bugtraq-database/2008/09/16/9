Team SHATTER Security Advisory

*Buffer overrun in XMLQUERY and XMLEXISTS*

September 15th 2008

Risk Level:
High

Affected versions:
IBM DB2 Database Server v9.1 and 9.5 on Windows platform.

Remote exploitable:
Yes (Authentication to Database Server is needed)

Credits:
These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Ariel Sanchez
of Application Security Inc.

Details:
The XMLQUERY and XMLEXISTS functions are vulnerable to a stack based
buffer overflow by passing an overly long parameter. The XMLQUERY and
XMLEXISTS functions are installed by default.

Impact:
Any low privileged user can exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a
denial of service or to run arbitrary code. On Windows systems, the
attacker may take complete control of the affected system because DB2
service runs under an administrative account.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Fix:
To fix the problem apply the FP5(v9.1)and FP1(v9.5):
