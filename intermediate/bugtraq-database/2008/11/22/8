Description:
    Previous versions of the httpd package contain multiple vulnerabilities:
    mod_proxy_http is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack, and
    mod_proxy_ftp contains a weakness that enables a cross-site-scripting
    (XSS) attack.
    
    In their default configurations, rPath Linux 1 and rPath Appliance
    Platform Linux Service 1 are not vulnerable to these attacks.
