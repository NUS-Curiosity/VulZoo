4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Adobe 
Acrobat/Reader, which can be exploited by malicious people to 
compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when parsing
format strings containing a floating point specifier in the
"util.printf()" Javascript function and can be exploited to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted PDF.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code when 
viewing a malicious PDF file.

======================================================================

The vendor will be releasing fixes later today.

NOTE: This was supposed to be a coordinated disclosure with Adobe, but
a third party has leaked the information.
