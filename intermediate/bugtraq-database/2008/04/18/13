Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified, the worst of which allow
arbitrary code execution on a user's system via a malicious Flash file.

Background
==========

The Adobe Flash Player is a renderer for the popular SWF file format,
which is commonly used to provide interactive websites, digital
experiences and mobile content.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /   Vulnerable   /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/netscape-flash      < 9.0.124.0              >= 9.0.124.0

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Flash:

* Secunia Research and Zero Day Initiative reported a boundary error
  related to DeclareFunction2 Actionscript tags in SWF files
  (CVE-2007-6019).

* The ISS X-Force and the Zero Day Initiative reported an unspecified
  input validation error that might lead to a buffer overflow
  (CVE-2007-0071).

* Microsoft, UBsecure and JPCERT/CC reported that cross-domain policy
  files are not checked before sending HTTP headers to another domain
  (CVE-2008-1654) and that it does not sufficiently restrict the
  interpretation and usage of cross-domain policy files
  (CVE-2007-6243).

* The Stanford University and Ernst and Young's Advanced Security
  Center reported that Flash does not pin DNS hostnames to a single IP
  addresses, allowing for DNS rebinding attacks (CVE-2007-5275,
  CVE-2008-1655).

* The Google Security Team and Minded Security Multiple reported
  multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities when passing input to
  Flash functions (CVE-2007-6637).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
(usually in a web browser), possibly leading to the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Adobe Flash
Player. The attacker could also cause a user's machine to send HTTP
requests to other hosts, establish TCP sessions with arbitrary hosts,
bypass the security sandbox model, or conduct Cross-Site Scripting and
Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=net-www/netscape-flash-9.0.124.0"
