Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.03.08: SCO UnixWare pkgadd Directory
 Traversal Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.03.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 03, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

SCO UnixWare is a UNIX operating system that runs on many OEM platforms.
The pkgadd command is used to install packages on the system. More
information about the product is available from the URL shown below.

http://www.sco.com/products/unixware714/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a directory traversal vulnerability within the
pkgadd program distributed with SCO Group Inc's UnixWare operating
system allows attackers to gain root privileges.

By setting an environment variable to a value containing directory
traversal sequences, such as "../", an attacker can cause the program
to create or append to arbitrary files on the system.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers gain root privileges. Access to execute
arbitrary shell commands is required to exploit this issue.

By targeting specific system files, an attacker can add accounts or
otherwise facilitate privilege escalation.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability within version
7.1.4 of UnixWare with all patches available as of August 27th, 2007
installed. Previous versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Changing the permissions of the pkgadd command to only allow root to
execute this program will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.

  # chmod 700 /usr/sbin/pkgadd

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
