Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in DBMail could allow for passwordless login to any
account under certain configurations.

Background
==========

DBMail is a mail storage and retrieval daemon that uses SQL databases
as its data store. IMAP and POP3 can be used to retrieve mails from the
database.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1  net-mail/dbmail       < 2.2.9                            >= 2.2.9

Description
===========

A vulnerability in DBMail's authldap module when used in conjunction
with an Active Directory server has been reported by vugluskr. When
passing a zero length password to the module, it tries to bind
anonymously to the LDAP server. If the LDAP server allows anonymous
binds, this bind succeeds and results in a successful authentication to
DBMail.

Impact
======

By passing an empty password string to the server, an attacker could be
able to log in to any account.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All DBMail users should upgrade to the latest version:

     # emerge --sync
     # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/dbmail-2.2.9"
