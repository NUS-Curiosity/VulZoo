Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package are vulnerable to a buffer
    overflow in the cifs and ip_nat_snmp_basic modules which can allow
    a remote denial of service or possible arbitrary code execution.
    
    In addition, support has been added for newer Intel 10Gb Ethernet
    adapters, and a bug which effects device ordering on certain Dell
    and HP systems has been resolved.
    
    A system reboot is required to resolve these issues.
