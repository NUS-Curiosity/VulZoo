4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in XnView, NConvert,
and GFL SDK, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise
a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when processing
the "format" keyword of Sun TAAC files. This can be exploited to
cause a stack-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into
viewing a specially crafted Sun TAAC file.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is confirmed in version 1.70 of XnView for Linux
and FreeBSD, XnView 1.93.6 for Windows, GFL SDK 2.82, and NConvert
4.92. Other versions may also be affected.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

XnView:
The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.94 beta1.

NConvert and GFL SDK:
A fixed version is not currently available. Do not open untrusted Sun
TAAC files.
