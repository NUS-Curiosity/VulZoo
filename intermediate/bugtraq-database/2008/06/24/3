Synopsis
========

Font parsing vulnerabilities in FreeType might lead to user-assisted
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

FreeType is a font rendering library for TrueType Font (TTF) and
Printer Font Binary (PFB).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/freetype       < 2.3.6                        >= 2.3.6

Description
===========

Regenrecht reported multiple vulnerabilities in FreeType via iDefense:

* An integer overflow when parsing values in the Private dictionary
  table in a PFB file, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2008-1806).

* An invalid free() call related to parsing an invalid "number of
  axes" field in a PFB file (CVE-2008-1807).

* Multiple off-by-one errors when parsing PBF and TTF files, leading
  to heap-based buffer overflows (CVE-2008-1808).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TTF
or PBF file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running an application linked against
FreeType (such as the X.org X server, running as root).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FreeType users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/freetype-2.3.6"
