Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in BitchX may allow for the remote execution
of arbitrary code or symlink attacks.

Background
==========

BitchX is an IRC client.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-irc/bitchx      <= 1.1-r4                         Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

bannedit reported a boundary error when handling overly long IRC MODE
messages (CVE-2007-4584). Nico Golde reported an insecure creation of a
temporary file within the e_hostname() function (CVE-2007-5839).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious IRC
server, resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. A local attacker could
perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary files on the local
machine.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Since BitchX is no longer maintained, we recommend that users unmerge
the vulnerable package and switch to another IRC client:

    # emerge --unmerge "net-irc/bitchx"
