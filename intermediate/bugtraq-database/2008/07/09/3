Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] iDefense Security Advisory 07.08.08: Microsoft SQL Server Restore Integer Underflow Vulnerability


Just to clarify, the following SQL Server vulnerabilities vulnerabilities:

SQL Server Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0106
SQL Server Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0107
Convert Buffer Overrun - CVE-2008-0086

 can be exploited to take complete control of the system on Windows 2003, 
it doesn't matter the user account under SQL Server service is running.

On Windows 2008 if the service is running under Network Service or Local Service account then full system compromise is always possible.
