    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2364

Description:
    Previous versions of the httpd package contain multiple vulnerabilities:
    mod_proxy_balancer is vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    attack in which a trusted user may be able to gain privileges, and
    mod_proxy_http is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.
    
    In its default configuration, rPath Linux 2 and rPath Appliance Platform
    Linux Service 2 are not vulnerable to these attacks.
