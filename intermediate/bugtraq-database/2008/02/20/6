Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 02.19.08: EMC RepliStor Multiple Heap
 Overflow Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 02.19.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 19, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

EMC RepliStor is a data backup and recovery application for Windows. For
more information, visit the vendor's website at the following URL.

http://software.emc.com/products/software_az/replistor.htm

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple heap overflow vulnerabilities in EMC
Corp.'s RepliStor could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute
arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

Multiple vulnerabilities exist within the code responsible for
compression. In each case, data is decompressed without consideration
for the size of the destination buffer. This results in an exploitable
heap overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the RepliStor Server or Control
Server, usually SYSTEM. In order to exploit these vulnerabilities, an
attacker needs to be able to connect to the targeted server on TCP port
7144 or 7145. No authentication is required to reach the vulnerable code
paths.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities in EMC
RepliStor version 6.2 SP2. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.
