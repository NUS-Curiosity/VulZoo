Synopsis
========

xine-lib is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows when processing
FLAC and ASF streams.

Background
==========

xine-lib is the core library package for the xine media player.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xine-lib     < 1.1.10.1                    >= 1.1.10.1

Description
===========

Damian Frizza and Alfredo Ortega (Core Security Technologies)
discovered a stack-based buffer overflow within the open_flac_file()
function in the file demux_flac.c when parsing tags within a FLAC file
(CVE-2008-0486). A buffer overflow when parsing ASF headers, which is
similar to CVE-2006-1664, has also been discovered.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to play specially crafted FLAC or
ASF video streams with a player using xine-lib, potentially resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the player.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.10.1"
