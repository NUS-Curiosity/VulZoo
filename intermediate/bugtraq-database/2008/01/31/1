Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in Xdg-Utils, allowing for the
remote execution of arbitrary commands.

Background
==========

Xdg-Utils is a set of tools allowing all applications to easily
integrate with the Free Desktop configuration.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-misc/xdg-utils     < 1.0.2-r1                     >= 1.0.2-r1

Description
===========

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that the "xdg-open" and "xdg-email" shell
scripts do not properly sanitize their input before processing it.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted link
with a vulnerable application using Xdg-Utils (e.g. an email client),
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Xdg-Utils users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-misc/xdg-utils-1.0.2-r1"
