Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in TikiWiki, some of them
having unknown impact.

Background
==========

TikiWiki is an open source content management system written in PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/tikiwiki       < 1.9.9                          >= 1.9.9

Description
===========

* Jesus Olmos Gonzalez from isecauditors reported insufficient
  sanitization of the "movies" parameter in file tiki-listmovies.php
  (CVE-2007-6528).

* Mesut Timur from H-Labs discovered that the input passed to the
  "area_name" parameter in file tiki-special_chars.php is not properly
  sanitised before being returned to the user (CVE-2007-6526).

* redflo reported multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in files
  tiki-edit_css.php, tiki-list_games.php, and
  tiki-g-admin_shared_source.php (CVE-2007-6529).

Impact
======

A remote attacker can craft the "movies" parameter to run a directory
traversal attack through a ".." sequence and read the first 1000 bytes
of any arbitrary file, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
through the "area_name" parameter. This attack can be exploited to
execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session,
allowing for the theft of browser session data or cookies in the
context of the affected web site. The impacts of the unspecified
vulnerabilities are still unknown.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All TikiWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/tikiwiki-1.9.9"
