Details
=======

The Cisco Wireless Control System is a centralized, systems-level
platform for managing and controlling lightweight access points,
wireless LAN controllers, and Wireless Location Appliances for the
Cisco Unified Wireless Network. The Cisco Wireless Control System uses
Apache Tomcat. A vulnerability in Apache Tomcat may allow for remote
code execution attacks. The mod_jk.so URI handler does not handle long
URLs correctly. An insecure memory copy triggers an exploitable stack
overflow. This vulnerability is documented in CVE-2007-0774 and in Cisco
bug ID CSCsk18191.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Each row of the following software table (below) describes a release
train and the platforms or products for which it is intended. If a
given release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible releases
that contain the fix are shown in the "First Fixed Release" column. A
device running a release in the given train that is earlier than the
release in a specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is
known to be vulnerable. The release should be upgraded at least to the
indicated release or a later version (greater than or equal to the
First Fixed Release label).

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Affected Releases                       | First Fixed       |
|                                         | Releases          |
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------|
| WCS for Linux and Windows 4.0.x and     | 4.0.100.0         |
| earlier                                 |                   |
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------|
| WCS for Linux and Windows 4.1.91.0 and  | 4.2.62.0          |
| earlier                                 |                   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory, and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

The following workarounds can be implemented.

Transit ACLs (tACL)
+------------------

Filters that deny HTTPS packets using TCP port 443 should be deployed
throughout the network as part of a tACL policy for protection of
traffic which enters the network at ingress access points. This policy
should be configured to protect the network device where the filter is
applied and other devices behind it. Filters for HTTPS packets using
TCP port 443 should also be deployed in front of vulnerable network
devices so that traffic is only allowed from trusted clients.

Additional information about tACLs is available in "Transit Access
Control Lists: Filtering at Your Edge":

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml

Additional Mitigation Techniques
+-------------------------------

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco devices
within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence
companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20080130-wcs.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be
bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_warranties_item09186a008088e31f.html, 
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for software
upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreements with third-party support organizations, such as
Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for guidance and assistance with the
appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their
point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows:

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
