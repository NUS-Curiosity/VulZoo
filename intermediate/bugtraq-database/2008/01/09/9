Synopsis
========

unp allows execution of arbitrary code via malicious file names.

Background
==========

unp is a script for unpacking various file formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/unp      < 1.0.14                              >= 1.0.14

Description
===========

Erich Schubert from Debian discovered that unp does not escape file
names properly before passing them to calls of the shell.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to unpack a
compressed archive with a specially crafted file name, leading to the
execution of shell commands from within the filename. That code will be
executed with the privileges of the user running unp.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All unp users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/unp-1.0.14"
