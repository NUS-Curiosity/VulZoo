- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses font names
embedded within an atom. When parsing the font name, the application
will treat a length from the file as a signed value when copying font
data into a buffer. Due to an unsigned promotion, this can be used to
write outside the bounds of a buffer which can lead to code execution
under the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
