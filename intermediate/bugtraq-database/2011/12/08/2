ZDI-11-341 : Cisco WebEx Player WRF Type 0 Parsing Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-341
December  7, 2011

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3319

- -- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:

Cisco



- -- Affected Products:

Cisco WebEx



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Cisco WebEx Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within atdl2006.dll. The vulnerability is
caused by lack of validation when parsing WRF files. A specially crafted
WRF file will cause the application to incorrectly push a size value to
a memcpy, allowing for corruption of heap memory. An attacker can
leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the target
system under the context of the current user.

- -- Vendor Response:

Cisco has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
