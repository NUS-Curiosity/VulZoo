Package        : curl
Vulnerability  : improper delegation of client credentials
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2192 
Debian Bug     : #631615

Richard Silverman discovered that when doing GSSAPI authentication, libcurl
unconditionally performs credential delegation. This hands the server a copy of
the client's security credentials, allowing the server to impersonate the
client to any other using the same GSSAPI mechanism.
This is obviously a very sensitive operation, which should only be done when
the user explicitly so directs.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
