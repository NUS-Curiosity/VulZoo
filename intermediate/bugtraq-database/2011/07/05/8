The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape
package only provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
