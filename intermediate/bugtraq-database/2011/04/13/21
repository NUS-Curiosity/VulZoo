-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office PowerPoint. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application handles an exception
within the PersistDirectoryEntry records when loading a presentation.
When an entry points to a container containing a Slide with a malformed
record, the application will raise an exception during the loading of
the record. Afterward the application will use a method off of this
malformed object which can lead to code execution under the context of
the application.
