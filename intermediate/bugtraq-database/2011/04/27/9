Subject: [USN-1124-1] rsync vulnerability

==========================================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1124-1
April 27, 2011

rsync vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 9.10

Summary:

rsync could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it connected
to a malicious server.

Software Description:
- rsync: fast remote file copy program (like rcp)

Details:

It was discovered that rsync incorrectly handled memory when certain
recursion, deletion and ownership options were used. If a user were tricked
into connecting to a malicious server, a remote attacker could cause a
denial of service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user
invoking the program.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 10.10:
  rsync                           3.0.7-2ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  rsync                           3.0.7-1ubuntu1.1

Ubuntu 9.10:
  rsync                           3.0.6-1ubuntu1.1

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
