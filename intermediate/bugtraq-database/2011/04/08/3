Package        : tmux
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: yes
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1496
Debian bug     : 620304

Daniel Danner discovered that tmux, a terminal multiplexer, is not
properly dropping group privileges.  Due to a patch introduced by Debian,
when invoked with the -S option, tmux is not dropping permissions obtained
through its setgid installation.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem,
it does not include tmux.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-6.

For the testing distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your tmux packages.
