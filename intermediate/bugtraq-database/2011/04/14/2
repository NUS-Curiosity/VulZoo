-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of CA Total Defense Endpoint. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within CA.Itm.Server.ManagementWS.dll. Due to a
failure to properly sanitize user-controlled input, it is possible for a
remote unauthenticated attacker to upload and subsequently execute
arbitrary code under the context of the CA Total Defense Heartbeat Web
service. Requests delivered to FileUploadHandler.ashx are subject to
arbitrary file writes, including directory traversal attacks, in the
GUID parameter. The Heartbeat Web service listens for HTTP requests on
port 8008 and 44344 for HTTPS. 

-- Vendor Response:
CA has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
