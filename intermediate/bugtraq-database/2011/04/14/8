CA20110413-01: Security Notice for CA Total Defense

Issued: April 13, 2011

CA Technologies support is alerting customers to security risks with
CA Total Defense. Multiple vulnerabilities exist that can allow a
remote attacker to possibly execute arbitrary code. CA issued an
automatic update to address the vulnerabilities.

The first set of vulnerabilities, CVE-2011-1653, are due to
insufficient handling of certain request parameters. A remote
attacker can use various SQL injection attacks to potentially
compromise the Unified Network Control (UNC) Server.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2011-1654, occurs due to insufficient
handling of file upload parameters. A remote attacker can upload a
file and use it to execute arbitrary code on the Total Defense
Management Server.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2011-1655, is due to insufficient
protection of sensitive information. A remote attack can acquire
account credentials and take privileged action on the Unified Network
Control (UNC) Server.
