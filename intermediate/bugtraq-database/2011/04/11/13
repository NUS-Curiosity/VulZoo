ZDI-11-118: Novell ZENworks Asset Management Path Traversal File Overwrite Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-118

April 11, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-4229

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Novell

-- Affected Products:
Novell Zenworks

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell ZENworks Asset Management.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within a servlet provided within the Novell
Zenworks distribution for uploading files. When processing the path name
for the file, the servlet will allow a user to inject path traversal
entities into the filename. Then, when the servlet downloads the
provided file, the destination will store it to the user-provided
location. This can lead to code execution under the context of the
service.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
