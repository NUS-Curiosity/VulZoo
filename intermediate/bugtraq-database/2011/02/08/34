ZDI-11-064: Microsoft Windows WmiTraceMessageVa Local Kernel Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-064

February 8, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0045

-- CVSS:
6.8, (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Windows XP

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code from
the context of kernelspace on vulnerable installations of Microsoft
Windows. The ability to make a system call is required in order to
exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the kernel's support for Trace Events.
Due to a bad type conversion, the kernel will use a truncated length for
allocating data from userspace. When populating this buffer the kernel
will use a differing length causing a buffer overflow. This will cause
memory corruption and can lead to code execution under the context of
the kernel.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
