-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Reader. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the application's implementation of an
image format supported by the Universal 3D compressed file format. When
parsing a particular texture file specified  by the format, the
application will explicitly trust fields within the file in a multiply
used to allocate space for the image data. Due to the application not
accommodating for the result being larger than the architecture is able
to store, the application will under allocate a buffer. When writing
image data to this buffer the application will write outside the
boundary of the allocation. This can lead to code execution under the
context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
