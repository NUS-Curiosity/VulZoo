TPTI-11-02: Adobe Shockwave TextXtra Invalid Seek Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-11-02

February 8, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0555

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing a DEMX
RIFF chunk within Director files. The logic within the TextXtra.x32
module fails to account for a specific condition and can be made to
misallocate a buffer on the heap. By crafting specific values within
DEMX substructures an attacker can corrupt memory leading to arbitrary
code execution under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
