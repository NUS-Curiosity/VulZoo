Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 02.08.11: Adobe Flash Player ActionScript
 Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.08.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 08, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Flash Player is an application for viewing animations and movies
using computer programs such as a Web browser; in common usage, Flash
lets you put animation and movies on a website. Flash Player runs SWF
files that can be created by the Adobe Flash authoring tool, by Adobe
Flex or by a number of other Macromedia and third party tools. For more
information, please visit following website:

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in Adobe
Systems Inc.'s Flash Player could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs when parsing a maliciously formatted sequence
of ActionScript code inside of an Adobe Flash file. The problem exists
in a certain ActionScript method. When the method is called with
particular parameters, the ActionScript engine gets confused and takes
a user supplied value as an object pointer which leads to an
exploitable condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the Web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Web page
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted
sites. After the user visits the malicious Web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the Flash
Plugin version 10.1.82.76 and 10.1.85.3. A full list of vulnerable
Adobe products can be found in Adobe Security Bulletin APSB11-02.

V. WORKAROUND

which are usually under C:\WINDOWS\system32\Macromed\Flash\ folder
