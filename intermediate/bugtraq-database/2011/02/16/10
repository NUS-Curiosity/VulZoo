Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


CVE-2011-0777

  Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via vectors related to image loading


CVE-2011-0778

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 does not properly restrict drag and drop
  operations, which might allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin
  Policy via unspecified vectors


CVE-2011-0783

  Unspecified vulnerability in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 allows
  user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (application crash) via vectors involving a "bad volume setting."


CVE-2011-0983

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly handle anonymous blocks,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
  unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a "stale pointer."


CVE-2011-0981

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly perform event handling for
  animations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or 
  possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a
  "stale pointer."

  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)
  via unspecified vectors


CVE-2011-0985

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly perform process termination
  upon memory exhaustion, which has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors.
