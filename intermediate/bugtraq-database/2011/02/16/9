February 15, 2011

10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Oracle Java Runtime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw is due to insufficient defenses against system
clipboard hijacking. When in focus, a handle to the system clipboard can
be retrieved without user interaction by a malicious component. The
clipboard can then be arbitrarily read from or written to. By writing a
TransferableProxy object to the system clipboard and then forcing a
paste action, arbitrary code can be executed under the context of the
user invoking the JRE.

-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
