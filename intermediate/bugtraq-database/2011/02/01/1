-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Performance Insight
Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific vulnerability is due to a hidden account present within the
com.trinagy.security.XMLUserManager Java class. Using this account a
malicious user can access the com.trinagy.servlet.HelpManagerServlet
class. This is defined within the piweb.jar file installed with
Performance Insight. This class exposes a doPost() method which an
attacker can use to upload malicious files to the server. Accessing
these files can then lead to arbitrary code execution under the context
of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
