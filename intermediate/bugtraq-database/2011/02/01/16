Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Cisco WebEx Player Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110201-webex

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 February 1 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WebEx
Recording Format (WRF) and Advanced Recording Format (ARF) Players.
In some cases, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system of a targeted
user.

The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back
WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on the computer of
an on-line meeting attendee. The players can be automatically
installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a
WebEx server. The player can also be manually installed for offline
playback after downloading the application from www.webex.com

If the WebEx recording player was automatically installed, it will be
automatically upgraded to the latest, non-vulnerable version when
users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server. If
the WebEx recording player was manually installed, users will need to
manually install a new version of the player after downloading the
latest version from www.webex.com 

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110201-webex.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx
recording players. Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux
versions of the player are all affected. Affected versions of the
players are those prior to client builds T27LC SP22 and T27LB SP21
EP3. Customers who have contractual agreements that prevent WebEx
from automatically upgrading a recording player to the latest version
should contact their account manager to determine upgrade options.

To determine whether a Cisco WebEx server is running an affected
version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco
WebEx server and go to the Support > Downloads section. The version
of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the
page under "About Support Center." See "Software Versions and Fixes"
for details.

Cisco recommends that users upgrade to the most current version of
the player that is available from www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html


Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The WebEx meeting service is a hosted multimedia conferencing
solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The WRF and
ARF file formats are used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have
been recorded on the computer of an on-line meeting attendee. The
players are applications that are used to play back and edit
recording files (files with .wrf and .arf extensions). The recording
players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a
recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server (for stream playback
mode). The recording players can also be manually installed after
downloading the application from www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html
to play back recording files locally (for offline
playback mode).

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the WRF and ARF
players. The vulnerabilities may lead to a crash of the player
application or, in some cases, remote code execution could occur.

To exploit one of these vulnerabilities, the player application would
need to open a malicious WRF or ARF file. An attacker may be able to
accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file
directly to users (for example, by using e-mail) or by directing a
user to a malicious web page. The vulnerability cannot be triggered
by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.

These vulnerabilities have been assigned the following Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers:

  * CVE-2010-3269
  * CVE-2010-3041
  * CVE-2010-3042
  * CVE-2010-3043
  * CVE-2010-3044

Vulnerability Scoring Details

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html


Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss 

* Multiple Cisco WebEx Player Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

CVSS Base Score - 9.3

    Report Confidence -        Confirmed


Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities described in this
document could result in a crash of the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or WRF
Player application and, in some cases, allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the user
who is running the recording player application.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a
complete upgrade solution.

These vulnerabilities are first fixed in T27LC SP22 and T27LB SP21
EP3. For customers who are running T27LC SP22, the client build will
be represented as 27.22SP.0.9253. The fix for customers who are
running T27LB SP21 will be deployed by WebEx over the next few weeks.
The client build will be determined after the software is deployed.

The client build is listed in the Support > Downloads section of the
WebEx page after a user authenticates. WebEx bug fixes are cumulative
in a major release. For example, if release 27.22SP.0 is fixed,
release 27.22SP.1 will also have the software fix.

If a recording player was automatically installed, it will be
automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when
users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server.

If a WebEx recording player was manually installed, users will need
to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the
latest version from www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities disclosed in this
advisory.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================
