+-----------------------------------------+

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch devices running an affected
version of software are affected.

To determine the current version of software running on the Cisco 
TelePresence Multipoint Switch, SSH into the device and issue the
show version active and the show version inactive commands. The 
output should resemble the following example:

    admin: show version active
    Active Master Version: 1.7.0.0-471


    Active Version Installed Software Options:
    No Installed Software Options Found.

    admin: show version inactive
    Inactive Master Version: 1.6.1.0-336

    Inactive Version Installed Software Options:
    No Installed Software Options Found.

In the preceding example, the system has versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.0
loaded on the device and version 1.7.0 is currently active. A device
is only affected by vulnerabilities in the active software version.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities

Details
=======

The Cisco TelePresence solution allows for immersive, in-person
communication and collaboration over the network with colleagues,
prospects, and partners even when they are located in opposite
hemispheres.

This security advisory describes multiple, distinct vulnerabilities
in the Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch. These vulnerabilities
are independent of each other.

Unauthenticated Java Servlet Access
+----------------------------------

A number of sensitive Java Servlets delivered via a Java Servlet
framework in the Cisco Telepresence Multipoint Switch could allow a
remote, unauthenticated attacker to perform actions that should be
restricted to administrative users only. The attacker would need the
ability to submit a crafted request to an affected device on TCP port
80, 443, or 8080.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit these vulnerabilities.

  * CTMS - CSCtf42008 ( registered customers only) has been assigned
    the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0383.
  * CTMS - CSCtf01253 ( registered customers only) has been assigned
    the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0384.

Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
+------------------------------------

An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in the administrative
web interface of the Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch. An
unauthenticated, remote attacker could submit a crafted request to an
affected device that would allow for the placement of
attacker-controlled content in arbitrary locations on the device. The
attacker would need the ability to submit a crafted request to an
affected device on TCP port 80 or 443.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * CTMS - CSCth61065 ( registered customers only) has been assigned
    the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0385.

Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution
+---------------------------------------------

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Cisco TelePresence
Multipoint Switch devices. An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
could exploit the vulnerability by submitting a malicious Cisco
Discovery Protocol packet to the affected system. When parsed, the
malicious packet may trigger a buffer overflow.

Because Cisco Discovery Protocol works at the data link layer (Layer
2), an attacker must have a way to submit an Ethernet frame directly
to an affected device. This may be possible in situations where the
affected system is part of a bridged network or connected to a
nonpartitioned device such as a network hub.

  * CTMS - CSCtd75766 ( registered customers only) has been assigned
    the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0379.

Unauthorized Servlet Access
+--------------------------

An unauthorized servlet access issue exists in the administrative web
interface of Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch devices. This issue
could allow a remote, authenticated attacker with unprivileged access
to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The
attacker would need the ability to submit a crafted request to an
affected device on TCP port 80 or 443.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * CTMS - CSCtf97164 ( registered customers only) has been assigned
    the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0387.

Java RMI Denial of Service
+-------------------------
A denial of service vulnerability exists in Cisco TelePresence
Multipoint Switch devices due to a failure to properly restrict
access to the RMI interface of the Java Servlet framework. An
unauthenticated, remote attacker could trigger an out-of-memory
condition on the servlet host by issuing a series of crafted
requests. The attacker would need the ability to communicate to an
affected device on TCP port 8999.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * CTMS - CSCtg35825 ( registered customers only) has been assigned
    the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0388.

Real-Time Transport Control Protocol Denial of Service
+-----------------------------------------------------

A Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) denial of service
vulnerability exists within Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch
devices. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could send a malicious
RTCP packet to a listening RTCP control port to crash the call
control process. The attacker would need to have the ability to
communicate to an affected device on a UDP port that was randomly
selected and negotiated during call setup.

Because the vulnerability is within a UDP-based service, the attacker
would not be required to perform a handshake prior to making the
crafted request. This could allow the attacker to spoof the source
address of an attack.

  * CTMS - CSCth60993 ( registered customers only) has been assigned
    the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0389.

XML-RPC Denial of Service
+------------------------

An XML-RPC denial of service vulnerability exists in Cisco
TelePresence Multipoint Switch devices. A remote, unauthenticated
attacker could send a malicious request to an affected device to
trigger a crash of the call geometry process. The attacker would need
the ability to communicate to an affected device on TCP port 9000.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * CTMS - CSCtj44534 ( registered customers only) has been assigned
    the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0390.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------
