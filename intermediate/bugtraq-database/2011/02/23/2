Several vulnerabilties have been discovered in phpCAS, a CAS client 
library for PHP. The Moodle course management system includes a copy
of phpCAS.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.13-3.

The stable distribution (squeeze) already contains a fixed version of
phpCAS.

The unstable distribution (sid) already contains a fixed version of
phpCAS.

We recommend that you upgrade your moodle packages.
