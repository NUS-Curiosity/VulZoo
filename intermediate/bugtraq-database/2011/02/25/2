System

Issued: February 23, 2011
Updated: February 24, 2011


CA Technologies support is alerting customers to a security risk 
associated with CA Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS). A 
vulnerability exists that can allow a remote attacker to execute 
arbitrary code.  CA Technologies has issued patches to address the 
vulnerability.

The vulnerability, CVE-2011-1036, is due to insecure method 
implementation in the XMLSecDB ActiveX control that is utilized in CA
