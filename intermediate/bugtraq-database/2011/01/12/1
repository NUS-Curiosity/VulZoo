Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 01.10.11: HP Network Node Manager Command
 Injection Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.10.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jan 10, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

HP Network Node Manager Command Injection Vulnerability HP Network Node
Manager (NNM) is an application suite that is used to map out and
manage network topography. NNM runs on a variety of platforms,
including Linux and multiple versions of Windows. For more information,
see the vendor's site found at the following link:
http://www.openview.hp.com/products/nnm/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a command injection vulnerability in
Hewlett-Packard Development Co. LP (HP)'s Network Node Manager could
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of
the affected service. The vulnerability exists within CGI scripts
provided with the NNM HTTP Server. These scripts do not effectively
sanatize a particular parameter. It is possible for an attacker to
supply a parameter containing a specially crafted command line string.
The command line string will be executed on the affected NNM HTTP
Server.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
commands with the privileges of the affected service. On RedHat
Enterprise 4, the application is started as the user 'bin.' By default
no authentication is required.

IV. DETECTION

OpenView Network Node Manager versions 7.51 and 7.53 running on HP-UX,
Linux, Solaris, and Windows are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

By default the affected CGI scripts do not require a user to be
authenticated. Authentication can be enabled on the NNM HTTP Server.
For further details refer to the NNM "Managing your network" guide.
