Synopsis
========

The cache manager of OpenAFS contains several bugs resulting in remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

OpenAFS is a distributed file system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-fs/openafs       < 1.4.9                             >= 1.4.9

Description
===========

Two vulnerabilites were discovered:

* Simon Wilkinson discovered from a bug report by Toby Blake that the
  cache manager of OpenAFS contains a heap-based buffer overflow which
  is related to the use of the ERR_PTR macro (CVE-2009-1250).

* A pointer dereference bug when using XDR arrays was discovered by
  Simon Wilkinson, with assistance from Derrick Brashear and Jeffrey
  Altman. (CVE-2009-1251).

Impact
======

The vulnerabilites might allow remote unauthenticated attackers to
cause a Denial of Service (system crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenAFS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/openafs-1.4.9"
