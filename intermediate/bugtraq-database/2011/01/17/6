Synopsis
========

Tor is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow that may allow
arbitrary code execution.

Background
==========

Tor is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a
connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/tor     < 0.2.1.28                           >= 0.2.1.28

Description
===========

Tor contains a heap-based buffer overflow in the processing of user or
attacker supplied data. No additional information is available.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an
unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the Tor user, or to cause a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tor users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tor-0.2.1.28"
