Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : backward compatibility option for SSL/TLS insecure
                 renegotiation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-3555
Debian Bug     : 587037

DSA-2141-1 changed the behaviour of the openssl libraries in a server
environment to only allow SSL/TLS renegotiation for clients that
support the RFC5746 renegotiation extension. This update to apache2
adds the new SSLInsecureRenegotiation configuration option that allows
to restore support for insecure clients. More information can be found
in the file /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/NEWS.Debian.gz .

For the stable distribution (lenny), the compatibility option has been
included in version 2.2.9-10+lenny9.

In addition, apache2-mpm-itk has been rebuilt to work with the updated
apache2 packages. The new version number is 2.2.6-02-1+lenny4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), and the testing distribution
(squeeze), the compatibility option has been included since version
2.2.15-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 and apache2-mpm-itk
packages.
