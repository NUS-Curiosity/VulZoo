Security Advisory: MVSA-11-007 (http://www.ventuneac.net/security-advisories/MVSA-11-007)

CVE: CVE-2011-2088

Vendors: Apache Software Foundation, OpenSymphony

Products: Struts 2, XWork , WebWork 

Vulnerabilities: Java Class Path Information Disclosure

Risk: Medium

Attack Vector: From Remote

Authentication: Not Required

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-3579


Description

XWork before version 2.2.1 allows Java class path disclosure when non-existent method is requested

    * using <s:submit> tag with and Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) enabled.
    * using bang notation (actionclass!method.action) with Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) enabled

Apache Struts 2 and OpenSymphony WebWork frameworks are vulnerable to similar attacks. 

1. Using <s:submit> tag with Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) enabled.

a. Test case for Struts 2.2.1 with XWork 2.2.1

        http://test.app.net/home.action?user=&password=&action!login:cantLogin_1=some_value

    XWork generated error:

        some_path.action.LoginAction.cantLogin_1()

2. Using bang notation actionclass!method.action with Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) enabled

a. Test case for Struts 2.2.1 with XWork 2.2.1

        http://127.0.0.1:8088/struts2-showcase/token/tokenPrepare2!input1.action

    XWork generated error:

        org.apache.struts2.showcase.token.TokenAction.input1()

b. Test case for Struts 2.0.6 with XWork 2.0.1

        http://127.0.0.1:8088/struts2-showcase-2.0.6/token/tokenPrepare2!input1.action

    XWork generated error:

        java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: org.apache.struts2.showcase.token.TokenAction.input1()


Affected Versions

Multiple releases of Apache Struts 2 framework prior to 2.2.3 were found vulnerable to this vulnerability.

Other open source and commercial products using XWork framework could be vulnerable to similar attacks. 

WebWork framework released by OpenSymphony (http://opensymphony.org) was confirmed as vulnerable to the second attack described in this advisory.

Mitigation
    
It is recommended to upgrade to Apache Struts 2.2.3 released on 5th of May 2011, or to the latest available version.

Alternatively, it is recommended to implement a custom error page (eg. error_page.jsp) which either uses proper output encoding to display XWork generated errors or displays a generic error message. An example of Struts configuration (required in struts.xml file) is shown below:

�
<global-results>
  <result name="error">/error_page.jsp</result>
</global-results>
<global-exception-mappings>
  <exception-mapping exception="java.lang.Exception" result="error"/>
</global-exception-mappings>
