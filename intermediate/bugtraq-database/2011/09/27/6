4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Novell GroupWise,
which can be exploited by malicious users to cause a DoS (Denial of 
Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused by a boundary error in GroupWise Internet 
Agent (gwia.exe) within the HTTP interface (port 9850/tcp) when 
handling requests for certain .css resources. This can be exploited to 
cause a limited stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted, 
overly long request.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 8.02 Hot Patch 3.
