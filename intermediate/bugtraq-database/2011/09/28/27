Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco IOS devices running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS Software
are affected by two vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS IPS and Cisco IOS
Zone-Based Firewall. The two vulnerabilities are independent of each
other. Details to confirm affected configurations are provided below.

  * Memory leak in Cisco IOS Software

    A device that is configured for either Cisco IOS IPS or Cisco IOS
    Zone-Based Firewall (or both), may experience a memory leak under
    high rates of new session creation flows through the device.
    To determine if a device is configured with Cisco IOS IPS, log
    into the device and issue the "show ip ips interfaces" CLI command.
    If the output shows an IPS rule either in the inbound or outbound
    direction set, then the device is vulnerable. This example, shows
    a device with an IPS rule set on Interface Gigabit Ethernet 0/0
    in the inbound direction:

        Router#show ip ips interfaces
            Interface Configuration
              Interface GigabitEthernet0/0
                Inbound IPS rule is example_ips_rule
                Outgoing IPS rule is not set
        Router#

    A device that is not configured for Cisco IOS IPS will return a
    blank line. The following example shows a device on which Cisco
    IOS IPS is not configured:

        Router#show ip ips interfaces

        Router#

    To determine whether a device is configured with Zone-Based
    Firewall, log into the device and issue the "show zone security"
    CLI command. If the output shows a member interface under a zone
    name, then the device is vulnerable. This example, shows a device
    with Zone-Based Firewall rules configured on both
    GigabitEthernet0/0 and GigabitEthernet0/1

        Router#show zone security
        zone self
          Description: System defined zone


        zone inside
          Description: *** Inside Network ***
          Member Interfaces:
            GigabitEthernet0/0


        zone outside
          Description: *** Outside Network ***
          Member Interfaces:
            GigabitEthernet0/1


        Router#

    Note: The device is vulnerable if configured with Zone-Based
    Firewall, regardless of the type of packet inspection being
    performed.

  * Cisco IOS Software Denial of Service when processing specially
    crafted HTTP packets

    A device is vulnerable if configured under the following
    circumstances:

    - HTTP Layer 7 Application Control and Inspection and Cisco IOS
    IPS are enabled.
    - HTTP Layer 7 Application Control and Inspection with match
    request arg regex parameter on the HTTP class map. This
    configuration is affected regardless if Cisco IOS IPS is enabled
    or not.

    The device is not vulnerable under other configurations. A
    summary of different configurations and their affect by this
    vulnerability is provided below:

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of
C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

    Router> show version
    Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Details
=======

Firewalls are networking devices that control access to the network
assets of an organization. Firewalls are often positioned at the
entrance points of networks. Cisco IOS Software provides a set of
security features that allow the configuration of a simple or
elaborate firewall policy according to particular requirements.

Cisco IOS IPS is an inline, deep-packet inspection feature that
effectively mitigates a wide range of network attacks.

  * Memory leak in Cisco IOS Software

    Devices with affected configurations may observe a memory leak
    under high rates of new session creation flows through the
    device.

    Logs may indicate a message similar to " *CCE: CCE 7 tuple table
    entry to add not malloced." or "CCE: CCE 7 tuple table adding
    data to invalid hash entry." when the device experiences this
    memory leak.

    The output of show processes memory sorted will show an
    increasing amount of memory being held in the "Chunk Manager"
    process in the "Holding" column. The following example shows the
    output of the "show processes memory sorted" CLI command:

        Router#show processes memory sorted
        Processor Pool Total:  930768768 Used:   90497932 Free:  840270836
              I/O Pool Total:   12582912 Used:    6138704 Free:    6444208

         PID TTY  Allocated      Freed    Holding    Getbufs    Retbufs Process
           1   0  130499156   72333476   58304964          0          0 Chunk Manager

    For this particular vulnerability applying Zone-Based Policy
    Firewall denial of service protection does not protect against
    the memory leak due to Cisco bug ID CSCtq28732.

    This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCti79848 and
    has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
    CVE-2011-3273.

  * Cisco IOS Software Denial of Service when processing specially
    crafted HTTP packets

    Devices with affected configurations may hang or crash when
    processing a specially crafted HTTP packets.

    If the device supports and is configured with scheduler
    isr-watchdog then the device will reset and reload if the
    vulnerability is exploited, rather than just hang. For more
    information on the "scheduler isr-watchdog" command consult the
    Cisco IOS Configuration Fundamentals Command Reference at the
    following link:
    
    http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/fundamentals/command/reference/cf_r1.html#wp1079401

    This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCto68554 and has
    been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3281.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in:

  * Memory leak in Cisco IOS Software

    The device may run out of memory resulting in instability or the
    device crashing.

  * Cisco IOS Software Denial of Service when processing specially
    crafted HTTP packets

    The device may crash or hang. If the device hangs, it will have
    to be power cycled to recover. If the device supports and is
    configured with scheduler isr-watchdog then the device will reset
    and reload if the vulnerability is exploited.

    For more information on the "scheduler isr-watchdog" command

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
