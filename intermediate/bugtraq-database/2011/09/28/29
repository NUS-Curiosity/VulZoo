Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software IP Service Level
Agreement Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110928-ipsla

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 September 28 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Cisco IOS IP Service Level Agreement (IP SLA) feature contains a
denial of service (DoS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered
when malformed UDP packets are sent to a vulnerable device. The
vulnerable UDP port numbers depend on the device configuration.
Default ports are not used for the vulnerable UDP IP SLA operation or
for the UDP responder ports.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-ipsla.shtml.

Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories. Nine of the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that
correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as
well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities
in the September 2011 Bundled Publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual
Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable when
they are configured for IP SLA, either as responders or as
originators of vulnerable IP SLA operations.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco
product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the "show
version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco
IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by
"Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices
do not have the "show version" command or may provide different output.

The following example shows output from a device that runs a Cisco
IOS Software image:

    Router> show version
    Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

IP SLA is an embedded agent in Cisco IOS Software designed to measure
and monitor common network performance metrics like jitter, latency
(delay), and packet loss.

The vulnerability that is described in this document is triggered by
malformed UDP packets triggered by malformed IP SLA packets sent to
the vulnerable device and port. A vulnerable device can be an IP SLA
responder or the source device of a vulnerable IP SLA operation.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtk67073 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-3272.

Vulnerable IP SLA Responder Configurations
+-----------------------------------------

A device configured either as an IP SLA general responder or a
permanent IP SLA UDP responder is vulnerable.

The general responder processes IP SLA control protocol packets on
UDP port 1967 and then may dynamically open vulnerable UDP ports
according to the IP SLA operations requested using the control
protocol. The configuration for a general responder is as follows:

    ip sla responder

The IP SLA UDP permanent responder is also vulnerable. An example
configuration is as follows:

    ip sla responder udp-echo port 300

There is no default UDP port number for the UDP permanent responder

Alternatively, both the general responder and the permanent responder
can be identified with the "show ip sla responder" command. The general
responder is vulnerable when it has been enabled. The permanent
responder is vulnerable only when it has been enabled and the "udpEcho
Responder" is present. In the Following example, the general responder
is not vulnerable because it has not been enabled but the permanent
responder is vulnerable because it has been enabled with a UDP echo
responder:

    Router# show ip sla responder
            General IP SLA Responder on Control port 1967
    General IP SLA Responder is: Disabled

            Permanent Port IP SLA Responder
    Permanent Port IP SLA Responder is: Enabled

    udpEcho Responder: 
      IP Address             Port
      0.0.0.0                 300

Vulnerable IP SLA Source Device Configurations
+---------------------------------------------

An IP SLA source device is a Cisco IOS device that has at least one
IP SLA operation configured. To be vulnerable a probe originator
needs to have at least one scheduled probe that uses either of the
following IP SLA operations:

  * udp-jitter probe
  * udp-echo

A vulnerable IP SLA source device configuration includes all the
following commands:

  * An "ip sla" global configuration command to define an IP SLA
    operation

  * Either a "udp-echo" or a "udp-jitter" IP SLA configuration command

  * An "ip sla schedule" global configuration command that activates
    one of the probes that uses a vulnerable IP SLA operation

The following examples show a source device that is configured for IP
SLA UDP echo and UDP jitter probes:

    ip sla 201
     udp-echo 192.168.134.21 201
    ip sla schedule 201 start-time now

    ip sla 301
     udp-jitter 192.168.134.121 122
    ip sla schedule 301 start-time now

The destination UDP ports for the probes need to be configured. If
the source UDP port is not configured an available port number will
be used when the probe is started. A device that originates a
vulnerable operation will be vulnerable on the source UDP ports of
the probe and a responder will be vulnerable on the destination UDP
port used for the probe.

IP SLA probes can be configured using Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP). In that case, by default, the "show running
configuration" command will not include the IP SLA probe
configuration. The "show ip sla configuration" command can be used to
verify whether a probe has been configured either by the command line
or via SNMP.

    Router# show ip sla configuration | include operation
    Type of operation to perform: udp-jitter
    Type of operation to perform: udp-echo

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability, but there are
mitigations that can be deployed on a general IP SLA responder to
reduce the exposure to this vulnerability.

General IP SLA Responder Mitigation
+----------------------------------

For devices that are configured as general responders, a mitigation
is to restrict IP SLA control packets on UDP port 1967 that are
addressed to the vulnerable device to permit only trusted probe
originators to open UDP ports that could be exploited. This can be
accomplished using techniques such as Infrastructure Access list or
Control Plane Protection.

For devices configured as general responders, mitigation techniques
that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are
available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document
for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20110928-ipsla.shtml

IP SLA Permanent Responder Mitigation
+------------------------------------

For the permanent responder, the mitigation is to filter UDP packets
addressed to the configured UDP port of each permanent responder to
permit packets from the IP addresses of trusted devices.

IP SLA Source Devices Mitigation
+-------------------------------

For IP SLA source devices, a mitigation is to allow only UDP packets
from trusted devices (that is, devices that are the target of IP SLA
operations).

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
