Package        : iceape
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2372 CVE-2011-2995 CVE-2011-2998 CVE-2011-2999 
                 CVE-2011-3000 

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Iceape internet suite,
an unbranded version of Seamonkey:

CVE-2011-2372

   Mariusz Mlynski discovered that websites could open a download
   dialog - which has "open" as the default action -, while a user
   presses the ENTER key.

CVE-2011-2995

   Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary and Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes
   in the rendering engine, which could lead to the execution of
   arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2998

   Mark Kaplan discovered an integer underflow in the javascript
   engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2999

   Boris Zbarsky discovered that incorrect handling of the
   window.location object could lead to bypasses of the same-origin
   policy.

CVE-2011-3000

   Ian Graham discovered that multiple Location headers might lead to
   CRLF injection.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package
only provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-8. This update also marks the compromised DigiNotar
root certs as revoked rather then untrusted.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
