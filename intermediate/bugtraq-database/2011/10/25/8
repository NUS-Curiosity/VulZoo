Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in the X.Org X server might allow local
attackers to disclose information.

Background
==========

The X Window System is a graphical windowing system based on a
client/server model.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-base/xorg-server       < 1.10.4-r1              *>= 1.9.5-r1 
                                                         >= 1.10.4-r1 

Description
===========

vladz reported the following vulnerabilities in the X.Org X server:

* The X.Org X server follows symbolic links when trying to access the
  lock file for a X display, showing a predictable behavior depending
  on the file type of the link target (CVE-2011-4028).
* The X.Org X server lock file mechanism allows for a race condition to
  cause the X server to modify the file permissions of an arbitrary
  file to 0444 (CVE-2011-4029).

Impact
======

A local attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to disclose
information by making arbitrary files on a system world-readable or
gain information whether a specified file exists on the system and
whether it is a file, directory, or a named pipe.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All X.Org X Server 1.9 users should upgrade to the latest 1.9 version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-base/xorg-server-1.9.5-r1"

All X.Org X Server 1.10 users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-base/xorg-server-1.10.4-r1"
