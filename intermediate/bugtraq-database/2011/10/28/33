Package        : tor
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2768 CVE-2011-2769 

It has been discovered by "frosty_un" that a design flaw in Tor, an online
privacy tool, allows malicious relay servers to learn certain information
that they should not be able to learn. Specifically, a relay that a user
connects to directly could learn which other relays that user is 
connected to directly. In combination with other attacks, this issue 
can lead to deanonymizing the user.  The Common Vulnerabilities and 
Exposures project has assigned CVE-2011-2768 to this issue.

In addition to fixing the above mentioned issues, the updates to oldstable
and stable fix a number of less critical issues (CVE-2011-2769). Please 
see this posting from the Tor blog for more information:
https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02234-released-security-patches

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.31-1~lenny+1. Due to technical limitations in the Debian
archive scripts, the update cannot be released synchronously with the
packages for stable. It will be released shortly.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.31-1.

For the unstable and testing distributions, this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.34-1.

For the experimental distribution, this problem have has fixed in version
0.2.3.6-alpha-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.
