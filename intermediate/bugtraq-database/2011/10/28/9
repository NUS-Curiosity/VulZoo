-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within the nipplib.dll component. When handling the
exposed method GetDriverSettings the application assembles a string for
logging consisting of the hostname/port provided as a parameter. When
building this message the process will blindly copy user supplied data
into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit
this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
browser.

-- Vendor Response:

Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
