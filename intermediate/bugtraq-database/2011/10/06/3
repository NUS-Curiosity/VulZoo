Cisco Security Advisory: Directory Traversal Vulnerability in Cisco
Network Admission Control Manager

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20111005-nac

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 October 05 1600 UTC (GMT)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC) Manager contains a directory
traversal vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated attacker to
obtain system information.

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20111005-nac.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Only Cisco NAC Manager software versions 4.8.X are affected by this
vulnerability. Cisco NAC Manager software versions 4.7.X and earlier
are not affected.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The Cisco NAC Server (Appliance) is not affected. The Cisco Identity
Services Engine (ISE) is not affected. No other Cisco products are
currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco NAC (formerly Cisco Clean Access) solution allows network
administrators to authenticate, authorize, evaluate, and remediate
wired, wireless, and remote users and their machines prior to
allowing users onto the network. The solution identifies whether
machines are compliant with security policies and repairs
vulnerabilities before permitting access to the network. You can use
the NAC Manager server and its web-based administration console to
manage multiple NAC Appliances in a deployment.

Cisco NAC Manager contains a directory traversal vulnerability. The
management interface uses TCP port 443. An unauthenticated attacker
could exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information,
including password files and system logs, that could be leveraged to
launch subsequent attacks. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug
ID CSCtq10755 and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) ID CVE-2011-3305.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

* CSCtq10755 ("Directory Traversal in CCA")

CVSS Base Score - 7.8
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Low
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   Complete
    Integrity Impact -         None
    Availability Impact -      None

CVSS Temporal Score - 6.4
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed

Impact
======

An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
access sensitive information, including password files and system
logs, that could be leveraged to launch subsequent attacks.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

This vulnerability has been corrected in Cisco NAC Manager Software
version 4.9.

Cisco NAC Manager software can be downloaded from the following link:

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20111005-nac.shtml.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be
bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
