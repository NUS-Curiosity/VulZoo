Package        : cyrus-imapd-2.2
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : none
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-3372 CVE-2011-3208

Multiple security issues have been discovered in cyrus-imapd, a highly scalable
mail system designed for use in enterprise environments.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-3208

    Coverity discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the NNTP server
    implementation (nttpd) of cyrus-imapd.  An attacker can exploit this
    flaw via several crafted NNTP commands to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-3372

    Stefan Cornelius of Secunia Research discovered that the command processing
    of the NNTP server implementation (nttpd) of cyrus-imapd is not properly
    implementing access restrictions for certain commands and is not checking
    for a complete, successful authentication.  An attacker can use this flaw
    to bypass access restrictions for some commands and, e.g. exploit
    CVE-2011-3208 without proper authentication.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2_2.2.13-14+lenny5.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2_2.2.13-19+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
cyrus-imapd-2.4 version 2.4.12-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.
