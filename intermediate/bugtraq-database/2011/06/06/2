Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 05.03.11: Tom Sawyer GET Extension Factory
 COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 05.03.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 03, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Tom Sawyer Software's GET Extension Factory is a component used for
graph visualization applications development. It is included in VMWare
Infrastructure Client. For more information, please visit vendor's
website: http://www.tomsawyer.com/products/index.php

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in Tom Sawyer
Software's GET Extension Factory could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected user.

The vulnerability exists within the way that Internet Explorer
instantiates GET Extension Factory COM objects, which is not intended to
be created inside of the browser. The object does not initialize
properly, and this leads to a memory corruption vulnerability that an
attacker can exploit to execute arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected user. In order to
exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to convince the
target to visit a website. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted sites.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed Tom Sawyer's Default GET Extension Factory
5.5.2.237, tsgetxu71ex552.dll and tsgetx71ex552.dll to be vulnerable.
VMWare VirtualCenter 2.5 Update 6, VirtualCenter 2.5 Update 6a is
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Setting the kill bit for those controls will prevent exploitation. The
CLSIDs for the controls are A2282403-50DE-4A2E-A118-B90AEDB1ADCC and
