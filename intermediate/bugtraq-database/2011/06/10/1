Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-5022 
Debian Bug     : 624287

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the Tag Image File Format (TIFF) library
is vulnerable to a buffer overflow triggered by a crafted OJPEG file
which allows for a crash and potentially execution of arbitrary code.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 3.9.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
