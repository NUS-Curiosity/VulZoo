-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing SVG
polygon objects. The code within nsSVGPointList::AppendElement() does
not account for user defined getter methods modifying or destroying the
parent object during a repaint. An attacker can abuse this flaw to
create a dangling pointer which is referenced during the traversal of
the SVG container hierarchy. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary
code within the context of the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
