-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of java. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page.

The specific flaw exists within the way java handles color profiles.
When parsing a color profile containing a invalid 'bfd ' tag it is
possible to specify an integer that can cause an integer to wrap. This
integer is then used to specify the size of a heap allocation. By
providing a specially crafted tag value an attacker can cause memory
corruption that can lead to remote code being executed under to user
running the browser.
