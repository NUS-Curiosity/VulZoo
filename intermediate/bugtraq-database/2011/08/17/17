-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation
Administrator Service. Authentication is not required to exploit this
vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within vxsvc.exe. The problem affecting the
part of the server running on TCP port 2148 is an integer overflow in
the function vxveautil.value_binary_unpack during the handling of the
ascii strings (opcode 6) where the 32-bit field supplied by the attacker
is used for allocating a destination buffer by adding an additional byte
to its value. This integer overflow can be used to create a small
allocation which will be subsequently overflowed, allowing the attacker
to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM.

-- Vendor Response:
Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
