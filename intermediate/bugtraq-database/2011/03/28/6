Package        : imp4
Vulnerability  : Insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3695 
Debian Bug     : 598584


Moritz Naumann discovered that imp4, a webmail component for the horde
framework, is prone to cross-site scripting attacks by a lack of input
sanitising of certain fetchmail information.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2-4lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3.7+debian0-2.1, which was already included in the squeeze
release.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 4.3.7+debian0-2.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your imp4 packages.
