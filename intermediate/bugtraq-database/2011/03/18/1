Package        : libvirt
Vulnerability  : insufficient checks
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1146
Debian Bug     : 617773

It was discovered that libvirt, a library for interfacing with different
virtualization systems, did not properly check for read-only connections.
This allowed a local attacker to perform a denial of service (crash) or
possibly escalate privileges.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.3-5+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.8-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.
