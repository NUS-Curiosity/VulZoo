Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3647 CVE-2011-3648 CVE-2011-3650 

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Iceape internet suite, an
unbranded version of Seamonkey:

CVE-2011-3647

   "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered a privilege escalation vulnerability in
   addon handling.    

CVE-2011-3648

   Yosuke Hasegawa discovered that incorrect handling of Shift-JIS 
   encodings could lead to cross-site scripting.

CVE-2011-3650

   Marc Schoenefeld discovered that profiling the Javascript code
   could lead to memory corruption.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package only
provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-9.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
