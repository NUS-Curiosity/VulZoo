Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability in MaraDNS allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

MaraDNS is a proxy DNS server with permanent caching.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/maradns              < 1.4.06                  >= 1.4.06 

Description
===========

A long DNS hostname with a large number of labels could trigger a
buffer overflow in the compress_add_dlabel_points() function of
dns/Compress.c.

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause
a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MaraDNS users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/maradns-1.4.06"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since February 12, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
