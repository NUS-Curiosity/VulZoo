Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the International Components
for Unicode (ICU) library.

    might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    execute arbitrary code via crafted text.

CVE-2015-2632

    An integer overflow vulnerability might lead into a denial of service
    or disclosure of portion of application memory if an attacker has
    control on the input file.

CVE-2015-4844

    Buffer overflow vulnerabilities might allow an attacker with control
    on the font file to perform a denial of service attacker or,
    possibly, execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2016-0494

    Integer signedness issues were introduced as part of the
    CVE-2015-4844 fix.

    A buffer overflow might allow an attacker to perform a denial of
    service or disclosure of portion of application memory.

CVE-2016-7415

    A stack-based buffer overflow might allow an attacker with control on
    the locale string to perform a denial of service and, possibly,
    execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.1-8+deb8u4.
