RESOLUTION

HPE has provided the following mitigations to resolve this issue: 
 
 * Deploy rate-limiting proxies or web application firewalls
    
   + For all versions of Glance which expose either the v1 or the v2 /images
API, operators are recommended to deploy external rate-limiting proxies or
web application firewalls. This will provide a front-end layer of protection
to Glance. The Glance database should be monitored for abnormal growth.
Although rate-limiting does not eliminate this vulnerability, it will slow it
to the point where operators can react prior to a Denial of Service
occurring. 
 
 
 * Restrict image creation to the admin role
  
  + Another possible mitigation is to restrict image creation to the admin
role. This should only be done when there are Glance nodes dedicated to
end-user access only. 
 
   + For further recommendations on external rate limiting and restricting
image creation, please refer to the Open Stack Security Notice OSSN-0076 -
