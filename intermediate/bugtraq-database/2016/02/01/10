Package        : radicale
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8747 CVE-2015-8748
Debian Bug     : 809920

Two vulnerabilities were fixed in radicale, a CardDAV/CalDAV server.

CVE-2015-8747

    The (not configured by default and not available on Wheezy)
    multifilesystem storage backend allows read and write access to
    arbitrary files (still subject to the DAC permissions of the user
    the radicale server is running as).

CVE-2015-8748

    If an attacker is able to authenticate with a user name like `.*',
    he can bypass read/write limitations imposed by regex-based rules,
    including the built-in rules `owner_write' (read for everybody,
    write for the calendar owner) and `owner_only' (read and write for
    the the calendar owner).

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.7-1.1+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9-1+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your radicale packages.
