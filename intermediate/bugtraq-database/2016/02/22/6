Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2016-0714 Apache Tomcat Security Manager Bypass

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

CVE-2016-0714 Apache Tomcat Security Manager Bypass

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- - Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.44
- - Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.67
- - Apache Tomcat 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.30
- - Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1
- - Earlier, unsupported Tomcat versions may be affected

Description:
Tomcat provides several session persistence mechanisms. The
StandardManager persists session over a restart. The PersistentManager
is able to persist sessions to files, a database or a custom Store. The
Cluster implementation persists sessions to one or more additional nodes
in the cluster. All of these mechanisms could be exploited to bypass a
security manager. Session persistence is performed by Tomcat code with
the permissions assigned to Tomcat internal code. By placing a carefully
crafted object into a session, a malicious web application could trigger
the execution of arbitrary code.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M3 or later
  (9.0.0.M2 has the fix but was not released)
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.0.32 or later
  (8.0.31 has the fix but was not released)
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.68 or later
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 6.0.45 or later
