7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

7.1. Hard-coded password in Lenovo SHAREit for Windows

[CVE-2016-1491] When Lenovo SHAREit for Windows is configured to receive files, a Wifi HotSpot is set with an easy password (12345678). Any system with a Wifi Network card could connect to that Hotspot by using that password. The password is always the same.

7.2. Remote browsing of file system on Lenovo SHAREit for Windows

[CVE-2016-1490] When the WiFi network is on and connected with the default password (12345678), the files can be browsed but not downloaded by performing an HTTP Request to the WebServer launched by Lenovo SHAREit. The following request was used to perform this action:

 
POST /list?type=file&path=C%3A%5CUsers\admin HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Dalvik/1.6.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.4.4; XT1032 Build/KXB21.14-L1.40)

7.3. Files transferred in plain text in Windows and Android version of Lenovo SHAREit

[CVE-2016-1489] The files are transfered via HTTP without encryption. An attacker that is able to sniff the network traffic could to view the data transferred or perform man in the middle attacks, for example by modifying the content of the transferred files.

7.4. Open WiFi Network defined on Android devices

[CVE-2016-1492] When the application is configured to receive files, an open Wifi HotSpot is created without any password. An attacker could connect to that HotSpot and capture the information transferred between those devices.
