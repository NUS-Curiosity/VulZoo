Subject: [CVE-2016-1926] XSS in Greenbone Security Assistant &#8805; 6.0.0
 and < 6.0.8

Hello, 

Vulnerability information
===============
Date: 13th January 2016
Product: Greenbone Security Assistant &#8805; 6.0.0 and < 6.0.8
Vendor: OpenVAS <http://www.openvas.org/>
Risk: Low, CVSS 1.9 (AV:A/AC:M/Au:M/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

Description
===============
It has been identified that Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) is vulnerable to cross site scripting due to a improper handling of the parameters of the get_aggregate command. Given the attacker has access to a session token of the browser session, the cross site scripting can be executed. OpenVAS-7 is not affected. 

Fix
===============
OpenVAS recommends that the publicly available patches are applied. If building from source, then patches r24056 (for Greenbone Security Assistant 6.0.x of OpenVAS-8) should be obtained from the OpenVAS SVN repository. For trunk (beta status of OpenVAS-9) this was solved with r24055.

A fresh tarball containing the latest stable release of Greenbone Security Assistant 6.0 (OpenVAS-8) can be obtained from:

    http://wald.intevation.org/frs/download.php/2283/greenbone-security-assistant-6.0.8.tar.gz

In the event that OpenVAS has been supplied as part of a distribution then the vendor or organisation concerned should be contacted for a patch.
