CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4312 CVE-2015-7566 CVE-2015-8767 CVE-2016-0723
                 CVE-2016-0728

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial-of-service.

CVE-2013-4312

    Tetsuo Handa discovered that it is possible for a process to open
    far more files than the process' limit leading to denial-of-service
    conditions.

CVE-2015-7566

    Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that the visor
    driver crashes when a specially crafted USB device without bulk-out
    endpoint is detected.

CVE-2015-8767

    An SCTP denial-of-service was discovered which can be triggered by a
    local attacker during a heartbeat timeout event after the 4-way
    handshake.

CVE-2016-0723

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the TIOCGETD ioctl.
    A local attacker could use this flaw for denial-of-service.

CVE-2016-0728

    The Perception Point research team discovered a use-after-free
    vulnerability in the keyring facility, possibly leading to local
    privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
