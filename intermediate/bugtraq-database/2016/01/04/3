Package        : samba
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3223 CVE-2015-5252 CVE-2015-5296 CVE-2015-5299 
                 CVE-2015-5330 CVE-2015-7540 CVE-2015-8467

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2015-3223

    Thilo Uttendorfer of Linux Information Systems AG discovered that a
    malicious request can cause the Samba LDAP server to hang, spinning
    using CPU. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    mount a denial of service.

CVE-2015-5252

    Jan "Yenya" Kasprzak and the Computer Systems Unit team at Faculty
    of Informatics, Masaryk University discovered that insufficient
    symlink verification could allow data access outside an exported
    share path.

CVE-2015-5296

    Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet discovered that Samba does not ensure
    that signing is negotiated when creating an encrypted client
    connection to a server. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to
    downgrade the connection and connect using the supplied credentials
    as an unsigned, unencrypted connection.

CVE-2015-5299

    It was discovered that a missing access control check in the VFS
    shadow_copy2 module could allow unauthorized users to access
    snapshots.

CVE-2015-5330

    Douglas Bagnall of Catalyst discovered that the Samba LDAP server
    is vulnerable to a remote memory read attack. A remote attacker can
    obtain sensitive information from daemon heap memory by sending
    crafted packets and then either read an error message, or a
    database value.

CVE-2015-7540

    It was discovered that a malicious client can send packets that
    cause the LDAP server provided by the AD DC in the samba daemon
    process to consume unlimited memory and be terminated.

CVE-2015-8467

    Andrew Bartlett of the Samba Team and Catalyst discovered that a
    Samba server deployed as an AD DC can expose Windows DCs in the same
    domain to a denial of service via the creation of multiple machine
    accounts. This issue is related to the MS15-096 / CVE-2015-2535
    security issue in Windows.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u6. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only
affected by CVE-2015-5252, CVE-2015-5296 and CVE-2015-5299.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.17+dfsg-2+deb8u1. The fixes for CVE-2015-3223 and
CVE-2015-5330 required an update to ldb 2:1.1.17-2+deb8u1 to correct the
defects.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.22+dfsg-1. The fixes for CVE-2015-3223 and CVE-2015-5330
required an update to ldb 2:1.1.24-1 to correct the defects.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
