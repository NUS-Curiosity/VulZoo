Package        : inspircd
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8702

It was discovered that inspircd, an IRC daemon, incorrectly handled
PTR lookups of connecting users. This flaw allowed a remote attacker
to crash the application by setting up malformed DNS records, thus
causing a denial-of-service,

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0.5-1+deb7u2.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.17-1+deb8u1.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 2.0.20-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your inspircd packages.
