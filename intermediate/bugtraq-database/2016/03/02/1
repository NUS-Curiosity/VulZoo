Exploit Vectors: Local and Remote

Tested on: Vivint Sky Control Panel v1.1.1.9926

Remediation guidelines: The vendor has implemented authentication to require authentication to the Web interface. Please contact the vendor and request a firmware update to mitigate the vulnerability, if identified.
