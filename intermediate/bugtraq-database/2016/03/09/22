Package        : rails
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2097 CVE-2016-2098

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, a web application
framework written in Ruby. Both vulnerabilities affect Action Pack, which
handles the web requests for Rails.

CVE-2016-2097

    Crafted requests to Action View, one of the components of Action Pack,
    might result in rendering files from arbitrary locations, including
    files beyond the application's view directory. This vulnerability is
    the result of an incomplete fix of CVE-2016-0752.
    This bug was found by Jyoti Singh and Tobias Kraze from Makandra.

CVE-2016-2098

    If a web applications does not properly sanitize user inputs, an
    attacker might control the arguments of the render method in a
    controller or a view, resulting in the possibility of executing
    arbitrary ruby code.
    This bug was found by Tobias Kraze from Makandra and joernchen of
    Phenoelit.
