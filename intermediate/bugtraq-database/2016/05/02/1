HPSBGN03547 rev.3 - HPE Helion Eucalyptus Node Controller and other Helion
Eucalyptus Components using glibc, Remote Arbitrary Code Execution

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon as
soon as possible.

Potential Security Impact: Remote Arbitrary Code Execution, Denial of Service
(DoS)

Source: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Product Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A security vulnerability in glibc has been addressed with HPE Helion
Eucalyptus Node Controller and other Helion Eucalyptus components. The
vulnerability could be exploited remotely resulting in arbitrary execution of
code.

**Notes:**

  - A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability has been announced in the
glibc library that affects all versions of glibc since 2.9. Glibc packages
shipped with Red Hat and CentOS 6 are affected.To exploit the vulnerability,
a remote attacker can create a specially crafted DNS response and potentially
execute an arbitrary code on the host with the permissions of a user running
glibc library.

  - Helion Eucalyptus Node Controller (NC) components are confirmed to be
affected by the vulnerability. Other Helion Eucalyptus components and
pre-bundled service EMIs do not directly expose the vulnerability, but
because glibc is a commonly used library on Linux, the exact exposure is hard
to determine. Any software performing domain name resolution is potentially
vulnerable.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.

  - HPE Helion Eucalyptus Node Controller 4.2.2 and earlier
  - HPE Helion Eucalyptus Service components EMIs for Load Balancing and
Imaging services package "eucalyptus-service-image-1.48-0.87.99" and earlier

RESOLUTION

HPE has made the following software updates and workaround information
available to resolve the vulnerability with glibc for HPE Helion Eucalyptus.

+ All hosts running HPE Helion Eucalyptus services should be upgraded to the
latest glibc. Updated glibc packages are available for RHEL and CentOS:

    https://access.redhat.com/articles/2161461

    **RHEL Note:** After following the guidelines for RHEL, a reboot is the
safest and recommended way to ensure that updates takes effect for all
services.

+ New Helion Eucalyptus Service EMI
eucalyptus-service-image-1.57-0.93.110.el6 with updated glibc packages is
available in the Eucalyptus software repositories at:

    http://downloads.eucalyptus.com/software/eucalyptus/4.2/

If installing the updated service EMI is not possible, the following
workaround is available to update the instances launched from
eucalyptus-service-image-1.48-0.87.99 and earlier to the latest glibc
packages.

**Workaround:**

  As a cloud administrator:

  1) create an update-glibc script with the following content:

    #! /bin/bash
    yum update -y glibc

  2) set the following cloud properties to use that script on instance start:

    euctl services.imaging.worker.init_script=@...ate-glibc
    euctl services.loadbalancing.worker.init_script=@...ate-glibc

  This script will be automatically executed for each of the new instances
started from the service image. For instances that are already
running, the cloud administrator will need to terminate them and start again
for the script to take effect. More specifically, for the Load Balancing
service, the cloud admin needs to find all instances running under the
"(eucalyptus)loadbalancing" account:

    # euare-accountlist | grep loadbalancing
    (eucalyptus)loadbalancing    <accnt_id>

    # euca-describe-instances verbose | grep <accnt_id>

  And terminate them using euca-terminate-instances. New updated instances
will be started automatically after that.

  For the Imaging Service, the imaging worker needs to be terminated and
started again:

    # esi-manage-stack -a delete imaging
    # esi-manage-stack -a create imaging
