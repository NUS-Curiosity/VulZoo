Potential Security Impact: Local Unauthorized Access to Files

Source: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Product Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified in HP-UX VxFS ACL
inheritance. The vulnerability could result in local unauthorized access to
files.

Notes:

  - Default ACL entries "default:other:", "default:user:", and
"default:class:" are not inherited correctly.
  - There is a risk that file access restrictions may not be effective on
inherited ACLs to restrict file or directory access by other users, for
example, by defining "default:other:---" in a parent directory.
  - The defect does not impact "default:group:" entries.
