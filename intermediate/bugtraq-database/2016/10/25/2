Apache OpenOffice Advisory
<https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2016-6804.html>

Title: Windows Installer Execution of Arbitrary Code with Elevated Privileges

Version 1.0
Announced October 11, 2016

Description

The Apache OpenOffice installer for Windows contained a defective
operation that allows execution of arbitrary code with elevated 
privileges.

The location in which the installer is run may have been previously
poisoned by a file that impersonates a dynamic-link library that 
the installer depends upon.  The counterfeit is operated instead 
because of a search-path defect in the installer.  The counterfeit 
will be operated under the administrative privileges of the OpenOffice
installer, compromising the user's PC.

Severity: Medium

    There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.
    Proof-of-concept demonstrations exist.

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

    All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older 
    are affected.  OpenOffice.org versions are also
    affected.

    
Mitigation:

Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 for the latest maintenance and 
cumulative security fixes.  Use <https://www.openoffice.org/download/>.


Defenses and Work-Arounds:

If you are unable to update to 4.1.3, there are other 
precautions that can be taken.  These precautions are also 
recommended as protection against other software that may 
have the vulnerability.

When executing .exe installers, ensure that the installer
is in a file folder that has no files but the installer 
.exe file.

If an installer proposes a folder to extract the setup
files into before the actual install, choose the name of 
a folder that is not in use.  Delete such a folder of setup 
files after the installation completes successfully.  To 
reinstall without downloading again, preserve the installer 
.exe on private removable storage.


Further Information:

For additional information and assistance, consult the Apache
OpenOffice Community Forums, <https://forum.openoffice.org/> or 
make requests to the <mailto:users@...noffice.apache.org> public
mailing list.  Defects not involving suspected security
vulnerabilities can be reported via
