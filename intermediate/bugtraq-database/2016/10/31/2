Crowd LDAP Java Object Injection (CVE-2016-6496)

Severity:
Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical,
according to the scale published in our Atlassian severity levels. The
scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or
low. This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its
applicability to your own IT environment.

Description:

The Crowd LDAP directory connector allowed an attacker to gain remote
code execution in Crowd by injecting malicious attributes in LDAP
entries. To exploit this issue, attackers either need to modify an
entry in an LDAP directory that Crowd is configured to use or
successfully execute a Man-in-The-Middle attack between an LDAP server
and Crowd. Crowd installations configured to communicate with an LDAP
server using the LDAPS protocol with the Secure SSL option enabled are
immune to the Man-in-The-Middle attack vector only (unless an attacker
is able to obtain the private key of the SSL/TLS certificate used to
secure the communication).

All versions of Crowd from 1.4.1 before 2.8.8 (the fixed version for
2.8.x) and from 2.9.0 before 2.9.5 (the fixed version for 2.9.x) are
affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:
https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-4790 .

Acknowledgements:
We would like to credit Alvaro Munoz and Alexander Mirosh of HPE
Security Fortify for reporting this issue to us.

Fix:

We have taken the following steps to address this issue:
* Crowd version 2.10.1 has been released with a fix for this issue.
* Crowd version 2.9.5 has been released with a fix for this issue.
