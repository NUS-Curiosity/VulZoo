Issue

The Acer Portal Android application (version 3.9.3.2006 and below),
installed by the manufacturer on all Acer branded Android devices,
does not validate the SSL certificate it receives when connecting to
the mobile application login server.

Impact

An attacker who can perform a man in the middle attack may present a
bogus SSL certificate which the application will accept silently.
Usernames, passwords and sensitive information could be captured by an
attacker without the user's knowledge.
