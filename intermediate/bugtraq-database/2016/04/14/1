Package        : samba
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5370 CVE-2016-2110 CVE-2016-2111 CVE-2016-2112
                 CVE-2016-2113 CVE-2016-2114 CVE-2016-2115 CVE-2016-2118

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2015-5370

    Jouni Knuutinen from Synopsys discovered flaws in the Samba DCE-RPC
    code which can lead to denial of service (crashes and high cpu
    consumption) and man-in-the-middle attacks.

CVE-2016-2110

    Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that the
    feature negotiation of NTLMSSP does not protect against downgrade
    attacks.

CVE-2016-2111

    When Samba is configured as domain controller, it allows remote
    attackers to spoof the computer name of a secure channel's endpoint,
    and obtain sensitive session information. This flaw corresponds to
    the same vulnerability as CVE-2015-0005 for Windows, discovered by
    Alberto Solino from Core Security.

CVE-2016-2112

    Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can downgrade LDAP connections to avoid
    integrity protection.

CVE-2016-2113

    Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that
    man-in-the-middle attacks are possible for client triggered LDAP
    connections and ncacn_http connections.

CVE-2016-2114

    Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that Samba
    does not enforce required smb signing even if explicitly configured.

CVE-2016-2115

    Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that SMB
    connections for IPC traffic are not integrity-protected.

CVE-2016-2118

    Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept any DCERPC traffic between
    a client and a server in order to impersonate the client and obtain
    the same privileges as the authenticated user account.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u9. The oldstable distribution is not affected
by CVE-2016-2113 and CVE-2016-2114.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.2.10+dfsg-0+deb8u1. The issues were addressed by upgrading
to the new upstream version 4.2.10, which includes additional changes
and bugfixes. The depending libraries ldb, talloc, tdb and tevent
required as well an update to new upstream versions for this update.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.3.7+dfsg-1.

for further details (in particular for new options and defaults).

We'd like to thank Andreas Schneider and Guenther Deschner (Red Hat),
Stefan Metzmacher and Ralph Boehme (SerNet) and Aurelien Aptel (SUSE)
for the massive backporting work required to support Samba 3.6 and Samba
4.2 and Andrew Bartlett (Catalyst), Jelmer Vernooij and Mathieu Parent
for their help in preparing updates of Samba and the underlying
infrastructure libraries.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
