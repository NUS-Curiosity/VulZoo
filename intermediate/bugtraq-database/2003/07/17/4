- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that logging into an IRIX 6.5 machine while particular
environment variables are set can lead to /usr/lib/iaf/scheme (login)
dumping core. Since "scheme" is suid root, this could potentially lead to a
root compromise.  A local account would be required to exploit any such
vulnerability.

This issue was assigned the following CVE:
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0574

Please note that this is not the same issue as reported in
CERT advisory CA-2001-34 or CERT advisory CA-1997-21 (CVE-1999-0028).

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in future releases of IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The scheme binary is installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems as part of
eoe.sw.base.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems.  SGI
recommends either upgrading to IRIX 6.5.21, or installing the appropriate
patch from the listing below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.21, or install the appropriate
patch.
