- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that BSD-based TCP/IP code has a bug with respect to
creating TCP connections to a broadcast address. This bug can potentially be
a security vulnerability when firewall administrators assume that the TCP
implementation works correctly and do not block broadcast addresses. If good
security practices have been followed on a firewall host or gateway, the
potential for exploitation is probably low.  This vulnerability is present
in IRIX 6.5 versions prior to 6.5.17m/f.

For additional details, see:

    http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/262733
    http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/4309
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0381

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in IRIX 6.5.17 and later versions.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

Since this is a kernel level vulnerability, it is present in all versions of
IRIX earlier than 6.5.17.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.



- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems.  SGI
recommends upgrading to IRIX 6.5.17 or later.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has not provided patches for these vulnerabilities. Our recommendation
is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.17 or later.
