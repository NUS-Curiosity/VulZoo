Package        : mgetty
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16741

Two input sanitization failures have been found in the faxrunq and faxq
binaries in mgetty, a smart modem getty replacement. An attacker could leverage
them  to insert commands via shell metacharacters in jobs id and have them
executed with the privilege of the faxrunq/faxq user.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.36-3+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mgetty packages.

For the detailed security status of mgetty please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/mgetty
