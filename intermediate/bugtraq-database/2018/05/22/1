CVE ID         : CVE-2017-0920 CVE-2018-8971

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Gitlab, a software
platform to collaborate on code:
	    
CVE-2017-0920

    It was discovered that missing validation of merge requests allowed
    users to see names to private projects, resulting in information
    disclosure.

CVE-2018-8971

    It was discovered that the Auth0 integration was implemented
    incorrectly.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.13.11+dfsg1-8+deb9u2. The fix for CVE-2018-8971 also requires
