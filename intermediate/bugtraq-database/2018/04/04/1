Package        : apache2
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-15710 CVE-2017-15715 CVE-2018-1283 CVE-2018-1301
                 CVE-2018-1303 CVE-2018-1312

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.

CVE-2017-15710

    Alex Nichols and Jakob Hirsch reported that mod_authnz_ldap, if
    configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, could cause an of bound write
    if supplied with a crafted Accept-Language header. This could
    potentially be used for a Denial of Service attack.

CVE-2017-15715

    Elar Lang discovered that expression specified in <FilesMatch> could
    match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather
    than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited
    in environments where uploads of some files are are externally
    blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.

CVE-2018-1283

    When mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI
    applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user could
    influence their content by using a "Session" header.

CVE-2018-1301

    Robert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted request could have
    crashed the Apache HTTP Server, due to an out of bound access after
    a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header.

CVE-2018-1303

    Robert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted HTTP request header
    could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server if using
    mod_cache_socache, due to an out of bound read while preparing data
    to be cached in shared memory.

CVE-2018-1312

    Nicolas Daniels discovered that when generating an HTTP Digest
    authentication challenge, the nonce sent by mod_auth_digest to
    prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a
    pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest
    authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across
    servers by an attacker without detection.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.4.10-10+deb8u12.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.25-3+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
