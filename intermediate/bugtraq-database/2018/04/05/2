Argument injection through Mercurial repository uri handling on Windows
(CVE-2018-5224)

Severity:
Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical, according
to the scale published in our Atlassian severity levels. The scale allows us to
rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.
This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT
environment.


Description:

Bamboo did not correctly check if a configured Mercurial repository URI
contained values that the Windows operating system may consider argument
parameters. An attacker who has permission to create a repository in Bamboo,
edit an existing plan in Bamboo that has a non-linked Mercurial repository, or
create a plan in Bamboo either globally or in a project using Bamboo Specs can
execute code of their choice on systems that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo
on the Windows operating system.
Versions of Bamboo starting with 2.7.0 before 6.3.3 (the fixed version for
6.3.x) and from version 6.4.0 before 6.4.1 (the fixed version for 6.4.x) running
on the Windows operating system are affected by this vulnerability. This issue
can be tracked at: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-19743 .



Fix:

To address this issue, we've released the following versions containing a fix:

* Bamboo version 6.3.3
* Bamboo version 6.4.1

Remediation:

Upgrade Bamboo to version 6.4.1 or higher.

The vulnerabilities and fix versions are described above. If affected, you
should upgrade to the latest version immediately.

If you are running Bamboo 6.3.x and cannot upgrade to 6.4.1, upgrade to version
6.3.3.
