Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16839 CVE-2018-16842

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.

CVE-2018-16839

    Harry Sintonen discovered that, on systems with a 32 bit size_t, an
    integer overflow would be triggered when a SASL user name longer
    than 2GB is used. This would in turn cause a very small buffer to be
    allocated instead of the intended very huge one, which would trigger
    a heap buffer overflow when the buffer is used.

CVE-2018-16842

    Brian Carpenter discovered that the logic in the curl tool to wrap
    error messages at 80 columns is flawed, leading to a read buffer
    overflow if a single word in the message is itself longer than 80
    bytes.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
