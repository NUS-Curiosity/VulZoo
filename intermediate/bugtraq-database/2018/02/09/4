Package        : mailman
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-5950
Debian Bug     : 888201

Calum Hutton and the Mailman team discovered a cross site scripting and
information leak vulnerability in the user options page. A remote
attacker could use a crafted URL to steal cookie information or to
fish for whether a user is subscribed to a list with a private roster.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.1.18-2+deb8u2.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.23-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.

its security tracker page at:
