Package        : strongswan
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-17540

Google's OSS-Fuzz revealed an exploitable bug in the gmp plugin caused by the
patch that fixes CVE-2018-16151 and CVE-2018-16151 (DSA-4305-1).

An attacker could trigger it using crafted certificates with RSA keys with
very small moduli. Verifying signatures with such keys would cause an integer
underflow and subsequent heap buffer overflow resulting in a crash of the
daemon. While arbitrary code execution is not completely ruled out because of
the heap buffer overflow, due to the form of the data written to the buffer
it seems difficult to actually exploit it in such a way.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.5.1-4+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
