Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Libvirt, a virtualisation

    resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2018-5748

    Daniel Berrange and Peter Krempa that the QEMU monitor was suspectible
    to denial of service by memory exhaustion. This was already fixed in
    Debian stretch and only affects Debian jessie.
