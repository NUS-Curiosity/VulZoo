Package        : unbound
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-16866
Debian Bug     : 941692

X41 D-Sec discovered that unbound, a validating, recursive, and
caching DNS resolver, did not correctly process some NOTIFY
queries. This could lead to remote denial-of-service by application
crash.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.0-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your unbound packages.

For the detailed security status of unbound please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/unbound
