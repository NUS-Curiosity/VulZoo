Package        : apache2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-9517 CVE-2019-10081 CVE-2019-10082 CVE-2019-10092
                 CVE-2019-10097 CVE-2019-10098

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.

CVE-2019-9517

    Jonathan Looney reported that a malicious client could perform a
    denial of service attack (exhausting h2 workers) by flooding a
    connection with requests and basically never reading responses on
    the TCP connection.

CVE-2019-10081

    Craig Young reported that HTTP/2 PUSHes could lead to an overwrite
    of memory in the pushing request's pool, leading to crashes.

CVE-2019-10082

    Craig Young reported that the HTTP/2 session handling could be made
    to read memory after being freed, during connection shutdown.

CVE-2019-10092

    Matei "Mal" Badanoiu reported a limited cross-site scripting
    vulnerability in the mod_proxy error page.

CVE-2019-10097

    Daniel McCarney reported that when mod_remoteip was configured to
    use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the "PROXY" protocol,
    a specially crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer
    overflow or NULL pointer deference. This vulnerability could only be
    triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients. The
    issue does not affect the stretch release.

CVE-2019-10098

    Yukitsugu Sasaki reported a potential open redirect vulnerability in
    the mod_rewrite module.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.4.25-3+deb9u8.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.38-3+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
