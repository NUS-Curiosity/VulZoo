Package        : libapache2-mod-auth-mellon
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-3877 CVE-2019-3878
Debian Bug     : 925197

Several issues have been discovered in Apache module auth_mellon, which
provides SAML 2.0 authentication.

CVE-2019-3877

    It was possible to bypass the redirect URL checking on logout, so
    the module could be used as an open redirect facility.

CVE-2019-3878

    When mod_auth_mellon is used in an Apache configuration which
    serves as a remote proxy with the http_proxy module, it was
    possible to bypass authentication by sending SAML ECP headers.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.0-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-auth-mellon packages.
