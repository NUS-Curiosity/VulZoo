Package        : evolution
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-15587
Debian Bug     : 924616

Hanno BÃ¶ck discovered that Evolution was vulnerable to OpenPGP
signatures being spoofed for arbitrary messages using a specially
crafted HTML email. This issue was mitigated by moving the security
bar with encryption and signature information above the message
headers.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.22.6-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your evolution packages.

For the detailed security status of evolution please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/evolution
