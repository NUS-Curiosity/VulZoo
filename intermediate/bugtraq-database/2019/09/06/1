         CVE Name       CVE-2019-15297                                        

      Description     When Asterisk sends a re-invite initiating T.38         
                      faxing, and the endpoint responds with a declined       
                      media stream a crash will then occur in Asterisk.       
    Modules Affected  res_pjsip_t38.c                                         

    Resolution  If T.38 faxing is not required then setting the ���t38_udptl���   
                configuration option on the endpoint to ���no��� disables this    
                functionality. This option defaults to ���no��� so you have to    
                have explicitly set it ���yes��� to potentially be affected by    
                this issue.                                                   
                                                                              
                Otherwise, if T.38 faxing is required then Asterisk should    
                be upgraded to a fixed version.
