          CVE Name        CVE-2019-15639                                      

      Description     When audio frames are given to the audio transcoding    
                      support in Asterisk the number of samples are examined  
                      and as part of this a message is output to indicate     
                      that no samples are present. A change was done to       
                      suppress this message for a particular scenario in      
                      which the message was not relevant. This change         
                      assumed that information about the origin of a frame    
                      will always exist when in reality it may not.           
                                                                              
                      This issue presented itself when an RTP packet          
                      containing no audio (and thus no samples) was           
                      received. In a particular transcoding scenario this     
                      audio frame would get turned into a frame with no       
                      origin information. If this new frame was then given    
                      to the audio transcoding support a crash would occur    
                      as no samples and no origin information would be        
                      present. The transcoding scenario requires the          
                      ���genericplc��� option to be set to enabled (the default)  
                      and a transcoding path from the source format into      
                      signed linear and then from signed linear into another  
                      format.                                                 
                                                                              
                      Note that there may be other scenarios that have not    
                      been found which can cause an audio frame with no       
                      origin to be given to the audio transcoding support     
                      and thus cause a crash.                                 
    Modules Affected  main/translate.c                                        

    Resolution  The ���genericplc��� option can be disabled in codecs.conf to     
                mitigate the described scenario. It is recommended, however,  
                that Asterisk be upgraded to one of the listed versions or    
                the linked patch applied to protect against potential         
                unknown scenarios.
