Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found, allowing a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code with escalated privileges on the
local system.

Background
==========

linux-ftpd-ssl is the netkit FTP server with encryption support.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-ftp/ftpd      < 0.17-r3                            >= 0.17-r3

Description
===========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in the linux-ftpd-ssl
package. A command that generates an excessively long response from the
server may overrun a stack buffer.

Impact
======

An attacker that has permission to create directories that are
accessible via the FTP server could exploit this vulnerability.
Successful exploitation would execute arbitrary code on the local
machine with root privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ftpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/ftpd-0.17-r3"
