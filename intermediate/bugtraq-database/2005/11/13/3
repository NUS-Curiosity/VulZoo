Synopsis
========

Lynx is vulnerable to an issue which allows the remote execution of
arbitrary commands.

Background
==========

Lynx is a fully-featured WWW client for users running
cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices such as vt100
terminals and terminal emulators.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/lynx     < 2.8.5-r2                        >= 2.8.5-r2

Description
===========

iDefense labs discovered a problem within the feature to execute local
cgi-bin programs via the "lynxcgi:" URI handler. Due to a configuration
error, the default settings allow websites to specify commands to run
as the user running Lynx.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can entice a user to access a malicious HTTP server,
causing Lynx to execute arbitrary commands.

Workaround
==========

Disable "lynxcgi" links by specifying the following directive in
lynx.cfg:

    TRUSTED_LYNXCGI:none

Resolution
==========

All Lynx users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/lynx-2.8.5-r2"
