Synopsis
========

The OpenVPN client is potentially vulnerable to the execution of
arbitrary code and the OpenVPN server is vulnerable to a Denial of
Service issue.

Background
==========

OpenVPN is a multi-platform, full-featured SSL VPN solution.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/openvpn       < 2.0.4                           >= 2.0.4

Description
===========

The OpenVPN client contains a format string bug in the handling of the
foreign_option in options.c. Furthermore, when the OpenVPN server runs
in TCP mode, it may dereference a NULL pointer under specific error
conditions.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could setup a malicious OpenVPN server and trick the
user into connecting to it, potentially executing arbitrary code on the
client's computer. A remote attacker could also exploit the NULL
dereference issue by sending specific packets to an OpenVPN server
running in TCP mode, resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

Workaround
==========

Do not use "pull" or "client" options in the OpenVPN client
configuration file, and use UDP mode for the OpenVPN server.

Resolution
==========

All OpenVPN users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/openvpn-2.0.4"
