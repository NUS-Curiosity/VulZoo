Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been identified that allows a specially crafted SVG
file to exploit a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary
code when opened.

Background
==========

Inkscape is an Open Source vector graphics editor using the W3C
standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/inkscape       < 0.43                           >= 0.43

Description
===========

Joxean Koret has discovered that Inkscape incorrectly allocates memory
when opening an SVG file, creating the possibility of a buffer overflow
if the SVG file being opened is specially crafted.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user into opening a maliciously crafted SVG
file, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code on a machine with
the privileges of the user running Inkscape.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Inkscape users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/inkscape-0.43"
