Advisory ID:       FLSA:123013
Issue date:        2005-11-14

---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated xchat package that fixes a security bug is now available.

X-Chat is a graphical IRC chat client for the X Window System.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the X-Chat's Socks-5 proxy
code. An attacker could create a malicious Socks-5 proxy server in such
a way that X-Chat would execute arbitrary code if a victim configured
X-Chat to use the proxy. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2004-0409 to this
issue.

Users of X-Chat should upgrade to this updated package which contains a
backported security patch and is not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
