Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been identified that allows arbitrary code
execution on a user's system via the handling of malicious SWF files.

Background
==========

The Macromedia Flash Player is a renderer for the popular SWF filetype
which is commonly used to provide interactive websites, digital
experiences and mobile content.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/netscape-flash      < 7.0.61                    >= 7.0.61

Description
===========

When handling a SWF file, the Macromedia Flash Player incorrectly
validates the frame type identifier stored in the SWF file which is
used as an index to reference an array of function pointers. A
specially crafted SWF file can cause this index to reference memory
outside of the scope of the Macromedia Flash Player, which in turn can
cause the Macromedia Flash Player to use unintended memory address(es)
as function pointers.

Impact
======

An attacker serving a maliciously crafted SWF file could entice a user
to view the SWF file and execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Macromedia Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/netscape-flash-7.0.61"
