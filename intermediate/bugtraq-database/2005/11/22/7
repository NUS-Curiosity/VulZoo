Synopsis
========

The fusermount utility from FUSE can be abused to corrupt the /etc/mtab
file contents, potentially allowing a local attacker to set
unauthorized mount options.

Background
==========

FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) allows implementation of a fully
functional filesystem in a userspace program. The fusermount utility is
used to mount/unmount FUSE file systems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-fs/fuse     < 2.4.1-r1                            >= 2.4.1-r1

Description
===========

Thomas Biege discovered that fusermount fails to securely handle
special characters specified in mount points.

Impact
======

A local attacker could corrupt the contents of the /etc/mtab file by
mounting over a maliciously-named directory using fusermount,
potentially allowing the attacker to set unauthorized mount options.
This is possible only if fusermount is installed setuid root, which is
the default in Gentoo.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FUSE users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-fs/fuse-2.4.1-r1"

References
==========
