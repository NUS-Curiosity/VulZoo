Synopsis
========

cURL is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

cURL is a command line tool and library for transferring files via many
different protocols. It supports NTLM authentication to retrieve files
from Windows-based systems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/curl      < 7.15.0                             >= 7.15.0

Description
===========

iDEFENSE reported that insufficient bounds checking on a memcpy() of
the supplied NTLM username can result in a stack overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could setup a malicious server and entice an user to
connect to it using a cURL client, potentially leading to the execution
of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running cURL.

Workaround
==========

Disable NTLM authentication by not using the --anyauth or --ntlm
options when using cURL (the command line version). Workarounds for
programs that use the cURL library depend on the configuration options
presented by those programs.

Resolution
==========

All cURL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/curl-7.15.0"
