Description:
  According to a iDEFENSE security advisory [0], a command injection
  vulnerability exists in the Lynx [2] WWW textual client. The
  vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands
  with the privileges of the underlying user. The problem specifically
  exists within the feature to execute local "cgi-bin" programs via the
  "lynxcgi:" URI handler. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  project assigned the id CVE-2005-2929 [3] to the problem.

  Additionally, according to a security advisory from Ulf Harnhammar
  [1], a stack-based buffer overflow in the "HTrjis" function in Lynx
  allows remote NNTP servers to execute arbitrary code via certain
  article headers containing Asian characters that cause Lynx to
  add extra escape (ESC) characters. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CVE-2005-3120 [4] to the
  problem.
