Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0070

Package names:	   kernel, perl
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2005-12-09
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process 
  allocation, device input and output, etc.

  perl
  Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and
  shell scripting. Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is 
  especially good at handling text. Perl's hallmarks are practicality and
  efficiency. While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's 
  most common applications (and what it excels at) are probably system
  administration utilities and web programming. A large proportion of the
  CGI scripts on the web are written in Perl. You need the perl package 
  installed on your system so that your system can handle Perl scripts.

Problem description:
  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Memory leak in the VFS file lease handling in locks.c
    allows local users to cause a denial of service via certain Samba
    activities that cause an fasync entry to be re-allocated by the
    fcntl_setlease function after the fasync queue has already been 
    cleaned by the locks_delete_lock function.
  - The auto-reap of child processes in Linux kernel 2.6 includes 
    processes with ptrace attached, which leads to a dangling ptrace 
    reference and allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash).
  - The time_out_leases function in locks.c allows local users to cause a
    denial of service (kernel log message consumption) by causing a large
    number of broken leases, which is recorded to the log using the printk
    function.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2005-3807, CVE-2005-3784 and CVE-2005-3857 to
    these issues.
  
  perl < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Integer overflow in the format string functionality
    (Perl_sv_vcatpvfn) allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary memory and
    possibly execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers with
    large values.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2005-3962 to this issue.
