Synopsis
========

The NBD server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that may result in
the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The NBD Tools are the Network Block Device utilities allowing one to
use remote block devices over a TCP/IP network. It includes a userland
NBD server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-block/nbd     < 2.8.2-r1                          >= 2.8.2-r1

Description
===========

Kurt Fitzner discovered that the NBD server allocates a request buffer
that fails to take into account the size of the reply header.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a malicious request that can result in the
execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the NBD server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All NBD Tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-block/nbd-2.8.2-r1"

==========
