Package        : bind9
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-9131 CVE-2016-9147 CVE-2016-9444
Debian Bug     : 851062 851063 851065

Several denial-of-service vulnerabilities (assertion failures) were
discovered in BIND, a DNS server implementation.

CVE-2016-9131

    A crafted upstream response to an ANY query could cause an
    assertion failure.

CVE-2016-9147

    A crafted upstream response with self-contradicting DNSSEC data
    could cause an assertion failure.

CVE-2016-9444

    Specially-crafted upstream responses with a DS record could cause
    an assertion failure.

These vulnerabilities predominantly affect DNS servers providing
recursive service.  Client queries to authoritative-only servers
cannot trigger these assertion failures.  These vulnerabilities are
present whether or not DNSSEC validation is enabled in the server
configuration.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
