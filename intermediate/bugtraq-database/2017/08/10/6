Package        : subversion
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-8734 CVE-2017-9800

Several problems were discovered in Subversion, a centralised version
control system.

CVE-2016-8734 (jessie only)

    Subversion's mod_dontdothat server module and Subversion clients
    using http(s):// were vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack
    caused by exponential XML entity expansion.

CVE-2017-9800

    Joern Schneeweisz discovered that Subversion did not correctly
    handle maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URLs. This allowed an
    attacker to run an arbitrary shell command, for instance via
    svn:externals properties or when using 'svnsync sync'.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.8.10-6+deb8u5.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.5-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.
