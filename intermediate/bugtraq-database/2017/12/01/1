Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-8816 CVE-2017-8817

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.

CVE-2017-8816

    Alex Nichols discovered a buffer overrun flaw in the NTLM authentication
    code which can be triggered on 32bit systems where an integer overflow
    might occur when calculating the size of a memory allocation.

CVE-2017-8817

    Fuzzing by the OSS-Fuzz project led to the discovery of a read out of
    bounds flaw in the FTP wildcard function in libcurl. A malicious server
    could redirect a libcurl-based client to an URL using a wildcard pattern,
    triggering the out-of-bound read.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u8.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
