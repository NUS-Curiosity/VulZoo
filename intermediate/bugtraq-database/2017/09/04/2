Package        : strongswan
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11185
Debian Bug     : 872155

A denial of service vulnerability was identified in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec
suite, using Google's OSS-Fuzz fuzzing project.

The gmp plugin in strongSwan had insufficient input validation when verifying
RSA signatures. This coding error could lead to a null pointer dereference,
leading to process crash.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.2.1-6+deb8u5.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.5.1-4+deb9u1.

For the testing distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.6.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
