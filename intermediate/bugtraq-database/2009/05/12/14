Title: CA20090126-01: CA Anti-Virus Engine Detection Evasion 
Multiple Vulnerabilities


CA Advisory Reference: CA20090126-01


CA Advisory Date: 2009-01-26
CA Advisory Updated: May 12, 2009


Reported By:
Thierry Zoller and Sergio Alvarez of n.runs AG


Impact: A remote attacker can evade detection.


Summary: The CA Anti-Virus engine contains multiple 
vulnerabilities that can allow a remote attacker to evade 
detection by the Anti-Virus engine by creating a malformed archive 
file in one of several common file archive formats. CA has 
released a new Anti-Virus engine to address the vulnerabilities. 
The vulnerabilities, CVE-2009-0042, are due to improper handling 
of malformed archive files by the Anti-Virus engine. A remote 
attacker can create a malformed archive file that potentially 
contains malware and evade anti-virus detection.

Note: After files have been extracted from an archive, the desktop 
Anti-Virus engine is able to scan all files for malware. 
Consequently, detection evasion can be a concern for gateway 
anti-virus software if archives are not scanned, but the risk is 
effectively mitigated by the desktop anti-virus engine.


Mitigating Factors: See note above.


Severity: CA has given these vulnerabilities a Low risk rating.

Non-Affected Products:
CA Anti-Virus engine with arclib version 7.3.0.15 installed


Affected Platforms:
Windows
UNIX
Linux
Solaris
Mac OS X
NetWare


Status and Recommendation:
CA released arclib 7.3.0.15 in September 2008.  If your product is 
configured for automatic updates, you should already be protected, 
and you need to take no action.  If your product is not configured 
for automatic updates, then you simply need to run the update 
utility included with your product.

CA Network and Systems Management (NSM) r11.1 SP1, and CA Common 
Services (CCS) r11.1 SP1: apply fix #RO05417.

CA Common Services (CCS) r3.1: apply fix #RO05418.

CA Anti-Virus for the Enterprise (formerly eTrust Antivirus) 7.1: 
apply fix #RO01955.

CA Secure Content Manager (formerly eTrust Secure Content Manager) 
r1.1: apply fix #RO05629.

CA Secure Content Manager (formerly eTrust Secure Content Manager) 
r8.0: apply fix #RO05309.

CA Secure Content Manager (formerly eTrust Secure Content Manager) 
r8.1: apply fix #RO05868.

CA Anti-Virus Gateway (formerly eTrust Antivirus Gateway) 7.1: 
apply fix #RO05631.

CA Gateway Security r8.1: apply Cumulative Fix 1.

CA ARCserve for Windows Server component installed on a 64 bit 
machine: apply fixes # RO01955 and RO01956.

CA ARCserve for Windows Server component installed on a 32 bit 
machine: apply fix # RO01955.

CA ARCserve for Windows Client Agent installed on a 64 bit 
machine: apply fix # RO01956.

CA ARCserve for Windows Client Agent installed on a 32 bit 
machine: apply fix # RO01955.

CA ARCserve for Linux Server r11.5: apply fix # RO01959.
CA ARCserve for Linux:
1. Download RO01959.tar.Z from RO01959 into a temporary location 
   /tmp/RO01959 
2. Uncompress and untar RO01959.tar.Z as follows:
      uncompress RO01959.tar.Z
      tar -xvf RO01959.tar
   The new "libarclib.so" will be extracted to /tmp/RO01959
3. Change the directory to $CAIGLBL0000/ino/config as follows:
      cd $CAIGLBL0000/ino/config
4. Rename "libarclib.so" to "libarclib.so.RO01959" as follows:
      mv libarclib.so libarclib.so.RO01959
5. Copy the new libarclib.so as follows:
      cp /tmp/RO01959/libarclib.so $CAIGLBL0000/ino/config/.
6. chmod +x $CAIGLBL0000/ino/config/libarclib.so
7. Stop the common agent (caagent stop)
8. Change the directory to ARCserve common agent directory 
   (typically /opt/CA/BABcmagt)
      cd /opt/CA/BABcmagt
   Note: To find out the agent home directory run the following 
   command:
      dirname `ls -l /usr/bin/caagent  |cut -f2 -d">"`
9. Save a copy of libarclib.so
      cp -p libarclib.so libarclib.so.RO01959
10. Copy over the new libarclib.so as follows:
       cp $/tmp/RO01959/libarclib.so  .
11. Start the common agent (caagent start)
12. Repeat steps (7-11) on all remote Linux client agents' 
    installations.
13. rm -rf  /tmp/RO01959


How to determine if you are affected:

For products on Windows:

1. Using Windows Explorer, locate the file "arclib.dll". By 
   default, the file is located in the 
   "C:\Program Files\CA\SharedComponents\ScanEngine" directory (*).
2. Right click on the file and select Properties.
3. Select the Version tab.
4. If the file version is earlier than indicated below, the 
   installation is vulnerable.

File Name    File Version
arclib.dll   7.3.0.15

*For eTrust Intrusion Detection 2.0 the file is located in 
"Program Files\eTrust\Intrusion Detection\Common", and for eTrust 
Intrusion Detection 3.0 and 3.0 sp1, the file is located in 
"Program Files\CA\Intrusion Detection\Common".

For CA Anti-Virus r8.1 on non-Windows platforms:

Use the compver utility provided on the CD to determine the 
version of Arclib. If the version is less than 7.3.0.15, the 
installation is vulnerable. 

Example compver utility output:
     ------------------------------------------------
     COMPONENT NAME                           VERSION
     ------------------------------------------------
     eTrust Antivirus Arclib Archive Library  7.3.0.15
     ... (followed by other components)

For reference, the following are file names for arclib on 
non-Windows operating systems:

Operating System    File name
Solaris             libarclib.so
Linux               libarclib.so
Mac OS X            arclib.bundle
