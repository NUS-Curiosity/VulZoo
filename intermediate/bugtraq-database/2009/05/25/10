Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in GnuTLS might result in a Denial of Service,
spoofing or the generation of invalid keys.

Background
==========

GnuTLS is an Open Source implementation of the TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0
protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-libs/gnutls       < 2.6.6                            >= 2.6.6

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were found in GnuTLS:

* Miroslav Kratochvil reported that lib/pk-libgcrypt.c does not
  properly handle corrupt DSA signatures, possibly leading to a
  double-free vulnerability (CVE-2009-1415).

* Simon Josefsson reported that GnuTLS generates RSA keys stored in
  DSA structures when creating a DSA key (CVE-2009-1416).

* Romain Francoise reported that the
  _gnutls_x509_verify_certificate() function in lib/x509/verify.c does
  not perform time checks, resulting in the "gnutls-cli" program
  accepting X.509 certificates with validity times in the past or
  future (CVE-2009-1417).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to process a
specially crafted DSA certificate, possibly resulting in a Denial of
Service condition. NOTE: This issue might have other unspecified impact
including the execution of arbitrary code. Furthermore, a remote
attacker could spoof signatures on certificates and the "gnutls-cli"
application can be tricked into accepting an invalid certificate.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GnuTLS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/gnutls-2.6.6"
