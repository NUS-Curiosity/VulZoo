Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 08.11.09: Microsoft Office Web Components
 2000 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 08.11.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 11, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Office Web Components is a group of ActiveX controls that can be used to
view and edit Microsoft Office files such as spreadsheets and charts. It
is commonly used to allow a user to edit a spreadsheet in the browser.
The controls are installed with a default installation of Microsoft
Office. More information can be found at the vendor's website at the
following address.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability in
Microsoft Corp.'s Office Web Components 2000 could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged on user.

When instantiating a Spreadsheet object, it is possible to pass the
object a parameter that refers to an Excel file that will be retrieved
and then loaded. By using a long string for the parameter, it is
possible to case a stack based buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation results in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the logged-on user. Exploitation would require that an
attacker hosts a maliciously crafted page on a Web site and entice
users to visit the site. No further action is needed other than
following a link to a malicious Web page.
