1. *Advisory Information*

Title: SQL Injection in CS-Cart
Advisory ID: BONSAI-2009-0100
Advisory URL: http://www.bonsai-sec.com/research/vulnerabilities/cs-cart_SQL-injection-0100.txt
Date published: 2009-08-04
Vendors contacted: CS-Cart
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: SQL Injection
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2009-2579


3. *Software Description*

CS-Cart is an "out of the box" ecommerce software solution with
easy-to-use functionality that
allows to start selling online immediately. Its feature set fits into
businesses of any size, from
a small single-product shop to a fully-featured online storefront [0].


4. *Vulnerability Description*

SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a security
vulnerability occurring in the
database layer of an application. The vulnerability is present when
user input is either
incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in
SQL statements or user input
is not strongly typed and thereby unexpectedly executed.

For additional information, please look at references [1] and [2].


5. *Vulnerable packages*

Version <= 2.0.5


6. *Non-vulnerable packages*

CS-Cart developers informed us that all users should upgrade to the
latest version of CS-Cart,
(CS-Cart 2.0.6) which fixes this vulnerability. More information to be
found here:
    http://kb2.simtech/how-to-upgrade


7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered by Ryan Dewhurst ( ryan -at- bonsai-sec.com ).


8. *Technical Description*

A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the reward_points.post.php
script, more specifically in
the $sort_order variable. The vulnerability can be triggered by
logging into CS-Cart and browsing to:

/index.php?dispatch=reward_points.userlog&result_ids=pagination_contents&sort_by=timestamp&sort_order='

Which will generate a syntax error in the database. The following is
the corresponding piece of code:

reward_points.post.php:69
$userlog = db_get_array("SELECT change_id, action, timestamp, amount,
reason FROM
                        ?:reward_point_changes WHERE user_id = ?i
ORDER BY $sort_by $sort_order
                         $limit", $user_id);
