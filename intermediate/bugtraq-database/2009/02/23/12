Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities were found in GNU Emacs, possibly leading to
user-assisted execution of arbitrary code. One also affects edit-utils
in XEmacs.

Background
==========

GNU Emacs and XEmacs are highly extensible and customizable text
editors. edit-utils are miscellaneous extensions to XEmacs.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-editors/emacs          < 22.2-r3                   >= 22.2-r3
                                                          *>= 21.4-r17
                                                                  < 19
  2  app-xemacs/edit-utils       < 2.39                        >= 2.39
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Morten Welinder reports about GNU Emacs and edit-utils in XEmacs: By
shipping a .flc accompanying a source file (.c for example) and setting
font-lock-support-mode to fast-lock-mode in the source file through
local variables, any Lisp code in the .flc file is executed without
warning (CVE-2008-2142).

Romain Francoise reported a security risk in a feature of GNU Emacs
related to interacting with Python. The vulnerability arises because
Python, by default, prepends the current directory to the module search
path, allowing for arbitrary code execution when launched from a
specially crafted directory (CVE-2008-3949).

Impact
======

Remote attackers could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
in GNU Emacs, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary Emacs Lisp
code or arbitrary Python code with the privileges of the user running
GNU Emacs or XEmacs.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU Emacs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/emacs-22.2-r3"

All edit-utils users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-xemacs/edit-utils-2.39"
