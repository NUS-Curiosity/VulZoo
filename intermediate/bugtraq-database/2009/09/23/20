-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerability installations of Adobe RoboHelp Server. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the management web server listening by
default on port 8080. The Java Servlet handling POST requests to the
server does not properly sanitize user input. A specially crafted
request can bypass authentication allowing an attacker to upload and
execute arbitrary files. Successful exploitation can result in complete
system compromise under SYSTEM credentials.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
