Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Session Initiation
Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20090923-sip

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2009 September 23

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability exists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
implementation in Cisco IOSï¿½ Software that could allow an
unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
on an affected device when the Cisco Unified Border Element feature
is enabled.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. For devices that must run SIP there are no
workarounds; however, mitigations are available to limit exposure of
the vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at:

Affected Products
=================

This vulnerability only affects devices running Cisco IOS Software
with SIP voice services enabled.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco devices running affected Cisco IOS Software versions that are
configured to process SIP messages with the Cisco Unified Border
Element feature are affected. Cisco IOS devices that are not
configured for SIP and Cisco Unified Border Element feature are not
affected by this vulnerability.

Note: Cisco Unified Border Element feature (previously known as the
Cisco Multiservice IP-to-IP Gateway) is a special Cisco IOS Software
image that runs on Cisco multiservice gateway platforms. It provides
a network-to-network interface point for billing, security, call
admission control, quality of service, and signaling interworking.

Cisco Unified Border Element feature requires the "voice service voip" 
command and the "allow-connections" subcommand. An example of an
affected configuration is as follows:

     voice service voip
       allow-connections from-type to to-type 
    ...
    !

Recent versions of Cisco IOS Software do not process SIP messages by
default. Creating a dial peer by issuing the command "dial-peer voice"
will start the SIP processes, causing the Cisco IOS device to process
SIP messages. In addition, several features within Cisco Unified
Communications Manager Express, such as ePhones, once configured will
also automatically start the SIP process, which will cause the device
to start processing SIP messages. An example of an affected
configuration is as follows:

    dial-peer voice <Voice dial-peer tag> voip
     ...
    !

In addition to inspecting the Cisco IOS device configuration for a
dial-peer command that causes the device to process SIP messages,
administrators can also use the command show processes | include SIP
to determine whether Cisco IOS Software is running the processes that
handle SIP messages. In the following example, the presence of the
processes CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET or CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET indicates that the
Cisco IOS device is processing SIP messages:

        Router#show processes | include SIP
         149 Mwe 40F48254            4          1    400023108/24000  0 CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET
         150 Mwe 40F48034            4          1    400023388/24000  0 CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET

warning Warning: Since there are several ways a device running Cisco
IOS Software can start processing SIP messages, it is recommended
that the "show processes | include SIP" command be used to determine
whether the device is processing SIP messages instead of relying on
the presence of specific configuration commands.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
show version command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router#show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of
C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The SIP Application Layer Gateway (ALG), which is used by the Cisco
IOS NAT and firewall features of Cisco IOS Software, is not affected
by this vulnerability. Cisco IOS XE Software and Cisco IOS XR
Software are not affected by this vulnerability. No other Cisco
products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Details
=======

SIP is a popular signaling protocol that is used to manage voice and
video calls across IP networks such as the Internet. SIP is
responsible for handling all aspects of call setup and termination.
Voice and video are the most popular types of sessions that SIP
handles, but the protocol has the flexibility to accommodate other
applications that require call setup and termination. SIP call
signaling can use UDP (port 5060), TCP (port 5060), or TLS (TCP port
5061) as the underlying transport protocol.

The Cisco Unified Border Element (previously known as the Cisco
Multiservice IP-to-IP Gateway) is a special Cisco IOS Software image
that runs on Cisco multiservice gateway platforms. It provides a
network-to-network interface point for billing, security, call
admission control, quality of service, and signaling interworking.

For more information about Cisco Unified Border Element refer to the
following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps5640/index.html

A DoS vulnerability exists in the SIP implementation in Cisco IOS
Software when devices are running a Cisco IOS image that contains the
Cisco Unified Border Element feature. This vulnerability is triggered
by processing a series of crafted SIP messages.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsx25880 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2009-2870.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS Software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
release train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the
earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the
anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed
in the "First Fixed Release" column of the table. The "Recommended
Release" column indicates the releases which have fixes for all the
published vulnerabilities at the time of this Advisory. A device
running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release
in a specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to
be vulnerable. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or
later than the release in the "Recommended Releases" column of the
table.

Note: No Cisco IOS-XE or Cisco IOS Software Modularity releases are
affected by this vulnerability.

Workarounds
===========

If the affected Cisco IOS device requires SIP for VoIP services, SIP
cannot be disabled, and therefore, no workarounds are available.
Users are advised to apply mitigation techniques to help limit
exposure to the vulnerability. Mitigation consists of allowing only
legitimate devices to connect to the routers. To increase
effectiveness, the mitigation must be coupled with anti-spoofing
measures on the network edge. This action is required because SIP can
use UDP as the transport protocol.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the companion document "Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the
Denial of Service Vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager and Cisco IOS Software", which is available at the following
location:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20090923-voice.shtml

Disable SIP Listening Ports
+--------------------------

For devices that do not require SIP to be enabled, the simplest and
most effective workaround is to disable SIP processing on the device.
Some versions of Cisco IOS Software allow administrators to
accomplish this with the following commands:

    sip-ua
     no transport udp
     no transport tcp
     no transport tcp tls

Warning: When applying this workaround to devices that are
processing Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or H.323 calls, the
device will not stop SIP processing while active calls are being
processed. Under these circumstances, this workaround should be
implemented during a maintenance window when active calls can be
briefly stopped.

The "show udp connections", "show tcp brief all", and "show processes |
include SIP" commands can be used to confirm that the SIP UDP and TCP
ports are closed after applying this workaround.

Depending on the Cisco IOS Software version in use, the output of
"show ip sockets" still showed UDP port 5060 open, but sending
something to that port caused the SIP process to emit the following
message:

    *Feb  2 11:36:47.691: sip_udp_sock_process_read: SIP UDP Listener is
    DISABLED 

Control Plane Policing
+---------------------

For devices that need to offer SIP services it is possible to use
Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to block SIP traffic to the device from
untrusted sources. Cisco IOS Releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T,
12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP may be configured on a
device to protect the management and control planes to minimize the
risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly
permitting only authorized traffic sent to infrastructure devices in
accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The
following example can be adapted to the network

    
    !-- The 192.168.1.0/24 network and the 172.16.1.1 host are trusted.
    !-- Everything else is not trusted. The following access list is used
    !-- to determine what traffic needs to be dropped by a control plane
    !-- policy (the CoPP feature.) If the access list matches (permit)
    !-- then traffic will be dropped and if the access list does not
    !-- match (deny) then traffic will be processed by the router.
    
    
    access-list 100 deny udp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5061
    access-list 100 deny udp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5061
    access-list 100 permit udp any any eq 5060
    access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5060
    access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5061
    
    
    !-- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4
    !-- traffic in accordance with existing security policies and
    !-- configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent
    !-- to infrastructure devices.
    !-- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by
    !-- the CoPP feature.
    
    
    class-map match-all drop-sip-class
      match access-group 100
    
    
    !-- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the
    !-- Control-Plane of the device.
    
    
    policy-map drop-sip-traffic
     class drop-sip-class
      drop
    
    
    !-- Apply the Policy-Map to the Control-Plane of the
    !-- device.
    
    
    control-plane
     service-policy input drop-sip-traffic

Warning: Because SIP can use UDP as a transport protocol, it
is possible to easily spoof the IP address of the sender, which may
defeat access control lists that permit communication to these ports
from trusted IP addresses.

In the above CoPP example, the access control entries (ACEs) that
match the potential exploit packets with the "permit" action result
in these packets being discarded by the policy-map "drop" function,
while packets that match the "deny" action (not shown) are not
affected by the policy-map drop function. Additional information on
the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/coppwp_gs.html
