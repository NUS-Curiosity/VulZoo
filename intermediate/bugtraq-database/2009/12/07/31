 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2008:233-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libcdaudio
 Date    : December 7, 2008
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A heap overflow was found in the CDDB retrieval code of libcdaudio,
 which could result in the execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2008-5030).
 
 In addition, the fixes for CVE-2005-0706 were not applied to newer
 libcdaudio packages as shipped with Mandriva Linux, so the patch to fix
 that issue has been applied to 2008.1 and 2009.0 (this was originally
 fixed in MDKSA-2005:075).  This issue is a buffer overflow flaw found
 by Joseph VanAndel.  Corporate 3.0 has this fix already applied.
 
 The updated packages have been patched to prevent these issues.

 Update:

 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
