 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2009:287-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : xpdf
 Date    : December 4, 2009
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in xpdf:
 
 Integer overflow in the SplashBitmap::SplashBitmap function in Xpdf 3.x
 before 3.02pl4 and Poppler before 0.12.1 might allow remote attackers
 to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF document that triggers a
 heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained
 from third party information.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists
 because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-1188 (CVE-2009-3603).
 
 The Splash::drawImage function in Splash.cc in Xpdf 2.x and 3.x
 before 3.02pl4, and Poppler 0.x, as used in GPdf and kdegraphics KPDF,
 does not properly allocate memory, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted PDF document that triggers a NULL pointer
 dereference or a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-3604).
 
 Integer overflow in the PSOutputDev::doImageL1Sep function in Xpdf
 before 3.02pl4, and Poppler 0.x, as used in kdegraphics KPDF, might
 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF
 document that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-3606).
 
 Integer overflow in the ObjectStream::ObjectStream function in XRef.cc
 in Xpdf 3.x before 3.02pl4 and Poppler before 0.12.1, as used in
 GPdf, kdegraphics KPDF, CUPS pdftops, and teTeX, might allow remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF document that
 triggers a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-3608).
 
 Integer overflow in the ImageStream::ImageStream function in Stream.cc
 in Xpdf before 3.02pl4 and Poppler before 0.12.1, as used in GPdf,
 kdegraphics KPDF, and CUPS pdftops, allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted PDF
 document that triggers a NULL pointer dereference or buffer over-read
 (CVE-2009-3609).
 
 This update fixes these vulnerabilities.

 Update:

 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
