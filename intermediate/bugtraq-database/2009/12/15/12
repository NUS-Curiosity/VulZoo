    VMware vCenter Stage Manager 1.x

3. Problem Description

 a. WebWorks Help - Cross-site scripting vulnerability

    WebWorks Help is an output format that allows online Help to be
    delivered on multiple platforms and browsers, which makes it easy
    to publish information on the Web or on an enterprise intranet.
    WebWorks Help is used for creating the online help pages that are
    available in VMware WebAccess, Lab Manager and Stage Manager.

    WebWorks Help doesn't sufficiently sanitize incoming requests which
    may result in cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in applications
    that are built with WebWorks Help.

    Exploitation of these vulnerabilities in VMware products requires
    tricking a user to click on a malicious link or to open a malicious
    web page while they are logged in into vCenter, ESX or VMware
    Server using WebAccess, or logged in into Stage Manager or Lab
    Manager.

    Successful exploitation can lead to theft of user credentials. These
    vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has
    access to the Service Console network.

    Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
    Service Console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
    http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726 for more
    information on VMware security best practices.

    Client-side protection measures included with current browsers are not
    always able to prevent these attacks from being executed.

    VMware would like to thank Daniel Grzelak and Alex Kouzemtchenko of
    stratsec (www.stratsec.net) for finding and reporting this issue.
    VMware would also like to thank Ben Allums of WebWorks.com for working
    on the remediation of this issue with us.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2009-3731 to this issue.
