Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Cisco WebEx WRF Player Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20091216-webex

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20091216-webex.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2009 December 16 1600 UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WebEx
Recording Format (WRF) Player. In some cases, exploitation of the
vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
on the system of a targeted user.

The Cisco WebEx WRF Player is an application that is used to play back
WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on the computer of an
on-line meeting attendee. The WRF Player can be automatically installed
when the user accesses a WRF file that is hosted on a WebEx server. The
WRF Player can also be manually installed for offline playback after
downloading the application from www.webex.com.

If the WRF Player was automatically installed, the WebEx WRF Player
will be automatically upgraded to the latest, non-vulnerable version
when users access a WRF file hosted on a WebEx server. If the WebEx
WRF Player was manually installed, users will need to manually install
a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from
www.webex.com.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20091216-webex.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
- -------------------

The vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx
WRF Player. Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the
player are affected. Affected versions of the WRF Player are those prior
to the "first fixed" versions, which are shown in the section "Software
Versions and Fixes" of this advisory.

To check if a Cisco WebEx server is running an affected version of the
WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx server and go
to the Support -> Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client
build will be displayed on the right-hand side of the page under "About
Support Center", for example "Client build: 27.11.0.3328".

There is no way to check if a manually installed version of the WRF
Player is affected by these vulnerabilities. Therefore, Cisco recommends
that users upgrade to the most current version of the player that is
available from http://www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
- ---------------------------------

The Cisco WebEx Player for the WebEx Advanced Recording Format (ARF)
file format is not affected by these vulnerabilities.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The WebEx meeting service is a hosted multimedia conferencing solution
that is managed by and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The WebEx Recording
Format (WRF) is a file format that is used to store WebEx meeting
recordings that have been recorded on the computer of an on-line meeting
attendee. The WRF Player is an application that is used to play back
and edit WRF files (files with .wrf extensions). The WRF Player can be
automatically installed when the user accesses a WRF file that is hosted
on a WebEx server (stream playback mode). The WRF Player can also be
manually installed after downloading the application from www.webex.com
to play back WRF files locally (offline playback mode).

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the WRF Player. The
vulnerabilities may lead to a crash of the WRF Player application, or in
some cases, lead to remote code execution.

To exploit a vulnerability, a malicious WRF file would need to be opened
by the WRF Player application. An attacker may be able to accomplish
this by providing the malicious WRF file directly to users (for example,
via e-mail), or by convincing users to visit a malicious website. The
vulnerability cannot be triggered by users attending a WebEx meeting.

These vulnerabilities have been assigned the following Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers:

  * CVE-2009-2875
  * CVE-2009-2876
  * CVE-2009-2877
  * CVE-2009-2878
  * CVE-2009-2879
  * CVE-2009-2880

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory based
on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in
this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS
at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

* Multiple Cisco WebEx Player Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities (all
vulnerabilities in this advisory)

CVSS Base Score - 9.3
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Medium
    Authentication -           None
    Confidentiality Impact -   Complete
    Integrity Impact -         Complete
    Availability Impact -      Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 7.7
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities described in this
document could result in a crash of the Cisco WebEx WRF Player
application, and in some cases, allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the targeted system with the privileges of the user
running the WRF Player application.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

The table below contains "First Fixed" information for the Cisco WebEx
WRF Player that is automatically downloaded from a WebEx site when a WRF
hosted on a WebEx site is accessed (stream playback mode). Fixes are
cumulative within a major release so for example, if release 27.10.1 is
fixed, then release 27.10.2 will have the fix too.

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Platform  | Major Release 26.x  | Major Release 27.x       |
|-----------+---------------------+--------------------------|
| Microsoft | 26.49.32; available | 27.10.x; available now   |
| Windows   | now except lockdown | for non-PSO and          |
|           | sites               | non-lockdown sites       |
|-----------+---------------------+--------------------------|
|           | 26.49.35; available | 27.11.8; available now   |
| Mac OS X  | early February 2010 | for non-PSO and          |
|           |                     | non-lockdown sites       |
|-----------+---------------------+--------------------------|
|           | 26.49.35; available | 27.11.8; available now   |
| Linux     | early February 2010 | for non-PSO and          |
|           |                     | non-lockdown sites       |
+------------------------------------------------------------+

PSO and lockdown sites running 27.x will receive the fixes for these
vulnerabilities during the next emergency patching (EP) cycle. This
advisory will be updated to indicate a specific timeline once one is
available.

If the WRF Player was automatically installed, the WebEx WRF Player will
be automatically upgraded to the latest, non-vulnerable version when
users access a WRF file hosted on a WebEx server.

If the WebEx WRF Player was manually installed, users will need to
manually install a new version of the player after downloading the
latest version from www.webex.com.
