Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the worst of
which leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL statements.

Background
==========

Ruby on Rails is a web-application and persistence framework.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-ruby/rails       < 2.2.2                             >= 2.3.5
                                                          *>= 2.2.3-r1

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were discovered:

* sameer reported that lib/action_controller/cgi_process.rb removes
  the :cookie_only attribute from the default session options
  (CVE-2007-6077), due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-5380 (GLSA
  200711-17).

* Tobias Schlottke reported that the :limit and :offset parameters of
  ActiveRecord::Base.find() are not properly sanitized before being
  processed (CVE-2008-4094).

* Steve from Coderrr reported that the CRSF protection in
  protect_from_forgery() does not parse the text/plain MIME format
  (CVE-2008-7248).

* Nate reported a documentation error that leads to the assumption
  that a block returning nil passed to
  authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest() would deny access to the
  requested resource (CVE-2009-2422).

* Brian Mastenbrook reported an input sanitation flaw, related to
  multibyte characters (CVE-2009-3009).

* Gabe da Silveira reported an input sanitation flaw in the
  strip_tags() function (CVE-2009-4214).

* Coda Hale reported an information disclosure vulnerability related
  to HMAC digests (CVE-2009-3086).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests to a vulnerable
application, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL
statements or a circumvention of access control. A remote attacker
could also conduct session fixation attacks to hijack a user's session
or bypass the CSRF protection mechanism, or furthermore conduct
Cross-Site Scripting attacks or forge a digest via multiple attempts.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ruby on Rails 2.3.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-ruby/rails-2.3.5"

All Ruby on Rails 2.2.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "=dev-ruby/rails-2.2.3-r1"

NOTE: All applications using Ruby on Rails should also be configured to
use the latest version available by running "rake rails:update" inside
the application directory.
