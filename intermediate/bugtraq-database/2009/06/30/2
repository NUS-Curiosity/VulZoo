Synopsis
========

An error in the Apache Tomcat JK Connector might allow for an
information disclosure flaw.

Background
==========

The Apache Tomcat JK Connector (aka mod_jk) connects the Tomcat
application server with the Apache HTTP Server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apache/mod_jk      < 1.2.27                         >= 1.2.27

Description
===========

The Red Hat Security Response Team discovered that mod_jk does not
properly handle (1) requests setting the "Content-Length" header while
not providing data and (2) clients sending repeated requests very
quickly.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests or a large
number of requests at a time, possibly resulting in the disclosure of a
response intended for another client.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Apache Tomcat JK Connector users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apache/mod_jk-1.2.27"

References
==========

  [ 1 ] CVE-2008-5519
