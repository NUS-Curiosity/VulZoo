Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-09-036
June 10, 2009

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2009-1529

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Internet Explorer

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific vulnerability exists when calling the setCapture method on
a range of objects. When setCapture is called on a collection of
specially crafted objects memory becomes corrupted. When the capture is
released, arbitrary memory is accessed potentially leading to remote
code execution. Exploitation of this vulnerability will lead to system
compromise under the credentials of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
