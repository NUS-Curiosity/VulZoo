-- CVE ID:
CVE-2009-1134

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Office Excel

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. Exploitation
requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious XLS
file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of the BIFF file format used
by Microsoft Excel. When Excel 2007 encounters a malformed Qsir record
(0x806) user data is improperly handled leading to potential code
execution. Successful exploitation of this can lead to a remote
compromise of the affected system running under the credentials of the
currently logged in user.
