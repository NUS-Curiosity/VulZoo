Synopsis
========

libwmf bundles an old GD version which contains a "use-after-free"
vulnerability.

Background
==========

libwmf is a library for converting WMF files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /   Vulnerable   /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libwmf     < 0.2.8.4-r3                  >= 0.2.8.4-r3

Description
===========

The embedded fork of the GD library introduced a "use-after-free"
vulnerability in a modification which is specific to libwmf.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted WMF
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libwmf users should upgrade to the latest version which no longer
builds the GD library:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libwmf-0.2.8.4-r3"
