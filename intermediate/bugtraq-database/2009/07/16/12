Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in PulseAudio may allow a local user to execute code
with escalated privileges.

Background
==========

PulseAudio is a network-enabled sound server with an advanced plug-in
system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /   Vulnerable   /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/pulseaudio      < 0.9.9-r54              >= 0.9.9-r54

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team discovered
that the pulseaudio binary is installed setuid root, and does not drop
privileges before re-executing itself. The vulnerability has
independently been reported to oCERT by Yorick Koster.

Impact
======

A local user who has write access to any directory on the file system
containing /usr/bin can exploit this vulnerability using a race
condition to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

Workaround
==========

Ensure that the file system holding /usr/bin does not contain
directories that are writable for unprivileged users.

Resolution
==========

All PulseAudio users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=media-sound/pulseaudio-0.9.9-r54"
