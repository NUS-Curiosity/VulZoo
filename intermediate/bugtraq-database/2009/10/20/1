 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2009:283
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : cups
 Date    : October 19, 2009
 Affected: Corporate 3.0, Multi Network Firewall 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple integer overflows in the JBIG2 decoder in
 Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, and
 other products allow remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (crash) via a crafted PDF file, related to (1)
 JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg, (2) JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg,
 and (3) JBIG2Stream::readGenericBitmap. (CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147)
 
 Integer overflow in the TIFF image decoding routines in CUPS 1.3.9 and
 earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
 crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image,
 which is not properly handled by the (1) _cupsImageReadTIFF function
 in the imagetops filter and (2) imagetoraster filter, leading to a
 heap-based buffer overflow. (CVE-2009-0163)
 
 The JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier,
 and other products allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) via a crafted PDF file that triggers a free of uninitialized
 memory. (CVE-2009-0166)
 
 Heap-based buffer overflow in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9,
 and probably other products, allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via a PDF file with crafted JBIG2 symbol dictionary
 segments (CVE-2009-0195).
 
 Multiple integer overflows in the pdftops filter in CUPS 1.1.17,
 1.1.22, and 1.3.7 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
 PDF file that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, possibly
 related to (1) Decrypt.cxx, (2) FoFiTrueType.cxx, (3) gmem.c,
 (4) JBIG2Stream.cxx, and (5) PSOutputDev.cxx in pdftops/. NOTE:
 the JBIG2Stream.cxx vector may overlap CVE-2009-1179. (CVE-2009-0791)
 
 The JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier,
 Poppler before 0.10.6, and other products allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PDF file that triggers
 an out-of-bounds read. (CVE-2009-0799)
 
 Multiple input validation flaws in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2
 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, Poppler before 0.10.6, and
 other products allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 a crafted PDF file. (CVE-2009-0800)
 
 The ippReadIO function in cups/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 1.3.10
 does not properly initialize memory for IPP request packets, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
 dereference and daemon crash) via a scheduler request with two
 consecutive IPP_TAG_UNSUPPORTED tags. (CVE-2009-0949)
 
 Integer overflow in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier,
 CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, Poppler before 0.10.6, and other products
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF
 file. (CVE-2009-1179)
 
 The JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier,
 Poppler before 0.10.6, and other products allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file that triggers a free
 of invalid data. (CVE-2009-1180)
 
 The JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier,
 Poppler before 0.10.6, and other products allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PDF file that triggers
 a NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2009-1181)
 
 Multiple buffer overflows in the JBIG2 MMR decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2
 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, Poppler before 0.10.6, and
 other products allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 a crafted PDF file. (CVE-2009-1182)
 
 The JBIG2 MMR decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and
 earlier, Poppler before 0.10.6, and other products allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and hang)
 via a crafted PDF file. (CVE-2009-1183)
 
 The directory-services functionality in the scheduler in CUPS 1.1.17
 and 1.1.22 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (cupsd
 daemon outage or crash) via manipulations of the timing of CUPS browse
 packets, related to a pointer use-after-delete flaw. (CVE-2009-1196)
 
 Two integer overflow flaws were found in the CUPS pdftops filter. An
 attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause pdftops
 to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the lp user if
 the file was printed. (CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)
 
 This update corrects the problems.
