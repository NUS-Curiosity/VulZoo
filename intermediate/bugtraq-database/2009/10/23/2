Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin, leading to the
remote execution of arbitrary code, unauthorized information
disclosure, or Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Pidgin is a client for a variety of instant messaging protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/pidgin     < 2.5.9-r1                          >= 2.5.9-r1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Pidgin:

* Yuriy Kaminskiy reported that the OSCAR protocol implementation in
  Pidgin misinterprets the ICQWebMessage message type as the ICQSMS
  message type, triggering an allocation of a large amount of memory
  (CVE-2009-1889).

* Federico Muttis of Core Security Technologies reported that the
  msn_slplink_process_msg() function in
  libpurple/protocols/msn/slplink.c in libpurple as used in Pidgin
  doesn't properly process incoming SLP messages, triggering an
  overwrite of an arbitrary memory location (CVE-2009-2694). NOTE: This
  issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for
  CVE-2009-1376 (GLSA 200905-07).

* bugdave reported that protocols/jabber/auth.c in libpurple as used
  in Pidgin does not follow the "require TSL/SSL" preference when
  connecting to older Jabber servers that do not follow the XMPP
  specification, resulting in a connection to the server without the
  expected encryption (CVE-2009-3026).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted SLP (via MSN) or ICQ web
messages, possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Pidgin, unauthorized information
disclosure, or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Pidgin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =net-im/pidgin-2.5.9-r1
