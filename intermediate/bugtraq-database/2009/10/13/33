Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.13.09: Microsoft Windows GDI+ TIFF
 File Parsing Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.13.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 13, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

The GDI+ library 'GdiPlus.dll' provides access to a number of graphics
methods, via a class based API. For more information on GDI+, please
visit following URL.

http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533798.aspx

Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) is a container format for storing
images. For more information about TIFF, please visit following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap based buffer overflow vulnerability in
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows GDI+ could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

This vulnerability occurs when parsing a malformed TIFF file. By
supplying incorrect values in a BitsPerSample tag, it is possible to
trigger a heap based buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the current user. Social engineering is required, as an
attacker must trick a user into viewing an image in the Web Browser,
viewing an e-mail with embedded image, opening an office file with
embbeded image, or downloading an image file and opening it within a
graphics rendering program.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Windows XP
Service Pack 2. Please see the Microsoft bulletin for additional details
on affected software.

V. WORKAROUND

The following workarounds can be employed to mitigate exposure to this
vulnerability:

*Restrict access to gdiplus.dll
*Unregister vgx.dll

Instructions for employing/removing these workarounds can be found in
the bulletin.
