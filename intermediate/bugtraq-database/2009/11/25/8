Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the UW IMAP toolkit and the
c-client library, the worst of which leading to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The UW IMAP toolkit is a daemon for the IMAP and POP3 network mail
protocols. The c-client library provides an API for IMAP, POP3 and
other protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-libs/c-client       < 2007e                          >= 2007e
  2  net-mail/uw-imap        < 2007e                          >= 2007e
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the UW IMAP toolkit:

* Aron Andersson and Jan Sahlin of Bitsec reported boundary errors in
  the "tmail" and "dmail" utilities when processing overly long mailbox
  names, leading to stack-based buffer overflows (CVE-2008-5005).

* An error in smtp.c in the c-client library was found, leading to a
  NULL pointer dereference vulnerability (CVE-2008-5006).

* Ludwig Nussel reported an off-by-one error in the
  rfc822_output_char() function in the RFC822BUFFER routines in the
  c-client library, as used by the UW IMAP toolkit (CVE-2008-5514).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send an e-mail to a destination mailbox name
composed of a username and '+' character followed by a long string,
possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code. A local attacker
could gain privileges by specifying a long folder extension argument to
the tmail or dmail program. Furthermore, a remote attacker could send a
specially crafted mail message to the UW IMAP toolkit or another daemon
using the c-client library, leading to a Denial of Service. A remote
SMTP server could respond to the QUIT command with a close of the TCP
connection instead of the expected 221 response code, possibly leading
to a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All c-client library users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/c-client-2007e"

All UW IMAP toolkit users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/uw-imap-2007e"
