Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin, allowing for
remote arbitrary code execution, Denial of Service and service
spoofing.

Background
==========

Pidgin (formerly Gaim) is an instant messaging client for a variety of
instant messaging protocols. It is based on the libpurple instant
messaging library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/pidgin       < 2.5.1                              >= 2.5.1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin and the
libpurple library:

* A participant to the TippingPoint ZDI reported multiple integer
  overflows in the msn_slplink_process_msg() function in the MSN
  protocol implementation (CVE-2008-2927).

* Juan Pablo Lopez Yacubian is credited for reporting a
  use-after-free flaw in msn_slplink_process_msg() in the MSN protocol
  implementation (CVE-2008-2955).

* The included UPnP server does not limit the size of data to be
  downloaded for UPnP service discovery, according to a report by
  Andrew Hunt and Christian Grothoff (CVE-2008-2957).

* Josh Triplett discovered that the NSS plugin for libpurple does not
  properly verify SSL certificates (CVE-2008-3532).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted messages or files using
the MSN protocol which could result in the execution of arbitrary code
or crash Pidgin. NOTE: Successful exploitation might require the
victim's interaction. Furthermore, an attacker could conduct
man-in-the-middle attacks to obtain sensitive information using bad
certificates and cause memory and disk resources to exhaust.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Pidgin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/pidgin-2.5.1"
