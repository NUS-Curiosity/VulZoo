Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The following Cisco ONS products are confirmed not vulnerable:

  * Cisco ONS 15800 Series
  * Cisco ONS 15500 Series Extended Service Platform
  * Cisco ONS 15302
  * Cisco ONS 15305
  * Cisco ONS 15200 Series Metro DWDM Systems
  * Cisco ONS 15190 Series IP Transport Concentrator

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The affected Cisco 15310-CL, 15310-MA, ONS 15327, ONS 15454, ONS
15454 SDH, and ONS 15600 hardware is managed through the CTX,
CTX2500, XTC, TCC/TCC+/TCC2/TCC2P, TCCi/TCC2/TCC2P, and TSC control
cards respectively. These control cards are usually connected to a
Data Communications Network (DCN). In this context the term DCN is
used to denote the network that transports management information
between a management station and the network entity (NE). This
definition of DCN is sometimes referred to as Management
Communication Network (MCN). The DCN is usually physically or
logically separated from the optical data network and isolated from
the Internet. This limits the exposure to the exploitation of this
vulnerability from the Internet.

A crafted stream of TCP traffic to the control cards on a node will
result in a reset of the corresponding control cards on this node. A
complete 3-way handshake is required on any open TCP port to be able
to exploit this vulnerability.

The timing for the data channels traversing the switch is provided by
the control cards.

When an active and a standby Cisco ONS 15310-MA, ONS 15310-CL, ONS
15327, ONS 15454 or ONS 15454 SDH control card reloads at the same
time, the synchronous data channels traversing the switch drop
traffic until the card comes back online. Asynchronous data channels
traversing the switch are not impacted. Manageability functions
provided by the network element using the CTX, CTX2500, XTC or TCC/
TCC+/TCC2/TCC2P control cards are not available until the control
card comes back online.

On the Cisco ONS 15600 hardware, whenever both the active and standby
control cards are rebooting at the same time, there is no impact to
the data channels traversing the switch because the TSC performs a
software reset which does not impact the timing being provided by the
TSC for the data channels.

Manageability functions provided by the network element through the
TSC control cards are not available until the control card comes back
online.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsr41128 
and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 
identifier CVE-2008-3818.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS Base Score - 7.8

  Access Vector         : Network
  Access Complexity     : Low
  Authentication        : None
  Confidentiality Impact: None
  Integrity Impact      : None
  Availability Impact   : Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 6.4

  Exploitability        : Functional
  Remediation Level     : Official-Fix
  Report Confidence     : Confirmed

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will result in a reset
of the node's control card. Repeated attempts to exploit this
vulnerability could result in a sustained DoS condition, dropping the
synchronous data channels traversing the switch (Cisco ONS 15310-MA,
ONS 15310-CL, ONS 15327, ONS 15454, ONS 15454 SDH) and preventing
manageability functions provided by the network element control cards
(all ONS switches) until the control card comes back online.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. The following
general mitigation actions help prevent remote exploitation:

  * Isolate DCN:
    Ensuring the DCN is physically or logically separated from the
    customer network and isolated from the Internet will limit the
    exposure to the exploitation of these vulnerabilities from the
    Internet or customer networks.
  * Apply Transit Access Control Lists:
    Apply access control lists (ACLs) on routers / switches /
    firewalls installed in front of the vulnerable network devices
    such that TCP/IP traffic destined for the CTX, CTX2500, XTC, TCC2
    /TCC2+/TCC2P, or TSC control cards on the ONS is allowed only
    from the network management workstations.
    For examples on how to apply ACLs on Cisco routers, refer to the
    white paper "Transit Access Control Lists: Filtering at Your
    Edge", which is available at the following link:
