Title: CA20090126-01: CA Anti-Virus Engine Detection Evasion 
Multiple Vulnerabilities


CA Advisory Reference: CA20090126-01


CA Advisory Date: 2009-01-26


Reported By:
Thierry Zoller and Sergio Alvarez of n.runs AG


Impact: A remote attacker can evade detection.


Summary: The CA Anti-Virus engine contains multiple 
vulnerabilities that can allow a remote attacker to evade 
detection by the Anti-Virus engine by creating a malformed archive 
file in one of several common file archive formats. CA has 
released a new Anti-Virus engine to address the vulnerabilities. 
The vulnerabilities, CVE-2009-0042, are due to improper handling 
of malformed archive files by the Anti-Virus engine. A remote 
attacker can create a malformed archive file that potentially 
contains malware and evade anti-virus detection.

Note: After files have been extracted from an archive, the desktop 
Anti-Virus engine is able to scan all files for malware. 
Consequently, detection evasion can be a concern for gateway 
anti-virus software if archives are not scanned, but the risk is 
effectively mitigated by the desktop anti-virus engine.


Mitigating Factors: See note above.


Severity: CA has given these vulnerabilities a Low risk rating.

Non-Affected Products:
CA Anti-Virus engine with arclib version 7.3.0.15 installed


Affected Platforms:
Windows
UNIX
Linux
Solaris
Mac OS X
NetWare


Status and Recommendation:
CA released arclib 7.3.0.15 in September 2008.  If your product is 
configured for automatic updates, you should already be protected, 
and you need to take no action.  If your product is not configured 
for automatic updates, then you simply need to run the update 
utility included with your product.


How to determine if you are affected:

For products on Windows:

1. Using Windows Explorer, locate the file "arclib.dll". By 
   default, the file is located in the 
   "C:\Program Files\CA\SharedComponents\ScanEngine" directory (*).
2. Right click on the file and select Properties.
3. Select the Version tab.
4. If the file version is earlier than indicated below, the 
   installation is vulnerable.

File Name    File Version
arclib.dll   7.3.0.15

*For eTrust Intrusion Detection 2.0 the file is located in 
"Program Files\eTrust\Intrusion Detection\Common", and for eTrust 
Intrusion Detection 3.0 and 3.0 sp1, the file is located in 
"Program Files\CA\Intrusion Detection\Common".

For CA Anti-Virus r8.1 on non-Windows platforms:

Use the compver utility provided on the CD to determine the 
version of Arclib. If the version is less than 7.3.0.15, the 
installation is vulnerable. 

Example compver utility output:
     ------------------------------------------------
     COMPONENT NAME                           VERSION
     ------------------------------------------------
     eTrust Antivirus Arclib Archive Library  7.3.0.15
     ... (followed by other components)

For reference, the following are file names for arclib on 
non-Windows operating systems:

Operating System    File name
Solaris             libarclib.so
Linux               libarclib.so
Mac OS X            arclib.bundle


Workaround: 
Do not open email attachments or download files from untrusted 
sources.
