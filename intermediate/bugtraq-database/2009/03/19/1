Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, the worst
of which may allow for remote code execution.

Background
==========

phpMyAdmin is a web-based management tool for MySQL databases.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/phpmyadmin     < 2.11.9.4                      >= 2.11.9.4

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin:

* libraries/database_interface.lib.php in phpMyAdmin allows remote
  authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a request to
  server_databases.php with a sort_by parameter containing PHP
  sequences, which are processed by create_function (CVE-2008-4096).

* Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in pmd_pdf.php allows
  remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the db
  parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-6942 and CVE-2007-5977
  (CVE-2008-4775).

* Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin
  allows remote authenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions
  as the administrator via a link or IMG tag to tbl_structure.php with
  a modified table parameter. NOTE: this can be leveraged to conduct
  SQL injection attacks and execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-5621).

* Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in
  phpMyAdmin allow remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks
  via unknown vectors related to the table parameter, a different
  vector than CVE-2008-5621 (CVE-2008-5622).

Impact
======

A remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the rights of the
webserver, inject and execute SQL with the rights of phpMyAdmin or
conduct XSS attacks against other users.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.11.9.4"
