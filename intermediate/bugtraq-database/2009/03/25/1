Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Squid which allow for
remote Denial of Service attacks.

Background
==========

Squid is a full-featured web proxy cache.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-proxy/squid       < 2.7.6                            >= 2.7.6

Description
===========

* The arrayShrink function in lib/Array.c can cause an array to
  shrink to 0 entries, which triggers an assert error. NOTE: this issue
  is due to an incorrect fix for CVE-2007-6239 (CVE-2008-1612).

* An invalid version number in a HTTP request may trigger an
  assertion in HttpMsg.c and HttpStatusLine.c (CVE-2009-0478).

Impact
======

The issues allows for Denial of Service attacks against the service via
an HTTP request with an invalid version number and other specially
crafted requests.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/squid-2.7.6"
