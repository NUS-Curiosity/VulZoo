As an update, this issue also affects 10.0.22.87 at least on Windows
and OS X.  I've seen some Linux distributions (e.g., [1]) claim that
10.0.22.87 fixes this bug (aka CVE-2008-4546), but I think this is
mistaken.

You can easily reproduce this bug (i.e., crash your browser) by
visiting http://flashcrash.dempsky.org/.  Be sure to tell your
friends: it can be the next Rick Roll.
