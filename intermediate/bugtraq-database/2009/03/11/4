Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified, the worst of which allow
arbitrary code execution on a user's system via a malicious Flash file.

Background
==========

The Adobe Flash Player is a renderer for the popular SWF file format,
which is commonly used to provide interactive websites, digital
experiences and mobile content.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /   Vulnerable   /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/netscape-flash     < 10.0.22.87             >= 10.0.22.87

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Flash Player:

* The access scope of SystemsetClipboard() allows ActionScript
  programs to execute the method without user interaction
  (CVE-2008-3873).

* The access scope of FileReference.browse() and
  FileReference.download() allows ActionScript programs to execute the
  methods without user interaction (CVE-2008-4401).

* The Settings Manager controls can be disguised as normal graphical
  elements. This so-called "clickjacking" vulnerability was disclosed
  by Robert Hansen of SecTheory, Jeremiah Grossman of WhiteHat
  Security, Eduardo Vela, Matthew Mastracci of DotSpots, and Liu Die Yu
  of TopsecTianRongXin (CVE-2008-4503).

* Matthew Dempsky reported a null-pointer dereference flaw when
  loading two SWF files compiled with different Flash versions from the
  same URI (CVE-2008-4546).

* Adan Barth (UC Berkely) and Collin Jackson (Stanford University)
  discovered a flaw occurring when interpreting HTTP response headers
  (CVE-2008-4818).

* Nathan McFeters and Rob Carter of Ernst and Young's Advanced
  Security Center are credited for finding an unspecified vulnerability
  facilitating DNS rebinding attacks (CVE-2008-4819).

* When used in a Mozilla browser, Adobe Flash Player does not
  properly interpret jar: URLs, according to a report by Gregory
  Fleischer of pseudo-flaw.net (CVE-2008-4821).

* Alex "kuza55" K. reported that Adobe Flash Player does not properly
  interpret policy files (CVE-2008-4822).

* The vendor credits Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security for
  reporting that an ActionScript attribute is not interpreted properly
  (CVE-2008-4823).

* Riley Hassell and Josh Zelonis of iSEC Partners reported multiple
  input validation errors (CVE-2008-4824).

* The aforementioned researchers also reported that ActionScript 2
  does not verify a member element's size when performing several known
  and other unspecified actions, that DefineConstantPool accepts an
  untrusted input value for a "constant count" and that character
  elements are not validated when retrieved from a data structure,
  possibly resulting in a null-pointer dereference (CVE-2008-5361,
  CVE-2008-5362, CVE-2008-5363).

* The vendor reported an unspecified arbitrary code execution
  vulnerability (CVE-2008-5499).

* Liu Die Yu of TopsecTianRongXin reported an unspecified flaw in the
  Settings Manager related to "clickjacking" (CVE-2009-0114).

* The vendor credits Roee Hay from IBM Rational Application Security
  for reporting an input validation error when processing SWF files
  (CVE-2009-0519).

* Javier Vicente Vallejo reported via the iDefense VCP that Adobe
  Flash does not remove object references properly, leading to a freed
  memory dereference (CVE-2009-0520).

* Josh Bressers of Red Hat and Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security
  Team reported an untrusted search path vulnerability (CVE-2009-0521).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted SWF
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user or a Denial of Service (crash). Furthermore a
remote attacker could gain access to sensitive information, disclose
memory contents by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file
inside a Flash application, modify the victim's clipboard or render it
temporarily unusable, persuade a user into uploading or downloading
files, bypass security restrictions with the assistance of the user to
gain access to camera and microphone, conduct Cross-Site Scripting and
HTTP Header Splitting attacks, bypass the "non-root domain policy" of
Flash, and gain escalated privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/netscape-flash-10.0.22.87"
