Synopsis
========

An error in Xerces-C++ allows for a Denial of Service via malicious XML
schema files.

Background
==========

Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of
C++.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/xerces-c     < 3.0.0-r1                      >= 3.0.0-r1

Description
===========

Frank Rast reported that the XML parser in Xerces-C++ does not
correctly handle an XML schema definition with a large maxOccurs value,
which triggers excessive memory consumption during the validation of an
XML file.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to validate
an XML file using a specially crafted XML schema file, leading to a
Denial of Service (stack consumption and crash).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Xerces-C++ users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/xerces-c-3.0.0-r1"
