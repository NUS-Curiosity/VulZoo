Description:
    Previous versions of curl accept arbitrary location values for
    redirects when CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION is enabled.  This may allow
    remote HTTP servers to trigger arbitrary requests to intranet
    servers, read or overwrite arbitrary local files, or execute
    arbitrary commands.  This update prohibits these redirects.
