Synopsis
========

An error in mpg123 might allow for the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

mpg123 is a realtime MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 audio player for layers 1, 2 and
3.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/mpg123       < 1.7.2                         >= 1.7.2

Description
===========

The vendor reported a signedness error in the store_id3_text() function
in id3.c, allowing for out-of-bounds memory access.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open an MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3
(MP3) file containing a specially crafted ID3 tag, possibly resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All mpg123 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/mpg123-1.7.2"
