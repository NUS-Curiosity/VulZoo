4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in UltraISO, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a
user's system.

1) A format string error when handling DAA file names can be exploited
by tricking a user into opening a file with a specially crafted name 
containing format specifiers.

2) A format string error when handling ISZ file names can be exploited
by tricking a user into opening a file with a specially crafted name 
containing format specifiers.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
