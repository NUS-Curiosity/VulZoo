4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in DivX Web Player, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's 
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a signedness error in the 
processing of "STRF" (Stream Format) chunks. This can be exploited to
cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted DivX file.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code by
