 Overflow Vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

iDefense Security Advisory 04.28.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 28, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

SmartSockets is a message-passing framework used to transport messages
over disparate channels. The RTserver is the server component of the
framework. For more information, see the vendor's site found at the
following link.

http://www.tibco.com/software/messaging/smartsockets/default.jsp

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability in
TIBCO Software Inc.'s SmartSockets RTserver could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected service.

The vulnerability occurs when parsing requests on the UDP interface of
the RTserver.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the affected service, usually SYSTEM. No
authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. Since the
vulnerability is a stack based buffer overflow, and there are no stack
cookies, reliable exploitation is trivial.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the
RTserver version 4.0.10.1. Previous versions may also be affected.

The SmartSockets framework is resold to various 3rd party vendors, and
in this case iDefense used the version provided with Computer
Associates Enterprise Communicator.

V. WORKAROUND

TIBCO has identified the following workarounds:

* Disable the rtserver UDP port if it has been enabled in the rtserver
configuration file.

     * Utilize a firewall to restrict access to the rtserver.

     * Use a user with restricted privileges to invoke the rtserver
       or application.

     * On Unix systems, invoke the server or application from a chroot
       environment.  This will restrict the ability to access or
       modify information in the event of a successful exploit.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

TIBCO has released a patch which addresses this issue. For more
