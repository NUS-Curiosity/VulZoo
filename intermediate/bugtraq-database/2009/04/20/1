Synopsis
========

Adobe Reader is vulnerable to execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Adobe Reader (formerly Adobe Acrobat Reader) is a closed-source PDF
reader.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/acroread       < 8.1.4                          >= 8.1.4

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Reader:

* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based buffer
  overflow when processing PDF files containing a malformed JBIG2
  symbol dictionary segment (CVE-2009-0193).

* A buffer overflow related to a non-JavaScript function call and
  possibly an embedded JBIG2 image stream has been reported
  (CVE-2009-0658).

* Tenable Network Security reported a stack-based buffer overflow
  that can be triggered via a crafted argument to the getIcon() method
  of a Collab object (CVE-2009-0927).

* Sean Larsson of iDefense Labs reported a heap-based buffer overflow
  when processing a PDF file containing a JBIG2 stream with a size
  inconsistency related to an unspecified table (CVE-2009-0928).

* Jonathan Brossard of the iViZ Security Research Team reported an
  unspecified vulnerability related to JBIG2 and input validation
  (CVE-2009-1061).

* Will Dormann of CERT/CC reported a vulnerability lading to memory
  corruption related to JBIG2 (CVE-2009-1062).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF
document, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Reader users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/acroread-8.1.4"
