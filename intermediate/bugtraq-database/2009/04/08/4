Package        : horde3
Vulnerability  : Multiple vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CVE-2009-0932 CVE-2008-3330 CVE-2008-5917
Debian Bugs    : 513265 512592 492578

Several vulnerabilities have been found in horde3, the horde web application
framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:


CVE-2009-0932

Gunnar Wrobel discovered a directory traversal vulnerability, which
allows attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via the
driver parameter in Horde_Image.

CVE-2008-3330

It was discovered that an attacker could perform a cross-site scripting
attack via the contact name, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary
html code. This requires that the attacker has access to create
contacts.

CVE-2008-5917

It was discovered that the horde XSS filter is prone to a cross-site
scripting attack, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary html code.
This is only exploitable when Internet Explorer is used.


For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.3-4etch5.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.2+debian0-2, which was already included in the lenny
release.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.2.2+debian0-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 packages.
