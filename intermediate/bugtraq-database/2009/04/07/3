Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in Xpdf might allow local attackers to execute
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Xpdf is a PDF file viewer that runs under the X Window System.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/xpdf      < 3.02-r2                           >= 3.02-r2

Description
===========

Erik Wallin reported that Gentoo's Xpdf attempts to read the "xpdfrc"
file from the current working directory if it cannot find a ".xpdfrc"
file in the user's home directory. This is caused by a missing
definition of the SYSTEM_XPDFRC macro when compiling a repackaged
version of Xpdf.

Impact
======

A local attacker could entice a user to run "xpdf" from a directory
containing a specially crafted "xpdfrc" file, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code when attempting to, e.g., print a file.

Workaround
==========

Do not run Xpdf from untrusted working directories.

Resolution
==========

All Xpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/xpdf-3.02-r2"
