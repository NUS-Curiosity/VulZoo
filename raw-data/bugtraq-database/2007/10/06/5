Subject: SSHatter 0.6

All,

SSHatter, the SSH brute forcer is now up to release 0.6.  New since the last 
announcement include:

* Changes allowing rudimentary username enumeration via timing attacks (as 
described in 
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/448025/100/0/threaded) have 
been implemented.  These changes has been validated against OpenSSH 3.5p1.

* Targets and usernames are now specified in a file and targets can now be 
specified one per line in the format <hostname>[:<portnumber>].

* Reconnection can optionally be enabled where support on connection failures 
have occurred.

* A default passwords list (taken from 
http://www.nth-dimension.org.uk/downloads.php?id=30) has also been added.

* Fixes for systems configured with AllowUsers have added as these systems do 
not return "Permission denied" on Net::SSH::Perl->login().

This latest version can be downloaded from 
http://www.nth-dimension.org.uk/downloads.php?id=34.

Remember, auditing systems without permission may be a crime, always read the 
label.
