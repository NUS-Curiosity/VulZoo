Synopsis
========

Balsa is vulnerable to a buffer overflow allowing for the user-assisted
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Balsa is a highly configurable email client for GNOME.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-client/balsa      < 2.3.20                         >= 2.3.20

Description
===========

Evil Ninja Squirrel discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the
ir_fetch_seq() function when receiving a long response to a FETCH
command (CVE-2007-5007).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious or
compromised IMAP server, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running Balsa.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Balsa users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/balsa-2.3.20"
