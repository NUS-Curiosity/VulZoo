Details
=======

Cisco Unified ICME, Unified ICMH, UCCE, UCCH and SUCCE are a suite of
strategic platforms that enable customers to provide intelligent
routing and call treatment with blending of multiple communication
channels.

A vulnerability exists in software version 7.1(5) for Cisco Unified
ICME, Unified ICMH, UCCE, UCCH and SUCCE editions that may enable any
Windows Active Directory domain defined user to obtain unauthorized
privilege levels. This would provide Windows Active Directory users
the ability to view Web View report information for any call center
instance. Cisco SUCCE is also impacted by unauthorized access to the
Web Admin tool, which could result in the ability to change the
application configuration, including editing application rights.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID: CSCsj55686

domain with unauthorized access to view Web View information for any
ICM or Contact Center instance. In addition, the vulnerability
provides unauthorized access to the Web Admin tool for any user
defined in the Windows Active Directory domain. It should be noted
that Web Admin is only used with Cisco SUCCE. Access to Web Admin may
result in the ability to change the application configuration,
including editing application rights.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

Any Windows users defined in Active Directory that are not part of
the ICM/IPCC Active Directory hierarchy will have full access to the
Web View and Web Admin tools. There is no workaround. Users defined
in the Windows Active Directory domain where the IPCC servers reside
and then associated to the instance of the ICM/IPCC Active Directory
hierarchy will have correct permissions. Filters such as Transit ACLs
can then be used to allow access to the Administration Workstation
from only the trusted hosts.

Filters that deny HTTP packets using TCP port 80 and HTTPS packets
using TCP port 443 should be deployed throughout the network as part
of a tACL policy for protection of traffic that enters the network at
ingress access points. This policy should be configured to protect
the network device where the filter is applied and other devices
behind it. Filters for HTTP packets using TCP port 80 and HTTPS
packets using TCP port 443 should also be deployed in front of
vulnerable network devices so that traffic is only allowed from
trusted clients.

Additional information about tACLs is available in "Transit Access
Control Lists: Filtering at Your Edge: 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion
document for this advisory: 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20071017-IPCC.shtml.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco will make free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. This advisory will be updated as fixed
software becomes available. Prior to deploying software, customers
should consult their maintenance provider or check the software for
feature set compatibility and known issues specific to their
environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html, or as 
otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact "psirt@...co.com" or "security-alert@...co.com" for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreement with third-party support organizations
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale, should get their upgrades by contacting the
Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows:

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
