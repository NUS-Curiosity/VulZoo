Subject: Oracle audit issue with XMLDB ftp service

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Oracle audit issue with XMLDB ftp service
Systems Affected: Oracle Oracle 9ir2, 10g Release 1
Severity: High
Vendor URL: http://www.oracle.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ davidl@...software.com ]
Reported: 9th March 2006
Date of Public Advisory: 17th October 2007
Advisory number: #NISR17102007E


Description
***********
The Oracle XML DB ftp service contains problems with auditing logins.
 
Details
*******
When a user attempts to log in via the XDB ftp service the audit trail shows
an incorrect entry for USERID. This can present two subtle problems.
Firstly, if  a user logs in as "SYSTEM" the USERID column only shows "SYSTE"
- only 5 characters. The second problem is that if the same user then
attempts to log in a  user "FOO", "FOOTE" is logged in the USERID column -
the "TE" coming from the "TE" of "SYSTE[M]" - the previous login. This only
happens on the same  connected TCP circuit; as such all audit entries have
the same SESSIONID.

Fix Information
***************
Oracle was alerted to this flaw on the 9th of March 2006. A patch has now
