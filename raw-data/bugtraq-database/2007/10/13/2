Synopsis
========

An SQL injection vulnerability and a possible identity theft have been
discovered in Ampache.

Background
==========

Ampache is a PHP-based tool for managing, updating and playing audio
files via a web interface.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/ampache      < 3.3.3.5                        >= 3.3.3.5

Description
===========

LT discovered that the "match" parameter in albums.php is not properly
sanitized before being processed. The Ampache development team also
reported an error when handling user sessions.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could provide malicious input to the application,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary SQL code. He could
also entice a user to open a specially crafted link to steal the user's
session.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ampache users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/ampache-3.3.3.5"
