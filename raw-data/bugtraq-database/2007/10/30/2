Subject: Siebel Security Basics

All,

I've posted a tutorial on Siebel security basics to my blog at http:// 
vote4katz.com/?p=13

The short story is to make sure you use common sense and tune  
defaults, which is pretty universal if you think about it.

As always, feedback, discourse, etc is always welcome.
