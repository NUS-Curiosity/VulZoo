Nope -- the behaviour we observed did not depend on the protocol by any 
means. For example we were able to connect to a netcat server listening on 
a TCP port despite of "Set access to specific services and programs" and 
an empty list of allowed services.

There is no way to "enable UDP filtering" in Leopard either -- at least I 
have not found any. In fact the firewall does not use ipfw rules at all.
