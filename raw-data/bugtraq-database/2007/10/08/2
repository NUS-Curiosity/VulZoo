Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in libsndfile.

Background
==========

libsndfile is a library for reading and writing various formats of
audio files including WAV and FLAC.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /   Vulnerable   /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libsndfile      < 1.0.17-r1               >= 1.0.17-r1

Description
===========

Robert Buchholz of the Gentoo Security team discovered that the
flac_buffer_copy() function does not correctly handle FLAC streams with
variable block sizes which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow
(CVE-2007-4974).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user
to open a specially crafted FLAC file or network stream with an
application using libsndfile. This might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code with privileges of the user playing the file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libsndfile users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libsndfile-1.0.17-r1"
