4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in McAfee E-Business
Server, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow within the
e-Business administration utility service when parsing authentication
packets. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow
via a specially crafted authentication packet with an overly large
length value.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

======================================================================
5) Solution

Install E-Business Server 8.5.3 for Solaris
Install E-Business Server 8.1.2 for Linux, HP-UX, AIX
