Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in ImageMagick, possibly
resulting in arbitrary code execution or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

ImageMagick is a collection of tools and libraries for manipulating
various image formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/imagemagick     < 6.3.5.10                  >= 6.3.5.10

Description
===========

regenrecht reported multiple infinite loops in functions ReadDCMImage()
and ReadXCFImage() (CVE-2007-4985), multiple integer overflows when
handling certain types of images (CVE-2007-4986, CVE-2007-4988), and an
off-by-one error in the ReadBlobString() function (CVE-2007-4987).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
image, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application, or an
excessive CPU consumption. Note that applications relying on
ImageMagick to process images can also trigger the vulnerability.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ImageMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/imagemagick-6.3.5.10"
