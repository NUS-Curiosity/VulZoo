Borland InterBase Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

http://risesecurity.org/advisory/RISE-2007002/

Published: October 3, 2007
Updated: October 3, 2007

INTRODUCTION

There exists multiple vulnerabilities within functions of Borland InterBase,
which when properly exploited can lead to remote compromise of the
vulnerable
system.
These vulnerabilities were confirmed by us in the following versions of
Borland
InterBase, other versions may be also affected.

Borland InterBase WI-V8.1.0.257
Borland InterBase WI-V8.0.0.123
Borland InterBase WI-V7.5.1.80
Borland InterBase WI-V7.5.0.129
Borland InterBase WI-V7.0.1.1
Borland InterBase WI-V6.5.0.28
Borland InterBase WI-V6.0.1.6
Borland InterBase WI-O6.0.2.0
Borland InterBase WI-O6.0.1.6
Borland InterBase WI-V6.0.1.0
Borland InterBase WI-V6.0.0.627
Borland InterBase WI-V5.5.0.742
Borland InterBase WI-V5.1.1.680
Borland InterBase LI-V8.1.0.253
Borland InterBase LI-V8.0.0.54
Borland InterBase LI-V8.0.0.53

DETAILS

The vulnerable functions do not validate user supplied data when copying
it to a
stack-based buffer, resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow. The
exploitation
of these vulnerabilities are trivial and results in remote compromise of the
vulnerable system.

This is the list of vulnerable functions, some of them contain more than one
stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

1. INET_connect
2. SVC_attach
3. isc_attach_database
4. jrd8_attach_database
5. isc_create_database
6. jrd8_create_database
7. PWD_db_aliased
8. expand_filename2
9. open_marker_file (UNIX only)

These vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending specially crafted attach,
create and service attach requests.

Proof of concept codes for these vulnerabilities can be downloaded from our
website http://risesecurity.org/.
