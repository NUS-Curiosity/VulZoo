Subject: eGov Content Manager Cross Site Scripting Vulrnability

[HSC] eGov Content Manager Cross Site Scripting Vulrnability

The eGov Manager was designed to simplify the efforts of government staffers 
who are responsible for posting public documents, news updates, events, managing 
staff directories and online services. This issue is due to a failure in the 
application to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Attackers may exploit this 
issue via a web client. An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary 
script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of 
the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication 
credentials and launch other attacks. A successful exploit could allow an attacker 
to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities 
in the underlying database implementation.
