If you want to do a thorough job of such mitigation as a Q&D fix, you 
may also need to nuke the 

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\nntp\shell

entry.

I can't easily test the viability of exploiting this via an nntp:// URI 
just now, but "nntp" is normally registered (at least with OE -- can 
someone check for Windows Mail?) with exactly the same sub-keys and 
values as the "news" and "snews" URI handlers...
