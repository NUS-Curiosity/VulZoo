Subject: 0day: mIRC pwns Windows

Yipiya Ypipiya yah yeah. Here is a 0day! hurra mIRC pwns your Windozes! (ref. pdp)

send this to a user and make him double click on it (masquerade it with pink fore/background color and say 'free pr0n click here ->' it works all the time! damned perverts):
mailto:%xx../../../../../../../../../../../windows/system32/calc.exe".bat

Now the question is, should we say *0day* for a bug in a core element that is WELL KNOWN by everyone (reported months ago), and will be patched, or should we try to get credits for finding a *vector* as pdp did with the supposed *acrobat reader pdf bug* ?

Fame kills bugs.
