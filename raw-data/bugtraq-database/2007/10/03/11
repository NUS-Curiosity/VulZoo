More important. Against which exact version and build did you test this? 
NGX R60 received 5 patches which might take care of some points.

I think however that Check Point consideres everyone with access to a 
Secure Platform system to be a trusted user. So they will not regard these 
issues with the priority you (Hugo Va¿½zqu) seem to bestow on it.
