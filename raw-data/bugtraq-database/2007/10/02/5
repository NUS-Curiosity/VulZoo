Subject: Original Photo Gallery Remote Command Execution

Original Photo Gallery Remote Command Execution

 Name              Original Photo Gallery Remote Command Execution
 Systems Affected  Original 0.11.2 version and below
 Severity          High
 Vendor            http://jimmac.musichall.cz/original.php
 Advisory
http://www.ush.it/team/ascii/hack-original/advisory_updated.txt
http://www.ush.it/team/ascii/hack-original/advisory.txt
 Author            Francesco `ascii` Ongaro, Antonio `s4tan` Parata
 Date              20070919

I. BACKGROUND

"Original is a set of scripts to get your digital photos on the web. It
aims to be as simple to maintain as possible."

The systems consist of two parts: "a client side script to scale your
images to different sizes, create archives of an album, attach optional
metadata" and a "php script to render html pages of the picture
gallery".

II. DESCRIPTION

It's possible to execute arbitrary code on remote systems which have
installed a vulnerable software version.

III. ANALYSIS

The file "inc/exif.inc.php" contains the following vulnerable statement:

exec("$exif_prog \"$gallery_dir/$galerie/lq/img-$snimek.jpg\"",
$exif_data, $exif_status);".

If PHP is configured with the "globals on" option, an attacker can
execute arbitrary code doing a direct request to the file and sending
shell commands in the parameter/value $exif_prog.

IV. DETECTION

http://www.x.com/original/inc/exif.inc.php?exif_prog=/path/to/touch%20/tmp/p0wn3d.txt;

The request should create a file in the /tmp directory (on Unix systems)
named p0wn3d.txt. If this happens than you have a vulnerable version of
the software (and a really risky PHP setup).

A rapid measurement show that ~10% systems are vulnerable of about
17'000 listed on Google (using the dork: "Generated by Original ver").

V. WORKAROUND

Upgrade to the new version 0.11.3 witch fix this vulnerability.

http://jimmac.musichall.cz/zip/original/original-0.11.3.tar.bz2

Or if unable to upgrade:

1) Disable access to the directory using Limit (vhosts/.htaccess).

2) Disable execution using disable_functions in php.ini.

The result is:

Warning: exec() has been disabled for security reasons in
/home/XXX/inc/exif.inc.php on line 157

3) Deny direct access to the file in the PHP code by checking for a
define or requested url.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor has promptly replied and addressed the problem issuing a
new release.

Original version 0.11.3 is available here:
