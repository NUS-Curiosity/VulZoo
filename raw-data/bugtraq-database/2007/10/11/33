Subject: Re: Remote Desktop Command Fixation Attacks

Thor, with no disrespect but you are wrong. Security in depth does not
work and I am not planning to support my argument in any way. This is
just my personal humble opinion. I've seen only failure of the
principles you mentioned. Security in depth works only in a perfect
world. The truth is that you cannot implement true security mainly
because you will hit on the accessibility side. It is all about
achieving the balance between security and accessibility. Moreover,
you cannot implement security in depth mainly because you cannot
predict the future. Therefore, you don't know what kinds of attack
will surface next.

Security is not a destination, it is a process. Security in depth
sounds like a destination to me.

It is not the same. We educate users not to open .exe files but RDP
and ICA are just pure business tools. Users are familiar with them and
their purpose. Therefore, they are more trusted. And what happens when
the tools that you trust turn against you?

And how come it is OK for a simple text file be able to ride your
session and execute commands on behalf of you? I think that this is a
problem. CSRF is a well known, widely acknowledged problem. The client
should at least warn you that you are about to start an alternative
shell. That's not the case though.

BTW, I am not sure if you stumbled across the other post I released on
FD and BUGTRAQ which is closely related to this one. Well, here is the
situation: if you visit a remote page that happens to be malicious,
attackers can inject any commands they wish into your remote desktop
without any visible notice. No interaction is required. And the attack
is super generic btw, and probably 100% wormable.

So, I believe it is an attack. Yes, it is not stack, heap overflow, or
some null pointer dereference issue, but it is an attack that we
cannot simply ignore it, mainly because it is a problem with a feature
rather then a bug. Features cannot be easily eliminated. Bugs will be
fixed!

One thing that I am always trying to do with the GNUCITIZEN sessions
is to educate developers as well system administrators that attacks
succeed when they are unexpected. At the end of the day, the trick is
simple.
