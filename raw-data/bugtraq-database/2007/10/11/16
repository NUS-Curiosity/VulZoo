Not completely.  There are some configurations in which EXEC mode is not
fully privileged.  For instance, someone might be covertly capturing
flows passing through the router.  The ability to execute arbitrary code
can be used to reveal that activity, and the router operator may not be
authorized to do so.

However, it seems to me that this is more or less a compliance thing,
not a security issue.
