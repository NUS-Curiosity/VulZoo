Subject: Tikiwiki 1.9.8 exploit ITW

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Hi,

there's a tikiwiki (tikiwiki.org) remote code execution exploit in the
wild, targetting v.1.9.8 and earlier. This vulnerability is being
exploited by multiple hosts (likely a botnet) using multiple payload
websites since at least Tue 08:00 PM UTC to gain access to several
users' hotmail accounts.

Disabling url_fopen() or denying access to tiki-graph_formula.php for
unauthenticated users will prevent your site from being exploited.

I've notified the developers.

If, what it says on http://dev.tikiwiki.org/Security is up to date (i.e.
unfixed security issues of high priority initially reported 9 months
ago), then you really should not use this software.

Moritz
