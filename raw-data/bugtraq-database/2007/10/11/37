Dear All,

....Hi everyone.  This is Jonathan from the SWI team in the MSRC.  Weve just released
Security Advisory 943521 regarding a vulnerability affecting Windows Server 2003 and
Windows XP with Internet Explorer 7 installed.  As you have probably noted theres
been a fair amount of discussion on this issue. One of the reasons we are releasing
this Advisory is due to increased risk given recent discussions about how this
vulnerability could be used in attacks.  Another reason is to clear up the
confusion we see between the URI issue covered in todays Advisory and the
protocol handler issue we documented in July in this IE Blog.  The final reason
is we actually contributed to some of the confusion by providing an incorrect
set of talking points to Heise.  Because these issues look very similar were
going to have some deep discussion on how Windows handles URIs.

To help explain the difference in detail, my co-workers Dave and Chen have helped
me put together some information...
