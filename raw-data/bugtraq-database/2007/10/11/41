rPath Security Advisory: 2007-0214-1
Published: 2007-10-11
Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Minor
Exposure Level Classification:
    Local Information Exposure
Updated Versions:
    initscripts=conary.rpath.com@rpl:1/8.12-8.10-1

rPath Issue Tracking System:
    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1825

Description:
    Previous versions of the initscripts package do not set sufficiently
    restrictive permissions on the /var/log/btmp file, leading to an
    Information Exposure vulnerability in which users' passwords may be
    revealed to unprivileged users in cases when the passwords have been
    inadvertently entered as usernames at some login prompts.
    
    Because sshd detects the incorrect permissions on /var/log/btmp and
    thus does not log failed authentications (instead issuing a warning
    about the file permissions to /var/log/secure), and gdm does not
    log the user name, this vulnerability is generally limited to failed
    logins at the system text console or over a local serial port.
