Synopsis
========

The mount and umount programs might allow local attackers to gain root
privileges.

Background
==========

util-linux is a suite of Linux programs including mount and umount,
programs used to mount and unmount filesystems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-apps/util-linux     < 2.12r-r8                    >= 2.12r-r8

Description
===========

Ludwig Nussel discovered that the check_special_mountprog() and
check_special_umountprog() functions call setuid() and setgid() in the
wrong order and do not check the return values, which can lead to
privileges being dropped improperly.

Impact
======

A local attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by using
mount helpers such as the mount.nfs program to gain root privileges and
run arbitrary commands.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All util-linux users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/util-linux-2.12r-r8"

==========
