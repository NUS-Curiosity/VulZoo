Introduction:
-------------
A malicious user who can send spoofed packets to an IP phone is able to freeze it. A potential victim does not recognize that his IP phone is offline until he tries to use it. Signs which make it obvious for the victim that his IP phone is not working are that he does not here a line peep sound when trying to make a call or that the LCD display is not updated.

The attack uses valid UNIStim "Mute / UnMute" messages which are sent to the IP phone with a spoofed server source address.

Nortel has noted this as:
Title:  Potential DoS Vulnerability - IP Phone Freeze to Offline State

Technical Description:
----------------------
Flooding an IP phone with valid UNIStim messages freezes the IP phone. The IP phone needs to be rebooted by pulling the power cord in order to work again.

The proof-of-concept code uses "Mute / UnMute" UNIStim messages. The ID number is increased sequentially from 1 to 65535. After the packets have been sent, the phone is frozen and cannot be used. The phone does not ring if it's number is called and the LCD display is not updated.
