* Risk Level:*
High - Spoofed log records / Injected JavaScript can lead to malware attacks

*Summary:*
Mobile-spy.com's user administration web application contains a critical 
bug that allows anyone to inject spoofed incoming/outgoing phone 
records, SMS messages, and URL's into the backend database for ANY user 
of the software. In addition, since the incoming records are not 
filtered, it is trivial to inject malicious JavaScript/HTML into the 
webpage viewed by the user of the software. Finally, the user/pass is 
stored locally on the victims phone as plaintext.

*Details:*
Details on this program and the vulnerabilities are located at:

* Workaround:*
Uninstall the software from the victim's phone. Delete all existing 
messages that are stored on Mobile-spy server using a secure browser 
with JavaScript disabled.
