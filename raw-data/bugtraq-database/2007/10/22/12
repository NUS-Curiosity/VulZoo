Tested newest version.
1. With Windows:
Open C:\WINDOWS\system32\mslck.dat with notepad
Content: '[Folder_name] [Driver]:\ 1' replace value 1 with 0 
Now it is: ('[Folder_name] [Driver]:\ 0'
Reboot, now you can copy/rename/delete [Folder_name]
2. With DOS:
Use HirenBoot, [Folder_name] locked change to DOS file type (8.3) like this: "folder~1.{21"
Rename "folder~1.{21" to "new_Folder_name" Now it is unlocked
