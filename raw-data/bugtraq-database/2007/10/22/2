Synopsis
========

The TRAMP package for GNU Emacs insecurely creates temporary files.

Background
==========

TRAMP is a remote file editing package for GNU Emacs, a highly
extensible and customizable text editor.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-emacs/tramp      < 2.1.10-r2                     >= 2.1.10-r2
                                                                *< 2.1

Description
===========

Stefan Monnier discovered that the tramp-make-tramp-temp-file()
function creates temporary files in an insecure manner.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the directory where the
temporary files are written, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the
filesystem that is writable by the user running TRAMP. When TRAMP
writes the temporary file, the target valid file would then be
overwritten with the contents of the TRAMP temporary file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All TRAMP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emacs/tramp-2.1.10-r2"
