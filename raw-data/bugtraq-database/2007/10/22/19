Synopsis
========

A directory traversal vulnerability has been discovered in Star.

Background
==========

The Star program provides the ability to create and extract tar
archives.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /    Vulnerable    /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/star      < 1.5_alpha84                   >= 1.5_alpha84

Description
===========

Robert Buchholz of the Gentoo Security team discovered a directory
traversal vulnerability in the has_dotdot() function which does not
identify //.. (slash slash dot dot) sequences in file names inside tar
files.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to extract a specially crafted tar archive, a remote
attacker could extract files to arbitrary locations outside of the
specified directory with the permissions of the user running Star.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Star users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/star-1.5_alpha84"
