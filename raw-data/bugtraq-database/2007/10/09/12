I don't agree. Whatever program takes input from an untrusted source, it's 
that programs duty to sanitize the input before passing it on to internal 
components. It's like a firewall, you filter before it gets inside the 
system.

Example, an ftp server has to sanitize filenames to prevent useage of 
streams on NTFS, you don't blame the filesystem that the input gets passed 
to, it's the job of the ftp server to do the sanitizing of untrusted input.
