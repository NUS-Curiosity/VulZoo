I think that given a system service that says "I will handle a mailto: URI",
that a programmer can *reasonably* expect the following:

1) That it will be handed to a program that actually does e-mail, and not
a calculator.  calc.exe hasn't *yet* followed the programming aphorism that
every program grows until it can read e-mail.

2) That said program can protect itself against overtly malicious input.
