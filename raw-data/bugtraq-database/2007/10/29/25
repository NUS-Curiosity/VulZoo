Subject: Windows binary of "Virtual Floppy Drive 2.1" contains vulnerable zlib (CAN-2005-2096)

The binary of the (presumably not widely used) Windows software
"Virtual Floppy Drive 2.1"
<http://chitchat.at.infoseek.co.jp/vmware/vfd.html>
ships with a vfd.dll that is statically linked against zlib 1.2.2
<http://www.zlib.net/> which is vulnerable to CAN-2005-2096.


A scan with ClamAV against the patterns published by Florian Weimer
at <http://www.enyo.de/fw/security/zlib-fingerprint/> verifies the
presence of the patterns of the vulnerable code:

| x:\>clamscan --database CAN-2005-2096.db
| VFD.DLL: CAN-2005-2096.zlib-1.2.2 FOUND
|
| ----------- SCAN SUMMARY -----------
| Known viruses: 16
| Engine version: 0.91.2
| Scanned directories: 1
| Scanned files: 1


The author and maintainer has been contacted twice via mail in
the last four weeks but choose not to respond at all.
