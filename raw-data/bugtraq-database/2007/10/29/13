3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in IBM Tivoli
Storage Manager Client, which can be exploited by malicious people to
conduct script insertion attacks.

Certain input passed in HTTP requests to the CAD service is not
properly sanitised before being logged. This can be exploited to 
insert arbitrary HTML and script code into dsmerror.log, which is 
executed in a user's browser session in context of the affected site 
when e.g. viewing the log file via the web-based interface using the
"FILE" functionality of the CAD service.

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Restrict access to the CAD service (default port 1581/tcp).

Filter malicious characters and character sequences in a proxy.
