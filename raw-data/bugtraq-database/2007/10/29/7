Team SHATTER Security Alert

Oracle Database Buffer overflow vulnerability in procedure
DBMS_AQADM_SYS.DBLINK_INFO

October 29, 2007

Risk Level:
Medium

Affected versions:
Oracle Database Server versions 9iR1, 9iR2 (9.2.0.7 and previous
patchsets) and 10gR1

Remote exploitable:
Yes (Authentication to Database Server is needed)

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martínez
Fayó of Application Security Inc.

Details:
Oracle Database Server provides the SYS.DBMS_AQADM_SYS package that is
used internally by the SYS.DBMS_AQADM package to provide procedures to
manage Oracle Streams Advanced Queuing (AQ) configuration and
administration information. This package contains the procedure
DBLINK_INFO which is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

Impact:
Any Oracle database user with EXECUTE privilege on the package
SYS.DBMS_AQADM_SYS can exploit this vulnerability. By default only
SYSDBA users have the required privilege. Exploitation of this
vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. It can also
be exploited to cause DoS (Denial of service) killing the Oracle server
process.
Vendor Status:
Vendor was informed about this vulnerability on 2/22/2005 and a patch
was released on 10/16/2007.

Workaround:
Restrict access to the SYS.DBMS_AQADM_SYS package.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update October 2007 available at Oracle
Metalink.
