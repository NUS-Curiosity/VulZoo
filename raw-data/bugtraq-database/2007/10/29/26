The maintainer finally replied to the last of my three attempts to
contact him (very timely, regarding the different timezones we are in):

| I can't do much about it just at the moment.  I've had a computer

| I will update the DLL in the next release.  Yes, I compiled the DLL
| myself.  There wasn't a precompiled version at the time I started using
| it.
