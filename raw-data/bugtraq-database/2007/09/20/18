Synopsis
========

Two user-assisted buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been discovered
in rsync.

Background
==========

rsync is a file transfer program to keep remote directories
synchronized.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/rsync     < 2.6.9-r3                         >= 2.6.9-r3

Description
===========

Sebastian Krahmer from the SUSE Security Team discovered two off-by-one
errors in the function "f_name()" in file sender.c when processing
overly long directory names.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to synchronize a repository
containing specially crafted directories, leading to the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All rsync users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/rsync-2.6.9-r3"
