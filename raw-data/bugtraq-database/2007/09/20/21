Synopsis
========

Vulnerabilities have been discovered in ClamAV allowing remote
execution of arbitrary code and Denial of Service attacks.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus is an open source (GPL) anti-virus toolkit for UNIX,
designed especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.91.2                      >= 0.91.2

Description
===========

Nikolaos Rangos discovered a vulnerability in ClamAV which exists
because the recipient address extracted from email messages is not
properly sanitized before being used in a call to "popen()" when
executing sendmail (CVE-2007-4560). Also, NULL-pointer dereference
errors exist within the "cli_scanrtf()" function in libclamav/rtf.c and
Stefanos Stamatis discovered a NULL-pointer dereference vulnerability
within the "cli_html_normalise()" function in libclamav/htmlnorm.c
(CVE-2007-4510).

Impact
======

The unsanitized recipient address can be exploited to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the clamav-milter process by sending an
email with a specially crafted recipient address to the affected
system. Also, the NULL-pointer dereference errors can be exploited to
crash ClamAV. Successful exploitation of the latter vulnerability
requires that clamav-milter is started with the "black hole" mode
activated, which is not enabled by default.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.91.2"
