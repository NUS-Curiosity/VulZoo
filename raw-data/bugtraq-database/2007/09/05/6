Summary
=======

The Cisco Content Switching Modules (CSM) and Cisco Content Switching
Module with SSL (CSM-S) contain two vulnerabilities that can lead to
a denial of service (DoS) condition. The first vulnerability exists
when processing TCP packets, and the second vulnerability affects
devices with service termination enabled.

Cisco has made free software available to address these
vulnerabilities for affected customers.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070905-csm.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

These vulnerabilities were identified in CSM software version 4.2 and
CSM-S software version 2.1. The following table helps illustrate the
vulnerable software versions for these products:

+---------------------------------------+
| Vulnerability |    CSM    |   CSM-S   |
|---------------+-----------+-----------|
| TCP packet    | 4.2 Prior | 2.1 Prior |
| Processing    | to 4.2.3a | to 2.1.2a |
| DOS           |           |           |
|---------------+-----------+-----------|
| Service       | 4.2 Prior | 2.1 Prior |
| Termination   | to 4.2.7  | to 2.1.6  |
+---------------------------------------+

To determine the software running on a Content Switching Module, log
in to the Catalyst switch and issue the show version command.

The following example shows a CSM running software version 4.2(2) in
a Supervisor running CatOS. Supervisors running CatOS or IOS will
have similar output. The version of the CSM is shown on the module

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Only Catalyst CSM modules running indicated 4.2 versions are affected
by these vulnerabilities. CSM software versions 4.1, 3.2 and 3.1 are
not affected by these vulnerabilities.

Catalyst CSM-S modules running indicated 2.1 versions are the only
vulnerable versions of software for that product.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability. The Cisco Secure Content Accelerator is not affected
by this vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Catalyst CSM is an integrated Server Load Balancing line card for
the Catalyst 6500 and 7600 Series designed to enhance the response
time for client traffic to end points including servers, caches,
firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) devices, and VPN termination
devices.

The Catalyst 6500 CSM-S combines high-performance server load
balancing (SLB) with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) offload. The CSM-S is
similar to the CSM; however, it can also terminate and initiate
SSL-encrypted traffic, which allows the CSM-S to perform intelligent
load balancing while ensuring secure end-to-end encryption.

When a module running affected code receives specific TCP packets out
of order, a DoS condition may be triggered resulting in the CPU
reaching 100% utilization or a reload with a FPGA4 exception with
icp.fatPath length error.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsd27478.

When service termination is enabled on a module running affected
software and the module is under high network utilization, a DoS
condition may be triggered, resulting in a reload with a FPGA4
exception 1 IDLE error.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsh57876.

In normal operations, the MSFC CLI handles the management of the CSM
and CSM-S; however, in order to upgrade the software, a user must
first log into the switch and session to the module.

For more information on how to upgrade your CSM, visit the
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/modules/ps2706/products_tech_note09186a0080094526.shtml
page on Cisco.com.

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/interfaces_modules/services_modules/csms/2.1.1/configuration/guide/getstart.html#wp1041858.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

Cisco will provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Customers are encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining
the environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.
