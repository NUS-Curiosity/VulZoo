Package description:
  fetchmail
  Fetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended
  for use over on-demand TCP/IP links, like SLIP or PPP connections.
  Fetchmail supports every remote-mail protocol currently in use on the
  Internet (POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, all IMAPs, ESMTP ETRN, IPv6,
  and IPSEC) for retrieval. Then Fetchmail forwards the mail through
  SMTP so you can read it through your favorite mail client.

  quagga
  Quagga is a free software that manages TCP/IP based routing protocol.
  It takes multi-server and multi-thread approach to resolve the current
  complexity of the Internet.

Problem description:
  fetchmail < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: An error exists in fetchmail which allows
    context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
    dereference and application crash) by refusing certain warning
    messages that are sent over SMTP.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2007-4565 to this issue. 

  quagga < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 > 
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability have been reported in Quagga, caused
    due to bgpd improperly handling messages sent by peers. This can be
    exploited to crash bgpd by sending a specially crafted "OPEN"
    message with an invalid message length or an invalid parameter
    length, or a specially crafted "UPDATE" message with a malformed
    "COMMUNITY" attribute.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2007-4826 to this issue.
