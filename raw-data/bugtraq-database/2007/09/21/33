Impact: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code or cause a 
denial of service condition.

Summary: CA ARCserve Backup for Laptops and Desktops contains 
multiple vulnerabilities that can allow a remote attacker to cause 
a denial of service condition or execute arbitrary code. The first 
set of vulnerabilities, CVE-2007-3216, occur due to insufficient 
bounds checking on multiple command arguments by the LGServer 
service. The second set of vulnerabilities, CVE-2007-5003, occur 
due to insufficient bounds checking on rxrLogin authentication 
credentials and on a username by the GetUserInfo() function. The 
third vulnerability, CVE-2007-5004, occurs due to insufficient 
verification of an integer value used during authentication, which 
can lead to integer overflow. The fourth vulnerability, 
CVE-2007-5005, occurs due to insufficient verification of file 
uploads by the NetBackup service. The fifth vulnerability, 
CVE-2007-5006, occurs due to insufficient verification of 
authorization credentials, which can enable an attacker to bypass 
authentication.
