Note: it's MONDAY this time!

If you haven't been before, please do come. We've got some great talks 
coming in the next few months Smiley

Talks Planned:

- Injecting RDS-TMC Traffic Information Systems - Andrea Barisani.

This talk is HIGHLY recommended - fresh from appearing at Blackhat, this 
is a great project that will amuse and inform you.. great possibilities.

- 'MPLS Security' - Thorsten Fischer - what it is, what people are doing 
about it and the current issues with it.
- 10 min special - TBA

Additionally - we will have 36Gb of WPA rainbow tables courtesy of the 
Church of Wifi available - bring your laptop & diskspace and grab it 
whilst you can.

Zac & Major hope to have something cool to show you too...

Oh, and we'll have DC15 stickers as well :-)

All welcome &  bring a friend.
