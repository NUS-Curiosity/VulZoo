Summary: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the CsAgent service

vulnerabilities, CVE-2007-5082, occur due to insufficient bounds 
checking in multiple CsAgent service commands. The second set of

validation of integer values in multiple CsAgent service commands, 
which can lead to buffer overflow. The third set of 
vulnerabilities, CVE-2007-5084, occur due to insufficient 
validation of strings used in SQL statements in multiple CsAgent 
service commands.
