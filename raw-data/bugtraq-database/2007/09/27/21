Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in teTeX, allowing for
user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

teTeX is a complete TeX distribution for editing documents.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/tetex      < 3.0_p1-r4                      >= 3.0_p1-r4

Description
===========

Mark Richters discovered a buffer overflow in the open_sty() function
in file mkind.c. Other vulnerabilities have also been discovered in the
same file but might not be exploitable (CVE-2007-0650). Tetex also
includes vulnerable code from GD library (GLSA 200708-05), and from
Xpdf (CVE-2007-3387).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
PNG, GIF or PDF file, or to execute "makeindex" on an overly long
filename. In both cases, this could lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All teTeX users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/tetex-3.0_p1-r4"
