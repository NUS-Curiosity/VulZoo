Subject: Promise NAS NS4300N GUI bug

List,

There is a bug in the Promise NAS NS4300N web GUI (firmware version 1.1.0.5)
which allows an authenticated (admin) user to change the password of the
'root' account.

The user management portion of the web interface allows the admin user to
change user's passwords. The PHP script that handles this does not check to
see if the admin is changing a user account or system accounts such as
'root'.

By changing the value of the 'user' parameter to 'root' (from whatever user
id whose password is being changed, e.g. 'admin' if you have not defined any
users) in the POST request to /usercp.php, we can provide a known password
for the root account and thereby login to the NAS (which is normally not
possible because Promise has not divulged root's password).

The vendor has not been notified, but this is hardly a critical issue..?
