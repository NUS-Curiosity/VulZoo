Subject: Re: Service Pack 3 for Microsoft Sharepoint Services broken

I can�t find hardly any information about this post but this is exactly what happened after I installed service pack 3
What is funny about this error (Pages with customized data view web parts or data view web parts linked to lists on other sites are not accessible. Error message either "access denied" or "Unable to display this Web Part. To troubleshoot the problem, open this Web page in a Windows SharePoint Services-compatible HTML editor such as FrontPage. If the problem persists, contact your Web server administrator.") it only happen when someone access my site from the outside world as long as you access the site entirely you don�t see this error.

I also have a problem with user from my intranet not being able to login at all 
If I find a fix ill post it good luck
