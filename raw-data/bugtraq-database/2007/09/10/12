Hi everyone,
I wrote a paper about an attack type I call "XSIO - Cross Site Image
Overlaying". It’s about something which I think many of you have already
done but I wasn’t able to find something written about it and even I
don’t think, that most of the people out there are aware of how big the
impact of something like this could be. But just read the paper if
you’re interested in hear some more about it :)
