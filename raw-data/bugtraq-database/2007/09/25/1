The exploit is not made public by its use.  The exploit is not even made 
public by (back-channel) sharing amongst the hacker/cracker community. 
The exploit is only made public if detected or the vulnerability is 
disclosed.  Until detected/disclosed the hacker/cracker can use their 
31337 0day spl01tz to break into whichever vulnerable machines they like. 
0day exploits are valuable because the opposition is ignorant of them.

Posting exploits to BUGTRAQ, however, inherently makes them not 0day...
