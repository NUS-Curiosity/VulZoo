Subject: Re: defining 0day

I asked a few fairly regular Joes (our sales staff) what 0Day means to 
them.. just the words, they have no point of reference and they all pretty 
much agreed that they thought it meant

"less than a day old" "or less than 24 hours ago, X happened"

that is what i remember it being in the old NNTP file xfer days as well.

these are non-tech savy folks.
