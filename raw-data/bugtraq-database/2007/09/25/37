As a professional, I would be happy to see terms like '0day' banished  
from the lexicon entirely. It's an essentially meaningless -- all  
third-party exploits are zero-day to _somebody_ -- term of boast co- 
opted from the warez scene, and we can do perfectly well without it.

Quibbling over its precise definition seems a ridiculous waste of bytes.
