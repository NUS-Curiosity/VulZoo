Subject: n.runs AG puts §202 law to the test - Tools back online

Dear List,
You may or may not have noticed but a lot of German companies and
researches have pulled their tools from their website in fear of litigation.

We are fed up with the ambiguity and confusion surrounding Germany
controversial new anti-hacker law and n.runs AG decided to put the law
to the test, we reuploaded the BTCrack (Bluetooth Cracking tool) and
futhermore added a new Item, the source code to the Linux port for
immediate download. [1]

The law, which took effect Aug. 10, mandates fines or prison sentences
for any person who violates 202a or 202b "by providing access to,
selling, acquiring, leaving at the disposition of someone, distributing
or otherwise making accessible" passwords or access control information.
It also outlaws computer programs whose purpose is solely criminal.

N.runs hopes its actions will encourage other German security firms and
researchers to put their security tools and research back online as
well. "The current confusion and uncertainty is affecting everyone
around here," Jan Münther (CTO) says.

"Germany is most certainly not becoming a safer place because of these
laws."
