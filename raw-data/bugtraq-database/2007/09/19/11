Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in the gMotor2 engine


Only an update about the advisory I released one month ago for the
rFactor game.
This game uses the same gMotor2 engine which is used also by many other
well known games like F1 Challenge 99-02, GT Legends, GTR, GTR 2, RACE,
Race 07, BMW M3 Challenge and so on.

The new advisory (not an usual advisory since I have NOT performed
further and specific research except a new proof-of-concept) is
available here:
