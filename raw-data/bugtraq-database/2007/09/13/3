Subject: NDSS 2008 CfP Papers Due September 21

NDSS (Network and Distributed Systems Security) is a traditional
academic scholarly conference, with an emphasis on practical security
matters. This year we are continuing our theme of cross-over between the
academic security research community and the "hacker" security research
community, and so we encourage submissions with novelty merit from both
communities.

Papers are due September 21st

The conference itself is February 10-13 in San Diego.

Thanks,
    Crispin
