Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in KVIrc, allowing for the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

KVIrc is a free portable IRC client based on Qt.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /       Vulnerable       /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-irc/kvirc      < 3.2.6_pre20070714       >= 3.2.6_pre20070714

Description
===========

Stefan Cornelius from Secunia Research discovered that the
"parseIrcUrl()" function in file src/kvirc/kernel/kvi_ircurl.cpp does
not properly sanitise parts of the URI when building the command for
KVIrc's internal script system.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
irc:// URI, possibly leading to the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running KVIrc. Successful exploitation
requires that KVIrc is registered as the default handler for irc:// or
similar URIs.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All KVIrc users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/kvirc-3.2.6_pre20070714"
