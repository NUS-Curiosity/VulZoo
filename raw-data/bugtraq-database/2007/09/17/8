Subject: RE: Next generation malware: Windows Vista's gadget API

Great overview, Todd!
I've just wanted to mention that MS downplayed the vulnerabilities I've
found in Vista's Sidebar gadgets.
In my blog post
(http://aviv.raffon.net/2007/08/16/VistaGadgetsGoneWild.aspx), I've
demonstrated a scenario where a worm can be propagated by exploiting the
vulnerability in the RSS feeds gadget.
I don't understand why Microsoft rated this vulnerability as important,
instead of critical.

Good paper; Since this is out there I figure I'll forward the much  
shorter article I wrote that details an attack against the contact  
gadget, which was patched last month.
