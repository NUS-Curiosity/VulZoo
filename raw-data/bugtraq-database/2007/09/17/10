I shall respond in turn to the interesting points from all responses.

Eric's talk seems to be a good start on risk analysis of gadgets generically.   
The design of Vista gadgets seems particularly troubling since it seemed to 
have several design flaws which were the subject of the paper.

Likewise, I was amazed when I got the tip off about gadgets from a developer  
friend at the turn of the year.  We've seen 3 PoC exploits so far, so I'm 
sure the malware community will be taking note.

Thanks, it's pretty interesting to see the various PoC coming out in almost in 
synchronisation with the paper.  I'm glad I'm not the only one concerned by 
the functionality they provide.

New, maybe not... it's simply an mashup (to use another buzzword ;)) of 
numerous existing attack vectors.  What's interesting here for me is that the 
gadget API is a new codebase and still we're facing Microsoft making the same 
old mistakes.  Honestly, irrespective of design flaws, how did the already 
reported vulnerable gadgets make it through the SDL.  We're talking about 
basic input validation flaws in a web app after all.  That for me is the 
crux.  It's not just about the dangers of installing rogue gadgets but the 
exploitation of existing gadgets.

I would like to think my paper is fair in this regard.  I have provided 
details of Microsoft's mitigations including the AD policy stuff in the 
references section of the paper.

As Peter wrote, maybe its the size of the install base ;).  I would guess that 
it's because you'll only end up with user level accounts.  Although I suspect 
haven't counted on ad fraud attacks, hijacking of cookies etc in their risk 
analysis.
