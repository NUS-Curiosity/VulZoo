   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2007-008
Advisory Title: Autodesk Backburner 3.0.2 : System Backdoor
        Author: Dave Hartley and Stephen Kapp
                  dave_hartley@...antec.com
  Release Date: 12-09-2007
   Application: Autodesk Backburner 3.0.2
      Platform: Windows
      Severity: Remotely exploitable
 Vendor status: Verified by vendor - Workaround Suggested - No Patch
    CVE Number: CVE-2007-4749
     Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/25590


Overview:

Autodesk Backburner is a facility wide network render manager for
3ds Max, Combustion, Inferno, Flame, Flint, Fire, Smoke, and Lustre.
Backburner provides a flexible, centralized solution for tracking
and prioritizing background render requests sent by multiple client
applications before sending them to available render nodes for
processing.

http://usa.autodesk.com/


Details:

The Autodesk Backburner software remote job queueing tool allows
users to submit jobs consisting of operating system commands that
will be executed by the Backburner Manager service on the render
server(s) without authentication.

The commands are executed with the privileges of the user account
that started the Manager service on the remote server. Backburner is
designed to be used by administrators on a closed network, the
applications that use Backburner require partial administrative
permissions therfore the service runs with administrative
privileges. A malicous attacker could leverage this functionality
to gain remote administrative control over the host running the
Backburner software

The default behavior for the tool is to search for available servers
on the network. The Backburner Manager Server Service listens by
default on tcp port 3234 for incoming jobs and responds to broadcast
discover requests by default on udp port 3234.

The software can be downloaded for free from the vendors site:

Vendor Response:

"The backburner package is intended to be used in a closed network
i.e. one that does not have routing between its hosts and the rest
of the world. If a customer decides that he cannot do without
Internet connectivity, he should take the appropriate measures to
limit traffic on its subnet so that machines make use of a proxy
to access the Internet, to the very least.

The cmdjob  utility is well documented in the Backburner 2007.1
userï¿½s guide. As well, a notice documents the security issue it
could represent for hosts using it on page 43 of the same guide.

By default, the cmdjob  utility is installed on the system. A user
can remove the cmdjob utility from his system if he does not wish
to submit jobs automatically. This should not affect the rest of
the Autodesk software infrastructure he already is using."


Recommendation:

Remove the cmdjob functionality.  Alternatively, limit network
access to the specific ports to only those hosts that require it.
