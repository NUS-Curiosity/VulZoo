[HSC] Boinc Forum Cross Site Scripting Vulrnability

This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize 
user-supplied input. Attackers may exploit this issue via a web client. An 
attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code execute in 
the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. 
This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials 
and launch other attacks.
