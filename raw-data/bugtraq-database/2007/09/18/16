Subject: A little advisory content correction.

There is a small mistake in the line:

readme.txt /../../../../../../../../asdf.exe

This filename originally looks like:

readme.txt <40 spaces here> /../../../../../../../../asdf.exe 

What I mean, is that only the "readme.txt" part of path is visible for the user, and the directory traversal string can be easily hidden in this way.
The forty space characters aren't displayed correctly due to the fact that they are shortened to one space by the browser.
