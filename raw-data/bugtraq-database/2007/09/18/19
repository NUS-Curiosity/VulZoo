Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in PhpWiki authentication
mechanism.

Background
==========

PhpWiki is an application that creates a web site where anyone can edit
the pages through HTML forms.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/phpwiki      < 1.3.14                          >= 1.3.14

Description
===========

The PhpWiki development team reported an authentication error within
the file lib/WikiUser/LDAP.php when binding to an LDAP server with an
empty password.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could provide an empty password when authenticating.
Depending on the LDAP implementation used, this could bypass the
PhpWiki authentication mechanism and grant the attacker access to the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PhpWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/phpwiki-1.3.14"
