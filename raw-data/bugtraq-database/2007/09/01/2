I'll have to protest here - I never hit at the original article. As you
can read in the blog entry (this is also why I posted the link) I think
that they have done everything alright.

Which is why I agree with them.

That is correct. It could be abused that way. Just like several other
folders on e.g. Vista could be as well since they share that exact
functionality. Still that doesn't make it technically a rootkit. It is a
pretty dumb idea, I totally agree. However AV really shouldn't be fooled
by something like this anymore. Some still is, but they'll grow out of it.

But just as Tyler Reguly phrased it just a few minutes earlier:
> There's a number of reasons why this isn't actually a rootkit... The problem with calling everything by the same name is that you degrade the original meaning of the world

This is the problem I was hitting at. And I am not trying to defend Sony.

Many Greetings
