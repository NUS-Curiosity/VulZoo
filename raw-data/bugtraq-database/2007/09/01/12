Subject: [Paper] The Anatomy of Third Party Pop Up Attacks.

Hi

This article deals with the latest third party popup attacks that are 
performed by an attacker from the rogue
and vulnerable links of the web sites to circumvent the normal 
functioning on the web. The target website
always seems to be the liable web provider from where the popup attacks 
are possible. It also discusses
other problems related with Pop Ups.
