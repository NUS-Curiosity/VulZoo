Actually, the impression I got is that the term "rootkit" was being used
correctly in this case -- in that it referred to software that can be
used when one has rooted a machine to cover one's tracks.  Whether or not
software interacts with the kernel really has nothing to do with whether
it's a rootkit, and I don't recall seeing anything in the linked
discussions of Sony's software that suggested otherwise.
