Subject: Re: Sony: The Return Of The Rootkit

According to Mikko Hypp√∂nen's post to F-Secure's blog Sony Electronics has confirmed that they received the research report this week:
http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-082007.html#00001266

The post says that companies have opened direct discussion channels and Sony will receive the  internal technical report of the case.

Maybe we will see an official response document from Sony later.
