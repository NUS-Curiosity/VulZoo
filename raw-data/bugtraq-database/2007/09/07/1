    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1696

Description:
    Previous versions of the krb5 package are vulnerable to an
    unauthenticated remote arbitrary code execution attack against
    the kadmind server.  Foresight Linux systems are not automatically
    configured with kadmind enabled.  Systems configured as kerberos
    administrative servers are vulnerable.

    6 September 2007 Update: CVE-2007-4743 was also assigned to this
    vulnerability due to a problem with the originally published patch
    (for CVE-2007-3999), which did not fully correct the vulnerability.
    The update provided for rPath Linux used the revised patch, which
    fully corrected the vulnerability.

    Note: Foresight Linux is not vulnerable to CVE-2007-4000 (which was
    announced coincident with CVE-2007-3999); it does not apply to the
    version of kerberos included in Foresight Linux.
