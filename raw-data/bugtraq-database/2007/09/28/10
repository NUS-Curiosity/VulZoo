Remember that the route traffic takes is dynamically determined with each 
packet - and most of those decisions are made outside your own machine. 
The path taken by one packet may differ markedly from that of the previous 
packet to the same destination.

And, in trying do what you suggest, you run into all of the shortcomings 
of traceroute - including:

1. Some nodes won't respond to you.
2. Some nodes may even lie to you.
3. There is no reasonable way to determine the path of the return traffic 
(asymmetric routing).
