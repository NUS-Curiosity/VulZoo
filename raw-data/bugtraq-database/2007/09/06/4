Subject: Re: PHP < 5.2.3 glob() denial of service

Hi there,

I haven't used PHP in a long while and I am by no means an expert.

I think that this type of attack is mitigated by the fact that PHP
doesn't support threading (more accurately, PHP modules don't support
threading) - it isn't thread-safe. Thus, if you are running PHP as CGI
or even a module within Apache, it will only crash the PHP CGI or the
Apache child process (since you have to use prefork)...

These are serious bugs to be sure, but given the above, in the "real
world" I don't think that this could cause too many problems.

Jon
