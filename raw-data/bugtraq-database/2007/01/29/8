Dear Jos,

JK> So what do you think about this?
I think it's not really that much of a threat, but it's a threat and
they don't follow the policies set forward by the government of
Luxembourg.

JK> Has anyone any experience with banks?
Specificaly Luxembourg, yes. There is a govermental branch you should contact in case you have
spotted irregularities - CSSF - http://www.cssf.lu
