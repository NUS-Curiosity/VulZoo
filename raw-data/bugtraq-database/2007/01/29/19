Subject: Re: Windows logoff bug possible security vulnerability and exploit.

I have used te UPHC service, and it helps some.  It does seem to reduce 
the frequency at which the problem occurs.  However, I still have the 
problem with it.  When I check the event viewer with UPHC installed,  I 
get messages that it remaps the registry and some other stuff, but some 
processes from a previous logon continue to run under the account it was 
run as in the same 'session' as the current logon, and at times appear 
on the desktop as a window or in the system tray as an icon.
