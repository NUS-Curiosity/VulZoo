Note how this package does not even contain a file called 
'import_xml.php'.

I think you are referring to this package: 
http://www.oemr.org/files/openemr-2.8.1.tar.gz

Unfortunately your advisory is once again, fake. The variable you are 
referring to is set in interface/globals.php which is of course included 
before the mentioned include statement.

You've got your fake advisories mixed up.

Note how both of these packages appear in this list, and also your other 
advisory:

http://www.milw0rm.com/sploits/milw0rm.tar.bz2

(platforms/php/remote subdirectory)


I suppose we're about to see a report that php is insecure, based on the 
number of advisories on bugtraq?
