Subject: Bluetooth DoS by obex push

Hello,

during a course project studying security and privacy related to Bluetooth, we discovered a simple but effective DoS attack using OBEX push.

Using ussp-push [1], it is possible to send out files very quickly. By continuously trying to push a &#64257;le, the target is &#64258;ooded with prompts whether to accept the &#64257;le or not, which disables any other usage on the phone, including the ability to turn off Bluetooth.
We confirmed the attack to work on the following phones:

- Sony Ericsson K700i
- Nokia N70
- Motorola MOTORAZR V3
- Sony Ericsson W810i
- LG Chocolate KG800

and expect nearly all available phones with Bluetooth to be vulnerable (in contrary to the previous DoS by l2ping).

A proof-of-concept code is attached, using ussp-push and targeting a known MAC. This could be easily extended to target all visible devices. Plus, a user could be forced to accept a possibly malicious file with this attack. Using only one Bluetooth-Dongle, we were able to practically disable three phones simlutaneously.

Best regards,
Stefan Ekerfelt and Armin Hornung
