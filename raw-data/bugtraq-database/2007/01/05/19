Subject: [DRUPAL-SA-2007-002] Drupal 4.6.11 / 4.7.5 fixes DoS issue

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drupal security advisory                                  DRUPAL-SA-2007-002
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project:          Drupal core.
Date:             2007-Jan-05.
Security risk:    Less critical.
Exploitable from: Remote.
Vulnerability:    Denial of service.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Description
-----------
The way page caching was implemented allows a denial of service attack. 
An attacker has to have the ability to post content on the site. He or she 
would then be able to poison the page cache, so that it returns cached 404 
page not found errors for existing pages.

If the page cache is not enabled, your site is not vulnerable. The 
vulnerability only affects sites running on top of MySQL.

 
Versions affected
-----------------
- Drupal 4.6.x versions before Drupal 4.6.11
- Drupal 4.7.x versions before Drupal 4.7.5

Solution
--------
- If you are running Drupal 4.6.x then upgrade to Drupal 4.6.11.
   http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/projects/drupal-4.6.11.tar.gz
- If you are running Drupal 4.7.x then upgrade to Drupal 4.7.5.
   http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/projects/drupal-4.7.5.tar.gz

- To patch Drupal 4.6.10 use http://drupal.org/files/sa-2006-002/4.6.10.patch.
- To patch Drupal 4.7.4 use http://drupal.org/files/sa-2006-002/4.7.4.patch.

Please note that the patches only contain changes related to this advisory, and
