Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities have been found in Squid which make it susceptible
to Denial of Service attacks.

Background
==========

Squid is a multi-protocol proxy server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-proxy/squid       < 2.6.7                            >= 2.6.7

Description
===========

Squid fails to correctly handle ftp:// URI's. There is also an error in
the external_acl queue which can cause an infinite looping condition.

Impact
======

An attacker could attempt to retrieve a specially crafted URI via a
Squid server causing the service to crash. If an attacker could
generate a sufficiently high load on the Squid services, they could
cause a Denial of Service by forcing Squid into an infinite loop.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/squid-2.6.7"

==========
