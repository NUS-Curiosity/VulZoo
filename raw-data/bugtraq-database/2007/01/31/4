Description
===========
By sending a specially crafted series of packets to the LGSERVER.EXE
process that listens on TCP port 2200, it is possible to cause the process
to terminate.

=================
Technical Details
=================
During the authentication negotiation, the third client packet at HEX
address (DWORD) 0x11 - 0x14 in the third client packet specifies a data
length. Setting this this value to 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff causes a read
access violation to occur, terminating the process.
