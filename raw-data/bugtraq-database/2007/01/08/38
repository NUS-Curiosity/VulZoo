Of course anti-DNS pinning would work against my algorithm, but anti-DNS 
pinning is a larger problem, one that is out of scope here. I mean - so 
many things are broken when anti-DNS pinning is introduced... especially 
any IP-based security techniques. Anti-DNS pinning should be solved by 
browser vendors (if possible), regardless of the PDF problem. And at any 
rate, I feel that my algorithm makes the attack harder because it forces 
it to involve anti-DNS pinning.

Anyway, if you worry about the current anti-DNS pinning techniques, you 
may simply serve your PDF files in HTTPS only. I believe this will 
defeat the present day anti-DNS pinning techniques (in the sense that 
the user under anti-DNS pinning attack will get a certificate error 
before being served the PDF).
