Erik Kamerling pointed off-the-list that everybody's favourite Dan
Kaminsky (www.doxpara.com) did some research on that subject, too; his
'paratrace' followed a similar principle, but relied on the party
correcting out-of-sync retransmissions. I found this approach to give poor
results in today's networks with overzealous commercial packet filters,
and hence, my tool implements an invasive approach where the current
session is trashed with in-sync data to solicit a high response rate.

Still, a credit is due!
