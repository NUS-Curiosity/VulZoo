Subject: London DC4420 meet - Wednesday 17th January, 2007

Happy New Year etc... Hopefully that's the last time this year I'll need 
to say that! :)

I hope you all had a refreshing and constructive break and are looking 
forward to phun and games in 2007...

For our part, we will be kicking off with a meet next Wednesday, January 
17th, 2007 at the Charing Cross Sports Club, Hammersmith, starting at 
19:30...

Nearest tube Hammersmith or Barons Court.

I have no idea what talks will materialize, but last time we had too 
many to fit in so I don't expect there to be a shortage... I've got a 
few RFID issues to report, and will be doing an experiment in London in 
the morning, so I'm crossing all my bits that I'll have something quite 
cool to show for it... :P

We are in the process of replacing our webserver, which has given 
sterling service but is now suffering from advanced senile dementia, so 
apologies if you have trouble getting in over the next couple of days... 
Normal service will be resumed shortly...

Looking forward to seeing you there!

cheers,
