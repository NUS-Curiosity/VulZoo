Subject: Re: Remove all admin->root authorization prompts from OSX

Hello,

About sudo in particular.

* You can force for a prompt (5mn by default on Mac OSX,) adding a line
such as the following in /etc/sudoers (using the visudo command):
  Defaults        timestamp_timeout = 0

* By default users do not authenticate on a per-tty basis. You can
enforce it with the following option:
  Defaults        tty_tickets

The last is activated by default on GNU/Linux distro Ubuntu. The reading
of the sudoers manual page is a very interesting.

Regards,

A trojan that gets control of an admin's session should not be able to escalate itself to root without a password prompt, which requires a human to decide (rightly or wrongly...) yes I do want to increase the authority of this process.

Presumably there is a window of vulnerability for a few minutes AFTER you have been root during which you could fall victim to a trojan.
