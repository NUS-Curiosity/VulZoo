 PHP Membership Manager Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability


PHP Membership Manager is a browser based tool which allows a site owner to easily manage an unlimited number of username / password accounts and groups which access secure, protected areas of a web site which require logging in before accessing.


This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Attackers may exploit this issue via a web client. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
