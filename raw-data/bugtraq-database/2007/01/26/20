rPath Security Advisory: 2007-0020-1
Published: 2007-01-25
Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Severe
Exposure Level Classification:
    Local Root Deterministic Privilege Escalation
Updated Versions:
    rmake=/conary.rpath.com@rpl:devel//1/1.0.3-2-0.1

References:
    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-987

Description:
    Previous versions of the rmake package do not drop supplemental users
    in the changeroot environment for builds.  This provides malicious
    packages with excess permissions that are configuration-dependent,
    and may allow local users to run arbitrary code as the root user.
