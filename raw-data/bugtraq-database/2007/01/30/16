I am not sure I understand how you propose to build an automatic
system to attack it: If you can tell that two images contain the same
number then it is very likely that you can recognize the numbers
themselves (there are only 10 different digits). OTOH, if you have a
human in the loop, they can just use gimp to create the averaged
figure images from a single image per figure, and then use these
templates to calculate correlation in different places of a given
challenge.

If the number of distinct tuples (position, angle) is not a very large
number, the correlation attack will work anyway (and I doubt that it
is possible to make the number large, because the attacker can try to
start with a scaled down image and templates).
