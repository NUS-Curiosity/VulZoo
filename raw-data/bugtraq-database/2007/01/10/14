Subject: VLC Format String Vulnerability also in XINE

Hi,

I have read about 
Bugtraq ID: 21852
I tried the demo-exploit from 
http://www.securityfocus.com/data/vulnerabilities/exploits/VLCMediaSlayer-x86.pl
Then I tried to play the file in xine and got ...

This is xine (X11 gui) - a free video player v0.99.4.
(c) 2000-2004 The xine Team.
xiTK received SIGSEGV signal, RIP.
Aborted

My system is an up-to-date SUSE LINUX 10.1 (i586)
I think xine has also this vulnerability.

Regards Sven
