You're not being rude at all-- that was my point about security@....com
"being somewhat obvious." RFC states the use of a "security" mailbox.  But
in the absence of any official reference, you really don't know if it is a
valid contact or not.

The main point was that when someone goes to a vendor's domain and clicks
"contact us" there should be a security reference there.  That fact is
evident when you consider that this thread wouldn't exist in the first place
had SAP simply provided that information.  A security researcher shouldn't
have to Google various machinations of possible security contact references,
nor should they have to search off-site security portals (and have to trust
the results) to see if a particular email address exists when it is trivial
to stick a link on vendor's "official" page...  It's really not that big of
a deal.
