While nobody could argue with that, I've lost count of the number of
banks and similar organisations to which I've tried to report phishing
scams via their "security@" alias, only to get a bounce saying no such
address.

And in at least one case (org name escapes me now) the "security@"
alias turned out to be a *physical* security department, populated by
large gentlemen with peaked caps and bulging armpits ... so you can't
rely on "security@".
