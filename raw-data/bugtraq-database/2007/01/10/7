Summary
=======

Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise, Cisco Unified Contact Center
Hosted, Cisco IP Contact Center Enterprise, and Cisco IP Contact
Center Hosted editions are affected by a vulnerability that may
result in the restart of JTapi Gateway process. Until this process
restarts, no new connections can be processed. Existing connections
will continue to work.

Cisco Unified Contact Center Express and Cisco IP Contact Center
Express are not affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070110-jtapi.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

All versions of Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise, Cisco
Unified Contact Center Hosted, Cisco IP Contact Center Enterprise,
and Cisco IP Contact Center Hosted editions are affected.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

  * Cisco Unified Contact Center Express and Cisco IP Contact Center
    Express editions are not affected.
  * Cisco Unified Intelligent Contact Management Enterprise and
    Hosted are not affected.

No other Cisco products are known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (formerly Cisco IP Contact
Center [IPCC] Enterprise), an integral component of the Cisco Unified
Communications system, provides intelligent routing and call
treatment with blending of multiple communication channels.

Cisco Unified Contact Center Hosted (formerly known as Cisco IP
Contact Center [IPCC] Hosted) is a platform that enables customers to
move to a Customer Interaction Network. The Customer Interaction
Network is a distributed, IP-based customer service infrastructure
comprising a suite of multichannel services and customer relationship
management applications.

A vulnerability exists in all versions of Cisco Unified Contact
Center Enterprise, Cisco Unified Contact Center Hosted, Cisco IP
Contact Center Enterprise, and Cisco IP Contact Center Hosted
editions that may result in the restart of JTapi Gateway process. The
restart of this process can take up to several minutes and during
this time no new calls can be processed. Existing calls continue to
work. If the system is deployed in a redundant way, the redundant
system will take over preventing a loss of service. However the JTapi
Gateway on the redundant system can also be restarted by exploiting
the same vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker will need to complete a
3-way TCP handshake to the JTapi server port. This port number can be
dependent on how the product is deployed and whether there is a
redundant pair of servers. It can be found in the Windows registry by
looking up the jtapiServerPortNumber value in the Windows Registry,
located at:

  * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cisco Systems, Inc.\ICM\
    [instanceName]\PG[Number][A/B]\PG\CurrentVersion\JGWS\jgw[number]
    \JGWData\Config.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Cisco will
provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then compute
environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks. Cisco PSIRT will set the bias
in all cases to normal. Customers are encouraged to apply the bias
parameter when determining the environmental impact of a particular
vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at 
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html.

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at 
https://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in the
restart of JTapi Gateway process. Restarting this process can take
several minutes and during this time no new calls can be processed.
Existing calls continue to work without any problems.

Software Version and Fixes
==========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

No workarounds exist for this vulnerability. The following general
mitigation actions are relevant for this vulnerability: Ensuring the
Cisco Unified Contact Center or Cisco IP Contact Center is physically
or logically separated from the data network and isolated from the
Internet which will limit the exposure to the exploitation of the
vulnerability from the Internet or internal data networks.

Apply access control lists (ACLs) on routers, switches, and firewalls
installed in front of the vulnerable network device such that TCP/IP
traffic destined for the Cisco Unified Contact Center or Cisco IP
Contact Center is allowed only from trusted sources. Refer to 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/tacl.html for examples on how to 
apply ACLs on Cisco routers.
