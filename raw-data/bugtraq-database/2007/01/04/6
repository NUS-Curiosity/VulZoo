No, it can't. Client-side pipelining using simultaneous sessions with
keep-alives is usually severely restricted on server-side (exactly for the
reason they can be abused to DoS the server), and the overhead is much
higher (you need to send hundreds of bytes to request a copy of a static
page).

Here, requesting an extra copy costs you 3 bytes, and that is in my
opinion notable - because you can do it thousands of times in a single
short request.

Not really; see above. These are typically well known, preventable by
configuring server-side limits, and require a much higher overhead.
