Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] Universal PDF XSS After Party(posible solution)

If I recall correctly from the Content-Disposition HTML attachment
handling vulnerabilities last year, Opera didn't reliably abide by the
Content-Disposition header.

Additionally, Content-Disposition support in IE, Firefox, Opera,
Safari and a few others was extremely inconsistent from version to
version.

Thank you,
