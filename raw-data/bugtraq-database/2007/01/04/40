YMMV, but for Apache-based servers, one of the two methods below -may- do the
trick (no guarantees that it won't break your app in the process):

# mod_rewrite prevention vs. DOM attacks on static content
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} .*\.(img|jpg|pdf|css|js)[^A-Za-z0-9._?&%-]
RewriteRule (.*\.(img|pdf|cgi|jpg)) $1 [R,L]

# mod_security 2.0 prevention vs. DOM attacks on static content
SecRule REQUEST_URI_RAW: ".*\.(img|jpg|pdf|css|js)[^A-Za-z0-9._?&%-]" \
    "deny,log,status:501,id:955001,severity:2,msg:'DOM attack on static
content'"
