Subject Name:            Drupal
Subject Summary:         CMS
Subject Home:            http://drupal.org/
Subject Versions:        * <= 4.7.4

Vulnerability Id:        none
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           denial of service, privilege escalation

Description:
    According to upstream vendor security advisories [0][1], two
    vulnerabilities exist in the content management system Drupal [2],
    version up to and including 4.7.4.
    
    The first vulnerability exists because a few arguments passed via
    URLs are not properly sanitized before display. When an attacker is
    able to entice an administrator to follow a specially crafted link,
    arbitrary HTML and script code can be injected and executed in the
    victim's session. Such an attack may lead to administrator access if
    certain conditions are met.
    
    The second vulnerability is related to the way page caching was
    implemented. It allows a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker
    has to have the ability to post content on the site. He or she would
    then be able to poison the page cache, so that it returns cached
    HTTP response code 404 ("page not found") errors for existing pages.
    If the page cache is not enabled, your site is not vulnerable. The
    vulnerability only affects sites running on top of MySQL, which is
    the case in the OpenPKG packaging of Drupal.
