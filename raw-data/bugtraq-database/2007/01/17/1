                        Security Advisory


   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2007-001
Advisory Title: Oracle Application Server 10g - Directory Traversal
  Release Date: 16-01-2007
   Application: Oracle Application Server 10g Release 3 (10.1.3.0.0)
      Platform: Windows and possibly others
      Severity: Remotely exploitable / User access
        Author: Oliver Karow / Oliver_Karow[@]symantec.com
 Vendor status: Verified by Vendor, Update Available
    CVE Number: CVE-2007-0222
     Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/22027


Overview:

- From Oracle's web site: "Oracle Application Server 10g offers a
comprehensive solution for developing, integrating, and
deploying your enterprise's applications, portals, and Web
services. Based on a powerful and scalable J2EE server, Oracle
Application Server 10g provides complete business integration
and business intelligence suites, and best-of-breed portal
software. Oracle Application Server 10g is the only platform
designed for grid computing as well as full lifecycle support
for Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)."

A vulnerable server side component allows remote access to
files outside of the application's root directory with
permissions of the LocalSystem process. No authentication is
required.


Details:

The server side component EmChartBean is part of the Oracle
Enterprise Manager 10g Application Server Control Software.
EmChartBean is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack.

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending an unauthenticated
http GET request. Remote access is granted to files outside of
the application's root directory with permissions of the
Javaw.exe process, which by default runs with LocalSystem
privileges.

The server side component EmChartBean only exists at runtime,
and is unpacked from a JAR file after an initial call to the
login page. Thus, a single request to the login page is
required before an attacker can successfully exploit the
vulnerability.


Vendor Response:

The fix for this security vulnerability is included in Oracle's
January 2007 Critical Patch Update. The Critical Patch Update
advisory, which lists the versions affected and contains links
to more information and patches, is available at:
http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpujan2007.html

The main page for Oracle Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts
is available at:
http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/alerts.htm


Recommendation:

Follow your organization's testing procedures before applying
patches or workarounds.  Symantec recommends that customers should
apply Oracle's update as soon as possible.


Oracle strongly recommends applying the Oracle Enterprise Manager
patches released with the January 2007 Critical Patch Update to all
instances affected by this problem.
