For what it is worth, Apache 2.2.x and later introduce support for http accept()
filtering on platforms which support httpfilter.  Since Apache 2.0.x, AcceptEx
is supported on Win32 to pend accept() for at least the initial request payload.

Of course this is not without some resource utilization for the incomplete
request payloads, but at least it does offload the resources from the web
server itself to the kernel socket layer.
