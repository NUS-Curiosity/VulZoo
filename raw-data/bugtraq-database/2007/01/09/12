I don't want to be rude but :
- security@...ain.tld is the only standardized security contact (as
defined by RFC 2142)
- googling security@....com would bring some results
- this was already answered on the Full-Disclosure mailing list
- the OSVDB Vendor Dictionary contains a record for SAP
- even the SecurityFocus site has some references to this email
