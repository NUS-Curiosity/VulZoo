Description:
    Previous versions of the xorg-x11 package are vulnerable to an attack
    which allows authenticated X connections to provide intentionally
    malformed data which the X server does not fully validate before
    using.  This vulnerability is known to enable a Denial of Service
    attack; any process with an authenticated connection to the X
    server can cause the entire X server process to crash.  (It may
    enable other attacks as well; the full extent of vulnerabilities
    created by these faults is not completely analyzed.)
