Hello Lee, 

if they think or not it is a security flaw, well, it's their opinion.
I think that the possibility to enumerate users is a security flaw, and you?

It depends from what the system is used for. There are a lot of companies
that use to attach important documents to the remedy tickets or use remedy
to trace every activity. According to you, is it important to access the
repository in which every activity has been traced ? 

Best regards,
