That's right, it's not vendor specific guys.  Yay!

Cacti version 0.8.6j has been released to address multiple 
vulnerabilities discovered in Cacti's PHP-based poller.

It is recommended that all users upgrade immediately. A patch containing
only the security fixes has been provided for both Cacti versions 0.8.6h
and 0.8.6i. Please see the official patches page for application
