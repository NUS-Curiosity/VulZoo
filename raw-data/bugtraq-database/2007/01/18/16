This vulnerability has been known for years.  OpenBSD implemented a
kernel check to block this attack in 1998.  FreeBSD and NetBSD have
similar kernel checks and I believe glibc also has checks to block
this.  It is disturbing that none of the commercial OS vendors appear
to have bothered to protect against this.
