Subject: Re: AToZed Software Intraweb Component for Borland Delphi and
 Kylix DoS vulnerability

Unless otherwise demostrated, this report is fake. We have never been contacted by this person and apart from an invalid workaround, there is also no actual mention of how this DOS is acheived, let alone mentioning that it's based on IIS so in principle could effect IIS itself and not only ISAPI applications that are produced by Intraweb.
