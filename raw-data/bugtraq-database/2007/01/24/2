Synopsis
========

A shell script commonly released with OpenLDAP makes insecure usage of
files in /tmp during the emerge process.

Background
==========

OpenLDAP Software is an open source implementation of the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol.

Affected packages
=================

                                                          >= 2.3.30-r2

                                                          >= 2.3.30-r2
     net-nds/openldap      < 2.3.30-r2                   >= 2.1.30-r10
                                                          >= 2.2.28-r7
                                                          >= 2.3.30-r2

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Team has discovered that the
file gencert.sh distributed with the Gentoo ebuild for OpenLDAP does
not exit upon the existence of a directory in /tmp during installation
allowing for directory traversal.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create a symbolic link in /tmp and potentially
overwrite arbitrary system files upon a privileged user emerging
OpenLDAP.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenLDAP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "net-nds/openldap"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:

confidentiality and security of our users machines is of utmost
importance to us. Any security concerns should be addressed to
