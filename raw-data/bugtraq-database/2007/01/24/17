4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Sienzo Digital 
Music Mentor, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise
a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the
NCTAudioFile2.AudioFile ActiveX control when handling the
"SetFormatLikeSample()" method. This can be exploited to cause a 
stack-based buffer overflow by passing an overly long string (about 
4124 bytes) as argument to the affected method.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a
user e.g. visits a malicious website.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 2.6.0.4.
