Wow you can program recursive functions! Congrats!

But that is only recursive loop, just close the page and it is done.
There are literally loads of these kind of problems in both Firefox and
IE and quite likely most other browsers.

There is a much funnier bug though, and just for the fun of it, and in
the hope that some Mozilla folks get annoyed by it and maybe fix it
after it was reported 6 years ago:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=59314

Reported: 2000-11-06 17:11 PST
Severity: critical
Priority: P3
Target Milestone: Future
Version: Trunk
Hardware: All
OS: All

Yep, it will be fixed in _the future_ ;)

The fun of this bugger is that if you have say 20 tabs open that you
can't swap tabs back. Thus you end up killing the process, loosing all
of them. A lot of fun when you where googling for something and opening
a lot of windows.

Greets,
 Jeroen
