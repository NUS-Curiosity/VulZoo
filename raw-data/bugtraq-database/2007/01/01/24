<Peeve type="pet">
"They" (developers) and "it" (the secure language) are both moving
targets.
There is no "genetic memory" with the human race; any more than there is
an "inherently secure" language.  For every developer that learns how to
write "secure code", at least one more starts cutting his/her teeth in
the same language; possibly for the same reasons.  Anyone who insists
that there either exists a "secure language" or that the problem of
"secure code" can be "completely solved" is IMHO, severely deluded.
Neither will ever be even remotely true.

If you have issue with someone's code habits, address it with them
first.  This is part & parcel to the "education" process.  If this fails
because of their unwillingness or inability to adjust, then you've done
what you can.  If this unresolved problem presents a public disservice,
then you report it.  Public opinion is a powerful motivator.

But aparently they aren't educatable - hence they stick to this
language. (Because of the many bad examples they can cut&paste code
from)
