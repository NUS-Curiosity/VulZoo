Subject: Contact request - nVidia

Does anyone out there have any security contact details at all, at the very least someone at nVidia who I can ask? I've found the email addresses for both FreeBSD and Linux bug reports for the nVidia reference drivers, but nothing for the Windows drivers.

Cheers,
Jonathan
