Description
-----------
The default login error page reflects unfiltered user input for multiple
fields. Exploting the vulnerability will lead to so-called cross-site
scripting (XSS).

XSS Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability
typically found in web applications which allow code injection by
malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users. Examples
of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts. An exploited
cross-site scripting vulnerability can be used by attackers to bypass
access controls such as the same origin policy. Recently,
vulnerabilities of this kind have been exploited to craft powerful
phishing attacks and browser exploits. Cross-site scripting was
originally referred to as CSS, although this usage has been largely
discontinued.
