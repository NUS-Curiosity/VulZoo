Vulnerability Description
----------------------------------------
MaraDNS 1.2.12.05 (stable) and 1.3.04 (testing) versions are prone to local resource exhaustion vulnerabilities susceptible of causing a denial of service.
DNS requests for reverse lookups (opcode != 0) or non-Internet class records (qclass != 1) queries will cause the server to leak approximately 550 bytes of memory.
This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause MaraDNS to allocate an arbitrary large amount of memory, thus provoking a remote denial of service when exhausting all the available memory.
