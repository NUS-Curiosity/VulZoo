Hello everyone,

After trying to report bugs to FuseTalk, and seeing them providing patches to
customers (dropping new fixed .cfm files in a private place reserved to
customers) without giving proper credits and without reporting them publicly
(we were following the Full Disclosure Policy v2.0), we decided to release
the advisories. It's a kinda weird attitude from a company that sold its
product to the NASA, Bloomberg, Adobe, AMD, etc. Here is the first one:
------------------------
Advisory: FuseTalk affected by a SQL Injection
Product: FuseTalk Basic/Standard/Enterprise ColdFusion version
Version: unknown, it seems the vendor fixed the bug silently in latest version
Risk: Medium
Reported on: April 17, 2007
Vendor: FuseTalk
Impact: data manipulation

Product Overview
------------------------
With an easy-to-use, intuitive administration system, extensive customization
capabilities and a rich feature set, FuseTalk is a pleasure to use for both
administrators and forum members. Full RDBMS support, high performance and full
linear scalability allow FuseTalk to meet your demands.Over 1,000 customers use
FuseTalk to deliver the benefits of collaborative online communities, including
VCampus, Rockwell, Seagate Software, Macromedia, Hasbro, U.S. Air Force, AT&T,
Citicorp, McCormick and Company, Adobe, eBay, AnandTech, NASA, Bloomberg,
the U.S. Dept. of Energy, etc.

Summary
------------------------
old versions of FuseTalk are vulnerable to a classic SQL Injection bug that
leads to data manipulation.

Technical Details
------------------------
The problem lies in the /forum/include/error/autherror.cfm script,the variable
*errorcode* is not sanitized.
