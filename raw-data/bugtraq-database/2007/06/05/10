Details

Symantec Reporting Server is an optional web application within the Symantec System Center console that can be used to be used to create reports about Symantec Client Security and Symantec AntiVirus products in an enterprise network.

Symantec was notified that a file created in the process of exporting data from Reporting Server could be potentially be manipulated by an unauthorized user to create a malicious executable file.   An attacker could then execute the file, potentially gaining access to the server in the context of the web server user.  

Symantec Response

Symantec engineers verified that the issue exists in Reporting Server included with the product versions listed above.   The error occurred due to the improper initialization of a variable, and updates have been released to correct the problem.  

This vulnerability affects only systems on which the Reporting Server program is installed. Individual client systems are not affected.

Symantec is not aware of any customers impacted by this issue, or of any attempts to exploit the issue.  However, we recommend that customers update Reporting Server immediately to protect against possible attempts to exploit this issue. 


Mitigation and best practices

- Uninstall Reporting Server if it is not being used
 - Symantec Client Security Console (SCS Console) and the Reporting Server interface should be restricted to trusted access only.  
 - Ensure that the SCS Console and Reporting Server interface are never visible external to the network.  This greatly reduces opportunities for unauthorized remote access. 
- User accounts for Reporting Server should be unique, and different from the userï¿½s network login account.  
- Delete exported data files which are no longer needed.
