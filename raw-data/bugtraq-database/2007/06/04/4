Subject: CACTUSHOP 6 Default Installation Allows Remote Database Disclosure

Cactushop (V6) allows remote users to download the database which contains creditcard
numbers and critical information. The affected carts default installation gives away the path to database file. As a result, an attacker exploiting this vulnerability will be able to obtain detailed private customer information, including credit card numbers, order details, addresses, telephone numbers, etc.
