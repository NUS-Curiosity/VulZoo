Subject: 2007-06-03: PeerCast streaming server submits cleartext password

Hi there,

peercast also submits the configured password in cleartext. e.g.
http://www.domain.tld:7144/admin?cmd=login&pass=asdfg.jodi.org&submit=Login

well, I have just played a bit around with it, so I assume this is already known. Solution might be
to use stunnel.

Have Fun :)
