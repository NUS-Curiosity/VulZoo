It is unclear who "you" is supposed to be here.  I'm guessing this is 
the vulnerability referred to by:

OSVDB 18407
CVE 2005-2472
ISS 21636
Secunia 16306
Bugtraq 14434

None of these indicate a solution is available.

The Mail List post reporting this vulnerability was 
http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2005-08/0002.html

In the post, it says that a patch will soon be available.  A quick 
glance at the download page at http://www.netcplus.com/downloads.html 
doesn't reveal a link to download the patch for 4.6.  I also don't see 
any advisory for users of 4.6 that a patch is available.

We will be happy to update our entry at osvdb.org, after verifying that 
a patch exists for 4.6, and an upgrade to 4.7 also solves the problem. 
Is that correct?

Thanks,
