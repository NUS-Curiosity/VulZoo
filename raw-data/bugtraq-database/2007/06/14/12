 Framework Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

Apache MyFaces Tomahawk JSF Framework Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.14.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 14, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Java Server Faces, JSF, is a framework used to create server side GUI
Web applications. It is comparable to the Java Struts framework. Apache
MyFaces Tomahawk is an open source implementation of JSF. The Tomahawk
version contains Apache extensions to the base specification. More
information is available at the following URL.

http://myfaces.apache.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an input validation vulnerability in Apache
Software Foundation's MyFaces Tomahawk JSF framework could allow an
attacker to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

The code responsible for parsing HTTP requests is vulnerable to an XSS
vulnerability. When parsing the 'autoscroll' parameter from a POST or
GET request, the value of this variable is directly inserted into
JavaScript that is sent back to the client. This allows an attacker to
run arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the affected domain of the
MyFaces application being targeted.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to
conduct an XSS attack on a user. This could allow an attacker to steal
cookies, inject content into pages, or submit requests using the user's
credentials.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must use social engineering
techniques to persuade the user to click a link to a Web application
that uses MyFaces Tomahawk. In the following example, the [javascript]
portion of the request would be present unfiltered in the returned
content.
