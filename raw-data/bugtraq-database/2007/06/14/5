Published: 2007-06-13
Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Minor

    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1450

Description:
    Previous versions of the spamassassin package are vulnerable to a Denial
    of Service attack in which a local attacker may overwrite arbitrary
    files when spamd is run using uncommon configuration options.  rPath
    Linux does not configure spamd using these options and is thus not
    vulnerable to this attack.
