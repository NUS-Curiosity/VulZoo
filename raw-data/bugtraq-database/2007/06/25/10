===========
Description
===========
Ingres 2006 is a venerable and functionality-rich RDBMS that has
recently been made available under the Gnu Public License (GPL).

A setuid binary, "wakeup", allows any user to truncate any file with the
privileges of the "ingres" user.

=================
Technical Details
=================
The "wakeup" binary creates a file named "alarmwkp.def" in the current
directory, truncating the file if already exists. The "wakeup" binary is
setuid "ingres" and world-executable, thus any user can truncate a file
with the privileges of the "ingres" user by creating a symbolic link in
the current directory.

===============
Fix Information
===============
Ingres issued a patch for this issue on the 21st June 2007.
