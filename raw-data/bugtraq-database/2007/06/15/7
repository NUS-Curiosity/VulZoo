Description:
    Previous versions of the evolution-data-server package are vulnerable to
    multiple attacks of varying severity, the most severe of which allows a
    compromised or malicious server to execute arbitrary code as the
    connecting user.
    
    Additionally, previous versions of evolution-data-server incorrectly did
    not include kerberos support on the x86_64 platform.
