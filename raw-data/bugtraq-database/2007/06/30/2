1) SQL Injection in login function. With help of this injection is possible to make per-symbol brute of tables names of blog's database (magic_quotes_gpc should be tured off).

------------------------------------------
"$sql = "select * from $tblUsers where login = '$login'";
if ( $login	 != $row['login'] )	$valid_user = 0;
		if ( $password  != $row['password'] ) $valid_user = 0;"
------------------------------------------

2) Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
