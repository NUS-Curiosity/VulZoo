Subject: Safari for Windows, 0day URL protocol handler command injection

Apple released version 3 of their popular Safari web browser today, with 
the added twist of offering both an OS X and a Windows version. Given 
that Apple has had a lousy track record with security on OS X, in 
addition to a hostile attitude towards security researchers, a lot of 
people are expecting to see quite a number of vulnerabilities targeted 
towards this new Windows browser.

There is a URL protocol handler command injection vulnerability in 
Safari for Windows that allows you to execute shell commands with 
arbitrary arguments. This vulnerability can be triggered without user 
interaction simply by visiting a webpage. The full advisory and a 
working Proof of Concept exploit can be found at
