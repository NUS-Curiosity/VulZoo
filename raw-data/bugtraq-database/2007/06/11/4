Subject: Cisco Trust Agent  Vulnerability

Vulnerability:
There is a vulnerability affecting the latest version (v2.1.103.0) of the Cisco Trust Agent software for MacOS X that can allow an individual with physical access to an endpoint to bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the local machine.  

Description:
When Cisco Secure Access Control Server is configured to display a message to the end user following a posture check, the Cisco Trust Agent installed on a MacOS X machine may display the message over the top of the login screen when the client is powered up or rebooted.  When the message is displayed, a user can access System Preferences through the Apple Menu as the root user and make changes to user accounts, including changing existing passwords.  

A malicious user with this access can change an administrator account password without knowledge of the existing password and then proceed to login using that account.
