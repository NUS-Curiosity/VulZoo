Packeteer PacketShaper Web Management Denial of Service


Critical: Less critical
Impact: DoS
Where: Local network

Product: Packeteer PacketShaper
http://www.packetshaper.com/


Packeteer PacketShaper is susceptible to a denial of service vulnerability in the web management interface. Requesting a specific URL will cause the device to reboot:

http://(target)/rpttop.htm?OP.MEAS.DATAQUERY=&MEAS.TYPE=

The user must first log in but even read-only "look" access is sufficient.


The vulnerability has been identified in version 7.3.0g2 and 7.5.0g1. However, other versions may be also affected.


Solution:
Restrict network access to the device management interfaces


Snort:
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET $HTTP_PORTS
    (msg:"WEB-MISC PacketShaper DoS attempt"; flow:to_server,established;
    uricontent:"/rpttop.htm"; pcre:"/MEAS\.TYPE=(?!(link|class)&)/U";
    classtype:denial-of-service; sid:TBD; rev:1;)
