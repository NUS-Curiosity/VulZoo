======================================================================
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered boundary errors in the detection of
executable packers in libdayzero.dll as loaded by the Filter Hub
(filter-hub.exe) of Symantec Mail Security for SMTP.  The errors
can be exploited to cause unhandled memory access violations causing
the filter hub service to crash.

The crash will cause the Filter Hub service to restart and attempt to
reprocess the malicious email causing the mail queue to backup.

The functions that detect the "PE-Shield v0.2" and
"ASPack v1.00-1.08.02" both use a value from the executable as an
offset into a buffer with insufficient validation.

======================================================================
5) Solution

Apply fixes.

Symantec Mail Security for SMTP:
Update to version 5.0.1 and apply patch 181.

Symantec Mail Security Appliance:
Update to version 5.0.0-36 or later.
