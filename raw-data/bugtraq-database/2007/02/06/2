Subject: Re: Jetty Session ID Prediction

Hi folks,

I've posted a paper that explains a little more here:

http://www.ngssoftware.com/research/papers/Randomness.pdf

The idea is eventually to have a tool that performs point-and-click
identification, analysis and prediction of an unknown source of
"randomness", including LCGs but also more advanced generators such as
the Mersenne twister and SHA1PRNG.

Cheers,

     -chris.
