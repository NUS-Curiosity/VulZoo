With MSIE7, it is possible only if you check 'Allow websites to open
windows without address or status bar' for that particular zone;
otherwise, all windows will have a minimal URL bar attached.

I'm not sure whether this setting is default - if it is, yeah, that'd be
bad for MSIE.

As far as Opera is concerned - by default, Javascript can't hide address
bars, and if you change this option, the originating URL is still
displayed.
