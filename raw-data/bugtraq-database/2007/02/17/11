I have to wonder if the "old bug" complaints are coming in reference to
one of the following:

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/3064/info
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5531/info

I know that my initial reaction was "haven't I seen this before?" but
the above two are what I found in my notes when I looked back.

(Note that the second of the two is reported to actually reference a
problem with login and not in.telnetd.)

 	We are kind of going around and around, but there's a couple of 
aspects to this that haven't even been talked about:

1) This seems like a case of "old code" somehow creeping back in to the 
current versions, and that's a phenomenon I've seen happen at a couple
of 
different places that I've worked at over the years. It's kind of a 
special case of version control gone bad, and I'm interested in how that

can happen and how to watch out for it.

1a) People have said that this bug was in old versions of SunOS/Solaris 
(and AIX I think) but nobody ever nailed down exactly when this was
fixed, 
versionwise. In fact, did anybody reproduce this in anything other than 
Solaris 10? It'd be nice to know the last old version that has the bug,
& 
the 1st that doesn't.

2) Does this have anything to do with the OpenSolaris effort? Like are 
people pulling in code from other sources?
