Bookmarklets should be bookmarkable only manually, with user knowledge and
consent (that is, you need to copy-and-paste the URL, etc). This seems to
be the case for javascript: URLs.

Here, the situation is different: the user can, and quite likely will,
unknowingly bookmark a script while attempting to bookmark a regular page
via Ctrl-D + <return>. He doesn't expect or want this code to later run in
the context of his start page or any other resource (principle of least
astonishment, etc, etc).
