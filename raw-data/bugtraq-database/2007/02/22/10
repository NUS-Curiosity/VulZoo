Subject: Re: Drive-by Pharming Threat

Have you actually tried this attack? In the paper by Stamm, Ramzan & Jakobsson there is no mention of tests against real routers.

The reason I ask is that I have configured Linksys and Netgear wireless routers and they only allow access to the admin interface via one specific hardwired port (generally the highest or lowest numbered one). It seems reasonable to assume that most people who buy a wireless router primarily use wireless access when connecting the web. Personally I only use the wired port to make configuration changes. This completely prevents the attack.

If I am right, this may be a lot less serious threat than you have suggested.

On the other hand if I am wrong, it may be a lot more serious, as the interfaces I have used will tell you the WEP key in hex.
