Subject: OWASP JBroFuzz 0.5 Fuzzer Released!

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_JBroFuzz

Version 0.5 has been released

JBroFuzz offers web directory enumeration, carrying a list of directory names to check against over http/s.

Oh, and the motto goes: If you can't fuzz with JBroFuzz, you probably don't want to fuzz!

Thank you,
