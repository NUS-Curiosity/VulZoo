Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] Firefox bookmark cross-domain surfing vulnerability

This vulnerability is cute but not very useful mainly because a lot of
social engineering is required.

However, here is an interesting thought for you: instead of asking the
user into bookmarking a page you can supply the bookmark directly to
their browser by using Live Bookmarks. So, a mainstream attack will be
when a SPLOG network injects malicious links into their feeds. If
someone happens to be subscribed to this network with a Live Bookmark
and they click on it... well you know.

I haven't tested this, although it should work. So, although I would
rate this issue as low risk, it could as well be quite high or at
least medium.

cheers
