Cisco Security Advisory: 
Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco PIX and ASA Appliances

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20070214-pix

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070214-pix.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 February 14 1600 UTC (GMT)

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple vulnerabilities are found in Cisco PIX 500 Series Security
Appliances and the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.
They affect the following:

  * Enhanced inspection of Malformed Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    traffic
  * Inspection of malformed Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets
  * Inspection of a stream of malformed Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP) packets
  * Privilege escalation

Vulnerabilities are independent of each other. If a vulnerability
affects a device, it does not necessarily mean that the device is
affected by all of them.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

With the exception of the Cisco FWSM module, no other Cisco products
are known to be vulnerable to the issues described in this advisory.

Details
=======

This Security Advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities.
They are independent of each other.

1. Enhanced inspection of Malformed HTTP traffic
+-----------------------------------------------

Cisco PIX and ASA Security Appliances may crash when inspecting a
malformed HTTP request when enhanced HTTP inspection is enabled. If
enhanced HTTP application inspection is enabled your configuration will
contain a line like "inspect http <appfw>" where <appfw> is the name of
a specific HTTP map. Please note that regular HTTP inspection
(configured via the command "inspect http" without an HTTP map) is not
affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects only 7.x
software releases.

For information on what enhanced inspection of HTTP traffic does, and
how to configure it, refer to the following URL: 
http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/multisec/asa_sw/v_7_2/conf_gd/firewall/inspect.htm#wp1431359

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsd75794. 


2. Inspection of malformed SIP packets
+-------------------------------------

The inspection of a malformed SIP packet may crash Cisco PIX and ASA
appliances. In order to trigger this vulnerability, SIP fixup (for 6.x
software) or inspect (for 7.x software) feature must be enabled. SIP
fixup is enabled by default in the 6.x software releases, and SIP
inspection is disabled by default in the 7.x and later software
releases.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug IDs CSCsd97077
and CSCse27708.

3. Inspection of a stream of malformed TCP packets
+-------------------------------------------------

By processing a stream of malformed packet in a TCP-based protocol
Cisco PIX and ASA Appliances may crash. Processing of the protocol must
be done by inspect feature. The packets can be addressed to the device
itself or just transiting it. Cisco PIX and ASA Appliance can inspect
the following TCP-based protocols:

  * Computer Telephony Interface Quick Buffer Encoding (CITQBE)
  * Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Call (DCE/RPC)
  * Domain Name Service (DNS)
  * Extended Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (ESMTP)
  * File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
  * H.323 protocol
  * Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
  * Internet Locator Server (ILS)
  * Instant Messaging (IM)
  * Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
  * Remote Shell (RSH)
  * Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)
  * Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  * Skinny (or Simple) Client Control Protocol (SCCP)
  * Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
  * Oracle SQL*Net
  * Sun RPC

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsh12711. 


4. Privilege escalation
+----------------------

Using the LOCAL method for user authentication may result in privilege
escalation. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user must be
defined in the local database with a privilege of zero and be able to
successfully authenticate to the affected device. Only if these
conditions are met can the user escalate assigned privileges to level
15 and become an administrator. After that, the user can change every
aspect of the configuration and operation of the device.

A device is vulnerable to this issue if these lines are present in the
device's configuration:

    pixfirewall(config)# aaa authentication enable console LOCAL
    pixfirewall(config)# username <user_name> password <secret_pwd> privilege 0


This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsh33287. 


Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Cisco will
provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then compute
environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are
encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the
environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS
at: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks:

(5.2), 7.1(2.5), 7.2(2.10).

The fixed software can be downloaded from
http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/pix for Cisco PIX Appliance
and from http:// www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/asa for Cisco ASA
Appliance.

Workarounds
===========

For vulnerabilities that involve HTTP and SIP protocols, it is possible
to apply mitigation techniques. Workarounds are available for the other
two vulnerabilities.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco
Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20070214-firewall.shtml

Enhanced inspection of Malformed HTTP traffic
+--------------------------------------------

Disabling HTTP application inspection (appfw) will prevent Cisco PIX
and ASA Appliances from being vulnerable to the issue listed in this
Advisory. By leaving inspect http statement configured, some level of
protection for the end devices (e.g,. computers protected by Cisco PIX
and ASA Appliance) will remain. However, since this level of inspection
is less granular, it may have negative impact on devices terminating
HTTP sessions. Devices which terminate HTTP sessions may be exposed to
packets that may cause these devices to crash or become compromised.

Inspection of malformed SIP packets
+----------------------------------

Disabling SIP inspection will prevent Cisco PIX and ASA Appliances from
being vulnerable to the issue listed in this Advisory. However, this
may have a negative impact on end devices terminating SIP sessions.
Devices which terminate SIP sessions could be exposed to packets that
may cause these devices to crash or become compromised.

If you run a 7.x software release, the alternative is to only allow
traffic from trusted hosts. The configuration needed to accomplish this
is as follows.

    access-list sip-acl extended permit udp 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 host 192.168.5.4 eq sip
    access-list sip-acl extended permit udp host 192.168.5.4 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 eq sip

    class-map sip-traffic
     match access-list sip-acl
    !
    !
    policy-map global_policy
     class inspection_default
      inspect dns maximum-length 512
      inspect ftp
      inspect h323 h225
      inspect h323 ras
      inspect rsh
      inspect rtsp
      inspect esmtp
      inspect sqlnet
      inspect skinny
      inspect sunrpc
      inspect xdmcp
      inspect netbios
      inspect tftp
     class sip-traffic
      inspect sip
    !
    service-policy global_policy global


In this example, the SIP endpoints are any host within the 10.1.1.0
network (inside the trusted network) and a host with the IP address of
192.168.5.4 (outside of the trusted network). You have to substitute
these IP addresses with the ones that are used in your network.

Note that SIP is an UDP-based protocol, so spoofing SIP messages is
possible.

Inspection of a stream of malformed TCP packets
+----------------------------------------------

The workaround is to increase the minimum TCP segment size (MSS) to 64.
This is accomplished with a global "sysopt" command:

    sysopt connection tcpmss minimum 64


Privilege escalation
+-------------------

There are two workarounds for this vulnerability. One consists of the
use of TACACS+ or Radius for authentication, and another is to change
the minimum privilege of the user from zero to one.

Use TACACS+ or Radius for authentication
+---------------------------------------

Do not use the LOCAL method for user authentication, but use TACACS+ or
Radius instead. This example shows how to configure the Cisco PIX
appliance to use TACACS+ or Radius to authenticate Secure Shell (SSH)
access to the device.

    pixfirewall(config)#aaa-server AuthOutbound protocol radius (or tacacs+)
    pixfirewall(config)#aaa authentication ssh console AuthOutbound
    pixfirewall(config)#aaa-server AuthOutbound host 10.0.0.1 <radius_key>


In this example, 10.0.0.1 is the IP address of the Radius server and
"radius_key" is shared key between the Radius server and the appliance.

More information on how to configure TACACS+ or Radius on Cisco PIX and
ASA appliances can be found at 
http://cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/vpndevc/ps2030/products_configuration_example09186a00807349e7.shtml

Changing user's minimum privilege level
+--------------------------------------

The second workaround consists of the change of the user minimum
privilege level from zero to one. In that case, your configuration may
look like this:

    pixfirewall(config)# aaa authentication enable console LOCAL
    pixfirewall(config)# username <user_name> password <secret_pwd> privilege 1


It is possible to use any other level as long as it is not zero or 15.
If it is 15, the user has all privileges, and that is what we want to
avoid in the first place.

Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.
