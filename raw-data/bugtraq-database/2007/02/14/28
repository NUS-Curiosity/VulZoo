Hi Michael. Thank you for making that issue public (about login). Haven't
seen it posted anywhere.

One note: although it could just as well be a bug, who says it was not a
backdoor in the early 90's?

Also, I understand this does not work on older Solaris/SunOS systems
(anyone can verify?) which adds to my personal interest in the
possibility. I refuse to believe someone is that funny/sad.

	Gadi.
