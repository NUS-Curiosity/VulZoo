Subject: Every MS Exploit

Project to find exploits for every MS Security Bulletin gets wiki�ed

Last September (part 1) http://ElseNot.com went public with it�s collocation and goal (try to find an exploit for every MS Security Bulletin ever released). Activity stopped when Microsoft published 473 bulletins and 163 Exploits had been found. 

Now part 2 of www.ElseNot.com is raising the bar and going wiki. Instead of 
just trying to get "a exploit", it is trying to get "every exploit". Now you don't have to rely on one person updating it. Do it your self, create a time line of exploit releases, document techniques and add other OS'es. This is the place to consolidate all the vulnerability information floating around the net, your head and mailing lists.
