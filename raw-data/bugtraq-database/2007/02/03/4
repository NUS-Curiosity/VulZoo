Subject: Security Advisory for Bugzilla 2.20.3, 2.22.1, and 2.23.3

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers two security issues that have recently been
fixed in the Bugzilla code:

+ A possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Atom feeds
  produced by Bugzilla.

+ Web server settings given by Bugzilla which provide security settings
  to protect data files from access via the web are overridden by the
  mod_perl startup script when running under mod_perl (development
  snapshot only).

We strongly advise that 2.20.x users should upgrade to 2.20.4. 2.22
users, and users of 2.16.x or below, should upgrade to 2.22.2. Versions
2.18.x are not affected by either of these vulnerabilities.

Development snapshots of 2.23 before 2.23.4 are also vulnerable to all
of these issues. If you are using a development snapshot, you should
upgrade to 2.23.4, use CVS to update, or apply the patches from the
specific bugs listed below.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
- -------
Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Versions:    2.20.1 and above
Description: Bugzilla does not properly escape some fields in generated
             Atom feeds, which leads to the potential for cross-site
             scripting in feed readers that support javascript and
             properly implement the Atom feed specification.

Issue 2
- -------
Class:       Database password disclosure
Versions:    2.23.3 only
Description: Bugzilla development snapshot version 2.23.3 introduced
             the ability to run Bugzilla under mod_perl on Apache.
             The mod_perl initialization script included with Bugzilla
             defines a new <Directory> block in the Apache configuration
             for the directory containing Bugzilla. This block fails to
             include permission for .htaccess files to override file
             access permissions.  The .htaccess file shipped with
             Bugzilla prohibits access by web browsers to read the
             localconfig file, which contains the username and password
             for connecting to the database server.
             If you are not running Bugzilla under mod_perl, then this
             does not affect you.
