No, but it can be easily defeated by changing the placement/appearance 
of the number(s) as well as that of the noise or by keeping both
constant over reloads.

What is exploited here, is the fact that noise and payload behave
differently on reload. This allows to separate them.

Please note, that averaging is a very simple technique to do that.
Depending on the type of captcha, one can use methods that converge 
much more quickly. Simplest one would be to use the simple majority
of pixel values or the median value, if slight global noise (e.g. from
compression artefacts) is expected. 

This should yield almost perfect results with as low as 3 different 
images. Adding a tiny bit of spatial filtering might help as well.


Kind regards,
