Quebec health officials are battling a fast-spreading virus that struck its
entire computer network system late Tuesday.

The virus ripped through computers at most health-care institutions,
affecting hospitals, CLSCs and nursing homes administrative activities
So far, its caused a province-wide slowdown and some fear that
patients files may have been damaged, too.

But government officials say patients privacy has not been compromised
and confidential information remains confidential.

The extent of the damage is not yet known, Isabelle Merizzi, press attache
to Health Minister Philippe Couillard said Wednesday.
