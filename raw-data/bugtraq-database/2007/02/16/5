Synopsis
========

A flaw in Fail2ban may allow remote attackers to deny access to
arbitrary hosts.

Background
==========

Fail2ban monitors log files for failed authentication attempts and can
block hosts responsible for repeated attacks.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/fail2ban       < 0.6.2                      >= 0.6.2

Description
===========

A flaw in the method used to parse log entries allows remote,
unauthenticated attackers to forge authentication attempts from other
hosts.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can add arbitrary hosts to the block list, denying
legitimate users access to a resource.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Fail2ban users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/fail2ban-0.6.2"
