If Peter is crying WOLF all the time. The one time he sees one, no one 
will notice it. That is how humans work.

If wa start crying 'backdoor' all the time who will notice it anymore if 
there truly is one. But untill reasonable arguments based on code audits 
or other reliable sources are presented we must assume that other human 
quality prevailed: Humans make errors. Even very silly ones at times.
