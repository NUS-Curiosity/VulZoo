Subject: MTCMS multiple upload vulnerabilities

avatar upload vulnerability:
upload any kind of file in:
site.com/MTCMS-V2.2/?a=gallery&b=add_down
and approuved or not it will be here :
/uploads/pictures/
same thing for : add link 
/index.php?a=links&b=add_link

xss permanent on Contact Us :
message & title fields are vulnerable to an xss attack.
this kind of xss are pretty dangerous, because you send the malicious message to an admin.
so you can get his cookie.
