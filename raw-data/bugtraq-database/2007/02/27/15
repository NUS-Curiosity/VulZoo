This looks like the bug described here: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3722
"DB error when sanitized search string results in empty query" (Filed January 31)

According to that page:

The same error results from searching for just a space.  In either case, adding other characters to the field results in the expected query.  It doesn't look like injection would be possible.
