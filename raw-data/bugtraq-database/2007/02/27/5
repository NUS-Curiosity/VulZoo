Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow was found in MPlayer's RTSP plugin that could lead to
a Denial of Service or arbitrary code execution.

Background
==========

MPlayer is a media player capable of playing multiple media formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/mplayer     < 1.0_rc1-r2                >= 1.0_rc1-r2

Description
===========

When checking for matching asm rules in the asmrp.c code, the results
are stored in a fixed-size array without boundary checks which may
allow a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker can entice a user to connect to a manipulated RTSP server
resulting in a Denial of Service and possibly execution of arbitrary
code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_rc1-r2"
