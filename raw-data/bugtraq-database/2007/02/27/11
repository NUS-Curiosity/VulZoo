 Detection Denial of Service Vulnerability

Computer Associates eTrust Intrusion Detection Denial of Service
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.27.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 27, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Computer Associates eTrust Intrusion Detection is a network intrusion
management and prevention system, that includes real-time session
monitoring and Internet web filtering capabilities. More information can
be found on the vendors site at the following URL.

http://www3.ca.com/solutions/Product.aspx?ID=163

II. DESCRIPTION

The eTrust Intrusion Detection process listens on TCP port 9191 for remote
administration functions. Administrator login requires that keys be
exchanged including a session key with blowfish encryption of the login
and the password.

Since the administration server fails to properly validate the key length
value, it is possible to cause the product to crash. During decryption, 4
is subtracted from the specified length and the result used as the length
of the data to decrypt. The decryption loop will proceed to overwrite the
entire heap segment. This leads to an unhandled exception.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to cause the
administration
service to crash.

Since the heap is not used once corrupted, the heap overflow cannot be
exploited for more than a denial of service.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in Computer Associates eTrust
Intrusion Detection version 3.0.5.57. Other versions are suspected
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is not aware of any workarounds for this issue.
