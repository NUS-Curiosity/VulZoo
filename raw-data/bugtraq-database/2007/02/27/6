Synopsis
========

A memory corruption vulnerability in CHMlib could lead to the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

CHMlib is a library for the MS CHM (Compressed HTML) file format plus
extracting and HTTP server utils.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-doc/chmlib       < 0.39                               >= 0.39

Description
===========

When certain CHM files that contain tables and objects stored in pages
are parsed by CHMlib, an unsanitized value is passed to the alloca()
function resulting in a shift of the stack pointer to arbitrary memory
locations.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted CHM file,
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user viewing the file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All CHMlib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-doc/chmlib-0.39"
