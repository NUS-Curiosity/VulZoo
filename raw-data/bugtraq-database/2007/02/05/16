Sure. You can probably have a file:// link in Open Office / MS Office
documents as well; but these all rely on external components, and as such,
attacks could be shrugged off as a weakness in these apps (and there's
some truth to this).

Browser authors know better, and they disallow file:// URLs from the
Internet ever since Javascript became so powerful; this case managed to
slip through, so I thought it's a neat example, in conjunction with
deterministic temporary files.
