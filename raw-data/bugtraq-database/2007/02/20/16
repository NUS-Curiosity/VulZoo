Subject: Metaye Released - ZmbScap

Team

Metaeye has released new project Zmbscap as:

The zombie scapper is an automated perl tool for detecting and stopping 
distributed
denial of service programs. The tool automatically searches and scans 
the desired target
for programs by looking for the ports that are used by the zombie 
masters. It stops the
zombie masters by sending a kill/stop trigger.

You can find the tool at:
