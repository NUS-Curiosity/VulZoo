Hi

I've been discussing this off-list with Hugo (the paper's author).

1. The redirection issue, if it exists, is relevant only to redirection 
through HTTP responses with status code 301. In other words, it seems 
that Apache 2.0 mod_cache+mod_proxy doesn't cache HTTP 302 responses.

2. In my experiments, the whole issue does not exist in the "standard" 
reverse proxy configuration. By default, the proxy server does not 
forward the HTTP Host header. Instead, it uses the host as it appears in 
the ProxyPass directive. The directive that governs whether the Host 
header will be preserved or not is ProxyPreserveHost 
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypreservehost). 
And the example configuration for reverse proxy 
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html#examples) doesn't 
override this default.
Unfortunately, Hugo's configuration file (as well as his proxy server 
machine) is no longer available, so we cannot reproduce the case in 
Hugo's lab. Hugo told me that his configuration was based off that 
example snippet from the Apache mod_proxy documentation (see above), 
which does not include ProxyPreserveHost.

3. I noticed some weird caching results with my own Apache 2.0 
mod_proxy+mod_cache when 301 response is cached - something quite 
different from Hugo's results.

I encourage readers to test the 301 redirection scenario and report to 
the list whether the Host header was forwarded to the web server or not.

Thanks,
-Amit
