Subject: Re: Jboss vulnerability

Interesting issue...

Trying various URLs for fun in one of our lab's jboss, i found the following:

      http://yoursitehere:port/web-console/      (opens the web
console of Jboss)
      http://yoursitehere:port/jmx-console/       (opens the jmx
console of jboss)

Most common values for port are 80 and 8080

Browsing you can view  some interesting information:

        - Hostname, host Address, processor, OS name and version (view
org.jboss.system.server.ServerInfo)
        - Work directories physical paths (view
org.jboss.system.server.ServerConfigImpl)
        - And maybe more usefull information for an attacker

Reading about this in the jboss wiki, i find that this is the default
configuration, that is not secured by default.

Javier Antunez
