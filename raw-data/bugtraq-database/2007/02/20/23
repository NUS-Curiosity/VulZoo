Memorized passwords.

Also, if a password is required for a subsidiary resource, the  
browser will ask the user for it. In IE, at least, a sequence like  
the one I describe below will pop up a series of password dialogs if  
the user attempts to cancel. Most users will eventually try typing in  
the correct password to try to make the password dialogs go away.

Depends on the router. It doesn't really matter much, though -
once the settings are saved the damage's been done.

Try them all at once:

<iframe src="http://192.168.0.1/csrf-for-another-router"></iframe>
<iframe src="http://192.168.0.1/csrf-for-a-third-router"></iframe>
