Hi Marcin,

I would put an access-class on your vty lines to allow ssh only from trusted 
hosts.  Either that or put an access-list on your outside interface.

Oh, and look up the abuse contact for that domain and report them.  It's 
probably someone trying a brute force on your ssh server.

HTH

Cheers,
Neil
