Yes, 'yapig' is one of the many thousands projects on the sf.net. Every
project gets a soft quota of 100Mb web space to put whatever they "want".
("Want" in a sense the project memebers may have shell access and can
upload arbitrary contents, presumably should be legal contents..., but
they users get to control what to put under their project space.)

If you find offensive or illegal content on sf.net (I did not check the
link you provided), I suggest you report it to SourceForge here:
