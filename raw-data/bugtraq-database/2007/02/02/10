Subject: Re: Ipswitch WS_FTP Server 5.04 multiple arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities


Michal,

iFTPAddU is for adding users, and iFTPAddH is for adding virtual
hosts.  These sound like administator-level controls.  Presumably, the
same admin already had the access to install WS_FTP in the first
place.  So, it doesn't seem like these cross any privilege boundaries,
so they don't sound like vulnerabilities.

Am I missing something here?
