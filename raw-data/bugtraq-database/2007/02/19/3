Subject: Powerschool 404 Admin Exposure

Powerschool 4.3.6 and possibly other versions expose the admin interface when requesting any file with .js

This allows one to see some directory and file names inside the admin folder.

POC:

http://[powerschoolip]/admin/.js

Product's website does not provide email contact?
