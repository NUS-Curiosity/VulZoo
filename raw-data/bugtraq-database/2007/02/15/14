See Casper Dik's email about when it was introduced...
He's not lieing...which is to say your email should not
have made it out to the list....

I just tried it locally with 5.7 and the result was:
$ telnet -l -froot localhost
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

Have you considered using SSH?

login:
telnet> Connection closed.

There are two methods to pass information through to telnet from
a remote connection as part of the telnet protocol:
- username
- terminal type

If either of these are passed through to the command line of /bin/login
then precautions need to be taken.
