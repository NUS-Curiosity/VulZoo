This needs to be further discussed, as your response here has been
awe-striking.

The remote possibility was raised, and for several reasons:
1. It just didn't seem to be possible such a vulnerability would exist,
yet it does.
2. It was a remote one (not raised by me, btw) which I wanted answers for
rather than let it die under the usual flames.
3. It was raised, we needed to discuss it.

Sun has been completely visible and did full-disclosure on the
vulnerability, how it got there, etc. I have to tip my hat to you and
thank you for your help with this.

I believe the entire industry should thank you, and follow your lead.

This is the first case where I have seen a vendor respond in such
fashion. It is to be commended yet again. You have proven what being open
with the community can achieve.

This is a serious F up on the side of Sun. Everyone makes mistakes
and incidents will happen no matter what. What matters here is how you
responded to the incident when it did happen.
