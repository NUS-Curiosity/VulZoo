Subject: RE: defacements for the installation of malcode

There was also a really entertaining presentation from Patrick Petersen of
IronPort at RSA, in which he mentioned use of defaced web sites as proxy
forwarders for spammers.  According to the presentation, the spammers have a
fairly sophisticated toolkit that takes over the site and turns it into a
pharmacy (or whatever) redirect site.  A different goal from the Websense
presentation, but still a purpose other than simple defacement.
