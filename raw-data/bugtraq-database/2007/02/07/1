Subject: Medium level security hole in FreeProxy

The FreeProxy HTTP proxy server suffers from a denial of service condition 
which causes the server to hang.  This occurs when an attacker makes a 
request for the hostname/portnumber combination in use by the server itself.  
The vendor was notified on the 10th January 2007 and a fix was made available 
on the 24th.  Full details can be found in the attached advisory.
