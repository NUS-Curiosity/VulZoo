Exactly, this is the point.

My point of the initial article was NOT to demonstrate a new or especially 
clever way to defeat a captcha. This would not really be something for 
bugtraq as most of the captchas can be defeated by sophisticated 
cutting-edge computer recognision software (see http://www.captcha.net/). 

The main idea is to show how a design flaw (repeatedly presenting the 
same information with different obfuscation) can be used to compromise 
a captcha without the need for an especially clever algorithm. 
So, it's not about how to defeat the captcha by recognizing the text but 
how to defeat it by exploiting a design flaw. 

And the good thing is: This design flaw can easily be avoided. 
However, one has to be aware of it.
