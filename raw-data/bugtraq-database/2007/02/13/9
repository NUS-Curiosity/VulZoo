Vendor:			Aruba Networks, http://www.arubanetworks.com
Affected Products:	Aruba Mobility Controllers 200, 600, 2400, 6000
				Alcatel Alcatel-Lucent OmniAccess Wireless
43xx, 6000
Vulnerability:		Aruba Mobility Controller Management Buffer Overflow

Risk:				HIGH
CERT VU ID:			VU#613833


Vendor communication:

2007/01/11			Initial notification to Aruba WSIRT
2007/01/11			Aruba WSIRT assigns contact
2007/01/11			n.runs provides crashdump to Aruba
2007/01/15			Aruba provides feedback on the vulnerability
2007/01/18			Patches available
2007/01/27			n.runs verifies patched firmware


Systems Affected:

All Aruba Networks Mobility Controllers (200, 800, 2400, and 6000) running
software versions greater than 2.0
Alcatel-Lucent OmniAccess Wireless 43xx and 6000 running software versions
2.0 and later.


Overview:

The Aruba Mobility Controllers management interfaces are susceptible to a
heap based buffer overflow vulnerability,  


Description:

Both the command line based and the web based management interface of the
Aruba Mobility Controller are vulnerable to a heap based buffer overflow
when overly long strings are passed as credentials. This can potentially
lead to remote code execution, resulting in a system compromise. 


Impact:

The overflow will in any case result in memory corruption that crashes the
management interfaces process, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS)
condition of the remote management capabilities. A carefully crafted
overflow may result in code execution, allowing an attacker to fully control
the device.

Solution:

Aruba Networks has made patched firmware available to their customers, who
should be able to retrieve it through Aruba's support site
https://support.arubanetworks.com. As a workaround, restrict access to the
administrative interfaces or disable them, reverting to console-only
administration.
