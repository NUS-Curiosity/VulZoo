I see this was not on bugtraq, adding here as well:

[...] bz says in the bug that this has already been fixed on the trunk 
[before these new reports]. You can't type *at all* in file input fields 
there, only use the File Open dialog, as I understood him.

I hope this fixes it once and for all. (Yes, this is a teaser. ;-) )
