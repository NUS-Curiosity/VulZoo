It's a bug.  I recall it being found and fixed in AIX many years ago.
Embarassing for Sun that it's still in Solaris, though.

It's actually caused by a "feature" of login; the bug is in programs
that exec login and pass "-froot" to it, and in preserving this feature
of login at all.

A quick Google search found Usenet postings about it from 1994; I'm sure
it was known well before then.
