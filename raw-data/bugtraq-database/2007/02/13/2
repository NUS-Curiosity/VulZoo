This probably explains why the core of the problem wasn't fixed for
Firefox: reports were repeatedly reduced to an issue with hiding file
input fields by manipulating opacity or visibility (in my example, I
placed the box off-screen to the left, at negative absolute coords,
instead). A proper solution would be to restrict the ability for scripts
to manipulate focus and read contents of file input fields, instead.
