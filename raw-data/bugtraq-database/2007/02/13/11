Subject: RE: Solaris telnet vulnberability - how many on your network?


Am I missing something?  This vulnerability is close to 10 years old.
It was in one of the first versions of Solaris after Sun moved off of
the SunOS BSD platform and over to SysV.  It has specifically to do with
how arguments are processed via getopt() if I recall correctly.

Subject: Solaris telnet vulnberability - how many on your network?

Johannes Ullrich from the SANS ISC sent this to me and then I saw it on
the DSHIELD list:

----
    If you run Solaris, please check if you got telnet enabled NOW. If
you
    can, block port 23 at your perimeter. There is a fairly trivial
    Solaris telnet 0-day.

    telnet -l "-froot" [hostname]

    will give you root on many Solaris systems with default installs
    We are still testing. Please use our contact form at
    https://isc.sans.org/contact.html
    if you have any details about the use of this exploit.
----

You mean they still use telnet?!

Update from HD Moore:
"but this bug isnt -froot, its -fanythingbutroot =P"

On the exploits@ mailing list and on DSHIELD this vulnerability was
verified as real.

If Sun doesn't yet block port 23/tcp incoming on their /8, I'd make it a
strong suggestion.

Anyone else running Solaris?
