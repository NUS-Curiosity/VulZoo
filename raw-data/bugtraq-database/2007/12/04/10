Subject: The first release of SWFIntruder is out !

I am proud to announce first release of SWFIntruder.
SWFIntruder (pronounced Swiff Intruder) is the first tool specifically 
developed for analyzing and testing security of Flash applications at
runtime.
It helps to find flaws in Flash applications using the methodology
originally described in Testing Flash Applications [1]
and in Finding Vulnerabilities in Flash Applications [2] .

Some neat feature:
    * Basic predefined attack patterns.
    * Highly customizable attacks.
    * Highly customizable undefined variables.
    * Semi automated Xss check.
    * User configurable internal parameters.
    * Log Window for debugging and tracking.
    * History of latest 5 tested SWF files.
    * ActionScript Objects runtime explorer in tree view.
    * Persistent Configuration and Layout. 

SWFIntruder is hosted @ OWASP:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:SWFIntruder

and is sponsored by Minded Security (http://www.mindedsecurity.com)

Check it out and let me know!
Any comments will be appreciated.
