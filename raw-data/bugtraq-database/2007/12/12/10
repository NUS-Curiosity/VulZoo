Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 12.11.07: Microsoft DirectX 7 and 8 DirectShow
 Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.11.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Dec 11, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft DirectShow, part of Microsoft DirectX, is used for the capture
and playback of multimedia streams on Microsoft Windows systems.
Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange (SAMI) is a file format
designed by Microsoft Corp. to deliver captions, subtitles, or audio
descriptions synchronized with digital media content.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in
Microsoft Corp.'s DirectShow could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

This vulnerability exists in the DirextShow SAMI parser, which is
implemented in quartz.dll. When the SAMI parser copies parameters into
a stack buffer, it does not properly check the length of the parameter.
As such, parsing a specially crafted SAMI file can cause a stack-based
buffer overflow. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context
of the current user.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must persuade a user
to open a malicious SAMI file. This can be accomplished by hosting a
malicious SAMI file on a web site or by sending the malicious file to a
user via e-mail or instant message.

It is important to note that a SAMI file does not necessarily have to
end with a .smi or .sami extension. DirectShow will identify the file
based on the file contents.

If "Web View Content" is enabled in Windows Explorer, which is the
default setting, a single click will open the malicious file in the
preview pane and trigger the vulnerability.

DirectX 9.0c is listed as an optional update for Windows 2000 operating
system in Windows Update site. It is not listed as a critical update.
However, installing this update will remove this vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed Microsoft DirectX 7.x and Microsoft DirectX 8.x
are vulnerable. Microsoft DirectX 9.0c or newer is not vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

To prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, upgrade to DirectX 9.0c
or newer.

If upgrading is not possible, you can prevent access to the vulnerable
code by un-registering quartz.dll as shown below. However, this
workaround will disable image, audio, and video rendering in
DirectX-enabled applications.

  C:\> regsvr32 -u %windir%\system32\quartz.dll
