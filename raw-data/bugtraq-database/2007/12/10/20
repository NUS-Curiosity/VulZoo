4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Samba, which can be 
exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the
"send_mailslot()" function. This can be exploited to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow with zero bytes via a specially crafted
"SAMLOGON" domain logon packet containing a username string placed at
an odd offset followed by an overly long GETDC string.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but
requires that the "domain logons" option is enabled.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

A fix should be released later today.
