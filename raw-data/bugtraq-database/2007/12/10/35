Subject: WASC Announcement: The Script Mapping Project Results and Call for Participation


The Web Application Security Consortium is pleased to announce the first results 
of the Script Mapping project! At this stage in the project we were able to cover
most of the test cases for Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2 and Safari 3.

The results can be found on the project page:
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/scriptmapping/

Project Description:

The purpose of the Script Mapping Project is to come up with an exhaustive list 
of vectors to execute script within a web page without the explicit use of <script> 
tags. This data can be useful when testing poorly implemented Cross-site Scripting 
blacklist filters, for those wishing to build an html white list system, as well as 
other uses.

WASC is actively seeking volunteers from various sections of the community including 
penetration testers, security researchers, and developers to contribute to this project.

If you would like to be involved with the project or if you have comments about the
results, test cases etc., please contact Romain Gaucher ( r@...ucher.info)

Regards,

- Announcements
