Subject: Re: TotalPlayer 3.0 .m3u crash


Total Player in reality is the recompiling of the CoolPlayer source code
available on the official website http://coolplayer.sf.net with the
"CoolPlayer" string substituited by "Total Player" (but with the same
skin, that's why it shows the CoolPlayer name).

Other than being in full GPL violation its installer contains a spyware
too (totalplayer.exe "seems" safe).

And yes, also CoolPlayer 217 is vulnerable to this stack buffer-overflow
vulnerability.

The problem is visible in the CPL_AddPrefixedFile function in
CPI_Playlist.c, memcpy + strcpy on cFullPath which is 260 bytes long.
