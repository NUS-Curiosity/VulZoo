Wasn't there an article or a post somewhere about an ISP that
maintained a canary web page with the statement "we haven't been
served with an NSL" and (I think) a date that was meant to be taken
down or perhaps merely not updated in such an event?

Cute idea, though I suppose they would also be subject to sanctions
for not maintaining it.
