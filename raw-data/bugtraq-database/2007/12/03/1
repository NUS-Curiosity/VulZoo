PR06-08: BEA Plumtree portal internal hostname disclosure vulnerability

Description:

BEA Plumtree portal is vulnerable to a internal hostname disclosure vulnerability.

The internal hostname of the server hosting BEA Plumtree portal is always included at the bottom of every requested HTML page within HTML comments.

Date Found: 12th September 2006

Vendor contacted: 18th May 2007

Vulnerable: BEA Plumtree 5.0.2, 5.0.3, 5.0.4, 6.0.1.218452 and possibly other versions.

Severity: Low

Authors: Adrian Pastor and Jan Fry from ProCheckUp Ltd (www.procheckup.com)

ProCheckUp thanks BEA for working with us.

Vendor Status: Confirmed

CVE Candidate: Not assigned

Proof of concept:

The following is an example of the internal hostname of Plumtree server disclosed within HTML comments:

<!--Hostname: websvr01-->

Consequences:

This information could be useful to a malicious user attempting to gain illegal access to resources on internal systems.

By following internal hostname naming conventions, an attacker could predict other internal hostnames  as well. For instance, if Plumtree portal is running on a server with an internal hostname of websvr01, an attacker could predict other internal  hostnames such as websvr01, websvr02, websvr03 and  so on.

Fix:

This has been addressed in AquaLogic Interaction 6.1. MP1. This can also be addressed by making config changes in ALUI 6.x versions.
