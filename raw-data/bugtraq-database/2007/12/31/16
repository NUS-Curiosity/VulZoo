not exactly true, i think.   the gag order on recipients of a NSL has  
never required lying, just
saying nothing (which is bad enough, given the historical lack of  
recipient access to judicial
review).

i would personally be more suspicious of the providers who had no  
comment
than the ones who made unequivocal denials.

the gag feature is in court at the moment (with a ruling against the  
govt's position
from as recently as september)  according to
