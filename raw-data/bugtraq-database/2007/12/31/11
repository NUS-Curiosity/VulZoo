Subject: RE: Cryptome: NSA has real-time access to Hushmail servers

Hushmail Team has posted its response on 29th Dec to Cryptome:

"Hush Communications Corporation, the company that provides the Hushmail.com email service, is not owned, wholly or in part, by any government agency."

Response from Safe-mail.net Team is the following:

"1. We never had any contacts, direct or indirect, with the NSA or any other
government agency anywhere in the world.
2. All software we use is in-house development.
3. We have never shared our technology with any other party."
