Heres the proof. 

U.S. Calea law "Sec. 103. ASSISTANCE CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS" By U.S. law any telecommunications carrier (thats you HushMail) that does business in the U.S. shall ensure intercept of all wire and electronic communications. So we have two choices, HushMail is telling the truth and knowingly breaking U.S. law. Or Hushmail is lying to the public and is a legal business in the U.S. The simplest answer is the Hushmail is a legal business in the U.S.
