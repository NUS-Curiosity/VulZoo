Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in the AMD64 x86 emulation
GTK+ libraries may result in the execution of arbitrary code in
applications using Cairo.

Background
==========

Cairo is a 2D vector graphics library with cross-device output support.
The AMD64 x86 emulation GTK+ library packages Cairo libraries for 32bit
x86 emulation on AMD64.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  emul-linux-x86-gtklibs     < 20071214                 >= 20071214
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Package 1 only applies to AMD64 users.

Description
===========

The Cairo versions used by the AMD64 x86 emulation GTK+ libraries were
vulnerable to integer overflow vulnerabilities (GLSA 200712-04).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to view or process a specially
crafted PNG image file in an application linked against Cairo, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All AMD64 x86 emulation GTK+ library users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge -a -1 -v ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-gtklibs-20071214"
