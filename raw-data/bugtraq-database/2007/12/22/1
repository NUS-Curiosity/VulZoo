 remote execution

Sorry for the brief post but Im still able to bypass filters that aol has put in place.  So again with frustration I come to FD to imply pressure on a company to patch correct.  From reading feedback from AOL they feel the vulnerability is put to bed and requires no more attention.

I am not posting 0day PoC only currently patched examples.  

Do not use any AIM 6 or higher client.
