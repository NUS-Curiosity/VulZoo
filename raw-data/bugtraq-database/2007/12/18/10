-- Vulnerability Details:
These vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Trend Micro ServerProtect. Authentication
is not required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

The specific flaw exists in the SpntSvc.exe daemon, bound by default on
TCP port 5168 and exposing the following DCE/RPC interface through
TmRpcSrv.dll:

    /* opcode: 0x00, address: 0x65741030 */
    error_status_t sub_65741030 (
        [in] handle_t arg_1,
        [in] long arg_2,
        [in][size_is(arg_4)] byte arg_3[],
        [in] long arg_4,
        [out][size_is(arg_6)] byte arg_5[],
        [in] long arg_6
    );

Various sub-functions from StRpcSrv.dll are exposed in this interface
and allow for full file system access that can be trivially leveraged
to executed arbitrary code.
