Subject: SyScan'08 Call For Paper/Training

*About SyScan'08*
The Symposium on Security for Asia Network aims to be a very different 
security conference from the rest of the security conferences that the 
information security community in Asia has come to be so familiar and 
frustrated with.
SyScan is a non-product, non-vendor biased security conference. It is 
the aspiration of SyScan to congregate in Asia the best security experts 
in their various fields, to share their research, discovery and 
experience with all security enthusiasts in Asia.

Speakers who have presented in previous SyScan conferences are among the 
best and brightest in the respective field.
Many of theses previous presentations were outstanding and awesome, with 
the industry still in active discussion today.
This will continue to be case as the highly regarded members of the Call 
for Paper (CFP) committee will ensure only the top speakers with the 
best content will speak at SyScan. Your participation in SyScan will 
help you to maintain your technological leadership and stay abreast of 
the latest developments in this rapidly moving technological field.

This two-day symposium would be held in a relaxed and informal 
atmosphere, allowing all participants to enjoy themselves whilst 
expanding their knowledge on information security. This is a 
single-track conference.
