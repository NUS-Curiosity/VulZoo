Subject: Tiger Team: New TV series about pen testers airing on CourtTV Dec 25 11 pm

CourtTV (TruTV) has a new series starting Dec 25 called "Tiger 
Team". They will air the first two episodes back-to-back at 11 pm 
and 11:30 pm ET.

It follows a group of penetration testers hired to test the 
security of organizations through social engineering, 
wired/wireless penetration testing, and physically defeating 
security mechanisms (lock picking, dumpster diving, going through 
air vents/windows). They attempt all of this while avoiding 
organizations' defenses (and local law enforcement). Think "To 
Catch a Thief", but better.

They don't have an official website yet, but hopefully that will 
change soon. For now, there is a digg thread started here (feel 
free to digg it to increase this show's exposure):

They also did a one-hour radio interview and Q&A call-in. They 
start talking about the pilot episode around the 16:50 mark. It is 
available here (commercial-free):
