DESCRIPTION:

   Oriol Carreras has discovered a security vulnerability in syslog-ng, the
   multi-platform syslog-replacement application developed by BalaBit IT
   Security.

BACKGROUND:

   Earlier versions of syslog-ng Open Source Edition and syslog-ng Premium
   Edition were vulnerable to a possible Denial of Service. The latest
   release (2.0.6 for syslog-ng, 2.1.8 for syslog-ng Premium Edition) fixes a
   segmentation fault which occurred when the timestamp of the incoming
   messages did not end with a space character (NULL pointer dereference).
   This is an easy Denial of Service possibility.

   Apart from the Denial of Service, no further exploits are known to be
   possible.
