6. Gadu-Gadu "emots.txt" Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability








Vulnerability Details
=========================
=========================


1. IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager Express Multiple Cross-Site
Scripting Vulnerabilities
===========================================================

IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager Express (http://127.0.0.1/tpmx) is
vulnerable to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, e.g.
assess modification, user-id etc. are not properly sanitized. This
might lead to remote java script code execution (cookie theft,
redirection, HTML injection etc.) Error processing is also vulnerable
to cross-site scripting.



2. IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager Express Remote Username
Enumeration Weakness
=======================================================

IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager Express is vulnerable to
remote username enumeration vulnerability. When trying to
create a new user with 'username' value that already exists,
one receives certain information about the problem. The problem
is even more serious as the login page is not crawler-protected,
thus automated brute-force attacks on certain acccounts might
be possible. This might lead to further attacks based on
the information obtained.


3. Computer Associates eTrust Threat Management Console
IP Address HTML Injection Weakness
====================================================

IP Address (and various other) are prone to HTML injection
weakness. No exploit is required. Further investigation has
not been performed, other weaknesses might also be possible.




4. Gadu-Gadu Skin Attribute Handling Remote Denial of Service
Vulnerability
=========================================================

Improper "skin" attribute handling by the (by default) registered
protocol handler (gadu-gadu protocol "gg") leads to resource
consumption based denial of service conditions. Gadu Gadu cannot
be running on the remote machine, only installed. The vulnerability
might be exploited via a web browser. The attacker should entice
the unaware victim to open a specially crafted link.



More verbose information has been provided directly to Gadu-Gadu.



5. Gadu-Gadu Remote Unspecified User Addition Vulnerability
========================================================

Popular communicator allows remote user addition as the result
of improper protocol handling (protocol handler "gg" is registered
by default). The vulnerability might be exploited via a web browser.
The attacker should lead to unaware victim opening the specially
crafted link. It might be also possible to send gadu-gadu request
from unauthorized users, but this has not been proven nor confirmed
yet.

This vulnerability might also allow to perform denial of service
attacks under certain conditions.


More verbose information has been provided directly to respective
software vendor.
