Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Security Agent for Windows System Driver
Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20071205-csa

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20071205-csa.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 December 05 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a system driver used by the
Cisco Security Agent for Microsoft Windows. This buffer overflow can be
exploited remotely and causes corruption of kernel memory, which leads
to a Windows stop error (blue screen) or to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is triggered during processing of a crafted TCP
segment destined to TCP port 139 or 445. These ports are used by the
Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2007-5580 has
been assigned to this vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20071205-csa.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

All versions of Cisco Security Agent for Windows, either managed
or standalone, are affected. Agents that are running on Cisco IP
Communications application servers or agents on systems that are running
the Cisco Security Manager are examples of a standalone implementation.

Standalone agents are installed in the following Cisco IP Communications
products:

  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CallManager)
  * Cisco Conference Connection (CCC)
  * Emergency Responder
  * IPCC Express
  * IPCC Enterprise
  * IPCC Hosted
  * IP Interactive Voice Response (IP IVR)
  * IP Queue Manager
  * Intelligent Contact Management (ICM)
  * Cisco Voice Portal (CVP)
  * Cisco Unified Meeting Place
  * Cisco Personal Assistant (PA)
  * Cisco Unity
  * Cisco Unity Connection
  * Cisco Unity Bridge
  * Cisco Internet Service Node (ISN)

Cisco Security Manager installs a standalone version of Cisco Security
Agent if an agent is not found when Cisco Security Manager is installed,
so systems that are running Cisco Security Manager are also affected by
this vulnerability.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) Solution Engine, also
known as the ACS appliance, integrates a standalone version of Cisco
Security Agent. However, the ACS Solution Engine is not affected by
this vulnerability because by default it blocks incoming traffic to
the affected TCP ports (139 and 445). Additional information is in the
Details section.

Cisco Security Agents that are running on the Solaris and Linux
operating systems are not affected by the vulnerability described in
this advisory.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco Security Agent is a security software agent that provides threat
protection for server and desktop computing systems. Cisco Security
Agents can be managed by a Management Center for Cisco Security Agents
or can be standalone agents that are not managed by a Cisco Security
Agent Management Center.

Some Cisco products integrate standalone Cisco Security Agents to
protect the products against viruses, worms, and attacks. Examples of
products that integrate standalone Cisco Security Agents include Cisco
IP Communications application servers, the Cisco Secure Access Control
Server (ACS) Solution Engine, and the Cisco Security Manager.

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a system driver used by Cisco
Security Agents, whether they are managed or unmanaged. Cisco Security
Agents use this driver by default.

Windows kernel memory becomes corrupted when this buffer is overflowed.
Therefore, exploitation of this vulnerability will lead to a Windows
stop error (kernel panic, or blue screen error), or to arbitrary code
execution. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the network.

The vulnerability is triggered when Cisco Security Agent is processing
a crafted TCP segment destined to TCP port 139 or 445. These ports are
used by the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. A TCP session
needs to be established (that is, the TCP three-way handshake needs to
be completed) for the vulnerability to be triggered.

All systems that are running a vulnerable version of Cisco Security
Agent for Windows are affected. This includes Cisco products that
integrate standalone Cisco Security Agents, such as Cisco IP
Communications applications servers and the Cisco Security Manager.
Although the ACS Solution Engine integrates a standalone Cisco Security
Agent, it is not affected because TCP ports 139 and 445 have been
firewalled by the ACS Solution Engine itself. This blocking of traffic
destined to TCP ports 139 and 445 is enabled by default and is not
user-configurable.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsl00618.

The CVE identifier CVE-2007-5580 has been assigned to this
vulnerability.

Workarounds
===========

General Considerations
+---------------------

Filters that deny SMB protocol packets using TCP ports 139 and 445
should be deployed as part of a transit access control list (tACL)
policy for protection from traffic that enters the network at ingress
access points. This policy should be configured to protect the network
device where the filter is applied and other devices behind it. Filters
for SMB protocol packets using TCP ports 139 and 445 should also be
deployed in front of vulnerable hosts so that traffic is allowed only
from trusted clients.

Additional information about tACLs is available in "Transit Access
Control Lists : Filtering at Your Edge":

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco devices
within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation
Bulletin companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20071205-csa.shtml

Cisco Security Agent Rule to Block TCP Port 139 and 445 Traffic
+--------------------------------------------------------------

Workstations that do not have a need to provide SMB services, such as
services for sharing directories or files and printers, can be protected
by configuring a Cisco Security Agent rule that blocks all traffic to
TCP ports 139 and 445 (the SMB ports).

Such a rule exists in versions of Cisco Security Agent that include
the Network Personal Firewall policy. The specific rule can be found
by searching rules for one that has the description "All applications,
server for SMB services (offering network shares)" or by opening the
Personal Firewall Module rule module (attached to the Network Personal
Firewall policy) and editing the rule that has this description. This
rule is enabled by default but the default action must be changed from
Allow to a High Priority Deny.

If the Network Personal Firewall policy is not available, administrators
can create a network access rule that blocks traffic to TCP ports 139
and 445. To do this, the rule must be configured as a Deny rule so
traffic is denied when the system on which Cisco Security Agent is
installed attempts to act as a server for network services on ports TCP
139 and 445. For additional information on configuring Cisco Security
Agent network access control rules, reference the following document:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/csa/csa52/user_guide/Chap6.html#wp1199624.

Caution: Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 on a Windows system will cause
the Windows system to stop providing SMB services. Before implementing
the workarounds presented in this section, administrators are advised to
ensure that they understand the implications of disabling SMB services
on users' workstations.
