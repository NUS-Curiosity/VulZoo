===========
Description
===========
The initial CiscoWorks login page is susceptible to XSS attack.

Impact: attackers could execute XSS attacks that can harvest session
cookies and usernames/passwords.

=================
Technical Details
=================
The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests
without performing any validity checks to

verify the request. Input is not properly sanitized before being returned
to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script
code in a user's browser session.

This issue has now been resolved.
