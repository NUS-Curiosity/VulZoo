Apparently, the word causes a fault when we create a malformed file in the following way. 

It creates a new file word and he inserts a "wordart" which completely stuffed with letters "A", then we open a hex editor ubicamos where are the letters "A" for the "wordart" and overwrites until much further down exactly from the direction 000014E0 to 00002A80. 

I leave a proof of concept
