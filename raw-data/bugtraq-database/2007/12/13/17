Subject: Re: AW: MS Office 2007: Digital Signature does not protect
	Meta-Data




Does this same issue appear in OpenOffice ODF format?  Though it does not l=
ook like a huge issue, of itself, it is similar to the way Microsoft ignore=
s metadata in all files, which is a way to add executable code to applicati=
ons with the names of known MS utilities, like notepad.exe.  If the metadat=
a file can be modified in the MS word properties dialog, it is also possibl=
e to modify the file in a text editor, and probably get a MS document to ru=
n arbitrary code when you open it.  This is the impact that the original po=
st does not make clear.
