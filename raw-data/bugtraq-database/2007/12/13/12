Subject: SECURITY: 1.4.12 Package Compromise

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

All,

It has been brought to our attention that the MD5 sums for the 1.4.12
package were not matching the actual package.  We've been
investigating this issue, and uncovered that the package was modified
post release.  This was believed to have been caused by a compromised
account from one of our release maintainers.

Further investigations show that the modifications to the code should
have little to no impact at this time.  Modifications seemed to be
based around a PHP global variable which we cannot track down.  The
changes made will most likely generate an error, rather than a
compromise of a system in the event the code does get executed.

Original packages, stored on secure media, have been restored to the
Sourceforge download servers, and additional signatures for the
packages are now available on the SquirrelMail download page at
http://www.squirrelmail.org/download.php

While we believe the changes made should have little impact, we
strongly recommend everybody that has downloaded the 1.4.12 package
after the 8th December, to redownload the package.

The code modifications did not made it into our source control, just
the final package.  We are currently investigating older packages to
see if they were also compromised.

Once again, the original package MD5s are:
ea5e750797628c9f0f247009f8ae0e14  squirrelmail-1.4.12.tar.bz2
d17c1d9f1ee3dde2c1c21a22fc4f9d0e  squirrelmail-1.4.12.tar.gz
3f6514939ea1ebf69f6f8c92781886ab  squirrelmail-1.4.12.zip

We apologies for the inconvenience this may have caused.

For any further issues, please contact myself, or the security list
security@...irrelmail.org
