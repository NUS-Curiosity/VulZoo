Subject: TCP Port randomization paper

Folks,

We have published a revision of our port randomization paper. This is 
the first revision of the document since it was accepted as a working 
group item of the tsvwg working group of the IETF (Internet 
Engineering Task Force). Any feedback on the proposed/described 
algorithms will be welcome.

The document is available at: 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tsvwg-port-randomization-00.txt

Additionally, it is available in other fancy formats (PDF and HTML) 
at: http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/port-randomization/index.html

Thanks,

--
