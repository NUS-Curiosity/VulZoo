Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in the web server in the Multi-Threaded DAAP
Daemon may lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Multi-Threaded DAAP Daemon (mt-daapd), also known as the Firefly Media
Server, is a software to serve digital music to the Roku Soundbridge
and Apple's iTunes.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/mt-daapd      < 0.2.4.1                    >= 0.2.4.1

Description
===========

nnp discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the XML-RPC handler in the
file webserver.c. The ws_addarg() function contains a format string
vulnerability, as it does not properly sanitize username and password
data from the "Authorization: Basic" HTTP header line (CVE-2007-5825).
The ws_decodepassword() and ws_getheaders() functions do not correctly
handle empty Authorization header lines, or header lines without a ':'
character, leading to NULL pointer dereferences (CVE-2007-5824).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted HTTP requests to the web
server in the Multi-Threaded DAAP Daemon, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
web server or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Multi-Threaded DAAP Daemon users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/mt-daapd-0.2.4.1"
