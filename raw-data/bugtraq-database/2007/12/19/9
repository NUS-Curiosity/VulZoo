Here I confirm the validity of the vulnerability:

Machine: Windows 2000 SP4, Apache 2.2.4, MySQL 5.0.45
Wordpress version tested: 2.2.0, 2.2.3, 2.3.1
Everytime the URL http://localhost/wordpress/index.php/wp-admin/ is
used, and user is NOT logged in. In each wordpress version draft
posts are indeed shown.

And according to wordpress bug report, a patch is applied on
19th to address the problem.
