Subject: Re: Wordpress - Broken Access Control

Nobody was attacking you. Calm down and try to be a bit more professional, please.

Although I am still unable to reproduce the problem on any sort of setup, a few other people have claimed to make it work as well. So a patch has been created and applied to eliminate the dependancy on "wp-admin/". The patch will most likely be in the next version of WordPress.

The bug tracking and patch for this issue can be found here:
