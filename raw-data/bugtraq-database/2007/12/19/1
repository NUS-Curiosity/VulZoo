Subject: Re: MS Office 2007: Digital Signature does not protect Meta-Data

Dear Mr. Naujoks,

yes, I can see your point, too.
I totally agree that users need to be educated, but I still think
that MS Office shall take a share to educate and inform users of
their digital signature's scope.

This might be true, but in my opinion, still builds on either the
assumption
- that MetaData (like category) is not part of the
author's document (thus not covered by his digital
signature), or
- that users are educated/aquinted with having
information "with" a document that did not originate from the
author.

Agreed, the area is labelled like that, but if this would
be freely editable data, why is Office 2007 not allowing
editing this data through the GUI?

All GUI edits to the MetaData are prohibited,
once a document is signed.

I also agree, that the severity of this is open to discussion, and
invite anybody interested in this discussion to contact me directly.
