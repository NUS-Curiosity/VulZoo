Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The FWSM is vulnerable if running System Software version 3.2(3).


To determine if the FWSM is vulnerable, issue the "show module" 
command-line interface (CLI) command from Cisco IOS or Cisco CatOS
to identify what modules and sub-modules are installed in the 
system.

The following example shows a system with a Firewall Service Module 
(WS-SVC-FWM-1) installed in slot 4.

switch#show module
 Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.
 --- ----- -------------------------------------- ----------------- -----------
 1   48    SFM-capable 48 port 10/100/1000mb RJ45 WS-X6548-GE-TX    SAxxxxxxxxx
 4    6    Firewall Module                        WS-SVC-FWM-1      SAxxxxxxxxx
 5    2    Supervisor Engine 720 (Active)         WS-SUP720-BASE    SAxxxxxxxxx
 6    2    Supervisor Engine 720 (Hot)            WS-SUP720-BASE    SAxxxxxxxxx

After locating the correct slot, issue the show module <slot number> 
command to identify the software version that is running.

switch#show module 4
 Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.
 --- ----- -------------------------------------- ----------------- -----------
 4    6    Firewall Module                        WS-SVC-FWM-1      SAxxxxxxxxx

 Mod MAC addresses                     Hw     Fw           Sw           Status
 --- --------------------------------- ------ ------------ ------------ -------
 4   0003.e4xx.xxxx to 0003.e4xx.xxxx  3.0    7.2(1)       3.2(3)       Ok

The preceding example shows that the FWSM is running version 3.2(3)
as indicated by the column under "Sw" above.

Note: Recent versions of Cisco IOS will show the software version of
each module in the output from the show module command; therefore, 
executing the show module <slot number> command is not necessary.

Alternatively, the information can also be obtained directly from the
FWSM through the show version command as seen in the following
example.

  FWSM#show version
  FWSM Firewall Version 3.2(3)

Customers who use the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) 
to manage their devices can find the version of the software displayed
in the table in the login window or in the upper left corner of the
ASDM window. The version notation is similar to the following example.

  FWSM Version: 3.2(3)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

  * FWSM System Software versions 3.2(2) and earlier.
  * FWSM System Software versions 3.1(x).
  * FWSM System Software versions 1.x(y) and 2.x(y).
  * The Cisco PIX 500 Series Security Appliance (PIX)
  * The Cisco 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA).

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

A vulnerability exists in the processing of data in the 
control-plane path with Layer 7 Application Inspections, that may
result in a reload of the FWSM. The vulnerability can be triggered
with standard network traffic, which is passed through the
Application Layer Protocol Inspection process.

The only FWSM release affected by this vulnerability is FWSM System
Software version 3.2(3). 

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsl08519.

service attack.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

FWSM software version 3.2(4) contains the fixes for the vulnerability
described in this document and will be available for download the week
beginning 31st December 2007.

FWSM software will be available for download from the following
location on cisco.com: 

http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/cat6000-fwsm?psrtdcat20e2

Workarounds
===========

* Disable the TCP normalizing function
  
  Disabling the TCP normalizing function in the FWSM will mitigate
  this vulnerability.

  The TCP normalizer performs the following action: for traffic that
  passes through the control-plane path, such as packets that require
  Layer 7 inspection or management traffic, the FWSM sets the maximum
  number of out-of-order packets that can be queued for a TCP
  connection to 2 packets. The TCP normalizer is enabled by default
  and is not configurable except to enable or disable.

  To disable the TCP normalizing function, use the 
  "no control-point tcp-normalizer" command in global configuration
  mode, as shown in the following example.

  FWSM# config terminal
  FWSM(config)# no control-point tcp-normalizer
  FWSM(config)#
  FWSM#

  Disabling the "control-point tcp-normalizer" will prevent strict
  TCP checks, such as detecting out-of-sequence segments and
  monitoring TCP options, on the TCP packets received on the Control
  Plane for Layer 7 inspection in the FWSM, will not be performed.
  The feature should be re-enabled after upgrading to a fixed version
  of software.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
