TippingPoint is committed to assuring the security of our customers, and 
we take all reports of potential security issues against our products very 
seriously. 

Even though this report seems less than credible, we would encourgage the 
author of this "advisory" to contact us directly and provide us with 
additional details and sources to allow us to investigate this claim. 
All though there seems to be limited to no information available on how 
this apparent "Denial of Service" would be carried out, we've  put our 
resources towards attempting to reproduce the issue, and all versions of 
our TOS have performed as expected with no DoS emerging. 

Again, if the poster of this advisory has additional information available 
that would allow us to successfully reproduce these claims, we would 
appreciate if it was submitted to us for investigation. 
Submissions can be made to secure@...m.com or on the web at 
www.3com.com/security.
 
Kind Regards, 
TippingPoint Security Response Team

Subject
3Com's TippingPoint Denial of Service






Vulnerability:       Denial of Service
Affected Product:    3Com's TippingPoint IPS
Affected Versions:   All

Author:              Corroded_Lunchmeats_X



Issue:
======

TippingPoint IPS is prone to DoS when a sequence of crafted packets are
destined for port 80.



Details:
========

When quickly flooded with packets destined for port 80, and an 
incrementing
source port this causes the software to consume a huge amount of CPU time,
due to a badly written loop, causing the device to stop responding.
