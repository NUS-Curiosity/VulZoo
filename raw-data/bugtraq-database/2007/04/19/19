Actually, FF on Linux just slows down for a while... memory allocation 
(RSS) for the process goes up untill it reaches ~800Mb, then I see an 
"out of memory" error in FF's javascript console and then... nothing.

No crashes of any kind.

Kernel's OOMkiller didn't got involved.

Disk I/O skyrocketed - of course - beacuse the system started to swap 
pretty soon (on a machine with 1Gb of physical memory).

It seems Firefox's JS engine is smart enough to catch the problem and 
shut down the bad script before it's too late... to the point I was able 
to browse normally after the tests, without any noticeable after-effect.

Also it seems that other people were doing their little experiments on 
this issue before anyone of us:

This guy also tested Opera, not just IE & FF: he was looking for OOM 
problems in the variuos JS engines and for problems in detecting and 
halting infinite recursions too. He reached the conclusion that Opera 
seems to be the one reacting better to those two issues, although I 
can't confirm (I just don't bother).

I found the link after 2 minutes, searching on Google (using the same FF 
instance I "tested", by the way ;-) ).

Tested PoC on:
- Firefox/2.0.0.1
- Linux 2.6.18.2
- GNU libc 2.3.6
- GCC 3.4.4
