Kaspersky Internet Security Suite klif.sys Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.03.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 03, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Kaspersky Internet Security Suite is a combination of Kaspersky
anti-virus, anti-spam, and personal firewall in one product. For more
information see the vendor's website at the following URL.

http://www.kaspersky.com/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in Kaspersky Lab's
Internet Security Suite klif.sys could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code within kernel context.

The klif.sys driver is part of the "anti-hacker" proactive protection.
As part of this defense, the driver hooks and screens various system
calls, such as registry functions.

The hook function for the _NtSetValueKey() function is vulnerable to an
integer overflow that leads to a kernel heap overflow. Passing a large
unsigned value for the data size argument results in an arithmetic
overflow when calculating the amount of memory to allocate. A copy
operation into this buffer results in corruption of kernel memory.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute code with kernel privileges.

This vulnerability lets an attacker overwrite a nearly arbitrary amount
of kernel heap memory with arbitrary data. Exploitation of kernel heap
based buffer overflows is both difficult and unreliable. However, there
are documented methods for exploiting these types of overflows.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed this vulnerability in Kaspersky Internet Security
6.0.1.411 for Windows. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
