    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1118

Description:
    Previous versions of the openoffice.org package are vulnerable to
    two indirect code execution attacks, one when reading maliciously
    malformed StarCalc documents, and one when parsing maliciously
    crafted URIs.  (Another vulnerability in libwpd was addressed
    separately, as libwpd is packaged separately in rPath Linux.)
