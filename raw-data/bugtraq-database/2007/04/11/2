aushack.com - Vulnerability Advisory
-----------------------------------------------
Release Date:
 11-Apr-2007

Software:
 webMethods - webMethods Glue Management Console
 http://www.webmethods.com/

 "With webMethods Glue developers can easily create SOAP interfaces
  for their existing Java and C/C++ applications, and legacy systems
  can be easily Web service-enabled, allowing reuse. webMethods Glue
  includes a compact, high-performance implementation of important
  standards such as HTTP, Servlets, XML, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI, and
  interoperates with Microsoft .NET, IBM WebSphere, BEA WebLogic,
  Apache Axis, and other Web service platforms."

Versions affected:
 Glue 6.5.1 and below.

Vulnerability discovered:

 Directory Traversal.

Vulnerability impact:

 Medium - Read arbitrary system files.

Vulnerability information:

 The webMethods Glue Management Console includes HTML pages via
 the /console?resource=console/index.html variable, which is prone
 to a classic traversal attack.

 Examples:

  http://glueconsole:8080/console?resource=../../../boot.ini
  http://glueconsole:8080/console?resource=\boot.ini
  http://glueconsole:8080/console?resource=c:\boot.ini

  Would return the contents of the 'boot.ini' file.

  Note that 'c:\boot.ini' is also valid. It may be possible
  (but untested) to traverse other volumes.
