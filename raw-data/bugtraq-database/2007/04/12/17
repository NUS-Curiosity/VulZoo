HPSBUX02203 SSRT071339 rev.1 - HP-UX Running Portable File System (PFS), Remote Increase in Privilege

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon as soon as possible.

Release Date: 2007-03-30
Last Updated: 2007-04-09

Potential Security Impact: Remote increase in privilege.

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified in HP-UX with the Portable File System (PFS). The vulnerability could be exploited remotely to gain an increase in privilege.

References: None

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.00 (obsolete), B.11.11 and B.11.23.

BACKGROUND

Note: HP-UX B.11.00 is obsolete as of January 1, 2007. It is discussed in this Security Bulletin because the patches cited in the Resolution section were available before January 1, 2007.

As of March 1, 2004 the Portable File System(PFS) is obsolete, and no longer supported on any HP-UX release. PFS is supplied, but no longer supported on HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11, and B.11.23.

PFS was originally adopted by HP to provide accessibility to Rock Ridge Interchange file system format on CD-ROM file systems. The equivalent functionality is now provided by HP via the HP-UX CDFS file system type and HP-UX's standard file systems commands.

The Hewlett-Packard Company thanks iDefense Labs http://www.idefense.com for reporting this vulnerability to security-alert@...com.

To determine if a system has an affected version, search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset" for an affected fileset. Then determine if the recommended patch or update is installed.

AFFECTED VERSIONS

HP-UX B.11.00
=============
OS-Core.CORE-KRN
ProgSupport.C-INC
OS-Core.CORE2-KRN
OS-Core.UX-CORE

RESOLUTION

The resolution is to avoid the vulnerability by discontinuing the use of PFS.

For B.11.00 and B.11.11, the enhanced CDFS and mount/umount commands are provided by the following patches. These patches are available on: http://itrc.hp.com

HP-UX B.11.00 - PHKL_28060, PHKL_26450, PHCO_26449 or subsequent
HP-UX B.11.11 - PHKL_28025, PHKL_26269, PHCO_25841 or subsequent

With these patches, a mount command option (mount -F cdfs -o rr) must be used to enable support of Rock Ridge at mount time.

For B.11.22, B.11.23 and later HP-UX releases, the Rock Ridge Interchange support is provided with the core HP-UX OS and is the default (no patches or special option required).

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
Discontinue the use of PFS.
