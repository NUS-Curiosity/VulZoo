Subject: Norton Multiple insufficient argument validation of hooked SSDT function
 Vulnerability

Hello,

We would like to inform you about a vulnerability in Symantec Norton products.


Description:

Symantec Norton Personal Firewall hooks many functions in SSDT and in at least two cases it fails to validate arguments 
that come from the user mode. User calls to NtCreateMutant and NtOpenEvent with invalid argument values can cause system 
crashes because of errors in Norton driver SPBBCDrv.sys. Further impacts of this bug (like arbitrary code execution in 
the kernel mode) were not examined.


Vulnerable software:

     * Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.1.7
     * Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.0.33
     * probably all versions of Norton Personal Firewall 2006, Norton Internet Security 2006 and other products that use 
SPBBCDrv driver
     * possibly older versions of Norton Personal Firewall and Norton Internet Security




More details and a proof of concept including its source code are available here:
