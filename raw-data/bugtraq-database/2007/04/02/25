IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment Multiple Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 03.31.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 31, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

IBM Corp.'s Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment is a network
boot server that facilitates central management of networked
workstations. It implements Pre-boot Execution Environment (PXE) as
well as a Web-based administration service. More information can be
found at the following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a multiple vulnerabilities within IBM Corp.'s
Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment allows attackers to crash
the service or potentially execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM
privileges.

These vulnerabilities specifically exist in the handling of
multi part/form-data HTTP POST requests. Malformed requests can cause
invalid memory accesses leading to denial of service, or in some cases
heap corruption.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to crash the service or potentially
execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

No authentication is required to access the vulnerable code. The
attacker need only be able to send a specially crafted request to the
HTTP (8080) or HTTP-SSL (443) port of the management service.

It should be noted that this service can be run with reduced privileges.
iDefense recommends running this service with the least amount of
privileges possible.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities within
version 5.1.0.116 of Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment.
Older versions are suspected to be vulnerable as well.

V. WORKAROUND

Employing firewalls to limit access to the affected service will
mitigate exposure to these vulnerabilities.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

IBM Corp. Tivoli has addressed these vulnerabilities within Tivoli
