In regard to djbdns, I believe that that's answered at:

http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dnscache.html

where it says:

    dnscache does not cache (or pass along) records outside the
    server's bailiwick; those records could be poisoned. Records for
    foo.dom, for example, are accepted only from the root servers,
    the dom servers, and the foo.dom servers.
