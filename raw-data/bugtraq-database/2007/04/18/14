Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MadWifi driver,
possibly leading to a Denial of Service and information disclosure.

Background
==========

The MadWifi driver provides support for Atheros based IEEE 802.11
Wireless Lan cards.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-wireless/madwifi-ng       < 0.9.3                    >= 0.9.3

Description
===========

The driver does not properly process Channel Switch Announcement
Information Elements, allowing for an abnormal channel change. The
ieee80211_input() function does not properly handle AUTH frames and the
driver sends unencrypted packets before WPA authentication succeeds.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted AUTH frames to the
vulnerable host, resulting in a Denial of Service by crashing the
kernel. A remote attacker could gain access to sensitive information
about network architecture by sniffing unencrypted packets. A remote
attacker could also send a Channel Switch Count less than or equal to
one to trigger a channel change, resulting in a communication loss and
a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MadWifi users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/madwifi-ng-0.9.3"
