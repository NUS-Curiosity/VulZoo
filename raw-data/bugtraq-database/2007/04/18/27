Well, as the main vulnerability implies, a sane DNS cache wouldn't
accept a record that wasn't requested.  If I ask for A, and I get A and
B back, and B isn't reasonably related to A, ignore B.

I'm not saying BIND is sane, but from what I understand, in this case
they got it right.  The birthday attack is merely another vector to
exploit the real problem.
