Synopsis
========

A memory leak has been discovered in FreeRADIUS, possibly allowing for
a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

FreeRADIUS is an open source RADIUS authentication server
implementation.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dialup/freeradius       < 1.1.6                      >= 1.1.6

Description
===========

The Coverity Scan project has discovered a memory leak within the
handling of certain malformed Diameter format values inside an EAP-TTLS
tunnel.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a large amount of specially crafted
packets to a FreeRADIUS server using EAP-TTLS authentication and
exhaust all memory, possibly resulting in a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FreeRADIUS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dialup/freeradius-1.1.6"
