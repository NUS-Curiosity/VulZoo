Aggregating queries would definitely help if you assume the attacker can
make recursive queries.  

However, it was my understanding (which could be completely wrong) that
BIND 9 reuses sockets for multiple queries, unlike previous versions,
and this makes spoofed attacks easier in another respect.  (Of course
this all has nothing to do with the Windows-specific flaw.)

That's good, that at least someone is trying to do this in BIND.

thanks for the info,
