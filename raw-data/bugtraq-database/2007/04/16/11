Introduction
============
oe2edit is a German Content Management System.

More Details
============
Cross Site Scripting:
Input passed directly to the "q" parameter in "oe2edit.cgi" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Cookie Manipulation:
Input passed directly to the "q" parameter in "oe2edit.cgi" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to inject custom META tags to alter the cookies stored in the browser, set custom cookies and to modify the cookie information. 

Workaround
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
You should work with "htmlspecialchars()" or "htmlentities()" php-function to ensure that html tags
are not going to be executed. 

Example:
$q = htmlspecialchars($_POST['q']);
$test = htmlentities($_GET['test']);
?>
