Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in ClamAV allowing for
the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.90.2                      >= 0.90.2

Description
===========

iDefense Labs have reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the
cab_unstore() function when processing negative values in .cab files.
Multiple file descriptor leaks have also been reported in chmunpack.c,
pdf.c and dblock.c when processing .chm files.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted CHM file to the
scanner, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running ClamAV.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.90.2"
