-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve
Media Server. User interaction is not required to exploit this
vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the SUN RPC service which binds to a
randomly chosen high TCP port. The target port can be obtained by
querying the port mapper. Multiple stack-based buffer overflows exist
during the parsing of malformed RPC strings. Exploitation of these
overflows can result in arbitrary code execution.

Computer Associates has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
