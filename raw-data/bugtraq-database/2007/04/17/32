Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] A Botted Fortune 500 a Day

Hi Steven,

I believe security of an organisation is orthogonal to the number of
employees/users and how savvy they are. It depends more on the will
and resources to secure the network properly. Two, corporations do
have many financial incentives to make sure they are secure - if they
are doing their risk analyses properly, they can see that. So, yes I
do expect them to fare better - a lot better - than ISPs. More
comments are in-line.

A compromise is a compromise and you don't know the extent until
you've looked at everything. If one of your machines is spewing spam,
how do you know it is also not leaking confidential data to a third
party? Any compromise has the potential to be *extremely* costly.

There is no reason for an admin to let users compromise the company's
security. If the company cares about security, they can disable admin
rights, lock down the firewall and run an IDS.

I can buy the argument that most companies don't care sufficiently,
but this is really orthogonal to the number and experience level of
their users.

Block the infection vectors: screen email, http and ftp traffic. No
personal laptops on company networks. No admin rights as far as
possible. Monitor and react to new vectors and threats as they arise.

Yes, I would disable people's Internet access - in fact all intranet
access too. My main interaction with Cisco kit to date is shutting
down Ethernet ports and re-enabling them after the problem has been
resolved. If there's an incident, the plug gets pulled until someone
has examined the machine, and if necessary reinstalled from known good
media.

They have a financial incentive to look after their machines, so I do
expect them to look after them. An ISP has no such incentive to look
after their customer's machines.

Yes, I've seen that. Having not worked at any of those particular
university, I can't comment on their setups. We immediately pulled the
plug on the occasional bots we had on our network. (If you're allowing
personal gear onto your network you will always get a few incidents.)

Not any networks I configure. You have to be internal, or you have to
authenticate - or no email.

My favourite quote at the moment is: "there are people who will try
anything to secure their networks, except design them correctly,
control the access levels within them, segment their networks,
understand their traffic, and monitor things closely." - Marcus Ranum.
Securing a network is not a black art any more, it just requires a lot
of corporate willpower to implement a useful security policy.

cheers,
 Jamie
