Systems Affected:

According to the Sun Security Coordination Team, Solaris 10 Operating
System,
Sun Java Web Console 2.2.2, Sun Java Web Console 2.2.3, Sun Java Web Console
2.2.4 and Sun Java Web Console 2.2.5 are affected.

The existence of the vulnerability was verified by n.runs on fully-patched
installations of Solaris 10 6/06 on SPARC and x86 Platform running Sun Java
Web Console 2.2.4. 


Overview:

A remote exploitable format string vulnerability has been identified in the
in
the Sun Java Web Console [1].


Description:

The Sun Java Web Console is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability.
The root cause of the format string vulnerability lies in the logging of
failed
logins, therefore this vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated
remote
users.

The vulnerability exists as the libc syslog function is called in
/usr/lib/libwebconsole_services.so with two (2) instead of at least three
(3)
arguments which enables an attacker to influence the message buffer.


Impact:

The exploitation of this vulnerability may result in unauthorised remote
code
execution or cause a denial of service condition by crashing the Java Web
Console service.


Solution:

Update to Sun Java Web Console 2.2.6 or later.
Patches for Solaris 10 were released by SUN Microsystems to address this
issue,
a workaround designed by Sun Microsystems is available. [2]
