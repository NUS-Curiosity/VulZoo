   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2007-003
Advisory Title: Macrovision InstallAnywhere Password and Serial
                Number Bypass
        Author: Brian Reilly / brian_reilly@...antec.com
  Release Date: 28-02-2007
   Application: Macrovision InstallAnywhere Enterprise
                (all versions)
      Platform: All
      Severity: Local Authorization Bypass
 Vendor status: Verified by vendor
    CVE Number: CVE-2007-1009
     Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/22643


Overview:

	Macrovisionï¿½s InstallAnywhere (acquired from Zero G Software in
	June 2005) is a program to build multiplatform installers, and is
	frequently used to distribute web services and J2EE applications.
	InstallAnywhere Enterprise offers the ability to require a serial
	number and/or a password as a	prerequisite to installing an
	application.  However, it is possible to modify specific
	configuration files included in an InstallAnywhere package to
	circumvent these controls

Details:

	InstallAnywhere packages include an XML project configuration file
	named	InstallScript.iap_xml.  This file controls the behavior of
	the	installation process, including verification of a password
	and/or serial	number (if applicable).

	Upon starting an installer, a directory is created in temporary
	disk space.  This directory contains multiple files, including a
	ZIP archive	that contains the XML project file.  A LaunchAnywhere
	executable is also created during the installation process and is
	used to launch the actual	Java application installer.
	It is possible to bypass serial number and password controls by
	creating a copy of this temporary directory, extracting a copy of
	the XML project	file from the ZIP archive, deleting the relevant
	serial number or password	verification sections from the XML
	project file, replacing the modifiedXML project file in the ZIP
	archive, and then manually starting the	installation process via
	the included LaunchAnywhere executable.

Vendor Response:

	Macrovision has confirmed the reports provided by Symantec and
	updated InstallAnywhere to resolve the issue.  Current
	InstallAnywhere customers will be encouraged to install version
	8.0.1 as soon as it becomes available (estimated mid April).
	More information regarding this version will be posted in the
	release notes.

	Macrovision will advise all users of InstallAnywhere to upgrade
	to 8.0.1 as soon as it becomes available.  Registered users of the
	software will be electronically notified of the availability of
	the release and directed to the necessary files. 

Recommendation:
	Developers should securely implement their own application-level
	controls as needed, independent of the InstallAnywhere installer.
