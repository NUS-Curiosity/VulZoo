Your advisory contains virtually no technical information that could be
used to confirm the problem - but assuming Intel notation, the above MOV
seems to be inconsistent with the description given.

This operations loads dword from memory into a register; if this is where
the application crashes, it's more likely indicative of a NULL pointer bug
(if EAX is 0), or some memory allocation mishap.
