[All work and no play makes bunker a dull boy...]


A problem has occurred during researching about this oracle package.
Because of particular coincidences concentrated on user privileges the
test results disaligned. Actually, after new analysis on other targets
the code seems not working as aspected.

I apologize for the mistake, the code was just removed, waiting for new
(oculated) hints.
