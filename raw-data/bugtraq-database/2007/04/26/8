Subject: Re: WordPress v2.1.3 >> remote file include~

None of these exploits you're posting actually work. WordPress does not have "require_once" or "include" as a variable in these files, and calling theme.php (to pick an example) will cause absolutely nothing to happen as it just defines functions. It executes nothing and produces no output by itself.

Please fact check and actually try out these "exploits" before posting them to Bugtraq in the future.
