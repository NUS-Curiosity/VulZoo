Subject: High Risk Vulnerability in OpenOffice

John Heasman of NGSSoftware has discovered a high risk vulnerability
in the handling of StarCalc documents within OpenOffice.


The vulnerability affects all versions of OpenOffice prior to 2.2. If
an attacker can coax a user into opening a specially crafted StarCalc
document then the attacker can execute arbitrary code in the security
context of their victim.



Details
*******

1) sc\source\filter\starcalc\scflt.cxx


USHORT NoteLen;
rStream >> NoteLen;
if (NoteLen != 0)
{
 sal_Char Note[4096];
 rStream.Read(Note, NoteLen);
 Note[NoteLen] = 0;
        String aText( SC10TOSTRING(Note));
        ScPostIt aNote(aText, pDoc);
 pDoc->SetNote(Col, static_cast<SCROW> (Row), Tab, aNote );
}


There is a stack overflow when copying more than 4096 characters into
the Note buffer.



Solution
********

This issue has now been resolved; OpenOffice users are strongly recommended
to install OpenOffice 2.2, apply OpenOffice patch 1.1.5 or obtain the
latest OpenOffice packages appropriate to their distribution.
