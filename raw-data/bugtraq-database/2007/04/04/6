Description:
    Previous versions of the krb5 package are vulnerable to three attacks
    that can be triggered remotely, one of which is known to provide
    unauthenticated unrestricted shell access to any system running
    the krb5 telnet daemon.  rPath Linux systems are not automatically
    configured with vulnerable daemons enabled.  Systems configured as
    kerberos administrative servers are vulnerable.
