Subject: Re: Microsoft Jet Engine MDB File Parsing Stack Overflow Vulnerability

It would be useful to know if this is also an issue with msjet40.dll
4.0.9510.0 (Windows Server 2003 SP2 + hotfixes).  I have an installer
for Windows XP SP2 that -- seems -- to cleanly apply Windows Server 2003
SP2's MDAC 2.82.  I haven't been able to give it a serious, hard testing
because I don't have many apps that still use MDAC.
