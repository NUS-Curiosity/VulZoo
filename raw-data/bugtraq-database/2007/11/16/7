Password:username@...mplemail.com

2. It will return unexpected error as follow;

Open Err:Connect failed; nested exception is: java.net.UnknownHostException: examplemail.com@....3.4(ip) Error occur : null

3. After this error, contineous Refresh (Keep pressing F5 key) and Post DATA yes, and following error occur.
