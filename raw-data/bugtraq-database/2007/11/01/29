While the list of IP address ranges is interesting, there's no evidence
provided that Microsoft OSes allow 'backdooring,' are the researchers
planning on providing any?

Subject: Cryptome: NSA has access to Windows Mobile smartphones

A widely known Web site Cryptome has released information about backdooring
Microsoft Windows machines today.

According to the post National Security Agency has access both stand-alone
systems and networks running Microsoft products.

The post states the following:
"This includes wireless wiretapping of "smart phones" running Microsoft
Mobile.
Microsoft remote administrative privileges allow "backdooring" into
Microsoft operating systems via IP/TCP ports 1024 through 1030."

According to the Cryptome's source this is typically triggered when devices
visit Microsoft Update servers.
