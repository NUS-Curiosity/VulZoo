This is inaccurate.
There is another way to use your vuln (as not direct on typing it in to
the browser), the problem of encoding input can be easily overcome using
a POST method that not encode the input or a FLASH/ACTIONSCRIPT.

So re-creating a web-banner that links to your application with a new
page (document.write) .js isn't very difficult to do.
