Subject: RE: mac trojan in-the-wild

I don't understand why this is being brushed off as not a big deal by so
many. 

No, it's not a worm, it's not a virus, it's not self-replicating.  It's
actually a pretty simple little trojan.  

But this is a bit groundbreaking -- this is the first time we've seen
the professional, profit-motivated malware folks move into the Mac.   

And like this is not a problem on Vista right now?  (which has similar
user messaging). 

The fake codecs are a plague on Windows systems.  

I'm not sure I would blow this off so quickly.  When people want their
porn, and don't know better, well... they do stupid things like install
fake codecs. And here, the Mac user is made to think this is a simple
Quicktime plug-in.

Let's see now, user must:

1) Navigate to porn site
2) Download Trojan
3) Either open file or have set 'Open Safe Files...'
4) Must allow install by typing admin password

Oh yeah, this will clearly hit Mac users hard, not. I don't see this as
a big deal, more as Darwin in action (if you will not mind the pun). How
this is a big deal is hard to see. Just a few more machines in the bot
net.

Now a self-replicating virus, that might be an issue, but this is a dead
end. Not even a very effective drive by.
