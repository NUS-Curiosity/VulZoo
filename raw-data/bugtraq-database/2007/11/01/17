Subject: Cryptome: NSA has access to Windows Mobile smartphones

A widely known Web site Cryptome has released information about backdooring Microsoft Windows machines today.

According to the post National Security Agency has access both stand-alone systems and networks running Microsoft products.

The post states the following:
"This includes wireless wiretapping of smart phones running Microsoft Mobile.
Microsoft remote administrative privileges allow backdooring into Microsoft operating systems via IP/TCP ports 1024 through 1030."

According to the Cryptome's source this is typically triggered when devices visit Microsoft Update servers.
