Subject: mac trojan in-the-wild

For whoever didn't hear, there is a Macintosh trojan in-the-wild being 
dropped, infecting mac users.
Yes, it is being done by a regular online gang--itw--it is not yet another 
proof of concept. The same gang infects Windows machines as well, just 
that now they also target macs.

This means one thing: Apple's day has finally come and Apple users are 
going to get hit hard. All those unpatched vulnerabilities from years past 
are going to bite them in the behind.

I can sum it up in one sentence: OS X is the new Windows 98. Investing in
security ONLY as a last resort losses money, but everyone has to learn it 
for themselves.
