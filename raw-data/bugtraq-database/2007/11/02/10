Subject: Re: [botnets] re MAC trojan (fwd)

There have been many threads on this subject, but I believe this post 
below covers what some of us are trying to say on why this issue is 
significant.

Obviously some people are far more articulate than me.

I think the point Gadi (and Alex of Sunbelt Software, in his original
blog entry) is trying to make is that professional malware authors have
begun to take notice of Apple.  As a piece of malware goes, this trojan
is nothing remarkable in itself, other than the fact that it's aimed at
Mac users.

As Gadi mentioned, there are a number of known issues that Apple has
yet to address.  If the professional malware authors are now taking aim
at Mac users, Apple appears to be making it easy for them.

There are a few comments that I've seen in this thread that are rather
worrisome:

::: Interspace System Department
> Relax. MAC users are not that stupid as MS users...

Are you a Mac user?  If so, you just proved yourself wrong with that
statement.  :)</flame>

Users are users, and their knowledge of computers varies greatly from
one to the next.  I've supported a number of Mac users who tend to be
clueless when it comes to computers, and I've supported Mac users who
know quite a bit about the machines they use.  Like any Windows or *nix
user, Mac users can - and will - fall prey to this kind of scheme.

Again, the trojan is not what's important here.  The fact that it was
written for Macs is particularly noteworthy, however.

Security issues should be fixed as soon as feasable, not 'when needed'.
If all security vulnerabilities were fixed 'when needed', the malware
authors would be having a field day (which, of course, implies they're
not already... hmmmm.).

Apple has a history of badly-written software.  As far as recent
examples go, take a look at tar and rsync on Tiger (10.4) - they've
been modified to support extended attributes like ACLs and resource
forks, and they're quite broken - extended attribute support introduces
a serious memory leak.

If that doesn't quite hit home, you can get a further idea of how their
software is written by taking a look at the man page for sharing(1), on
OS X Server (for those of you without access to OS X Server, take a
look at
http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sharing.1.html
).  Pay particular attention to the description for the -s, -g, and -i
options - do their developers (or tech writers) know the difference
between AND and OR?  :)
