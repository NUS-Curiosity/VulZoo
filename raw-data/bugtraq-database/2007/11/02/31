Subject: DoS Exploit for DHCPd bug (Bugtraq ID 25984 ; CVE-2007-5365)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello,

I've been playing with DHCPd bug in *Ubuntu Linux*. According to the
analysis by Core it could be theoretically possible to get a shell ("the
possibility of using it to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems was
not investigated in-depth and should not be disregarded"):
http://www.coresecurity.com/index.php5?module=ContentMod&action=item&id=1962

But in practice it doesn't seems to be possible because vulnerable memcpy
tries to write past the end of the stack region (it tries to write ~64
kbytes, when available stack space is ~8 kbytes), so you always get an
instant "Segmentation fault", without any chance to control EIP.

DoS exploit is quite trivial. DHCPd crashes using mms values:
278 <= mms <= 284
I've attached working (DoS) exploit.

If some code-ninja has any idea about how to overcome the former
exploitation problem, please, I'd  be interested in knowing it (perhaps
performing a previous DHCP operation in order for the stack to be expanded,
before launching the real exploit?).
