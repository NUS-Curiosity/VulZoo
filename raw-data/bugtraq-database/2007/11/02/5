Yes, ISC has finally gotten around to randomizing the source ports, as of
9.5.0a2. It is controlled by the "use-queryport-pool" option in the server
section of the BIND configuration file. It defaults to "yes".

You can control how big the pool is with the "queryport-pool-ports" option. It
defaults to 8 (an extra 3 bits of entropy).

This set of ports is refreshed periodically, with a frequency controlled by the
"queryport-pool-updateinterval" option. (Personally I think this option adds no
little value from a security point of view, but it doesn't hurt.)
