4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in ACDSee 
products, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

1) An input validation error within ID_PSP.apl when processing PSP 
image files can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via 
a specially crafted PSP image file.

2) An integer overflow error within ID_PSP.apl when processing PSP 
image files can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via 
a specially crafted PSP image file.

3) An input validation error within AM_LHA.apl when processing LHA
archives can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a
specially crafted LHA archive.

NOTE: The AM_LHA.apl plugin is not included in a default install of
ACDSee Photo Editor.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows execution of
arbitrary code.
