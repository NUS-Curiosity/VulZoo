Considering most tar versions have specific protections to avoid this very
problem (namely, tar extracting a file outside of the directory hierarchy
where it is executed), then yes, it is a problem.

Even if you happen to think the root cause of all computing evil is what
is between the chair and the keyboard, trojans are a valid attack
vector.
