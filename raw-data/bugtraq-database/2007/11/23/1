Subject: Re: Re: Gadu-Gadu Local/Remote Buffer Overflow vulnerability

Hi all,

I was trying to confirm that, but under Windows XP MCE (lang: German and English) with all patches, overflows on other address. Can anybody confirm that?

I agree with JohnDo, why just don't send user a specially crafted kernel32.dll :).

For me, this is just design bug.

Emacs
