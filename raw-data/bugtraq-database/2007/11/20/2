Agreed. I don't claim this being a bug of X.509.

Agreed again: if all subjectAltNames would be shown to the user on first
contact like the CN it would be a user issue. Instead, browsers bury
them in details, Konqueror does not even show them *anywhere*. So an
avarage user has not enough information to make a proper decision.

However, vendors seem to head towards strong hostname binding. MSIE,
Opera and Safari 3 already do so. Mozilla-1.9/Firefox-3 will have the
probably best solution: the user can set a list of hostname/port tupels
a cert shall be trusted for.

Yes, SNI is the 'real' solution to vitual https hosting. But it will
still take some time till all servers, clients and admins know that.
