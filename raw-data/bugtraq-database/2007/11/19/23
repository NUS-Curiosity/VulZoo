Introduction:
-------------
If a malicious user sends a TFTP request to the
signaling server with the MAC address of the
victim�s VoIP phone as part of the file name, he
is able to reroute only the audio stream coming
from the other end of the call to his computers IP
address.
Even though an Alcatel VoIP phone can make or take
calls, and send audio, it is prevented from hearing anything said at the other end of the
communication. The VoIP phone needs to be rebooted
manually in order to work again.

This vulnerability may be further exploited by
rerouting the audio stream to the victim�s VoIP
phone again. This would only allow the malicious
user to eavesdrop on half of the victim's audio
communication: what the victim says is not
intercepted, only on the answers made by the other
party would be overheard. Note, this scenario has
not been verified.
