Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in teTeX, possibly
allowing to execute arbitrary code or overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

teTeX is a complete TeX distribution for editing documents.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/tetex      < 3.0_p1-r6                      >= 3.0_p1-r6

Description
===========

Joachim Schrod discovered several buffer overflow vulnerabilities and
an insecure temporary file creation in the "dvilj" application that is
used by dvips to convert DVI files to printer formats (CVE-2007-5937,
CVE-2007-5936). Bastien Roucaries reported that the "dvips" application
is vulnerable to two stack-based buffer overflows when processing DVI
documents with long \href{} URIs (CVE-2007-5935). teTeX also includes
code from Xpdf that is vulnerable to a memory corruption and two
heap-based buffer overflows (GLSA 200711-22); and it contains code from
T1Lib that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing an overly
long font filename (GLSA 200710-12).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
DVI or PDF file which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. A local
attacker could exploit the "dvilj" vulnerability to conduct a symlink
attack to overwrite arbitrary files.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All teTeX users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/tetex-3.0_p1-r6"
