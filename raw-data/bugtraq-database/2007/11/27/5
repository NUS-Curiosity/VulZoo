Subject: Announce: RFIDIOt release RFIDIOt-0.1r, November 2007

Folks,

I'm please to bring you the latest update to RFIDIOt, the open source 
python library for RFID exploration...

This release is brought to you courtesy of United Airlines, who bumped 
me from my flight thereby condemning me to 8 hours in the largest, 
shiniest, emptiest and most soul-destroying lounge I've ever had the 
misfortune to set foot in... If ever there was motivation to lose 
yourself in python, this was it... :)

 From CHANGES:

   v0.r
   add SCM Microsystems reader support
   add -d (debug) option
   switch to T=1 protocol for PC/SC
   add auto-detect of PC/SC reader types
   fix minor reporting issues in readmifaresimple.py
   fix setting of tag type 'ALL' on ACG readers (different for LF or HF)
   added a bunch of PCSC ATR card types
   add reading of previously stored files to mrpkey.py
   fix CBEFF processing in mrpkey.py
   fix bruteforcing of first character in mrpkey.py [Petter Bjorklund]
   add ID Card processing to mrpkey.py [vonJeek <mailto:vonjeek@....org>]

The main change is processing the Biometric block in e-passports, which 
should now work correctly for all nations, and adding ID cards (thanks 
to vonJeek)... Please let me know if you find any exceptions. ID cards 
have so far only been tested on NL cards.

enjoy,
Adam
