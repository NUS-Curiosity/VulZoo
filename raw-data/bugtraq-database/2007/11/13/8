1. That document is not quite up-to-date. I don't think there
   were any improvements in the actually passed law, though.

2. The IP is not "the only thing which is logged". Besides
   telephone and SMS/MMS connections the following is logged:
    - for internet connections (i. e. dial-in or equivalent):
       - IP number
       - connecting user (i. e. the calling phone number, 
         ppp userid or equivalent)
       - Timestamp

    - for email
       - sender and recipient address of every email (logged on
         sending as well as receiving servers)
       - IP address(es) accessing a mailbox
       - timestamps for both of the above

    - for anonymizing services (!):
       - original and anonymized identifiers (e. g. IP or
         email address)
       - timestamps

So much for "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit".

Bye,
	Peter
