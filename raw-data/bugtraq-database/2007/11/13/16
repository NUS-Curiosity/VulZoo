That's been an ongoing question for me with regards to things like  
TOR gateways.

As has been recently posted on Risky Business[1] and The Age[2], TOR  
doesn't prevent sniffing of the traffic leaving its gateway. If a  
running gateway connects to a server with "information of interest" -  
child porn, bomb making information, a known criminal forum - that  
brings authorities investigating to your house, it isn't a very good  
way to cover ones own tracks with noise. On a similar note, randomly  
connecting and pushing network data may create noise that obscures  
important data, but it may be easily filtered out from the logs  
during analysis.

That's been my first question as well. Storage, at least for  
compliance purposes, has gotten cheaper. 6 months of log data for  
most ISPs will still be under the 500GB range of disk. The harder  
part of the stored logs is making it easily analyzed and relevant.  
There are, of course, several companies in the data retention  
compliance arena already, most have offerings for PCI, SOx and HIPAA.  
It's not a stretch to think there are smaller offerings to handle  
this German laws lighter retention requirement for logs.
