It's probably a good idea to deploy encryption *now*, and use it for
*everything*, and be ready for when (not if) they decide to be more draconian
in their logging requirements.  And yes, encrypt *everything* - that way you
make it a lot harder to do traffic analysis.  If only the "interesting" 10% is
encrypted, they know which 10% are interesting connections, which may be as
important as the actual content.
