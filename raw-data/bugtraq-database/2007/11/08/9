Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in 3proxy, possibly resulting in a
Denial of Service.

Background
==========

3proxy is a really tiny cross-platform proxy servers set, including
HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SOCKS and POP3 support.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-proxy/3proxy      < 0.5.3j                          >= 0.5.3j

Description
===========

3proxy contains a double free vulnerability in the ftpprchild()
function, which frees param->hostname and calls the parsehostname()
function, which in turn attempts to free param->hostname again.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request to the proxy,
possibly resulting in a Denial of Service. Under typical configuration,
the scope of this vulnerability is limited to the local network.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All 3proxy users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/3proxy-0.5.3j"

==========
