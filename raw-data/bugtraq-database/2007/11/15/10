4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Samba, which can be
exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the 
"reply_netbios_packet()" function in nmbd/nmbd_packets.c when sending
NetBIOS replies. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer
overflow by sending multiple specially crafted WINS "Name Registration"
requests followed by a WINS "Name Query" request.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but
requires that Samba is configured to run as a WINS server (the "wins
support" option is enabled).

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Apply patch or update to version 3.0.27.
