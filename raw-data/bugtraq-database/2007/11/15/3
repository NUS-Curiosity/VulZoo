Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 11.14.07: Apple Mac OS X Mach Port Inheritance
 Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 11.14.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Nov 14, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Mach ports are used to provide inter-process communication (IPC)
facilities on Mac OS X. More information can be found on the vendor's
site at the following URL.

http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/boundaries/chapter_14_section_4.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an access validation vulnerability in Apple Inc.'s
Mac OS X could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges.

When executing a setuid-root binary, the Mach kernel does not reset the
current thread Mach port, or the current thread Mach Exception Port. By
first creating and obtaining write access to a Mach port, and then
executing a set-uid root binary, an attacker can write arbitrary data
into the address space of the process running as root. This leads to
arbitrary code execution in the privileged process.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution
of arbitrary code with root privileges. All an attacker needs is a
setuid-root binary and permission to execute it. In a default install,
there are numerous binaries that meet these requirements.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Mac OS X
version 10.4.10, both Server and Workstation. Previous versions may
also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Apple addressed this vulnerability within their Mac OS X 2007-008
