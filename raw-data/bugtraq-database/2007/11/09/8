Subject: xoops mylinks module - sql injection

I have found a mysql injection vulnerability in
mylinks xoops module
brokenlink.php page where
$_GET['lid'] is not validated by intval() or any other input validation.

See:
modules/mylinks/brokenlink.php?lid=1%20OR%201=2

or get an error of fetch in the page title
