3) Vendor's Description of Software 

"The Link Grammar Parser is a syntactic parser of English, based on
link grammar, an original theory of English syntax. Given a sentence,
the system assigns to it a syntactic structure, which consists of a 
set of labeled links connecting pairs of words. The parser also 
produces a "constituent" representation of a sentence (showing noun 
phrases, verb phrases, etc.)"

4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in AbiWord Link
Grammar, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an
application using the library.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the
"separate_word()" function in tokenize.c when processing overly long
words (over 61 bytes). This can be exploited to cause a stack-based
buffer overflow via a specially crafted sentence passed to the
"separate_sentence()" function.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

5) Solution 

Fixed in the CVS repository.
