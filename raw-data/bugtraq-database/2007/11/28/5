4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Symantec 
Backup Exec for Windows Servers, which can be exploited by malicious 
people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).

1) A NULL-pointer dereference error in the Backup Exec Job Engine 
service (bengine.exe) when handling exceptions can be exploited to 
crash the service by sending a specially crafted packet to default 
port 5633/TCP.

2) Two integer overflow errors within the Backup Exec Job Engine 
service can be exploited to e.g. cause the service to enter an 
infinite loop and exhaust all available memory or consume large 
amounts of CPU resource by sending a specially crafted packet to 
default port 5633/TCP.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Apply hotfixes.
