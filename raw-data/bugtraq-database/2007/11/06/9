If smf has index.php?action=admin in .htaccess ,i can bypass that by typing in the url some variable of administration panel :

example:

index.php?action=admin (.htaccess,then access denied)
index.php?action=membergroups (accessible)
index.php?action=news (accessible)
index.php?action=featuresettings (accessible)

...and others...

i can bypass and enter the administration by typing the accessible variables in the url...
