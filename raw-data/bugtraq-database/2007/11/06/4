Description:
    Previous versions of the perl package contain weaknesses when evaluating
    regular expressions.
    
    If a system is serving a perl-based web application that evaluates
    remote input as a regular expression, an attacker may be be able to
    exploit these weaknesses to execute arbitrary, attacker-provided code on
    the system, potentially elevating this to a remote, deterministic
    unauthorized access vulnerability.
    
    In its default configuration, rPath Linux 1 does not enable any
    perl-based web applications and is thus not vulnerable to this potential
    unauthorized access.
