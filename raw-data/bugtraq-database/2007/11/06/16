Description:
    Previous versions of the pcre package contain multiple vulnerabilities,
    the worst of which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    
    The pcre library and utilities are not known to be exposed via any
    privileged or remote interfaces within rPath Linux by default, but many
    applications linked to the pcre library are routinely exposed to remote
    or untrusted data; some examples include httpd, some PHP applications,
    and various KDE components.
