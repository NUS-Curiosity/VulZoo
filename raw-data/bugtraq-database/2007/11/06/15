That text came from a worm that Symantec and FSecure alerted about 
and put out an advisory about (and there was a story on PC World
 too as I recall). (One of the web vuln scanner folks also put
an advisory but I forget whom now, sorry).

What was interesting to me about the reports I got was that
it sounded like someone was using the worm ids as noise to
send other messages, to look like _update_ messages not AV. 
Maybe experimenting with a new version? Using the worm
as cover for a targeted attack? Unfortunately this is all
verbal descriptions, and not very accurate ones, so I 
can't verify this.

Also a quick search for IDs on skype also shows that
there is another sequence of IDs in the form:

    system.scan.c<number>

But this also begs the question, why haven't the security
folks at Skype shut these down already, as they've been
active for weeks, and people are submitting abuse reports
about them?

cheers,
