There's a few things wrong with this approach. Most of them were  
outlined by Bruce Schneier when he reviewed "TrackMeNot"[1] last year.

The same issues with TrackMeNot apply to Hayneedle, including  
potential false positives, and list of word combinations that can be  
filtered out easily, and well, the list goes on.
