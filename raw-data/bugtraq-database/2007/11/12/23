Subject: Re: Standing Up Against German Laws - Project HayNeedle

However some of these issues can be mitigated without too much trouble. 
  For example, one could have a dynamically growing dictionary of words 
to search for based on random words in random results pages that it 
grabs.  At the very least, this would kill any attempts to filter it out 
of the data mining system.

If the point of the system is primarily to create plausible deniability 
for the end-user, that is, to allow them to say "hayneedle hit the site, 
not me, so I am innocent", then I'd say it could be effective in that 
regard barring some proviso in the law that allow them to persecute 
someone who did not actually even visit a site of their own volition. 
Beyond that, it's also effective in terms of turning up the noise to 
signal ratio and making this law that much less effective, while placing 
a greater burden of ISPs who are then more likely to lobby against it 
ever more vigorously.... all while remaining entirely 'white area' in 
terms of functionality.

I understand your post, but I don't think Mr. Ziegler was over-selling 
his product's effectiveness beyond what it is really capable of.

Take care, Matt
