Synopsis
========

Several vulnerabilities were reported in Lighttpd, most of them
allowing a Denial of Service and potentially the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Lighttpd is a lightweight HTTP web server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/lighttpd      < 1.4.16                      >= 1.4.16

Description
===========

Stefan Esser discovered errors with evidence of memory corruption in
the code parsing the headers. Several independent researchers also
reported errors involving the handling of HTTP headers, the mod_auth
and mod_scgi modules, and the limitation of active connections.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can trigger any of these vulnerabilities by sending
malicious data to the server, which may lead to a crash or memory
exhaustion, and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
Additionally, access-deny settings can be evaded by appending a final /
to a URL.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Lighttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.16"
