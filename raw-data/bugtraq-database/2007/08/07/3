Subject: Re: CORRECTION: EXPL0it FIXED :JPG PoC denial of service exploit

Actually, this is not a jpg file. Although the exploit image is named as .jpg, its format is consistent with the windows metafile format, not the jpeg. It is already well known that there are unpatched bugs in wmf file processing in Windows which can crash the viewing application.

The same goes for recently published 'MS Windows Explorer.exe Gif Image Denial of Service Exploit'.
