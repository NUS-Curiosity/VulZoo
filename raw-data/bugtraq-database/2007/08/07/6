er, spoke too soon. It actually just presents a dialog box that doesn't let you
choose an option (to continue logging in or not). What I was seeing was firefox
not letting me do anything until I chose one of the non-existent options.
Killing the dialog box makes the firefox session resume normally. Apparently
this dialog-issue was fixed in trunk (for 3.x) but not in 2.x.

Thanks to Adam Guthrie from Mozilla for helping figure that one out.
