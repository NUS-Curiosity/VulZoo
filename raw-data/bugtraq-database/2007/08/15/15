thanks for your suggestion. No, I didn't try this, because the servers
containing the DRAC4 cards are in productive use and I don't want to
enlarge downtimes. As in the advisory already described, the vendor seems
to be able to reproduce the issue.

I'm sorry, but for the moment I'm unable to do so anyway, because of the
new paragraph/law of combat of computer crime rate here in Germany. First
I would have to contact a lawyer to make sure, that these actions aren't
criminal at all.


With kind regards

Robert Scheck
