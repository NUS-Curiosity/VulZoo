Subject: Announcement: Releasing CORE GRASP for PHP. An open source, dynamic
 web application protection system.

Moderator note: this copy of the post has a corrected URL.

CORE GRASP for PHP is a web-application protection software aimed at
detecting and blocking injection vulnerabilities and privacy violations.
As mentioned during its presentation at Black Hat USA 2007, GRASP is
being released as open source under the Apache 2.0 license and can be
obtained from http://grasp.coresecurity.com/.

The present implementation protects PHP 5.2.3 against SQL-injection
attacks for the MySQL engine, it can be installed with almost the same
effort as the PHP engine, both in Unix and Windows systems, and
protection is immediate with any PHP web application running in the
protected server.

CORE GRASP works by enhancing the PHP execution engine (VM) to permit
byte-level taint tracking and analysis for all the user-controlled or
otherwise untrustable variables of the web application. Tainted bytes
are then tracked and their taint marks propagated throughout the web
application's runtime. Whenever the web application tries to interact
with an DB backend using SQL statements that contain tainted bytes,
GRASP analyzes the statment and detects and prevents attacks or abnormal
actions.

CORE GRASP was developed by CoreLabs, the research unit of Core Security
Technologies. At CoreLabs, we plan to improve the tool and include new
protections shortly. However, the invitation to collaborate with the
project is open. If you would like to collaborate, please go to the
GRASP website and subscribe to our mailing list.
