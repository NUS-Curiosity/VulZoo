Subject: Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities in Lotus Notes Client

Local Privilege Escalation Through Default ntmulti.exe File Permissions

Unprivileged users can execute arbitrary programs that run with the privileges of the LocalSystem account by replacing the Multi-user Cleanup Service executable with arbitrary executables. This vulnerability exists because the default file permissions assigned during installation to ntmulti.exe (the executable for the Multi-user Cleanup Service) allow unprivileged, interactive
users to replace ntmulti.exe with any file.

Because the Multi-user Cleanup Service is a Windows service running with LocalSystem privileges, unprivileged users can easily elevate their privileges.
