I don't know of a good solution to stupid laws.  My impulse is to 
encourage security companies to boycott such governments.  Don't sell (or 
give) them products and services.  (Tell them that you are afraid of 
violating their laws. A valid concern.)  Maybe they will get the hint 
after the 42th successful hack/virus/whatever.

Of course, this will not work.  As seen in the US, there are plenty of 
people who will do anything for money, no matter who it hurts, including 
themselves or the industry they work in.

The US has also gone after people revealing vulnerabilities.  "Killing the 
messenger" is a popular pasttime world wide.
