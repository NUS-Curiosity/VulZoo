Description:
    Previous versions of the tar package are vulnerable to an attack in
    which unpacking an intentionally-malformed tar archive can overwrite
    arbitrary files to which the user running tar has write access.  If the
    attacking user knows the name of a vulnerable binary file and overwrites
    it, this allows the attacker to place arbitrary code on the system which
    is likely to be run.  If root is running tar, this includes any file on
    the system, which would elevate this to an indirect non-deterministic
    remote root unauthorized access vulnerability.
