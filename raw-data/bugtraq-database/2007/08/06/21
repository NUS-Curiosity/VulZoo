Risk Level:
High - Server compromise

Program Summary:
 From the site: http://www.ezphotosales.com
EZPhotoSales is the perfect solution for the photographer who already 
has a website and can't stand the idea of paying high commissions to 
online gallery hosts to provide easy online ordering for customers.

EZPhotoSales is a set of files that runs on your own website and 
automatically generates visually pleasing galleries where your customers 
can order prints and specialty items at your prices.

Details:
Details are presented at 
http://www.informit.com/guides/content.asp?g=security&seqNum=267 and 
http://www.informit.com/guides/content.asp?g=security&seqNum=268

In summary, through a series of vulnerabilities, the administrative 
backend and protected portions of the application can be accessed. From 
here permament code can be added to each page of the application, 
resulting in a permament cross-site scripting attack. In addition, due 
to a lack of file type filtering, PHP scripts can be uploaded to the 
server.

Workaround:
Password protect the galleries.txt and config.dat files of the program.

Vendor Response:
No plans to fix program. Replacement program to be released in future. 
Upgrade options will be available.
