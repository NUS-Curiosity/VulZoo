Subject: RE: VMWare poor guest isolation design

Arthur,
Perhaps there are implementations in certain businesses that require
those things. It is possible you may not be the only person with that
level of access, particularly in a large environment with 50 or so DA's,
and 10's of 1000's of users, with dozens or hundreds of VM's...

Looked at in the perspective that you don't *own* the hardware and the
VM's on them, would that alter your answer at all?

I don't see this as a serious problem.  This is the virtual equivalent
of no
physical security.  If the host OS (or an account within it) is
compromised,
of course all bets are off when it comes to a virtual machine running
within
it.

Furthermore, this attack only works if you are running the vmware guest
utilities *and* you are currently logged into a GUI desktop running the
vmware userland process.

I personally look at this as an issue for Windows.  I personally don't
install the vmware guest software for my Linux VMs, nor would I log into
a
GUI as root.  For that matter, if you are merely hosting the guest VMs
why
would you need to ever use the vmware console after installation?  Use a
network-based access method, making the need for the vmware guest
utilities
unnecessary.  That should be sufficient for all OS'es.

In (not so) short, this attack vector is virtually worthless if
reasonable
security practices are employed.
