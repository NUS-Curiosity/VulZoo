Subject: Astaro DOS and POP3 bypass issues partially resolved

http://www.hescominsoon.com/archives/773

I mentioned earlier about a DOS issue and a pop3 bypass issue.  There is 
a fix now.  Make a backup of your configuration and have the system 
e-mail it to you.  Reload the box with the latest 7.006 ISO and then 
restore the backup.  That resolves the pfilter-repoter DOs issue.  The 
pop3 bypass issue is still out there.

My "Foundation" verse:
Isa 54:17  No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and 
every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt 
condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their 
righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.
