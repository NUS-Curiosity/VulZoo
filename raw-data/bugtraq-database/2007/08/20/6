Synopsis
========

A directory traversal vulnerability has been discovered in Apache
mod_jk.

Background
==========

Apache mod_jk is a connector for the Tomcat web server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apache/mod_jk      < 1.2.23                         >= 1.2.23

Description
===========

Apache mod_jk decodes the URL within Apache before passing them to
Tomcat, which decodes them a second time.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could browse a specially crafted URL on an Apache
server running mod_jk, possibly gaining access to restricted resources.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Apache mod_jk users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apache/mod_jk-1.2.23"
