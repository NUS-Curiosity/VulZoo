Subject: RE: Skype Network Remote DoS Exploit

Apologies if someone already posted the obvious question but:

How come this Patch Tuesday was different for Skype? 

Why didn't the last Patch Tuesday, which had the same rebooting
requirements as any other Patch Tuesday, cause the same problem with
Skype? What was different about this Patch Tuesday? Anyone seen Skype
give an explanation of that yet, as I'm assuming someone already asked
that question, hopefully.
