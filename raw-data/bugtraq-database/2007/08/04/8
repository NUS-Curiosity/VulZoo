After travelling the world to attend many excellent security conferences 
with our compatriots, we decided it was time to pull finger and organise 
one in Aotearoa, New Zealand.

This is the call for presenters for the inaugural Kiwicon.

[WTF?]

Kiwicon '07 will be a largely informal conference, organised by the 
security community for the security community. It will be held in 
Wellington, New Zealand, on the weekend of the 17th and 18th of 
November, 2007.

It will focus on sharing information; ideas, code, and catching up with 
other like-minded people from around New Zealand (and further abroad).

[Venue]

Our hosts for the weekend will be Victoria University of Wellington.

This location has the advantage of being close to cheap accommodation 
and, more importantly, several good pubs. Details will be provided 
closer to the conference date.

[Costs]

Kiwicon '07 is a non-profit event.

Attendance for the entire weekend will cost $50 for employed individuals 
(self-employed and salaried). There is a discounted rate of $30 for 
students and the unemployed.

Please do note that there are several good pubs in close proximity. We 
anticipate the total cost of the weekend in money and dignity may be higher.

[Topics]

Suggested topics include but are not limited to:

     - Information Warfare / Industrial Espionage
     - Satellite Hacking
     - Echelon - Waihopai & Tangimoana
     - Lockpicking / Wiretapping / Bugs

We do not plan on having pre-determined time slots for presentations. If 
your talk is only 20 minutes long, then you will only be talking for 20 
minutes. The goal of the weekend is to share useful information - this 
means flexible time limits.

We already have a number of excellent speakers confirmed, to get a slot
