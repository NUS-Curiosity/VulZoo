Subject: ContentDM Search.php XSS Vulnerability

ContentDM has a XSS vulnerability.
Many .gov sites run this software.
CDM fails to block special charachters etc so by searching for <script>alert('XSS');</script> We can make a popup saying XSS.
An attacker could steal cookies, redirect the page etc.

Date Released: 3rd August 2007
Vendor has been contacted.
