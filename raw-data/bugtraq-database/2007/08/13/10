Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in the Xfce Terminal program,
allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Xfce Terminal is a console tool for the Xfce desktop environment.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /    Vulnerable    /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  xfce-extra/terminal     < 0.2.6_p25931            >= 0.2.6_p25931

Description
===========

Lasse Karkkainen discovered that the function terminal_helper_execute()
in file terminal-helper.c does not properly escape the URIs before
processing.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted link,
possibly leading to the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Xfce Terminal. Note that the exploit
code depends on the browser used to open the crafted link.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Xfce Terminal users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
