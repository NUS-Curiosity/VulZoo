Introduction
============
eXV2.de CMS is a Content Management System.

More Details
============
1. Cross Site Scripting:
Input passed directly to the "set_lang" parameter in the Browser Cookie is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
A user can sent a cookie to himself with ?/set_lang=deutsch and edit it.  
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Workaround: [Cross Site Scripting]
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.


Example:

$my_Cookie_Vars =  $_COOKIE;

if (isset($my_Cookie_Vars['set_lang'])){
    if (($my_Cookie_Vars['set_lang'] == "deutsch")||($my_Cookie_Vars['set_lang'] == "english")||($my_Cookie_Vars['set_lang'] == "french")) {                       
        }  else {
            $abuse = true;
            $xoopsConfig['language'] = $xoopsConfig['default_language'];                 
        }    
}   


if ($abuse){
    die("The desired action could not be performed.");
}
