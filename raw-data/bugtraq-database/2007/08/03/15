I believe RaeD meant no offense and did was in fact not aware of the 
previous findings. In the past SecuriTeam helped him out with 
disclosure and his findings were on the moeny.

I think:
1. This is either yet another exploit.
2. An honest mistake.

But I am not RaeD not affiliated with him. Give people the benefit of the 
doubt. Who would steal thi sbluntly only to be found out?

Thanks.
