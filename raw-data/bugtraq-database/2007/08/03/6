Subject: Re: TS-2007-001-0: BlueCat Networks Adonis Linux-HA heartbeat DoS
 Vulnerability

In response to this security advisory, BlueCat would like to post the following:

BlueCat acknowledges the existence of this issue and our testing indicates that a temporary outage may result from this Denial of Service attack.  System monitoring tools will alert the Adonis administrator of this issue immediately so that normal service can be reestablished with minimal impact.  We have confirmed that there is no persistent damage to the system as a result of this attack and the attack will not compromise any settings or information on the Adonis systems.

BlueCat is taking the following steps to address this issue:
1. Release a patch that will modify the firewall rules to restrict all traffic on port 694 to the cluster partner. The patch should be available later today - Friday, August 3rd. 

2. Update the version of the Heartbeat software to address this issue permanently.  This patch will be made available later this month.

To reduce the risk of this DoS attack, BlueCat recommends that customers check their firewall/router settings to ensure that UDP port 694 is closed. Since HA cluster partners must operate on the same subnet, there is no reason that any traffic on this port is required except between the cluster partners themselves.

For any BlueCat customer that wishes to obtain the patch, or seek more information on the matter, please feel free to contact BlueCat Network's Customer Care at 1.866.491.2228.


Kindest regards,
Branko Miskov
Director of Product Management
BlueCat Networks Inc.
