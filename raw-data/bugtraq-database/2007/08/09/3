Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in libarchive (formerly named as
app-archive/bsdtar), possibly allowing for the execution of arbitrary
code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

libarchive is a library for manipulating different streaming archive
formats, including certain tar variants, several cpio formats, and both
BSD and GNU ar variants.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/libarchive       < 2.2.4                        >= 2.2.4

Description
===========

CPNI, CERT-FI, Tim Kientzle, and Colin Percival reported a buffer
overflow (CVE-2007-3641), an infinite loop (CVE-2007-3644), and a NULL
pointer dereference (CVE-2007-3645) within the processing of archives
having corrupted PaX extension headers.

Impact
======

An attacker can trick a user or automated system to process an archive
with malformed PaX extension headers into execute arbitrary code, crash
an application using the library, or cause a high CPU load.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libarchive or bsdtar users should upgrade to the latest libarchive
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/libarchive-2.2.4"
