Summercon is the oldest of the hacker cons. It has been hosted insuch fine cities as St. Louis, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and Amsterdam. The con audience is a wide mix from security professionals, military officals, socialists, hackers, parents, artists, etc... It is a social event with presentations to help get the conversations started. There is little attitude, lots to learn, and plenty of fun at Summercon; all in the name of hacking. 

Summercon is FREE this year! Pease buy a t-shirt to support the organizer's efforts.
