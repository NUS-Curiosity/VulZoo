Dear "xyborg",

As far as I remember this particular issue's description 
(the one I had sent) didn't involve any URL bar spoofing 
information (this was generally all about the notion of
'security'-related confusement I was playing with). 

But, nevertheless, thank you for reminding me ;)


Cheers,

mb
