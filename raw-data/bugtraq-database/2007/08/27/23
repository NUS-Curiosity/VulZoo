Subject: Re: n.runs-SA-2007.027 - Sophos Antivirus UPX parsing Arbitrary CodeExecution
 Advisory

Hi 3APA3A,

It was a mistake in the advisory,
It should say:

"Integer cast around in UPX packed files parsing"

I ask for apologies for the mistake.
Unfortunately we can't give more details about the vulnerability because
the German Law (ยง202)

Cheers,
  Sergio
