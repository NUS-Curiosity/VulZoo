Your position seems to be that an easy automated scripting interface is a 
lot more dangerous than a slightly harder indirect attack method. The 
truth is that they are both scriptable and reliable.  Techniques for 
attacking virtual machines from the host are certainly no harder to code 
than the average remote exploit that worms used to propogate.  Do you 
really think a worm writer who wants to compromise VMWare guests would 
take advantage of a scripting interface but shy away from the task if he 
had to write custom code to break into the guest?

Here's a best practice:  Don't assume that guests are protected from 
software running on the host system.

A (virtual) machine where attackers can arbitrarily read and write
the memory, the disk and even alter devices is going to be a soft target.

The physical analogy that someone brought up earlier works well here.
Would you consider your machine locked down if someone could open
your computer case, yank the hard drive and attach new devices to the
system at will?  Well, with a virtual machine they can do that while
the machine is running.
