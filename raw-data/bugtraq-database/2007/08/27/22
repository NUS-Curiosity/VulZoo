Subject: Community input/questions for ISOI 3?

Hi, like last time, we are looking for community input and questions for the 
Internet security operations community, to be discussed during ISOI 3.

ISOI is happening this Monday and Tuesday, we will likely compile the responses 
in a few weeks.

We will reply to people personally on issues which bother them, and compile a 
short text with answers to the community itself.

We tried to do this last time around, and encountered a problem with 
classifying which material the presenters allow for public consumtion, and 
which is to remain private due to obvious concerns.

This time around we ask them ahead of time.

The current topics being discussed at ISOI 3 can be located on the schedule:
http://isotf.org/isoi3.html

We may be off though, so feel free to ask on any issue which you find to be
relevant.

Thanks, we appreciate the community's participation.

 	Gadi.
