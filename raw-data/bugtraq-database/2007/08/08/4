Cisco Response
==============

This is the Cisco PSIRT response to an issue discovered and reported
to Cisco by Roger Jefferiss and Rob Pope of SecureTest Ltd, UK
regarding cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cisco Unified
MeetingPlace Web Conferencing. 

The original report is available at the following link: 
http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2007-August/065134.
html

We greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with researchers on
security vulnerabilities, and welcome the opportunity to review and
assist in product reports.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsi33940.

Additional Information
======================

Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing (MP) provides real-time
collaboration functionality to an organization's intranet and
extranet, and integrates Cisco Unified MeetingPlace with a web
server, thus providing users with a browser-based interface. Web
Conferencing enables users to schedule and attend conferences,
access meeting materials, and collaborate on documents from common
web browsers.

Success Template (STPL) and Failure Template (FTPL) parameters are
used to specify the return template of a user request.  These
should correspond to an actual template file that resides on the
MP server's file system. 

When MP servers running software versions 5.3.235.0 and earlier
receive invalid input for the STPL or FTPL parameters, they return
a HTML error template page.  The returned HTML page contains the
original inputted URL. 

When this reflected XSS vulnerability is exploited, malicious code
or a script is embedded within the URL and associated with either
the STPL or FTPL parameter. The malicious code is usually in the
form of a script embedded in the URL of a link or the code may be
stored on the vulnerable server or malicious website.  An 
unsuspecting user is enticed to follow a malicious link to a 
vulnerable MP server that injects (reflects) the malicious code
back to the user's browser as the MP server does not have the 
requested template file associated with the STPL or FTPL
parameter.  Therefore, the MP server responds with the template
used for error pages, which includes the requested URL with the
malicious code, thus causing the target user's browser to execute
it.

Software versions 5.3.333.0 and later of Cisco Unified MeetingPlace
Web Conferencing will return a XML message with an embedded error
code when receiving invalid input for the STPL and FTPL
parameters.  The error message is properly and securely formatted
per the XML CDATA specification.

All 5.4 and 6.0 versions of Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web
Conferencing are unaffected by this vulnerability.

To determine the software version of a Cisco Unified MeetingPlace
Web Conferencing server, access the MP server home page via a HTTP
session; the version information is provided at the bottom of the
home page.  The following output shows an example of the text
viewable when accessing the home page of a MeetingPlace Web
Conferencing server running software version 5.3.447.4:

Version: 5.3.447.4

Workarounds
===========

There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
