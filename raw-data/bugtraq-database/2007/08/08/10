Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Macromedia Flash
Player, allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The Macromedia Flash Player is a renderer for the popular SWF file type
which is commonly used to provide interactive websites, digital
experiences and mobile content.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/netscape-flash     < 9.0.48.0                 >= 9.0.48.0

Description
===========

Mark Hills discovered some errors when interacting with a browser for
keystrokes handling (CVE-2007-2022). Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon
from Minded Security discovered a boundary error when processing FLV
files (CVE-2007-3456). An input validation error when processing HTTP
referrers has also been reported (CVE-2007-3457).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user running the Macromedia Flash Player, or sensitive data
access.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Macromedia Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/netscape-flash-9.0.48.0"
