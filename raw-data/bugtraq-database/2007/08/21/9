Subject: RE: SYMSA-2007-007: Palm OS Treo Smartphone Denial of Service

 
	When I tested this on my Treo over Verizon's network, only one
packet with the prescribed parameters was needed to force a soft reset
of my phone rather than the flood described in CVE-2003-0293. When I
notified Verizon of this, they were completely unaware of this
vulnerability -- well, at least their help desk people were. I'm hoping
they'll take steps to filter this kind of traffic on their network.
	On a side note, when I was testing this vulnerability, I tried
varying the size of the ICMP packet. Strangely enough, I got no response
if the packet was of size 1469 bytes, or 1471 bytes. There must be
something special about 1470 byte ICMP packets. Anyone have any ideas?

Hi.  Is this fundamentally different than the previously reported PalmOS

ICMP denial of service bug (CVE-2003-0293)?

Thanks,

Stuart
