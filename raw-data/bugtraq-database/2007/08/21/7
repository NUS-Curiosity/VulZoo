Subject: Re: Re: SYMSA-2007-007: Palm OS Treo Smartphone Denial of Service

SYMSA-2007-007 seems to be strictly targeted at the latest Palm equipped Treo Smartphones where as CVE-2003-0293 is focused on Palm Pilots released as of 2003. Also, the exploit code provided in CVE-2003-0293 does not match the packet size that is referenced in SYMSA-2007-007.
