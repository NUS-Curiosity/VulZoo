I've no insight at all into this issue beyond what's been publicly  
disseminated, but it's important to note that the Skype folks  
explicitly stated that there was some sort of flaw in their P2P  
communications mechanisms which led to the outage, FWIW.

AFAIK, Sype didn't blame Microsoft - they blamed a code flaw on their  
part and stated that the coincidence of lots of reboots associated  
with the most recent Microsoft updates exposed the Skype code flaw  
(again, I've no insight into this matter beyond what Skype have  
publicly stated).
