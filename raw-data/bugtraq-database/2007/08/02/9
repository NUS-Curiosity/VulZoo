Risk Level:
High - Disclosure of sensitive information

Program Summary:
 From the website: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minimo/

Minimo uses Mozilla Technologies to produce a highly usable web browser 
for advanced mobile devices. Features include:
* Fast access to your mobile content via Homebase start page
* Best support for modern web standards (Javascript and AJAX).
* Social Bookmarking
* Tab browsing
* RSS Support
* Proven security (TLS, SSL3)
* International support
* Cross platform capability
* Widget and Extension support

Vulnerability Details:
Minimo includes a password manager feature that allows users to store 
user/password information of sites they visit. There are two ways this 
feature can be abused. First, the action of any form can be changed 
dynamically via JavaScript, which could be introduced into a site via a 
cross-site scripting (XSS)bug. Second, the form fields can be 
automatically filled in without user interaction. As a result, a XSS bug 
could allow an attacker to inject an invisible form into a victims 
browser that could collect the user/pass without any interaction or 
visible indication.

Note: The Password Manager bug is often misunderstood for how it work. 
The reason is that there are numerous subtle variations on how the 
username and password show up. The following highlights some of these:

1. If there is only one username stored in the password manager for the 
specific, it will automatically show up in the username field. If there 
is more than one username stored in the Password Manager, a user would 
normally type in or select the specific username for the site, which 
then allows Minimo/Firefox to fill in the password. As a result, an 
attacker would have to know the username to successfully grab the 
credentials.

2. If the password field is named 'password' and there is only one 
username associated with the site, the Password Manager will 
automatically fill in both the user and password. This particular 
version was noticed by 
http://www.heise-security.co.uk/services/browsercheck/demos/moz/pass1.shtml. 


Similar Firefox bugs has been known about since mid-2006; however, 
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=360493#c44 indicates these 
are supposedly resolved.

The details and vulnerable status of Minimo .2 and below is new.

Proof of Concept

The following webpage provides a link to two pages. The login.php page 
is just a sample form that you can enter a user/pass into. Enter and 
save some sample info and then click on the second poc.htm link. This 
will open a page with a script inside that dynamically creates a framed 
environment, one of which is essentially hidden (note: using 
style:hidden will not work). In the hidden frame, the login.php page is 
loaded, the action is changed, and the user/pass are tickled into the 
form fields. You should see two popups - one with the changed form 
action, and the other with the stored user & pass variables.
