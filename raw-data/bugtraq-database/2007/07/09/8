The reports at the official website (www.eleytt.com) are going to be soon available. 

Firefox's issue does actually concern the 
situation you mentioned (as far as I know 
there are various other examples of this, as I said, this is just an exemplary code). FLV file handling issue in Windows Media Classic is different from the one that I have reported some time ago. Vulnerabilities in Symantec's products are going to join the advisory section soon.
