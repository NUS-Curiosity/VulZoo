Subject Name:            bind
Subject Summary:         DNS Server
Subject Home:            http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/
Subject Versions:        9.* <= 9.4.1-P1

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2007-2925, CVE-2007-2926
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           privilege escalation

Description:
    As confirmed [0] by the vendor, two vulnerabilities exist in the DNS
    server BIND [1]:
    
    1. The default access control lists (acls) are not being correctly
    set. If not set anyone can make recursive queries and/or query the
    cache contents.
    
    2. The DNS query id generation is vulnerable to cryptographic
    analysis which provides a 1 in 8 chance of guessing the next query
    id for 50% of the query ids. This can be used to perform cache
    poisoning by an attacker. This bug only affects outgoing queries,
    generated by BIND 9 to answer questions as a resolver, or when it is
    looking up data for internal uses, such as when sending NOTIFYs to
    slave name servers.
