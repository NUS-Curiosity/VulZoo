That article does not deal with attacks on BIND's PRNG.

As far as I can tell, Joe Stewart extended Zalewski's TCP sequence
number analysis to BIND's transaction IDs - however I don't think
Stewart's paper "DNS Cache Poisoning â€“ The Next Generation" (
www.lurhq.com/dnscache.pdf ) goes as far as the recent BIND advisory
here - http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/bind-security.php:

"The DNS query id generation is vulnerable to cryptographic analysis
which provides a 1 in 8 chance of guessing the next query id for 50%
of the query ids. This can be used to perform cache poisoning by an
attacker."

I don't think that Amit's attack has been described before.

cheers,
 Jamie
