Subject: Re: Mozilla protocol abuse

Since I published this report it has come to my attention that 
Thunderbird 1.5, unlike Thunderbird 2.0, has not been patched with the 
"osint" security flag. As such all Thunderbird 1.5 users are vulnerable 
against this attack and those exploits. Now would be a good time to 
upgrade to Thunderbird 2.0.
