I reserve the word 0day to issues that have been found through exploits.

So a 0day exploit is an exploit out in the field were the vulnerability 
is/was not publicly known before the exploit was found.

As such it would be a very rough indication of the score of good guys 
(writing advisories) and the bad guys (writing exploits).
