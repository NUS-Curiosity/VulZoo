PR07-19: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) / HTML injection on Webbler CMS admin login page (2)

This advisory has been published following consultation with UK CPNI (formerly known as NISCC) 

Date Found: 14th June 2007


Successfully tested on: Webbler CMS version 3.1.3. Earlier versions are possibly affected as well.

Note: the version number is usually included within 'meta' HTML tags and 'X-Powered-By' HTTP response headers. i.e.:

<meta name="generator" content="webbler 3.1.3 - http://tincan.co.uk/webbler" />

X-Powered-By: webbler version 3.1.3 


Description:

Webbler CMS is vulnerable to XSS within the " /uploader/index.php" server-side script and 'login' parameter.

No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

Consequences:

An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code in the browser of a user who clicks on a link to a site generated/managed by Webbler CMS. HTML tags can also be injected.

This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the target site, or the redirection of confidential information to unauthorised third parties.

	
Proof of concept:

This vulnerability can only be exploited as a POST request, so the attacker must convince the victim to visit a third-party site which causes the victim's browser to submit the POST XSS request to the vulnerable site. This can be accomplished through a hidden '<form>' with a 'method="post"' attribute.


The following curl command can be used to test if a site is vulnerable:

curl -s "http://target-domain.com/uploader/?" -d "login=\"><script>alert(\"XSS\")</SCRIPT>&password=test&processlogin=Enter&forgotpassword="
