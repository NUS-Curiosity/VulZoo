PR07-20: Webroot disclosure on Webbler CMS

This advisory has been published following consultation with UK CPNI (formerly known as NISCC)

Date Found: 14th June 2007


Successfully tested on: Webbler CMS version 3.1.3. Earlier versions are possibly affected as well.

Note: the version number is usually included within 'meta' HTML tags and 'X-Powered-By' HTTP response headers. i.e.:

<meta name="generator" content="webbler 3.1.3 - http://tincan.co.uk/webbler" />

X-Powered-By: webbler version 3.1.3 


Description:

Sites that are generated/managed through Webbler CMS disclose the webroot within HTML comments. i.e.:

<!-- /var/webbler_cache/www.target-domain.com/13697/index.php--><!-- lid:  -->


Consequences:

A remote attacker could recover information with regards to the target site's directory structure. 

This kind of information can be useful for attackers in certain scenarios. i.e.: when attempting to exploit file retrieval vulnerabilities.
