I think there is still hope for us buddy, at least when professionals make 
releases.
For example, instead of saying I'm being pedantic on this (which I am), 
you could (also, in addition) reply and say "yep" or "nope", thus 
contributing to some discussion. Meaning, we would either make a stand for 
our profession or at the very least get educated as we go along.

Some people believe the way to reach a "mature industry" is time, others 
believe it's training or in a more specific fashion, certifications. I 
don't know what the answer is, and I am sure it isn't terminology (or 
certifications, hehe).

I do know though, what a 0day is, and don't intend to compromise it for 
the sake of what the press makes of it. It's a strong term and concept 
which shouldn't be abused. That or we can decide on a new term for what 
0day used to mean. How about "blubla"?

>From professionals, we can expect good language and for their work to 
speak for them. We shouldn't compromise on silly things like what 0day 
means.

Maybe I will give this up next year, but for now, advisories named "0day" 
have disapeared lately. Maybe peer pressure does have some effect.

The above is over-thinking and some could consider it very silly, but for 
now, I believe in it. It's just like I resent those among consultants who 
conduct themselves in a fashion that makes me ashamed of my profession, as 
a far-off analogy.
