"Discovred" as in "found in a web page with some dodgy script in it"?  
This exploit (though not in this precise form) is common as muck in 
them thar int-duh-net tubes at the moment... 

You can't mean "discovered" as in "first found through unique personal 
research/investigation/etc" as this exploit has been publicly disclosed 
since April 2006, I think (and privately used previously?):

and again, in a more elaborate "multiple dodgy ActiveX control target" 
version shortly thereafter:

Oh, and did I mention patched since 11 April 2006:

So probably not that effective if what you want is an assured "fire an 
forget" remote IE exploit...
