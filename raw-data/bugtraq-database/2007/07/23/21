RE: 10. ActiveReportsExcelReport EXCLEXPT.DLL Library Denial of Service

We have found this thread and have not been able to isolate the problem with the description provided. This information should be reported to Data Dynamics directly with steps on how to reproduce the DoS. We would like to fix this problem, but need to understand it first. 

Please provide any additional information here: http://www.datadynamics.com/forums/8/ShowForum.aspx

Thank you,
