                    Development Team" in the loop.
  2007/07/05        Norman's "Head of Engine Development Team" replays 
                    that The OLE2 issues should be resolved with the 
                    latest scanner engine (5.91.02) and that the 
                    decompression issues, the crash cases will be

                    n.runs RFP
  2007/07/10        Norman replays the following:

"Sergio,

We have discussed your mail.  It is not our company's policy 
to publish information about vulnerabilities or bugs in our 
software, unless they are extremely critical and/or can be 
worked around by the end-user.  There are usually a large 
number of vulnerabilities/bugs in any software, and in our 
opinion it would only serve to unsettle user confidence in the 
products if the industry continually feeds information about 
such weaknesses, and we don't see that it would give the user 
any benefit in return. 

Instead we feel that it should be the supplier's 
responsibility to correct any errors and weaknesses and have 
them released to the user fast and silently, without alerting 
also the malware industry.

Hence, there is no forum where we can credit you for your 
findings.

We sincerely appreciate that you notify us whenever you find a 
vulnerability in our software, as we appreciate such 
information from other sources.  These findings, in addition 
to bug reports, are continuously being reviewed with respect 
to seriousness and work involved in fixing the problems, and 
assigned priorities accordingly, but no estimated dates for 
fixing the issues are published.

This has always been - and presently is - our company's 
policy.  This policy may of course be revised by company 
management at any time, if deemed necessary or useful."

  2007/07/11        n.runs replays that when they request the PoC files 
                    they implicitly accepted n.runs RFP and that the last 
                    mail was violating n.runs RFP and request a soon 
                    replay, otherwise the advisories would have to be 
                    release uncoordinated.
  2007/07/23        Norman DID NOT replay
  2007/07/23        n.runs assumes that Norman finalized their 
                    communication with n.runs
  2007/07/23        Advisories release
