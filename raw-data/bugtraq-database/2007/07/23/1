I've just noticed this, when you use Opera internal Source code viewer, it 
fails to display the whole html code if the page contains a NULL (0x00) 
char. Its not a big deal, but it can be abussed to hide evil javascript 
code for Opera users. I've just tested this in Opera for Windows. :] :] I 
leave a test of concept down :] "

On Linux it works too...

What is interesting, Opera fix this few months ago and now they again 
add this "future" to the software ;]
