Subject: Announce: RFIDIOt PC/SC support - new release 0.1p (July 2007)

Folks,

I'm pleased to announce that I've finally got around to releasing PC/SC 
support for RFIDIOt. This means you can use lower cost reader/writers 
that are also much easier to find (although at the moment there are 
limitations as to what you can do with them, so they are not a complete 
alternative).

So far I've only tested the Omnikey Cardman 5321, which is a 13.56MHz 
device, and am able to access things like e-passports, Mifare cards and 
ISO 15693 (commonly used in ticketing and hotel doors etc.).

No doubt there are some simple tweaks that would enable more of the 
other test programs to work but I felt there was enough here to get 
people started so didn't want to delay the release any further...

Full list of changes in this release:

v0.p
   add PCSC support (http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ and 
http://pyscard.sourceforge.net/) [hints/tips/inspiration Henryk Pl√∂tz]
   fix cardselect.py and multiselect.py to check for presence of card
   fix 'waitfor/do nothing' in RFIDIOt.py [Philippe Biondi]
   cleaner check digit calc in mrpkey.py [Philippe Biondi]
   change -r to -R (reader type) to allow -r to be used for PCSC 
compatibility
   add speed/framesize reporting to mrpkey.py
   increase MAX read chunk size to 118 in mrpkey.py (needs fixing to go 
up to device supported size ISO_FRAMESIZE)
   fix bit allignment issue in FDXBID encoding/decoding [Matsche]
   add global uid variable
   add locked block reporting to readmifare
   add readmifaresimple.py

enjoy,
Adam
