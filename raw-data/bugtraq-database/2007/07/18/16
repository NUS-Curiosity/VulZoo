With regards to your last statement, I would like to believe that that's 
so, or at least that if there is some harm in "early release" of 
information that that harm is mitigated (if not outright outweighed) by 
the potential good that's done by alerting the community and thereby 
allowing them to develop their own responses.

I guess what we're really talking about here is the perceived potential 
negative impact of letting the bad guys know that a vulnerability exists 
in space X (that they might then attempt to exploit where without that 
knowledge, they wouldn't try to exploit it even if it could be argued that 
they would attempt to find it) vs. the perceived potential good of 
allowing the good guys to attempt to formulate their own defenses 
tangential to some sort of "official" response.

It seems to me that without metrics (how many early release advisories 
turned into exploits that wouldn't have been created without said 
advisory?) that all discussion on this topic is either philosophical or 
academic (which is not to imply "without merit").

I, for one, enjoyed your rant.
