Hi,

What exactly constitutes a 0day? From my perspective naming a
vulnerability 0day have absolutely no value whatsoever, it just doesn't
make any sense. 0day for who? The person who release it, sure, but for
the security community as a whole... nah.

I'm also personally starting to question the whole idea behind public
disclosure and advisories. Do they actually mean anything these days?
What good is it to know about a vulnerability that was "discovered" 6
months ago? The important thing is to know what can be done BEFORE the
patch has been released.

Also a big portion of "advisories" seem to be related to the most
obscure softwares and home made PHP applications that most of us never
even care about anyway. These advisories clutter the ones that have even
 the slightest validity.

One more thing about "advisories". I think it would be better to release
them immediately and let people know what they are facing. With public
dissemination of a vulnerability perhaps someone will release a 3rd
party patch or another inventive way of protecting oneself. Holding it
"secret" really doesn't help anyone. If anything it prevents people from
 trying to find a way to fix the vulnerability.

Michael Zalewski is in my opinion someone who is using the bug-traq list
in a way that is meaningful. He brings up topics for discussion that
concern us all. More people should do that.

Anyways, enough ranting.

/ Chris
