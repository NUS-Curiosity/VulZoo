Perhaps. Even so, adding, as you (and many others) suggested previously, 
UDP source port (strong) randomization, in combination with strong 
transaction ID randomization would make poisoning way way harder than 
where it is today. Instead of 16 bits, you'd have ~30 bits of (strong) 
randomness. That's much better, and there's no reason I see why it can't 
be implemented today.
