Subject: Re: Retrieving "deleted" sms/mms from Nokia phone (Symbian S60)

While developing Noki(a Nokia .nbu file explorer at http://nokisms.googlepages.com), I did test a lot of backup files of different Nokia phones' and didn't find any hint of deleted sms entries. This might be only available for certain phone models(and pc suite ). As I know N-Gage uss a special version of Nokia pc suite - that might make some difference.
