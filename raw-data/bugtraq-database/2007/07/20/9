Yes, ideally if someone with a bit of community credibility could step
up and propose a standard that certainly would kick start it a little bit.

Another great benefit of such a template would be consistency in layout
and contents. Also to improve the educational value of an advisory it
would be neat if an appropriate code-segment of the vulnerability could
be included. Now people will argue the whole intellectual property
aspect but I seriously doubt that 3-5 lines of code are going to affect
anything.

Let's do something about this!
