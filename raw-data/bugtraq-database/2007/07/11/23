This is exploitable (and tested) against IIS 5/5.1 (IIS6/7 are not
vulnerable)
However, potentially other web servers are also vulnerable if they are
capable of decoding alternate unicode characters.

I also agree with you, blaming an IPS for not detecting attack which is
impossible in the wild would be very pointless.
Although IIS 5 is old, it is still relatively common.

Any further questions, feel free to ask.

Can  you,  please, provide example of such server? Fatih Ozavci reported
similar   problem   with  Checkpoint  and  Halfwidth/Fullwidth  Unicode,
potential  attack  vector  was IIS with .Net framework, in this case IIS
seems not to be exploitable.

Blaming IPS it does not detect attack which is impossible in-the-wild is
nonsense. Blaming corporate-level IPS doesn't detect attack against SOHO
web server is acceptable nonsense :)
