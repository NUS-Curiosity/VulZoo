Summary
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM), formerly CallManager,
contains two overflow vulnerabilities that could allow a remote,
unauthenticated user to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or
execute arbitrary code.

A workaround exists for one of the vulnerabilities.

Cisco has made free software available to address these
vulnerabilities for affected customers.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070711-cucm.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Note: Cisco Unified CallManager versions 4.2, 4.3, 5.1 and 6.0 have
been renamed as Cisco Unified Communications Manager. CUCM versions
3.3, 4.0, 4.1 and 5.0 retain the Cisco Unified CallManager name.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 6.0 and Cisco
CallManager Express are not affected by these vulnerabilities. No
other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM), formerly CallManager, is
the call processing component of the Cisco IP telephony solution that
extends enterprise telephony features and functions to packet
telephony network devices, such as IP phones, media processing
devices, voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateways, and multimedia applications.

  * CTL Provider Service Overflow
    The Certificate Trust List (CTL) Provider service of CUCM
    contains a heap overflow vulnerability that could allow a remote,
    unauthenticated user to cause a DoS condition or execute
    arbitrary code. The CTL Provider service listens on TCP port 2444
    by default, but the port is user-configurable. This vulnerability
    is corrected in CUCM versions 4.1(3)SR5, 4.2(3)SR2, 4.3(1)SR1 and
    5.1(2). CUCM 3.x versions are not affected by this vulnerability.
    This issue is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsi03042.
  * RIS Data Collector Heap Overflow
    The Real-Time Information Server (RIS) Data Collector service of
    CUCM contains a heap overflow vulnerability that could allow a
    remote, unauthenticated user to cause a DoS condition or execute
    arbitrary code. The RIS Data Collector process listens on TCP
    port 2556 by default, but the port is user-configurable. This
    vulnerability is corrected in CUCM versions 3.3(5)SR2b, 4.1(3)
    SR5, 4.2(3)SR2, 4.3(1)SR1 and 5.1(2). This issue is documented in
    Cisco Bug ID CSCsi10509.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 1.0.

Cisco will provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are
encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the
environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in a DoS
condition or the execution of arbitrary code.

Software Version and Fixes
==========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

It is possible to workaround the CTL Provider Service Overflow
vulnerability by disabling the CTL Provider Service if it is not
needed. Access to the CTL Provider Service is usually only required
during the initial configuration of CUCM authentication and
encryption features. For CUCM 4.x systems, please consult the
following documentation for details on how to disable CUCM services:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps556/products_administration_guide_chapter09186a008070ec49.html

For CUCM 5.x systems, please consult the following documentation for
details on how to disable CUCM services:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps556/products_administration_guide_chapter09186a008037ced2.html#wp1048220

Filtering traffic to affected CUCM systems on screening devices can
be used as a mitigation technique for both vulnerabilities:

  * Permit access to TCP port 2444 only between the CUCM systems
    where the CTL Provider service is active and the CTL Client,
    usually on the administrator's workstation, to mitigate the CTL
    Provider service overflow.
  * Permit access to TCP port 2556 only from other CUCM cluster
    systems to mitigate the RIS Data Collector overflow.

It is possible to change the default ports of the CTL Provider (2444/
TCP) and RIS Data Collector (2556/TCP) services. If changed,
filtering should be based on the values used. The values of the ports
can be viewed in CUCM Administration interface by following the 
System > Service Parameters menu and selecting the appropriate
service.

There is currently no method to configure filtering directly on a
CUCM system.

Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your
network, it is possible to identify traffic that should never be
allowed to target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic
at the border of your network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a
network security best practice and should be considered as a
long-term addition to good network security, as well as a workaround
for this specific vulnerability. The filters shown above should be
included as part of an infrastructure access list which will protect
all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP address range.

The white paper entitled "Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure
Protection Access Control Lists" presents guidelines and recommended
deployment techniques for infrastructure protection access lists.
This document is available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml

Filters blocking access to TCP/2444 and TCP/2556 should be deployed
at the network edge as part of a transit access list which will
protect the router where the ACL is configured, as well as other
devices behind it. Further information about transit ACLs is
available in the white paper "Transit Access Control Lists: Filtering
at Your Edge," which is available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion
document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20070711-cucm.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco will make free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. This advisory will be updated as fixed
software becomes available. Prior to deploying software, customers
should consult their maintenance provider or check the software for
feature set compatibility and known issues specific to their
environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by
the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
