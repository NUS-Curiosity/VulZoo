Subject: 0day linux 2.6 /dev/mem rootkit found

I found one interesting tool on my server, with the
name 'Boxer 0.99 BETA3'. It's protected by ELFuck
linux executables obfuscator. Google doesn't know
anything about it.
Now, it is available at http://surfall.net/rel.tar.gz
(ELFuck password: 'notdead')
Anybody seen it before?
