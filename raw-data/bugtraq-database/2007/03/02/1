Synopsis
========

The Snort DCE/RPC preprocessor contains a buffer overflow that could
result in the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Snort is a widely deployed intrusion detection program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/snort      < 2.6.1.3                      >= 2.6.1.3

Description
===========

The Snort DCE/RPC preprocessor does not properly reassemble certain
types of fragmented SMB and DCE/RPC packets.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted fragmented SMB or
DCE/RPC packets, without the need to finish the TCP handshake, that
would trigger a stack-based buffer overflow while being reassembled.
This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions
of the user running the Snort preprocessor.

Workaround
==========

Disable the DCE/RPC processor by commenting 'preprocessor rpc_decode'
and 'include $RULE_PATH/rpc.rules' from /etc/snort/snort.conf .

Resolution
==========

All Snort users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/snort-2.6.1.3"

==========
