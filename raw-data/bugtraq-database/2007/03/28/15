Backporting this change will be overkill, I think.  It includes
configuration bits for toggling enablement of various ViewVC views.  For
most folks, though, this is one of those configure-once-and-never-look-back
items.  So, it might be easier to just hard-code the disablement.  You can
do this by tweaking the function view_checkout() (found in lib/viewvc.py or
lib/viewcvs.py, depending on which software you're running) to raise an
Exception.  Psuedo-patch for ViewVC:

   def view_checkout(request):
  +    raise debug.ViewVCException('Checkout view is disabled',
  +                                '403 Forbidden')

or for ViewCVS:

   def view_checkout(request):
  +    raise debug.ViewCVSException('Checkout view is disabled',
  +                                 '403 Forbidden')
