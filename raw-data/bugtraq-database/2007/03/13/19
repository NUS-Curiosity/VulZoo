Isn't it the case with every software created to add some protection
to you computer? Firewalls, antiviruses, IDSes etc. are all adding
code to your operating system that may, in the future, be found
vulnerable to some attack. It is just the question whether protection
they provide compensates additional threat they may introduce.
