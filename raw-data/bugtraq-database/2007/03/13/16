iframedollaz used to offer webmasters a deal to include code on their
website for cash per hit (drive-by install).

They have been doing a lot of other stuff, as well, such as breaking into
websites and "defacing" them. Read defacing as "leave them the same way
only add malicious code to install drive-by malware".

They are by far not the only ones, nor are these their only strategies.
