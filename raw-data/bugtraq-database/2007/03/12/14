RIM BlackBerry Pearl 8100 Browser DoS
------

12 March 2007

Summary:
A vulnerability has been discovered that could impact upon the availability of the BlackBerry 8100 Wireless handheld (v4.2.0.51). It is possible for a remote attacker to construct a WML page that contains an overly long string value within a link (e.g.: <a href = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa etc.>). Should the page or link be accessed by BlackBerry devices, this leads to a temporary Denial of Service within the 4thPass browser component on the device, and temporary device inoperability. Normal functionality will be returned to the browser / device after an amount of time relative to the size of the link supplied, or by physically removing and reinserting the battery thereby creating a reset.

Business Impact:
Exploitation of this issue can lead to a loss of device functionality.  

Affected Product(s):
The BlackBerry 8100 (Pearl) handheld device (v4.2.0.51)

Remediation:
Upgrade to vendor patch 4.2.1

Additional details of this vulnerability are available from the vendor at www.blackberry.com/security/news.jsp
