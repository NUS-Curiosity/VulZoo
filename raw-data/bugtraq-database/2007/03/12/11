Subject: Re: Wiki Remote Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

This is the designed behavior of the application, not an "exploit" as 
you claim.  In addition to that, the syntax used in your example URL's 
is specific to MediaWiki, and not common amongst all wiki apps, as you 
claim.  Furthermore, this "exploit" does not work "100% of the time" - 
even if this could be called an exploit, which it clearly is not, 
protecting an entry and configuring levels of access are relatively 
common and simple tasks for Wiki administrators.
Your claim that this is an access validation error is simply wrong, and 
is akin to saying that being able to write to a file which a user 
intentionally sets to mode 0777 is an error.

Anyone using any type of Wiki project is vulnerable. Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to gain remote administrative access to the vulnerable sites Pages. Attackers can use a browser to exploit this issue.
