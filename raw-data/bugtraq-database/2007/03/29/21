Subject: Re: Re: Bypass phishing protection in Firefox / Opera

yes, this what you comment is another different failure and i've commented it in the following article:

http://www.zonafirefox.net/2007/02/nueva-falla-en-el-filtro-anti-phishing.html

By the way, i think this new way to bypass the phishing protection is some dangerous. 

Demostrations again (look at the code):

http://zonafirefox.googlepages.com/prueba.html

Firefox 2.0.0.3, Opera 9.10 and Opera 9.2b fails. IE7 has no problems.

A single IFRAME / OBJECT can bypass phishing protection.
