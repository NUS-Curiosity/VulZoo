    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1170

Description:
    Previous versions of the inkscape package may execute arbitrary code
    when provided with certain strings, particularly when provided with
    a maliciously-crafted URI.  This vulnerability could have been
    exposed for users who configured a browser to open certain document
    types with inkscape.
    
    Another vulnerability fixed in this version of inkscape involves
    the Whiteboard Jabber client, but this functionality was not
    included in the previous version of inkscape included in rPath
    Linux, so it was not vulnerable.
