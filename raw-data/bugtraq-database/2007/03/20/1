Subject: Oracle 10g Dynamic Monitoring Services XSS /servlet/Spy

Hi,

Access to http://somesite/servlet/Spy should be restricted. But
generally database or system administrators ignore the hardening of
Oracle apllications or database. I have noticed XSS bug in Dynamic
Monitoring services on Oracle-Application-Server-10g/10.1.2.0.0.
