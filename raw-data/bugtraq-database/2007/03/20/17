Subject: Linksys WAG200G - Information disclosure

Hi there,

About 2 months ago I bought a wireless ADSL modem/router, the Linksys WAG200G. Just did some basic security checks and to my utter surprise the device responded with about all sensitive information it knows:

* Product model
* Password webinterface
* Username PPPoA
* Password PPPoA
* SSID
* WPA Passphrase

I notified Linksys, got some regular support questions and was then assured my concerns would be forwarded to the product engineers. Some weeks later I tried again, same message, silence since then.

My firmware version is 1.01.01, latest available for this type.

'Technical' info:
Sent a packet to UDP port 916.
Answer contains mentioned information.
(LAN interface and Wireless interface)

Greetings,
Daniï¿½l Niggebrugge
