Hello Stefano,

first of all. I am not angry at you, although my mail might have sounded
so, but at the people that deserve it.

The fault of the PHP Security Response Team is not yours. They are the
ones that give credit to the wrong persons.
Luckily after 2.5 years they fixed that issue (or atleast tried so).

This is the goal of the MOPB. And right now it might look like the MOPB
was already successfull. Unfortunately I have worked together with the
PHP Security Response Team for several years and I know how they react.
They might be active for a little while (especially when the media looks
at them) but when that period of time is over they will continue with
their old habits.
