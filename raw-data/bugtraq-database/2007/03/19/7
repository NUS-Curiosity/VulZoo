Synopsis
========

LTSP includes a version of libVNCServer that is vulnerable to an
authentication bypass.

Background
==========

The Linux Terminal Server Project adds thin-client support to Linux
servers.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/ltsp      < 4.2-r1                             >= 4.2-r1

Description
===========

The LTSP server includes vulnerable LibVNCServer code, which fails to
properly validate protocol types effectively letting users decide what
protocol to use, such as "Type 1 - None" (GLSA-200608-05). The LTSP VNC
server will accept this security type, even if it is not offered by the
server.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized
access with the privileges of the user running the VNC server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All LTSP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/ltsp-4.2-r1"
