 From a technical standpoint, of course everyone at an OS vendor, even down
to the janitors, wants their OS secure as possible.

But the problem isn't the desire or the knowledge of the technology.

Anytime Thompson, or any software publisher CEO uses a vague term like 
"security platform," you know they have a marketing hat on, and their comments 
are going to be largely devoid of supporting detail.  That is not an indication 
these people are ignorant.

Second, I think at least part of what he left out is that developing, deploying, 
and maintaining software that performs malware identification and mitigation is 
a multi-faceted task.  In fact, all software publishing is complicated.  Success 
requires some marketing, a lot of research, some high-traffic and spiked 
distribution server access patterns, a clean parking lot, janitors, and did I 
mention some actual software development too?

So yes, there are lots of ways to get distracted.  Budget politics, marketing
choices, shareholder dividends, talent shortage, growth, acquisitions (did 
someone say Veritas?), currency fluctuation.

Claiming "conflict of interest" is a diversion.  The truth, I think, is that
competition keeps vendors honest, on their toes, and delivering increased value 
at decreased price.  Symantec would improve if they faced more competition, and 
MicroSoft would improve if they faced more competition.  It's how a free market 
works.
