Subject: Horde IMP Webmail Client version H3 (4.1.4) fixes multiple XSS issues

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

Horde IMP Webmail Client version H3 (4.1.4) was released a few hours
ago. It contains fixes for 2 XSS issues (compared to 4.1.4 RC1).


1. Script injection through email subject lines in threaded view

Subject lines of emails, when displayed in vulnerable versions of IMP in
'multiple message view' (IMP core) or with the thread plugin, are not
properly sanitized.

An email with a custom crafted subject which may then be loaded in the
authenticated webmail session of the victim may inject malicious client
side scripting code (such as Javascript) or HTML and allow for XSS attacks.

Example:
Subject: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

The issue is found in thread.php.



2. Multiple XSS in search function

A victims' web browser, running a previously authenticated IMP session,
may be forced into loading a custom crafted URL pointing to the email
search function. The payload will cause the client side script code
contained in the specially crafted URL to be executed in the security
context of the domain the vulnerable copy of IMP is accessed through.
This allows for mounting XSS attacks.

There were several XSS issues in the search function which have been
fixed at the same time.

Example:
[Base_HREF]/horde/imp/search.php?edit_query=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28'XSS'%29%3C/script%3E%3Cx=%22
