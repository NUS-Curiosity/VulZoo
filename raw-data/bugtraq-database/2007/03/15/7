Yeah, I love the KILLWINANDREBOOT command, which will basically delete
NTLDR and NTDETECT.COM before rebooting Windows ...

Embedded URLs are :
http://58.65.234.73/~mjakson
http://58.65.234.73/~mjakson/mail.php
http://58.65.234.73/~mjakson/newuser.php
http://58.65.234.73/~mjakson/commandack.php
http://58.65.234.73/~mjakson/mailwab.php
http://58.65.234.73/~mjakson/command.php
http://58.65.234.73/~mjakson/upload.php

You can also easily guess the following URL :
http://58.65.234.73/~mjakson/admin.php

Best course of action for sysadmins would be to block at least this IP.

The site seems to be hosted in a server farm near Hong Kong.
On March, 14th at 20:00 GMT the site was still up and running.

Very nice piece of malware indeed ...
