Subject: Norton Insufficient validation of 'SymTDI' driver input buffer

Hello,

We would like to inform you about a vulnerability in Symantec Norton products.


Description:

Norton insufficiently protects its driver \Device\SymEvent against a manipulation by malicious applications and it fails 
to validate its input buffer. It is possible to open this driver and send arbitrary data to it, which are implicitly 
believed to be valid. It is possible to assemble the data in the input buffer such that the driver performs an invalid 
memory operation and crashes the whole operating system. Further impacts of this bug (like possibility of arbitrary code 
execution in the kernel mode) were not examined.


Vulnerable software:

     * Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.1.7
     * Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.0.33
     * probably all versions of Norton Personal Firewall 2006, Norton Internet Security 2006 and other products that use 
SymTDI driver
     * possibly older versions of Norton Personal Firewall and Norton Internet Security


More details and a proof of concept including its source code are available here:
