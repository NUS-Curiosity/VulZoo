- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our investigation into affected products is still on-going.  We will
make any necessary updates to the response we have posted to cisco.com at 
the following URL:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20070315-xss.shtml

In some cases it is possible to eliminate the vulnerability by removing
or renaming the files PreSearch.html and PreSearch.class (if they exist
- - they can be found using the operating system's file search feature.)
Please note that this workaround is not applicable to appliances and
other products where direct access to the file system is not available,
and that by removing or renaming these files it will no longer be
possible to search the product's online help contents.

We also have a companion document that provides additional information
on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and the methods used to exploit
them. This document, a Cisco Applied Intelligence Response titled
"Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Threat Vectors", is available
at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20060922-understanding-xss.shtml

We are not aware of any malicious use of this vulnerability.

This issue was also reported to us by Erwin Paternotte from Fox-IT, just
five days apart. Erwin's report was on the Cisco CallManager. We would
like to thank you both for bringing this issue to our attention and for
working with us towards coordinated disclosure of the issue.

Cheers,
