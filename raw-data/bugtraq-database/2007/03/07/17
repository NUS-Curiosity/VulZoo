Subject: FLSA - foresight linux security announcements

Just a heads up to folks that Foresight Linux [1] will now be publishing 
security advisories. These advisories will be published as soon as 
updates for the relevant issues have been pushed. The advisories will be 
posted to a newly-created mailing list [2] explicitly for this purpose, 
as well as to FullDisclosure, Bugtraq, and LWN.net. Interested users and 
developers are encouraged to subscribe to the foresight-security list.

Developers who are interested in joining the foresight security team are 
encouraged to stop by #foresight and say hello.
