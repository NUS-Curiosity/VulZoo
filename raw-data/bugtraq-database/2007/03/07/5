Subject: Re: Drake CMS v0.3.2 < = RFi Vulnerabilities

This vulnerability has nothing to do with Drake CMS v0.3.2.

It affected Drake CMS v0.2.2 ALPHA and ONLY when PHP was with register globals active; since the product was ALPHA it was not released for production websites but only for ALPHA testers to spot bugs. If each ALPHA tester would have submit a security report...
Do you think alpha testers still have v0.2.2? They keep themselves updated via SVN so this security report has no target audience, reports a wrong version information (should be v0.2.2 ALPHA) and a wrong vulnerability information, and furthermore refers about a specifically unstable product.

(To: k4rtal gmail com) If you were not as lame as you are you would have spent some more time finding some real vulnerability in Drake CMS instead of publishing this crap.
