Pardon me for maybe being a little naÃ¯ve here, but the situation you state: 

"I have conducted code reviews on several commercial apps which use C:\TEMP in very insecure ways to store sensitive data."  

That would certainly seem to me that a programmer and the QA process failed.  I struggle to see where Windows is to blame for that.  I am no "Windows lover" but as a working security professional, I see as much poorly written code junking up Linux, Unix, Apples (yes we have them all) as I see with Windows, yet in those situations, will you blame the OS there too?  I think it is time you take the bias you have, set it aside and look at the statement you made which was concise, accurate and factual, then point the blame where it belongs; at the code writers whose code you review!.  

Cheers

Jens

I find your assessment somewhat short-sighted.  It seems some of these attacks would be
possible in those situations.

Sure, Windows is already pathetically insecure against an attackers
already on the local system, but this would be yet another attack
vector.
