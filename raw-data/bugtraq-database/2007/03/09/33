Program Description |
====================
WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform
with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.
What a mouthful. WordPress is both free and priceless at the same time.
More simply, WordPress is what you use when you want to work with your
blogging software, not fight it.

_________
Overview |
=========
The query variable "year" inside the function "wp_title", its not sanitized
so it allows a non persistent cross site scripting attack.

$title takes the value in raw (without any type of filter) of $year which is an
a query variable, that can be filled with any web browser via a simply
GET parameter.
