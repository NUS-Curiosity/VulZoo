Subject: [CAID 34817, 35058, 35158, 35159]: CA BrightStor ARCserve Backup Tape Engine and Portmapper Vulnerabilities


Title: [CAID 34817, 35058, 35158, 35159]: CA BrightStor ARCserve 
Backup Tape Engine and Portmapper Vulnerabilities

CA Vuln ID (CAID): 34817, 35058, 35158, 35159

CA Advisory Date: 2007-03-15

Reported By: McAfee

Impact: Remote attackers can cause a denial of service or 
potentially execute arbitrary code.

Summary: CA BrightStor ARCserve Backup contains four 
vulnerabilities that can allow a remote attacker to cause a denial 
of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. CA has issued 
patches to address the vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability, 
CVE-2006-6076, is due to insufficient bounds checking in the Tape 
Engine, which can result in a buffer overflow and arbitrary code 
execution. The second vulnerability, CVE-2007-0816, is related to 
how invalid parameters are handled by the portmapper (catirpc.dll) 
service. By sending a specially crafted request, a remote attacker 
can crash the service. The third vulnerability, CVE-2007-1447, is 
due to a memory corruption issue that occurs during processing of 
RPC procedure arguments by the Tape Engine. The vulnerability can 
result in a denial of service, and can potentially be exploited to 
execute arbitrary code. The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2007-1448, 
is due to the presence of an RPC function that, when called, will 
disable the Tape Engine interface. A remote attacker can make a 
request that will effectively shut down Tape Engine functionality.

Mitigating Factors: None

   "catirpc.dll". By default, the files are located in the 
   "C:\Program Files\CA\BrightStor ARCserve Backup" directory.
2. Right click on each of the files and select Properties.
3. Select the General tab.
4. If either file timestamp is earlier than what is indicated in
