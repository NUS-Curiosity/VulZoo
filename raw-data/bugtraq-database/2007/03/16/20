I've done both: sold a security enhancement for someone else's OS
(Immunix) and now I'm responsible for that same technology as part of
SUSE Linux (AppArmor).

I have no idea how Thompson gets his conflict of interest. It makes no
sense to me. I agree with Litchfield that it is an OS vendor's
responsibility to secure their OS as best they can, and using intrusion
prevention technologies is perfectly fair game.

However, Microsoft is a special case, because they have been legally
found to be a monopoly, and so special laws apply. So what Microsoft can
legally do may be different from what Red Hat, Novell, or Sun can do. I
am not a lawyer, so I won't speculate on what those differences might be.

Is Thompson talking about OS vendors in general having a conflict of
interest? Or just referring to Microsoft's monopoly status? I can't
tell, but it sounds like the former, and that sounds wrong.
