Overview:
Quoting http://www.phprojekt.com/features.php?&newlang=eng 
"PHProjekt is a modular application for the coordination of group 
activities and to share informations and document via the web.
Components of PHProjekt: Group calendar, project management, time card 
system, file management, contact manager, mail client and many other 
modules.
PHProjekt supports many protocols like ldap, xml/soap and webdav and 
is available for 38 languages and 9 databases."



Description:
In detail, the following flaws were determined during a quick source 
code review for the modules Projects, Contacts, Helpdesk, Notes, Search
and Mail. 
During the validation the php.ini setting "magic_quotes_gpc" was 
deactivated.

PHProjekt using an internal a CSRF protection (see function 
check_csrftoken() in lib/lib.inc.php). 
By calling this function the return value is always true. Due to incorrect 
output validation in many modules, such as Mail or Filemanager, 
Cross Site Request Forgery is possible.
   
Finally, the Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability also affect the 
summary page, which is PHProjekt's index page.


Remarks
-------
There may be other modules which are affected, but they have not been 
subject to review at this point. 



Solution:
The vulnerabilities were reported on Dec 31 2006 and an update has 
been released on Mar 14 2007.
