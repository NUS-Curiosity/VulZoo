Subject: New report on Windows Vista network attack surface


Greetings,

Some of you may be interested in a new report titled "Windows Vista Network
Attack Surface Analysis" by myself, Ollie Whitehouse, Tim Newsham, and Matt
Conover.
    
http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/reference/Vista_Network_Attack_Surface_RTM.
pdf ( http://tinyurl.com/2qrglc )

You might recall that an earlier edition of this report was released last
July covering certain beta builds.  This new report is a complete re-test
with the RTM (release) build of Vista.  We have also deepened our research
into Teredo, LLTD, Windows Firewall, MS-RPC, and IPv4/IPv6 fragmentation
reassembly.  However, it is still a very broad paper covering a large number
of topics.

We hope you find this report interesting or useful.

Sincerely,

  Jim Hoagland

P.s. Thanks for Oliver Friedrichs and Symantec for allowing us to conduct
this research and to publish it.  It was an interesting study.
