Subject: SymEvent Driver Local Access System Denial of Service

Hello,

Today, we have accidentally discovered that the vulnerability, which is described here

http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2006.09.20a.html

and its third party identifications are

BID:               20051
Secunia Advisory:  SA21938
CVE:               CVE-2006-4855


is active again in the today's update of Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.1.7.
Probably, some changes have been made in the SymEvent driver since it was fixed
that causes that the driver is vulnerable again.

The version of symevent.sys on the testing system is 12.0.0.20.

Kind Regards,
