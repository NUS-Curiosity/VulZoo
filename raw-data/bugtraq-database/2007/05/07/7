I haven't examined the source code to this, but on June 16, 2006, 
gamr-14@...mail.com disclosed RFI vulnerabilities [1] in four Nucleus 
scripts, all with the DIR_LIBS variable as the injection point. This was 
subsequently proven to be a false report as the variable was previously 
set and could not be manipulated by an attacker.

Have you actually tested this, or is this based on a quick grep of the 
source code?
