What is the instruction that it crashes on? this is the important part, not always so much 'what' you write but 'how' you overwrite.

If it is something like:

MOV DWORD PTR DS:[ECX],EAX
MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+4],ECX

then you have a bunch of stuff to play with and exploitation should be a piece of cake, overwrite some pointer for example. Otherwise it might well be a little trickier but from what you post it looks pretty good.

Anyway, paste where it crashes in the assembler.
