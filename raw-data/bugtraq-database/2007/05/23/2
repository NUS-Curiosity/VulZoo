BoastMachine v3.0 platinum - Session İd Hacking

After the login into the site which alllows new user registration. Site 
user's data which is entered to change the topic, can be changed by another 
user, and that is a security hole because of ID interchangeability in URL 
address space.

If the changed topic belongs to the admin it doedn't affect the free login 
and site user has an authority to make changes and cop the topics.
