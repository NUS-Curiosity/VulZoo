Subject: Q1 2007 Application Security Trends Report (Corrected Link)

All,

First, I want to thank you for bringing the broken link to my
attention. Essentially we had a race condition and someone changed the
name of the file after I had made my post.

I have been informed that the best thing to do is to download the
report directly from the Cenzic homepage:

http://www.cenzic.com.

We will have a link to the file prominently displayed. You can find it
on the right hand side of the page. I have put a direct link to the
Cenzic homepage from my blog post about the Trend report, at:

http://secureweb.typepad.com/secure_web/2007/05/q1_2007_applica.html

For those of you that want to try your hand at a direct link, here is
one with the new filename:

http://www.cenzic.com/pdfs/Cenzic_AppSecTrends_Q1-07.pdf

Be aware, I can't guarantee that a busy little bee won't change the
filename again, so if that direct link doesn't work by the time you
read this then you can get the latest version off of our homepage
(above).

Shoutz out to the cReW of the ISTR! :-) Your hard work is appreciated.

Thanks,

-Tom
