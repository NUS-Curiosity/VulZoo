A few banks in Australia are using a similar idea: Bank of Queensland 
offer a device that every time you press a button it gives a code that 
their website expects in addition to your net banking username+password. 
Commonwealth Bank do the same thing but instead of a device they do a 2 
stage login, first stage being username+pass the second being a code 
sms'sed to a pre-registered mobile phone number.
