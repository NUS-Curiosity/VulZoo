Synopsis
========

An integer overflow vulnerability has been reported in file allowing
for the user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

file is a utility that guesses a file format by scanning binary data
for patterns.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-apps/file       < 4.21                                >= 4.21
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Package 1 only applies to x86, PPC and HPPA users.

Description
===========

Colin Percival from FreeBSD reported that the previous fix for the
file_printf() buffer overflow introduced a new integer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to run the file program on an
overly large file (more than 1Gb) that would trigger an integer
overflow on 32-bit systems, possibly leading to the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Since file is a system package, all Gentoo users should upgrade to the
latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/file-4.21"

==========
