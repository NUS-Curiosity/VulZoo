The Call for  Papers for VNSECON  Security Conference 2007 is now
open. VNSECON 2007 is a security conference taking place downtown
in Ho Chi Minh City (aka Saigon),  Vietnam from the 3rd to 4th of
August  2007. Some invited  papers  have  been  confirmed, but  a
limited number of speaking slots are still available.


- --[ Introduction

VNSECON 2007 aims to be  an event that enables the dissemination,
discussion and sharing  of security information between  security
communities.  We organize  a  conference  that  gathers  security
experts, from the  mainstream network  security arena  as well as
the underground community, to share their researches, discoveries
and experiences.

We promise to make VNSECON a great and fun event for all security
enthusiasts, regardless the colors on their hats.


- --[ The Venue

Ho Chi Minh City,  fondly referred to  as Saigon  - "The Pearl of
the Orient",  still retains a charm reminiscent  of  its  French-
European heritage  in  the midst of rapid  commercialization. The
city  promises  an endless fascination  for travelers  wanting to
explore  Vietnam's  rich  4,000-year  history.  It is a bustling,
dynamic and industrious center, the largest city in  the country,
the economic  capital and the  cultural trendsetter. The streets,
where much of the city's life takes  place, is a myriad of street
markets,  shops,  pavement  cafes,  stands-on-wheels and  vendors
selling wares spread out on sidewalks.
