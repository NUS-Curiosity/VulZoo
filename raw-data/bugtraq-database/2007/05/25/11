Subject: rtpBreak - detects, reconstructs and analyzes any RTP session

Ciao,

I would like to announce you the first public release of rtpBreak.
This is the description:

---
rtpBreak detects, reconstructs and analyzes any RTP [rfc1889] session through
heuristics over the UDP network traffic. It works well with SIP, H.323, SCCP
and any other signaling protocol. In particular, it doesn't require the
presence of RTCP packets (voipong needs them) that aren't always transmitted
from the recent VoIP clients.
