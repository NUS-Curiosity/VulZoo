Subject: Re: Retrieving "deleted" sms/mms from Nokia phone (Symbian S60)

Well, in fact you can easily recover the data directly on the phone
using something like FExplorer and an hex editor
just take a look at the files in the subfolders of C:\system\Mail

(hint hint: you can also copy attached files over to anywhere on the
FS from there)

what really sucks about this "feature" is that these apparently
"deleted" sms take space on the device with every attachment they
have, even though they've been deleted and they won't be overwritten
because as files, they haven't been deleted
