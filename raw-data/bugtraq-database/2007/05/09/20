(copied here without permission)
Step by Step Demo:

- Download POC from http://tracingbug.com/downloads/citihook.zip and
unzip to some directory
- Launch citihook.exe, this will watch only
https://www.online.citibank.co.in/ URL

Effectively, "Let me install my malware on your machine to demonstrate
how vulnerable it is."

P-p-p-p-p-p-leeeze (three anti-social points for that quote)!
The "problem" ceases to be a vulnerability at this point.
