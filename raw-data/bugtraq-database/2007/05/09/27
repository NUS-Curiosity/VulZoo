Even though I was the first to point out this is old news for the malware
scene in online/e fraud, I'd be the first to bow down before Int3 and say
"thank you for sharing your work with us". Many don't.

But your point above:
"without installing malware on the victim host"

Although true on some level, is bogus for the purpose of this work, as it
being written makes an automatic assumtion on working only after malware
is installed.

Although you are right, in practice this is already an heavily abused
technology, and.. 
'Getting malware on a system', who ever heard of such a ridiculous
idea? :)
