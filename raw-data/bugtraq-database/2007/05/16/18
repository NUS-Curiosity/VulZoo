I completely agree with you.
Infact the news is how EASY is it to recover sms/mms deleted without
using any recovery tool (just using the PC Nokia Suite) and the aim of
my post was to increase the perception of the privacy risk on the mobile
devices.

I hope that after this post, Nokia people will think about introducing
more security features. Those actually are infact often reduced to just
a 4 digit number (the PIN).

I think the question is crucial and, I hope, finally clear.
