The Challenge/Response is done when you log in and for transactions.

The account number you're sending to is used in making the challenge. So
if you were to change the account number, the user would surely notice
that suddenly the challenge isn't matching the account number.

"Account holders at Barclays, NatWest and Nationwide will be given a
calculator-style gadget which, once they insert their debit card, will
produce a randomly generated number which they will have to key in as
well as their usual passwords and identification numbers."

That sounds like what we (ABNAMRO customers) have. Except that we enter
the challenge on the device as well.
