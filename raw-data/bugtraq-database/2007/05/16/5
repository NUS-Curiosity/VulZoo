No, you're right. Part of the point is that Safari is reading these
passwords from Keychain. And the whole point of Keychain is preventing
unauthorized programs from getting at the datastore. If a rogue
program asked for these passwords directly, then Keychain would
present a dialog alerting the user. But as the applescript shows, the
program can get Safari to essentially act on its behalf.
