Dear 3APA3A,

In my opinion, You are only partially right. It is true that not all
of the bugs are security-related ones. It is, however, untrue that
the problem iself is only limited to media file playing refusal as
it leads to a crash. I don't see much security impact, too.
According to SecurityFocus (BID: 23991),
"[..] Media Player Classic is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability
when processing a malformed MPA file. A remote attacker can
exploit this issue to crash the affected application, denying service
 to legitimate users.[..]"

The issue is definetely not a conversation piece, I agree ;-)

Michal
