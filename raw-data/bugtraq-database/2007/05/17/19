How about this Trojan ;)

looks great method to get the Password if the inputs are
scrambled,rotated randomly after each entry etc.
Combination of trojan like this +a simple keylogger +a MITM can defeat
all possible authentication mechanism Multi Factor,channel
authentications like OTP,SMS based  logging   etc
