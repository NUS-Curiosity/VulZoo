Subject Name:            Samba
Subject Summary:         CIFS/SMB Server
Subject Home:            http://www.samba.org/
Subject Versions:        3..* <= 3.0.24

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2007-2444, CVE-2007-2446, CVE-2007-2447,
                         CVE-2007-2453, CVE-2007-2454
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           denial of service, privilege escalation,
                         arbitrary code execution

Description:
    Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the CIFS/SMB server
    implementation Samba [0]:
    
    1. A logic error in the SID/Name translation functionality in
    smbd(8) allows local users to gain temporary privileges and execute
    SMB/CIFS protocol operations via unspecified vectors that cause the
    daemon to transition to the "root" user (CVE-2007-2444) [1].
    
    2. Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the NDR parsing in
    smbd(8) allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted
    MS-RPC requests (CVE-2007-2446) [2].
    
    3. The MS-RPC functionality in smbd(8) allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters involving the
    (1) "SamrChangePassword" function, when the "username map script"
    "smb.conf" option is enabled, and allows remote authenticated users
    to execute commands via shell metacharacters involving other MS-RPC
    functions in the (2) remote printer and (3) file share management
    (CVE-2007-2447) [3].
    
    4. A buffer overflow in the "nss_winbind" library, as used in
    the winbindd(8) daemon, allows attackers to execute arbitrary
    code via the gethostbyname(3) and getipnodebyname(3) functions
    (CVE-2007-0453) [4].
    
    5. A format string vulnerability in the "afsacl" VFS module in
    allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via
    format string specifiers in a filename on an AFS file system, which
    is not properly handled during Windows ACL mapping (CVE-2007-0454)
    [5].
