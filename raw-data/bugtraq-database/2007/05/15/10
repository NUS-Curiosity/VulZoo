Unless the "challenge" which the user must feed into the secure device
includes both the amount and the recipient, the MitM can present false
information to the user alongside the correct challenge, then use the
response to authenticate the fraudulent transaction.

IOW, the user thinks that they are paying $20 to amazon.com, but
they're actually paying $1000 to fraudster.com.

Certainly, OTP prevents a keylogger from grabbing a password which can
be used subsequently to authenticate an arbitrary number of fraudulent
transactions. You at least have to intercept a legitimate transaction
for each fraudulent transaction, preferably in such a way that the
user doesn't realise that they've been intercepted.

[The last part requires the legitimate recipient to design their
payment interface such that it will only accept the exact transaction
they initiated, and not an alternative payment from a third party
(i.e. the fraudster paying the $20 out of the $1000 they just took).]

So long as the system places any trust in the user's PC, auditing the
other components is of limited value.

A really secure system would need to ensure that the user specifically
authorises the transfer of amount X to recipient Y, and not merely
some unspecified transaction.

Eliminating trust in the user's PC would require that the significant
details of the transaction are passed to the secure device, which
realistically requires a better communication channel than a keypad.
