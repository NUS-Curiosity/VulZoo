What is included in the "signed" stuff, and when is that
challenge/response done?

If malware is running on the user's computer, can it change the
destination of a funds transfer invisibly to the user, and still have
the verification work?

That is, user enters "Pay 100 to Credit Card".  The malware sends the
bank "Pay 100 to Bad Guy".  The bank tells the user "Verify transfer
of 100 from your account".  Oops.
