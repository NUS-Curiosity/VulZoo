Subject: RE: Defeating Citibank Virtual Keyboard protection using screenshot method

The point Yash is trying to make is that the Virtual Keyboard doesn't
give any protection from malware. And the idea behind the Virtual
Keyboard is that it protects you from malware like keyloggers.

Gadi pointed out in his first email that this is not really new, and
that there's other ways that don't even require taking screenshots. 

So there's no threat without code installation, but the virtual keyboard
is supposed to defeat code installations.

I'm surprised that banks use such simple things as passwords. Banks here
in the Netherlands use things like one-time PINs, and challenge/response
stuff that uses your chipped bank card. Seems a little safer to me.

Cheers,

	Rogier
