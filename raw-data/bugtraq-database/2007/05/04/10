Subject: safari's saved password at risk

I'd like to inform you that safari is prone to a vunlerability that allow a local user to steal safari's saved passwords by using some macosx componenets. More infos about this issue will be made available as soon as apple will provide a fix. I strongly recommend users remove all safari's saved password from the keychain.

cheers,
