I quite agree, the Summary of my attached advisory makes this point.  However, 
as I also point out in the Solutions section, all of the issues you list were 
against major version 1 of the firmware.  We're now at major version 3 and 
directory traversal is still a problem.  Moreover, the advisories that cover 
directory traversal (http://securityvulns.ru/Mdocument578.html and 
http://securityvulns.ru/Mdocument578.html) only talk about /etc/passwd.  
Neglecting the fact that the web server runs as root and that /etc/shadow is 
therefore available.

Secondly, the Javascript injection issue describe is as far as I 
know /entirely new/.  It's not a short walk to the point where these two 
issues alone could be use to compromise devices, irrespective of the firmware 
issues you also link to.

Maybe, I'm hoping that by version 10 of the firmware in the year 2014, D-Link 
may actually manage to fix some of these reported problems?  Moreover, maybe 
they'll actually make it possible for researchers to report these things in a 
manner whereby they actually respond to the reports when contacted.  Not 
holding my breath though.
