HPSBTU02179 SSRT061256 rev.1 - HP Tru64 UNIX Running the ps command, Local Disclosure of Sensitive Information

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon as soon as possible.

Release Date: 2007-04-25
Last Updated: 2007-04-25

Potential Security Impact: Local disclosure of sensitive information

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with the HP Tru64 UNIX Operating System running the ps command. The ps command could be used to disclose information about a process's arguments and environmental variables that might be exploited by a local, authorized user. 

References: None 

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
The following supported software versions are affected: 

HP Tru64 UNIX v5.1B-4 
HP Tru64 UNIX v5.1B-3 
HP Tru64 UNIX v5.1A PK6 
HP Tru64 UNIX v4.0G PK4 
HP Tru64 UNIX v4.0F PK8 

BACKGROUND


RESOLUTION
HP has released the following Early Release Patch kits (ERPs) publicly for use by any customer. 

The ERP kits use dupatch to install and will not install over any Customer Specific Patches (CSPs) that have file intersections with the ERP.

The resolutions contained in the ERP kits are targeted for availability in the following mainstream patch kit: 

HP Tru64 UNIX Version v5.1B-5

The ERP kits distribute the following files:

/usr/bin/ps 
/sbin/ps 

After installing the patch kit, by default, the HP Tru64 UNIX ps command behaves just the same: it can display a process's arguments, and the ps e command displays a process's environmental variables. 
To prevent users from seeing the arguments and environmental variables of other users, set new variables in the "/etc/rc.config.common" file (versions v5.1A PK6, v5.1B-3, v5.2B-4) or the "/etc/rc.config" file (versions v4.0G PK4 and v4.0F PK8) as follows: 

For HP Tru64 UNIX versions v5.1B-4, v5.1B-3 and v5.1A PK6, use:

# rcmgr -c set TBL_ARGUMENTS_DISABLE 1 
# rcmgr -c set TBL_ENVIRONMENT_DISABLE 1 

For HP Tru64 UNIX versions v4.0G PK4 and v4.0F PK8, use:

# rcmgr set TBL_ARGUMENTS_DISABLE 1 
# rcmgr set TBL_ENVIRONMENT_DISABLE 1 

Important notes about setting these new variables: 

Setting the new variables to prevent the ps command from allowing non-root users to display other users arguments and environment variables might cause some applications or program scripts to not function properly. 
The root user running the ps command will continue to be allowed to display other users arguments and environment variables.
