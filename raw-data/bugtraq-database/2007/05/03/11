for one of the filesets listed below. For affected systems 
verify that the recommended action has been taken.

END AFFECTED VERSIONS 

Certain network traffic can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) for HP-UX systems running TCP/IP (IPv4). Receiving a certain packet on any open TCP/IP connection can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition which can only be corrected by a reboot of the affected system. The Denial of Service (DoS) is characterized by high cpu utilization and a lack of response on any I/O port including the system console. 

Previous revisions of this Security Bulletin recommended setting ip_pmtu_strategy to 0 or 3 as a workaround. Patches or updates to resolve the issue are now available. After these patches or updates are installed the workaround will no longer be necessary or recommended. 
- ->The ip_pmtu_strategy parameter should be restored to the default value of 1. 
- ->Note: Previous versions of this Security Bulletin incorrectly stated that the default value of ip_pmtu_strategy is 2.
