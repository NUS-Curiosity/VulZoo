Subject: Medium security hole affecting DSL-G624T

Hi,

I've identified a couple of security flaws affecting the DSL-G624T firmware.  
I believe the directory traversal issue has been reported in other devices / 
firmware versions supplied by D-Link but not the combination I tested and 
clearly has not been resolved.  Additionally, the Javascript injection issue 
is I believe new and has not been reported on any device.

These issues were reported by email to the vendor at the usual addresses 
(support/security/etc) without response on 13th April 2007.  I also attempted 
to log faults on the vendors support web site but sadly, it would not 
function adequately using either Firefox nor Konqueror.

Tim
