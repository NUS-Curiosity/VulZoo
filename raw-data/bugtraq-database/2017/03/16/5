Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends not to use this product in a production environment
until a thorough security review has been performed by security
professionals and all identified issues have been resolved.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Command Injection in Admin Interface
A command injection vulnerability was found in "pingtest_action.cgi".
This script is vulnerable since it is possible to inject a value of a
variable. One of the reasons for this behaviour is the used PHP version
(PHP/FI 2.0.1 from 1997).

The vulnerability can be exploited by luring an attacked user to click
on a crafted link or just surf on a malicious website. The whole attack
can be performed via a single GET-request and is very simple since there
is no CSRF protection. See our other advisory published in January 2017:
https://www.sec-consult.com/fxdata/seccons/prod/temedia/advisories_txt/20170130-0_Ubiquiti_Networks_XSS_CSRF_v10.txt

An attacker can open a port binding or reverse shell to connect to the
device and is also able to change the "passwd" since the web service
runs with root privileges!

Furthermore, low privileged read-only users, which can be created in the web
interface, are also able to perform this attack.

If the Ubiquiti device acts as router or even as firewall, the attacker
can take over the whole network by exploiting this vulnerability.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Command Injection in Admin Interface
The following link can be used to open a reverse shell to the attacker's
IP address. There are two possibilities for the different firmware
versions.
Reverse root shell - firmware: v1.3.3 (SW)
[ PoC removed - no patch available ]

Reverse root shell - firmware: v5.6.9/v6.0 (XM)
[ PoC removed - no patch available ]

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following devices and firmware versions have been tested/verified:
TS-8-PRO                     - v1.3.3 (SW)
(Rocket) M5                  - v5.6.9/v6.0 (XM)
(PicoStationM2HP) PICOM2HP   - v5.6.9/v6.0 (XM)
(NanoStationM5) NSM5         - v5.6.9/v6.0 (XM)
