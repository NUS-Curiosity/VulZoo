Package        : connman
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-12865
Debian Bug     : 872844

Security consultants in NRI Secure Technologies discovered a stack
overflow vulnerability in ConnMan, a network manager for embedded
devices. An attacker with control of the DNS responses to the DNS proxy
in ConnMan might crash the service and, in same cases, remotely execute
arbitrary commands in the host running the service.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.21-1.2+deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.33-3+deb9u1.

For the testing distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.33-3+deb9u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.35-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your connman packages.
