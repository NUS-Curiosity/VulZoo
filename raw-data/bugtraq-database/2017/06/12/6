The vulnerability laboratory core research team discovered a client-side cross site scripting vulnerability in the official Evolution Script v5.3 Content Management System.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2017-06-07: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Evolution Script S.A.C.
Product: Evolution Script - Content Management System (Web-Application) 5.3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the official Evolution Script v5.3 Content Management System.
The issue allows remote attackers to inject script code with client-side attack vector to compromise browser to application requests.

The cross site vulnerability is located in the `status` parameter of the `Ticket Support` module. Remote attackers are able to inject 
own malicious script codes via GET method request. The attack vector is non-persistent and the request method to inject is GET.
The vulnerability affects the support and administrator role in the ticket support module.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.2.
Exploitation of the cross site vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishings attacks, non-persistent external redirect 
and malware loads or non-persistent manipulation of affected and connected module context.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Support Tickets

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] status

Affected Role(s):
[+] Support
[+] Admin


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user account and with low user interaction.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The security vulnerability can be resolved by a parse or escape of the status parameter content.
Disallow the usage of special chars to prevent further script code injection attacks.
Parse the ticket support content list and include an own exception-handling.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the cross site scripting web vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as medium (CVSS 3.3).
