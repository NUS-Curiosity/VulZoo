Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-0605

    A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the trace subsystem.

CVE-2017-7487

    Li Qiang reported a reference counter leak in the ipxitf_ioctl
    function which may result into a use-after-free vulnerability,
    triggerable when a IPX interface is configured.

CVE-2017-7645

    Tuomas Haanpaa and Matti Kamunen from Synopsys Ltd discovered that
    the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations are vulnerable to an
    out-of-bounds memory access issue while processing arbitrarily long
    arguments sent by NFSv2/NFSv3 PRC clients, leading to a denial of
    service.

CVE-2017-7895

    Ari Kauppi from Synopsys Ltd discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3
    server implementations do not properly handle payload bounds
    checking of WRITE requests. A remote attacker with write access to a
    NFS mount can take advantage of this flaw to read chunks of
    arbitrary memory from both kernel-space and user-space.

CVE-2017-8064

    Arnd Bergmann found that the DVB-USB core misused the device
    logging system, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability, with
    unknown security impact.

CVE-2017-8890

    It was discovered that the net_csk_clone_lock() function allows a
    remote attacker to cause a double free leading to a denial of
    service or potentially have other impact.

CVE-2017-8924

    Johan Hovold found that the io_ti USB serial driver could leak
    sensitive information if a malicious USB device was connected.

CVE-2017-8925

    Johan Hovold found a reference counter leak in the omninet USB
    serial driver, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.  This
    can be triggered by a local user permitted to open tty devices.

CVE-2017-9074

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the IPv6 fragmentation
    implementation could read beyond the end of a packet buffer.  A
    local user or guest VM might be able to use this to leak sensitive
    information or to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-9075

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the SCTP/IPv6 implementation
    wrongly initialised address lists on connected sockets, resulting
    in a use-after-free vulnerability, a similar issue to
    CVE-2017-8890.  This can be triggered by any local user.

CVE-2017-9076 / CVE-2017-9077

    Cong Wang found that the TCP/IPv6 and DCCP/IPv6 implementations
    wrongly initialised address lists on connected sockets, a similar
    issue to CVE-2017-9075.

CVE-2017-9242

    Andrey Konovalov reported a packet buffer overrun in the IPv6
    implementation.  A local user could use this for denial of service
    (memory corruption; crash) and possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-1000364

    The Qualys Research Labs discovered that the size of the stack guard
    page is not sufficiently large. The stack-pointer can jump over the
    guard-page and moving from the stack into another memory region
    without accessing the guard-page. In this case no page-fault
    exception is raised and the stack extends into the other memory
    region. An attacker can exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.

    The default stack gap protection is set to 256 pages and can be
    configured via the stack_guard_gap kernel parameter on the kernel
    command line.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u1 or earlier versions before the stretch release.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
