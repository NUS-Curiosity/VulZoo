Package        : libphp-phpmailer
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-10033
Debian Bug     : 849365

A functionally regression was discovered in some specific usage
scenarios of PHPMailer following the security update of DSA-3750. New
packages have been released which correct the problem. The original
advisory text follows for referecen.

Dawid Golunski discovered that PHPMailer, a popular library to send
email from PHP applications, allowed a remote attacker to execute
code if they were able to provide a crafted Sender address.

Note that for this issue also CVE-2016-10045 was assigned, which is a
regression in the original patch proposed for CVE-2016-10033. Because
the origial patch was not applied in Debian, Debian was not vulnerable
to CVE-2016-10045.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.9+dfsg-2+deb8u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.14+dfsg-2.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libphp-phpmailer packages.
