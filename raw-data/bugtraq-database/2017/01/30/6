8) About Flexera Software

Flexera Software helps application producers and enterprises increase
application usage and the value they derive from their software.

http://www.flexerasoftware.com/enterprise/company/about/

Flexera Software  delivers  market-leading  Software  Vulnerability
Management solutions enabling enterprises to proactively identify and
remediate software vulnerabilities, effectively reducing the risk of
costly security breaches.

http://www.flexerasoftware.com/enterprise/products/

Flexera  Software  supports  and  contributes  to  the community in
several ways.  We have always believed that reliable vulnerability
intelligence and tools to aid identifying and fixing vulnerabilities
should be  freely available  for  consumers  to ensure that users,
who care about their online privacy and security, can stay secure.
Only a few vendors address vulnerabilities in a proper way and help
users get updated  and  stay secure.  End-users (whether private
individuals or businesses) are otherwise left largely alone,  and
that is why back in 2002, Secunia Research started investigating,
coordinating  disclosure  and  verifying software vulnerabilities.
In  2016,  Secunia Research  became  a  part  of  Flexera Software
and today our in-house software vulnerability research remains the
core  of  the  Software  Vulnerability  Management  products  at
Flexera Software.

The  public  Advisory database  contains sufficient information  for
researchers, security enthusiasts, and consumers to lookup individual
products and vulnerabilities  and  assess, whether they need to take
any actions to secure their systems or whether a given vulnerability
has already been discovered
