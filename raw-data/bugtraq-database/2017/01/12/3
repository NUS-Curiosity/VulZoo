CA20170109-01: Security Notice for CA Service Desk Manager

Issued: January 10, 2017
Last Updated: January 10, 2017

CA Technologies support is alerting customers to a potential risk
with CA Service Desk Manager. A vulnerability exists in RESTful
web services that can potentially allow a remote authenticated
attacker to view or modify sensitive information. Fixes are
available.

The vulnerability, CVE-2016-10086, is due to incorrect permissions
being applied to certain RESTful requests that can allow a malicious
user to view or update task information. This vulnerability only
affects CA Service Desk Manager installations with RESTful web
services running.

How to determine if the installation is affected

installed can give the status of the RESTful web services:
