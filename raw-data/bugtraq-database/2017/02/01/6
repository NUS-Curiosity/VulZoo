Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco Prime Home could allow an unauthenticated, 
remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute actions with administrator privileges.
 
The vulnerability is due to a processing error in the role-based access control (RBAC) of 
URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending API commands via HTTP to a 
particular URL without prior authentication. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform 
any actions in Cisco Prime Home with administrator privileges.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds 
that address this vulnerability.
