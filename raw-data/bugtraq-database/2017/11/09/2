         CVE Name       

    Description  A memory leak occurs when an Asterisk pjsip session object   
                 is created and that call gets rejected before the session    
                 itself is fully established. When this happens the session   
                 object never gets destroyed.                                 

    Resolution  Asterisk now releases the session object and all associated   
                memory when a call gets rejected.
