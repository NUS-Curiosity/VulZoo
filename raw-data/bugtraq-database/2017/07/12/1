Vendor description:
-------------------
AGFEO GmbH & Co. KG is a vendor of telephone systems and other
(tele-)communication products like DECT phones, headsets or smart home
products as well.


Business recommendation:
------------------------
The available patches should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends not to use this product in a production environment
until a thorough security review has been performed by security professionals
as there are indications for further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Unauthenticated access to web services and authentication bypass
A web service with multiple scripts for debug purposes is accessible
on an unusual port on the device. There is also a script to read files from
the filesystem. As the web service runs with root privileges all files
on the operating system can be read by an attacker. This only affects the
ES 5xx product line, all other vulnerabilities affect both ES 5xx and 6xx.

The configuration of the device can be changed and arbitrary updates can be
uploaded as well as music files for the answering machine. By reading the
database content, the usernames and their passwords can be revealed and easily
decrypted. This way the administrator password can be dumped from the database
and the device can be fully administrated by an attacker.
The normal user interface has an additional development subfolder which was
probably used during the development process. Updates can be triggered from
this sub platform and log files, statistics and states can also be displayed.


2) Unauthenticated access to configuration ports
Multiple different instances of TCP services are present on the device. Each
of the listening sockets is forked from a debug and configuration service.
Internal device information can be read from the device. Among other commands,
the configuration of the device can also be altered by using these services.


3) Hardcoded cryptographic keys
Three certificates including their private keys are embedded in the firmware
of AGFEO ES 5xx/6xx SmartHome products. The certificates and keys in both
product lines are exactly the same. One certificate is used for HTTPS
(default server certificate for web based configuration and management).

Impersonation, man-in-the-middle or passive decryption attacks are possible.
These attacks allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information like
admin credentials and use them in further attacks.


4) Multiple reflected cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
The ES 5xx SmartHome products are vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting.
Malicious JavaScript code can be executed in the browser of a victim by luring
to a handcrafted link. This is possible even if the victim is not logged in.
It is assumed that the 6xx products are affected as well but those could not be
tested.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Unauthenticated access to web services and authentication bypass
The debug web service is available by using the following url:
http://<Device-IP>:20011/index.html
There are different scripts accessible, the following actions can be executed:
    -) Change IP configuration
    -) Change time zone
    -) Upload updates (Any files can be uploaded to the device!)
    -) Read all files on the filesystem
    -) Play, delete and move voice messages on all mail boxes
    -) Converting mp3 files to wav files
    -) List all connected phones and the related numbers

The SQLite database is located under "/home/profile/poolstore.db". By reading
this file the usernames and passwords can be dumped. The passwords are encoded
with base64 and encrypted with XOR. To decrypt the XOR'ed password the
following key has to be used:
    "0x42 0xab 0xce 0xfa 0x54 0xed 0xcf 0xba"

The function to decrypt the password was found in the php script "login.php":
function decodePassword($PasswordEnc)
{
    $PasswordBinaryEncBase64 = "";
    $PasswordBinaryEnc="";
    $PasswordBinary = array();
    $Password = "";
    $lastChar=0;

    $Key=array(0x42, 0xab, 0xce, 0xfa, 0x54, 0xed, 0xcf, 0xba);

    $PasswordBinaryEncBase64 = $PasswordEnc;

    // base64 decode
    $PasswordBinaryEnc = base64_decode($PasswordBinaryEncBase64);

    // xor decode
    for($i=0; $i<strlen($PasswordBinaryEnc); $i++) {
        $PasswordBinary[$i] = ord($PasswordBinaryEnc[$i]) ^ $Key[$i % count($Key)]
^ $lastChar;
        $lastChar = ord($PasswordBinaryEnc[$i]);
    }

    // erstes Zeichen entfernen (random char!)
    foreach ($PasswordBinary as $chr) {
      $Password .= chr($chr);
    }
    $Password = substr($Password, 1);
    // printf("%s:%d  Password %s\n", __FUNCTION__, __LINE__, $Password);
    return $Password;
}

An additional subfolder, which contains debug scripts, is available under the
following location:
http://<Device-IP>/shdev/ui9.php

Updates can be triggered, logs can be shown and status messages can be gathered
within this functionality. Furthermore, it is possible to debug the login
process. Since there is a hardcoded user "admin" a brute force attack is also
possible.


2) Unauthenticated access to configuration ports
The following TCP ports can be accessed with "nc <Device-IP> -p <Port>":
19002, 19004, 19006, 19009, 19010, 19080, 19081
By connecting to one of these ports a debug interface spawns. For example the
connection to port 19081:
$ nc 192.168.0.40 19081

vulnerability at different entry points:

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
One firmware is available for the whole ES 5 product line, and another one for
the product line ES 6. Therefore, all vulnerabilities which have been found in
one product of ES 5/6 are also available in all other products of ES 5/6.

The following product / firmware version has been tested by SEC Consult:
ES 512 Version 1.9b (es5xxv19b_c063be6)
ES 512 Version 1.10 (es5xxv110_f105485)

Based on results of the SEC Technologies IoT Inspector
(http://www.iot-inspector.com/ - automated firmware analysis tool) we believe
that the product line ES 6 is also prone to the identified vulnerabilities
(except the web service on port 20011) as well as product line ES 5.

Firmware Version 1.9b (ES6xxv19b_c063be67b9c2ba)
Firmware Version 1.10 (ES6xxv110_f105485715a360)

            when the update is available on the homepage in the next
            few days. Shifted release to CW14.
2017-04-05: Asked for status update. Vendor responds that firmware will
            be available next week. Shifted release to unknown.
2017-04-24: Asked whether the download is available or not. Firmware
            will be available next week.
2017-04-25: Found new version 1.12a for ES 6xx on vendor home page.
2017-05-26: Found new version 1.11a for ES 5xx on vendor home page.
2017-05-29: Asked whether the current firmware contains all the fixes.
            Vendor responds that only a part of the vulnerabilities
            is fixed. They also state that v1.12b is for all products
            except "ES5xx up" will be available this week. This
            firmware contains all fixes.
2017-06-06: Asked vendor for the actual state, because the contact said
            that all vulnerabilities are fixed and the firmware can be
            received after calling the hotline. Asked vendor which
            vulnerabilities are actually fixed; No answer.
2017-06-14: Informed vendor that the advisory will be published on
            2017-07-12 because of the long "ping-pong" game without
            real outcome.
2017-06-22: Contact stated that version 1.12c will be available next
            week.
