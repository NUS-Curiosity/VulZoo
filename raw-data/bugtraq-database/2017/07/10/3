Package        : bind9
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-3142 CVE-2017-3143
Debian Bug     : 866564

Cl√©ment Berthaux from Synaktiv discovered two vulnerabilities in BIND, a DNS
server implementation. They allow an attacker to bypass TSIG authentication by
sending crafted DNS packets to a server.

CVE-2017-3142

    An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative
    DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name may be able to
    circumvent TSIG authentication of AXFR requests via a carefully constructed
    request packet. A server that relies solely on TSIG keys for protection
    with no other ACL protection could be manipulated into:
    - providing an AXFR of a zone to an unauthorized recipient
    - accepting bogus NOTIFY packets

CVE-2017-3143

    An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative
    DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the zone and
    service being targeted may be able to manipulate BIND into accepting an
    unauthorized dynamic update. 

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u12.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
