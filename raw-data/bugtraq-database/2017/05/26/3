VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified in HPE ML10 Gen 9
Server using Intel Xeon E3-1200 v5 Processor. The vulnerability could be
remotely exploited to allow access restriction bypass.

**Note:**
On May 1st, 2017, Intel disclosed a new vulnerability with their Intel
Manageability Firmware which is utilized on some systems containing Intel
processors. This vulnerability allows an unprivileged network or local
attacker to gain control of the remote manageability features of Intel Active
Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel
Small Business Technology (SBT) platforms.  Do not attempt to upgrade the ME
FW without following the instructions detailed in the Resolution section.
Refer to the "Platform Specific Information" section in the Resolution for
more specific information on upgrades for specific ProLiant servers.
