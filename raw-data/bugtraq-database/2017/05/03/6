Vulnerability Class:
====================
Privilege Escalation


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Hola's goal is to make the internet faster, more open, and cheaper to operate. Hola is a collaborative (P2P) internet -- Hola works by sharing 
the idle resources of its users for the benefit of all. Hola provides several products based on this resource sharing technology:

Hola's VPN network allows consumers to browse the web privately, securely, and freely. Making the world wide web worldwide again. Hola is used 
by over 80 million people! Luminati has disrupted the way businesses conduct brand monitoring (checking the prices of their products in various stores), 
self-test (checking how their corporate site looks from multiple countries), anti ad-fraud and so on, by providing them a privacy network. Hola's Video 
CDN changes the game in video delivery. Designed as a service for video publishers, HolaCDN makes videos start faster, buffer less, and at a fraction 
of the costs of traditional businesses.

Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The vulnerability laboratory core research team discovered an privilege escalation vulnerability in the official Hola VPN v1.34 client software.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2016-05-03:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Hola Networks Ltd
Product: Hola - VPN Software (Windows) 1.34


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local privilege escalation vulnerability has been discovered in the official Hola VPN v1.34 client software.
The local security vulnerability allows an attackers to gain higher access privileges by exploitation of an 
insecure permission misconfiguration.

The software suffers from a local privilege escalation vulnerability. Users are able to change the files with 
executable access to a binary of choice. The issue is located in the misconfigured permission values with the 
`F`(full) flag in the users and everyone group. The group/user permission for the path is assigned to the 
everyone group. Local attackers could exploit the vulnerability by a replace of the `7za.exe` or 
`hola.exe`...etc files with a malicious executable file. The malicious file is exectuable with the 
local system user permissions.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as medium (CVSS 3.2). Exploitation of the software vulnerability 
requires a low privilege system user account with restricted access and without user interaction. Successful exploitation 
of the vulnerability results in system process compromise and further manipulation or exploitation to compromise the 
local computer operating system.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The local privilege escalation vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers without user interaction and with system user account.
