Vulnerability Class:
====================
SQL Injection


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Tag Meta allows to efficiently manage all site`s meta information. With Tag Meta, as example, it is possible to set the 
tag `title` or the meta tags (e.g. from the most common `description`, `keywords`, `robots`, as well as the recently 
`content rights` and `external reference`) or link `canonical` on any page, just specifying the URL or a part of it. 
This provides a swiss army knife to improve site positioning in SEO optimization. But Tag Meta also supports regular 
expressions in the matching rules and this allows to match a group of URLs with a single rule. In this way it is 
possible to manage metadata from a single control panel.
