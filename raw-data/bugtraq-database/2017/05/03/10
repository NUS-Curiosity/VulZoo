Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Zenario v7.6 content management system.
The persistent validation vulnerability allows remote attacker to inject own malicious script code via persistent attack vector.

The security vulnerability is located in the `Browser title` and `Description meta tag` parameters of the `Editing metadata` module.
Remote attackers with privilege web-application user accounts are able to inject own malicious script code to the application-side 
of the vulnerable module. The validation of the `Search engine results preview` is broken and allows to execute any injected code 
by the `Browser title` and `Description meta tag` input fields. First the content is client-side included via POST and after the 
save the content is saved permanently in the database management system. Thus allows a privileged application user account like a
translator or limited admin to inject malicious script codes. The execution occurs on each preview of the malicious injected item.

The security risk of the xss vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.4. 
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires a privileged web-application user account and only low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the xss web vulnerability results in persistent phishing attacks, session hijacking, persistent external 
redirect to malicious sources and persistent manipulation of affected or connected web module context.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Modules(s):
[+] Forms - Categories - Properties - Metadata & Content

Vulnerable Input Field(s):
[+] Browser title
[+] Description meta tag

Affected Modules(s):
[+] Editing metadata on review
[+] Search engine results preview


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged web-application user account 
and low user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the issue follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1.  Download and step the newst application version
2.  Setup a full admin account and a restricted admin account
3.  Login with a restricted administrator account to the web-application
4.  Now move to the Forms - Categories - Properties - Metadata & Content
Note: Restricted admins are allowed to edit on this part of the forms module the meta data
5.  Now inject to the vulnerable input fields a script code payload with for example a cross site request
6.  The first execute takes place as self-xss, click the popup and move to the save button (page buttom)
7.  Save the content and logout as restricted administrator
8.  Login as full admin and move to the forms module
9.  Open the new entry of the restricted admin to edit or preview
10. The execution takes place within the formular were the  Search engine results preview is visible
11. Successful reproduce of the persistent vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be resolved by an escape of the content that is displayed in the search preview of the edit meta data module.
Disallow the usage of special chars and restrict the input fields to prevent further attacks via search preview module.


Security Risk:
==============
he security risk of the persistent cross site scripting vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.4)
