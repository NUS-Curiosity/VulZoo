3. Vulnerability Description
==================================
During the security analysis, ThunderScan discovered
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in Simple Slideshow Manager
WordPress plugin.

The Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities can enable the attacker to
construct the URL that contains malicious JavaScript code. If the
administrator of the site makes a request to such an URL, the
attacker's code will be executed, with unrestricted access to the
WordPress site in question. The attacker can entice the administrator
to visit the URL in various ways, including sending the URL by email,
posting it as a part of the comment on the vulnerable site or another
forum.

In the specific case of the second Cross-Site scripting vulnerability
(3.2), some modern browsers URL encode the < and > characters. The
easiest way to reproduce the vulnerability is to use Internet
Explorer, or older version of some other browser.


3.1. Cross-Site Scripting
  Function:     echo
  Variable:     $_GET['name']
  Sample URL:  
http://www.vulnerablesite.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=Acurax-Slideshow-Add-Images&name="></script><script>alert(42)</script>
  File:         simple-slideshow-manager\includes\option_fields.php
    ---------
    1276  $acx_selected_gallery_name = trim($_GET['name']);
    ...
    1282  <input type = "text" autocomplete="off" id = "rename" name =
"rename" class="field" value="<?php echo $acx_selected_gallery_name; 
?>" onblur="if (this.value == '') {this.value = '<?php echo
$acx_selected_gallery_name;  ?>';}" onfocus="if (this.value == '<?php
echo $acx_selected_gallery_name;  ?>') {this.value = '';}" />
    ---------
   
3.2. Cross-Site Scripting
  Function:     echo
  Variable:     $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
  Sample URL:  
http://www.vulnerablesite.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=Acurax-Slideshow-Add-Images&name="></script><script>alert(42)</script>
  File:         simple-slideshow-manager\includes\option_fields.php
    ---------
    1284  <input type = "hidden" id = "url" name = "url" value = "<?php
echo str_replace( '%7E', '~', $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']); ?>"/>   
    ---------
