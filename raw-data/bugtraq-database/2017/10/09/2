Package        : nautilus
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-14604
Debian Bug     : 860268

Christian Boxd√∂rfer discovered a vulnerability in the handling of
FreeDesktop.org .desktop files in Nautilus, a file manager for the GNOME
desktop environment. An attacker can craft a .desktop file intended to run
malicious commands but displayed as a innocuous document file in Nautilus. An
user would then trust it and open the file, and Nautilus would in turn execute
the malicious content. Nautilus protection of only trusting .desktop files with
executable permission can be bypassed by shipping the .desktop file inside a
tarball.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has not been fixed yet.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.22.3-1+deb9u1.

For the testing distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.26.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.26.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nautilus packages.
