Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable when
they are configured to use IKE version 1 (IKEv1).

A number of features use IKEv1, including different Virtual Private
Networks (VPN) such as:

  * LAN-to-LAN VPN
  * Remote access VPN (excluding SSLVPN)
  * Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)
  * Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI)

There are two methods to determine if a device is configured for IKE:

  * Determine if IKE ports are open on a running device
  * Determine if IKE features are included in the device
    configuration

Determine if IKE Ports are Open on a Running Device
+--------------------------------------------------

The preferred method to determine if a device has been configured for
IKE is to issue the "show ip sockets" or "show udp" exec command. If the
device has UDP port 500, UDP port 4500, UDP port 848, or UDP port 4848
open, it is processing IKE packets.

In the following example, the device is processing IKE packets in UDP
port 500 and UDP port 4500, using either IPv4 or IPv6:

    router# show udp
    Proto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF
     17       --listen--          192.168.130.21    500   0   0 1001011   0
     17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN           500   0   0 1020011   0
     17       --listen--          192.168.130.21   4500   0   0 1001011   0
     17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN          4500   0   0 1020011   0
    !--- Output truncated
    router#

Determine if IKE Features are included in the Device Configuration
+-----------------------------------------------------------------

To determine if a Cisco IOS device configuration is vulnerable,
the administrator needs to establish whether there is at least one
configured feature that uses IKE. This can be achieved by using the
"show run | include crypto map|tunnel protection ipsec|crypto gdoi"
enable mode command. If the output of this command contains either
crypto map, tunnel protection ipsec, or, crypto gdoi then the device
contains an IKE configuration. The following example shows a device that
has been configured for IKE:

    router# show run | include crypto map|tunnel protection ipsec|crypto gdoi
    crypto map CM 100 ipsec-isakmp
     crypto map CM
    router#


Determine the Cisco IOS Software Release
+---------------------------------------

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco
product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the "show
version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco
IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by
"Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices
do not have the "show version" command or may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of
C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

Router> show version 
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance is not affected by
this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The IKE protocol is used in the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
protocol suite to negotiate cryptographic attributes that will be
used to encrypt or authenticate the communication session. These
attributes include cryptographic algorithm, mode, and shared keys.
The end result of IKE is a shared session secret that will be used to
derive cryptographic keys.

Cisco IOS Software supports IKE for IPv4 and IPv6 communications. 
IKE communication can use any of the following UDP ports:

  * UDP port 500
  * UDP port 4500, NAT Traversal (NAT-T)
  * UDP port 848,  Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI)
  * UDP port 4848, GDOI NAT-T

The IKEv1 feature of Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of
an affected device.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using either IPv4 or
IPv6 on any of the listed UDP ports. Spoofing of packets that could
exploit this vulnerability is limited because the attacker needs to
either receive or have access to the initial response from the
vulnerable device.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCts38429 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-0381.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has scored the vulnerabilities in this advisory based on the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in this
security advisory is in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

* Cisco Catalyst 3550 Series Switches support the Internet Key
Exchange (IKE) feature and are vulnerable to Cisco bug ID CSCts38429
when the devices are running Layer 3 images; however, this product
reached the End of Software Maintenance milestone.  Cisco 3550 Series
SMI Switches that are running Layer 2 images do not support IKE and
are not vulnerable.  No other Cisco devices that run 12.2SE-based
software are vulnerable.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address the
vulnerability described in this advisory. Prior to deploying
software, customers are advised to consult their maintenance
providers or check the software for feature set compatibility and
known issues that are specific to their environments.

Customers may only install and expect support for feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading,
accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers
agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as set forth at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, upgrades should be obtained
through the Software Center on Cisco.com at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers Using Third-Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers with Cisco products that are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers,
should contact that organization for assistance with the appropriate
course of action.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix depends on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Because of the variety of
affected products and releases, customers should consult their
service providers or support organizations to ensure that any applied
workaround or fix is the most appropriate in the intended network
before it is deployed.

Customers Without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have the product serial number available and be
prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of
entitlement to a free upgrade. Customers without service contracts
should request free upgrades through the TAC.
