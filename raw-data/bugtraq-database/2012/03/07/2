Package        : imagemagick
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0247 CVE-2012-0248

Two security vulnerabilities related to EXIF processing were
discovered in ImageMagick, a suite of programs to manipulate images:

CVE-2012-0247
	When parsing a maliciously crafted image with incorrect offset
	and count in the ResolutionUnit tag in EXIF IFD0, ImageMagick
	writes two bytes to an invalid address.

CVE-2012-0248
	Parsing a maliciously crafted image with an IFD whose all IOP
	tags value offsets point to the beginning of the IFD itself
	results in an endless loop and a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 8:6.6.0.4-3+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 8:6.6.9.7-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.
