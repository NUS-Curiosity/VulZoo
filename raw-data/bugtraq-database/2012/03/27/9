Package        : linux-2.6
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation/denial of service
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-4307 CVE-2011-1833 CVE-2011-4347 CVE-2012-0045
                 CVE-2012-1090 CVE-2012-1097

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4307

    Nageswara R Sastry reported an issue in the ext4 filesystem. Local users
    with the privileges to mount a filesystem can cause a denial of service
    (BUG) by providing a s_log_groups_per_flex value greater than 31.

CVE-2011-1833

    Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered an information
    leak in the eCryptfs filesystem. Local users were able to mount arbitrary
    directories.

CVE-2011-4347

    Sasha Levin reported an issue in the device assignment functionality in
    KVM. Local users with permission to access /dev/kvm could assign unused pci
    devices to a guest and cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2012-0045

    Stephan Barwolf reported an issue in KVM. Local users in a 32-bit guest
    running on a 64-bit system can crash the guest with a syscall instruction.

CVE-2012-1090

    CAI Qian reported an issue in the CIFS filesystem. A reference count leak
    can occur during the lookup of special files, resulting in a denial of
    service (oops) on umount.

CVE-2012-1097

    H. Peter Anvin reported an issue in the regset infrastructure. Local users
    can cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by triggering the
    write methods of readonly regsets.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-41squeeze2.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.32-1um-4+41squeeze2

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.

Thanks to Micah Anderson for proof reading this text.
