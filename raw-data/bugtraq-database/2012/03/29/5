High Risk Vulnerability in McAfee Email and Web Security Appliance

29 March 2012

Ben Williams of NGS Secure has discovered a high risk vulnerability in the McAfee Email and Web Security Appliance  

Impact: Any logged-in user can bypass controls to reset passwords of other administrators

If role-based access control is implemented, it should be enforced (otherwise it can be trivially bypassed).

Versions affected:

All versions prior to 5.5 Patch 6, Email and Web Security 5.6 Patch 3, McAfee Email Gateway 7.0 Patch 1

NGS Secure is going to withhold details of this flaw for three months. This three month window will allow users the time needed to apply the patch before the details are released to the general public. This reflects the NGS Secure approach to responsible disclosure.
