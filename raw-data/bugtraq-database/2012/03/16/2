         CVE Name       

    Description  An attacker can cause Asterisk to crash in one of two ways:  
                                                                              
                 1. A dialplan uses the Milliwatt application with 'o'        
                 option                                                       
                                                                              
                 2. The internal_timing opion in asterisk.conf is off         
                                                                              
                 3. The attacker sends a large audio packet. The number of    
                 samples in the audio packet determines the number of         
                 internal data samples that are copied into the buffer. This  
                 overruns the buffer, potentially causing a crash.            
                                                                              
                 OR                                                           
                                                                              
                 1. A diaplan uses the Milliwatt application with the 'o'     
                 option                                                       
                                                                              
                 2. The attacker negotiates a media format with a sampling    
                 rate greater than 32kHz. The application will attempt to     
                 generate an audio packet using the sample rate of the        
                 negotiated format, where the sample rate will require a      
                 number of data points greater then the size of the buffer.   
                 Again, the the application copies a number of internal data  
                 samples into the buffer that are greater then the size of    
                 the buffer, potentially causing a crash.                     
                                                                              
                 Note that the latter attack vector is only possible in       
                 Asterisk 10, as it supports codecs with a sample rate        
                 greater then 32kHz.                                          

    Resolution  Upgrade to one of the versions of Asterisk listed in the      
                "Corrected In" section, or apply a patch specified in the     
                "Patches" section.
