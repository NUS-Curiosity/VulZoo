                   VMware Security Advisory

Advisory ID: VMSA-2012-0004
Synopsis:    VMware View privilege escalation and cross-site scripting
Issue date:  2012-03-15
Updated on:  2012-03-15 (initial advisory)
CVE numbers: CVE-2012-1508, CVE-2012-1509, CVE-2012-1510, CVE-2012-1511
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware View addresses privilege escalation and cross-site scripting
   issues.

2. Relevant releases

   View 4.6.0 and older.

3. Problem Description

 a. VMware Virtual Desktop Display Driver Privilege Escalation

    The VMware XPDM and WDDM display drivers contain buffer overflow
    vulnerabilities and the XPDM display driver does not properly check
    for NULL pointers. Exploitation of these issues may lead to local
    privilege escalation on View virtual desktops.

    VMware would like to thank Tarjei Mandt for reporting theses issues
    to us.
 
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2012-1509 (XPDM buffer overrun),
    CVE-2012-1510 (WDDM buffer overrun) and CVE-2012-1508 (XPDM null
    pointer dereference) to these issues.
    
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.
 
    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product *      Version   on       Apply Patch **
    =============  ========  =======  =================
    View           5.0       Windows  not affected
    View           4.6       Windows  View 4.6.1
    View           4.0       Windows  affected, no patch planned

    * Other affected products are documented in VMSA-2012-0005; this
      advisory is exclusively for View.

   ** Notes on updating VMware Virtual Agents:
      
      In order to remediate the problem, VMware View Agents must be
      updated in any pre-existing virtual desktops. The XPDM and WDDM
      drivers are part of the View Agent.

      View Agents that have moved to View 5.0 from a lower View version
      are affected if their View Agent was not updated after the move.

 b. View Manager Portal Cross-site Scripting

    A cross-site scripting vulnerability in View Manager Portal may
    allow a remote attacker to run scripts in the victim's browser. The
    attacker can trigger this vulnerability by supplying a crafted URL
    to the victim and convincing them to click on the link.
    
    VMware would like to thank Jeremy Conway for reporting this issue
    to us.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2012-1511 to this issue.
    
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.
 
    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch
    =============  ========  =======  =================
    View           5.0       Windows  not affected
