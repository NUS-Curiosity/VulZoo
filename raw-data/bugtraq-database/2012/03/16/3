          CVE Name        

    Description  An attacker attempting to connect to an HTTP session of the  
                 Asterisk Manager Interface can send an arbitrarily long      
                 string value for HTTP Digest Authentication. This causes a   
                 stack buffer overflow, with the possibility of remote code   
                 injection.                                                   

    Resolution  Upgrade to one of the versions of Asterisk listed in the      
                "Corrected In" section, or apply a patch specified in the     
                "Patches" section.
