==================
Barracuda Networks
Product: CudaTel - Communication Server v2.0.029.1


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple persistent Input Validation vulnerabilities are detected on Barracudas CudaTel Phone Application v3.0.028.001. 
Local low privileged user accounts can implement/inject malicious script code to manipulate modules via persistent context 
requests. When exploited by an authenticated user, the identified vulnerabilities can result in information disclosure via error, 
session hijacking, access to available phone line services, manipulated persistent context execution out of the auto route listings.

						   [-] Advanced Routing extension - NAME & Listing
						   [-] Auto Attendants - NAME & Listing
						   [-] ALL Types Listing Category

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by local privileged user accounts with low user inter action or remote via manipulated 
http request & high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
