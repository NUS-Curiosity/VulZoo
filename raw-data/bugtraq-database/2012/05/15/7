Subject: Trigerring Java code from a SVG image

Hello,

SVG is a XML-based file format for static or animated images. Some SVG
specifications (like  SVG 1.1 and SVG Tiny 1.2) allow to trigger some
Java code when the SVG file is opened.

Given that I had to look at these features for a customer, I developed
some PoC codes which are now available online:
