Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
Digital Defense, Inc. (DDI) has discovered a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the Epicor Returns Management software SOAP interface. Left unremediated, this vulnerability could be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands and extract information from the backend database using standard SQL exploitation techniques. Additionally, an attacker may be able to leverage this flaw to compromise the database server host operating system.

Solution Description
--------------------
Epicor Software Corporation has confirmed they have now contacted the customers affected, and have made an update available to address this vulnerability. As such, DDI recommends restricting access to the affected port/interface until installing the Epicor update or implementing another workaround to address the issue.

It should be noted that Epicor has advised DDI that the codebase for Returns Management software may differ significantly from customer to customer. Epicor has suggested that some customer installs may not contain this specific vulnerability as a result of this codebase variability.

DDI recommends that any customer currently utilizing Epicor Returns Management software within their enterprise install the update Epicor has made available and, if concerned about the applicability of the update, log a support call with Epicor directly to determine if their codebase contains this vulnerability.
