Package        : openoffice.org
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1149

Tielei Wang discovered that OpenOffice.org does not allocate a large
enough memory region when processing a specially crafted JPEG object,
leading to a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code
execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.1-11+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:3.4.5-1 of the
libreoffice package.

We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.
