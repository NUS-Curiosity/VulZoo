Yes.  The flaw is in how rssh parses command lines, irrespective of
what SSH implementation is used.  I've been a bit vague about the
details for the moment; I'm hoping that the announcement will generate
some interest in taking over the maintenance of the project.  I'd like
to have some sense of what will happen next before the full details
are disclosed.  If someone wants to step forward, it would be good to
give them a chance to fix it before that happens.
