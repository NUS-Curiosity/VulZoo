Subject: GreHack 2012 - Call For Papers (Grenoble, France)

*GreHack 2012* 2nd Call For Papers
http://ensiwiki.ensimag.fr/index.php/GreHack-2012-english
GreHack 2012 conference will be held in Grenoble (French Alps), France
and brings together students, academia, industry and gov in order to
exchange knowledge around emerging issues in the security + hacking
world.
During the night, a Capture The Flag will take place.


*Suggested Topics (not limited to)*
http://ensiwiki.ensimag.fr/index.php/GreHack_2012-Call_For_Presentation-english

 -- greyhat hacking: a consumer advance, or a risque for worlwide security?
 -- current state of laws relative to cyber-security and hacking +
justified suggestions of modifications

- Track: technical
 -- Hadopi: why is it a technical and legal failure? how to exploit
in memory vulnerabilities of Hadopi approved software?

 -- In Memory Vulnerabilities
   --- Windows 8: heap analysis, kernel structures and new memory protections
   --- Exploit Corner: come present us your last sploit!

 -- Hardcore Penetration Testing
   --- Code obfuscation to complicate Reverse Engineering
   --- Discrete Attacks (eg: without writing on the filesystem)
   --- Hypervisor evasion
   --- Vulnerabilities and exploits on defensive security tools (eg:
AntiMalwares, Firewalls, IDS)

 -- Attacking Infrastructures
   --- Internet: how to root your ***box? Which security
functionalities (and properties) are provided? How to bypass them?
   --- ipsec, ipv6

   --- dumb/simple/basic fuzzing and smart-fuzzing for automating
vulnerability detection
   --- metrics for exploitability of vulns (in memory, web)

   --- advances in reverse-engineering automation and model inference
   --- symbolic exection

 -- Hardware Attacks
   --- nanotechnology
   --- fault injection in memory via laser
