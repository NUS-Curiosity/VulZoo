Subject: Acuity CMS 2.6.x <= Path Traversal Arbitrary File Access

1. OVERVIEW

Acuity CMS 2.6.x (ASP-based) versions are vulnerable to Path Traversal.


2. BACKGROUND

Acuity CMS is a powerful but simple, extremely easy to use, low
priced, easy to deploy content management system. It is a leader in
its price and feature class.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

The issue is due to the script, /admin/file_manager/browse.asp, not
properly sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style
attacks (e.g., ../../) supplied via the 'path' parameter. It would
allow the attacker to access arbitrary files outside of web root
directory.


4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

Tested with version 2.6.2.


5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

http://localhost/admin/file_manager/browse.asp?field=&form=&path=../../


6. SOLUTION

The Acunity CMS is no longer in active development.
It is recommended to user another CMS in active development and support.
