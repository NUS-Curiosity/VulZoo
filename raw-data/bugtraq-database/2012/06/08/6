Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0441

Kaspar Brand discovered that Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS)
library did insufficient length checking in the QuickDER decoder,
allowing to crash a program using the library.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.8-1+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 2:3.13.4-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
