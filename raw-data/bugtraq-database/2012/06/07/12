ZDI-12-086 : RealNetworks RealPlayer rvrender RMFF Flags Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-086
June  6, 2012

- -- CVE ID:

CVE-2012-0922

- -- CVSS:

7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks

- -- Affected Products:

RealNetworks RealPlayer

- -- Vulnerability Details:

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the rvrender module. When parsing an IVR
file, the code within this module does not account for a negative value for
the "RMFF 1.0 Flags" element within the input data. By providing a
specially crafted file an attacker is able to achieve a program state that
results in a function pointer value being retrieved from file data and
subsequently called. This vulnerability can be leveraged to execute code
under the context of the user running the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
