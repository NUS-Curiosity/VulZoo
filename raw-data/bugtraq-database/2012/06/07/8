ZDI-12-081 : Oracle Java GlueGen Arbitrary Native Library Loading Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-081
June  6, 2012

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Oracle


- -- Affected Products:

Oracle Java Runtime


- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page
or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists in the Java GlueGen library. This library is not
installed by default with Java, but it is available as a signed .jar
package. The affected jar files are signed with a certificate that is
trusted by default JRE installs and as such are downloaded and run without
user interaction. Crafted Java applets can reach a call to
'openLibraryGlobal' in the GlueGen library that allow remote .dll files to
be loaded into the JRE process. This can lead to remote code execution
under the context of the current process.

- -- Vendor Response:

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
