ZDI-12-083 : Oracle Java OpenAL Library Pointer Manipulation Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-083
June  6, 2012

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Oracle

- -- Affected Products:

Oracle Java Runtime

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page
or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists in the Java OpenAL (JOAL) library. This library is
not installed by default with Java, but it is available as a signed .jar
package. The affected jar files are signed with a certificate that is
trusted by default JRE installs and as such are downloaded and run without
user interaction. Crafted Java applets can reach a call to
'dispatch_alDeleteBuffers1' that takes a user controllable int and uses it
as a function pointer. This can lead to remote code execution under the
context of the current process.

- -- Vendor Response:

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
