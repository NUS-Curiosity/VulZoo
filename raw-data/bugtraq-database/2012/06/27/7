Cisco Security Advisory: Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in the Cisco
WebEx Player

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20120627-webex

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 June 27 16:00  UTC (GMT) 

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) player contains four buffer
overflow vulnerabilities and the Cisco Advanced Recording Format (ARF)
player contains one buffer overflow vulnerability. In some cases,
exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of a targeted
user.

The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back
WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting
site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players can
be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that
is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. The players can also be manually
installed for offline playback after downloading the application from
http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html.

If the WRF or ARF players were automatically installed, they will be
automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users
access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the
WRF or ARF player was manually installed, users will need to manually
install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version
from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html.

Cisco has updated affected versions of the WebEx meeting sites and WRF
and ARF players to address these vulnerabilities.
