Subject: AdNovum NevisWeb Security Proxy Vulnerability - Cross-site scripting (XSS) within 302 Redirections

Hi all,

nevisProxy is a Swiss secure reverse proxy with integrated web
application firewall (WAF). It acts as a central upstream entry point
for web traffic to integrated online applications. nevisProxy controls
user access and protects sensitive data, applications, services, and
systems from internal and external threats. nevisProxy is a component of
AdNovum's security framework Nevis.

The security product is prone to a XSS vulnerability in its redirection
routine.
