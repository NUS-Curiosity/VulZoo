Subject: Re: Analysis: Vast IPv6 address space actually enables IPv6 attacks

Okay,

so you say it's not as hard to scan an IPv6 network as the raw math
would indicate but it's still a lot harder than scanning an IPv4 network.

Still... where in the article does it say anything about "vast address
space... enables attacks"?

The title and the article don't match.
