- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of XML elements within a TeXML
file. Specifically, when handling the style XML element the code within
QuickTime3GPP.qtx does not properly validate the length of the data within
specific sub-fields. By providing specially crafted data, the code can be
made to copy too much into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. Exploitation
of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code under the context of the user running Quicktime.
