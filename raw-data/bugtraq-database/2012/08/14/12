Abstract:
=========
The Laboratory Researcher (Nafsh) Ehram Shahmohamadi (sec-lab.ir) discovered multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in the 7sepehr CMS.


Report-Timeline:
================
Vulnerability Laboratory [Research Team]  - Ibrahim El-Sayed [storm] (strom@...nerability-lab.com)


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities are detected in the official 7sepehr.com Content Management System 2012. 
Remote attackers can execute/inject own sql commands to compromise the affected application dbms. The vulnerabilities 
are located in the news_detail, news_view and content asp modules with the bound vulnerable id parameter. 
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection vulnerability result in dbmsor web application compromise. 


Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] news_Detail.asp
				[+] newsview.asp
				[+] contents.aspx

Vulnerable Parameter(s):		
				[+] id



Proof of Concept:
=================
The remote sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account & 
without required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
