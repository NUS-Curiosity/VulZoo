Subject: GreHack 2012 - LAST Call For Papers (Grenoble, France) till 15th
 August 2012

----------------------------------------------
*GreHack 2012* LAST Call For Papers .. till 15th August 2012.
----------------------------------------------
http://grehack.org GreHack 2012 conference will take place in Grenoble
(Alps), France on October 19th-20th 2012 and brings together students,
academia, industry and government to exchange knowledge around
emerging issues in the security + hacking world. During the night, a
Capture The Flag will take place. Each paper is peer reviewed at least 3 times.

---------------------
*Suggested Topics (not limited to)*
---------------------
http://grehack.org/en/index.php/GreHack_2012-Call_For_Papers-english/
- Track: ethical, legal and philosophical
-- greyhat hacking: a consumer advance, or a risk for worldwide security?
-- current state of laws relative to cyber-security and hacking +
justified suggestions of modifications

- Track: technical
-- Hadopi: why is it a technical and legal failure? how to exploit in
memory vulnerabilities of Hadopi approved software?
-- In Memory Vulnerabilities
  --- Windows 8: heap analysis, kernel structures and new memory protections
  --- Exploit Corner: come present us your last sploit!
-- Hardcore Penetration Testing
  --- Code obfuscation to complicate Reverse Engineering
  --- Discrete Attacks (eg: without writing on the filesystem)
  --- Hypervisor evasion
  --- Vulnerabilities and exploits on defensive security tools (eg:
AntiMalwares, Firewalls, IDS)
-- Attacking Infrastructures
  --- Internet: how to root your ***box? Which security
functionalities (and properties) are provided? How to bypass them?
  --- ipsec, ipv6
  --- routing protocols
  --- wireless: 802.11, r√©seaux 3G, 4G, WiMAX, RFID
  --- sensor networks
-- Malwares and Botnets
  --- state of the art of botnets redundancy mechanism
  --- self-code modification (polymorphism) of malwares
  --- ability of antimalwares to detect slighly mutated samples
  --- vulnerabilities in antimalwares drivers

- Track: research
-- Learning and Offensive Security
  --- static and dynamic analysis
  --- dumb/simple/basic fuzzing and smart-fuzzing for automating
vulnerability detection
  --- metrics for exploitability of vulns (in memory, web)
  --- model checking
  --- advances in reverse-engineering automation and model inference
  --- concolic execution
-- Hardware Attacks
  --- nanotechnology
  --- fault injection in memory via laser
  --- smart cards
  --- transportations
  --- medical tools
  --- embedded malwares
-- Cryptology
  --- influence of the environment on PRNG entropy
  --- mathematic aspects in current cryptology
-- Defensive Security
  --- Trust Based Computing
  --- New Access Control Models for processes isolation
  --- New H/W + S/W for increasing the cost of exploitation

*Remark*
- We highly encourage original topics that break with traditional
research directions
- We will favor presentations with tools demonstrations or results
