ZDI-12-152 :  Oracle Outside In Excel MergeCells Record Parsing Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-152
August 22, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

- -- Affected Products:
Oracle Outside In

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of applications that utilize Oracle's Outside In
Technology. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in
that the target must visit open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of Excel files. When handling
the MergeCells record, the process does not properly validate size values
which can lead to an integer overflow. The resulting value is used to
allocate a heap buffer which can be corrupted by an attacker to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
