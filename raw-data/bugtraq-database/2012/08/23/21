ZDI-12-165 : (0Day) HP Operations Agent for NonStop Server HEALTH Packet
Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-165
August 22, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

- -- Affected Products:
Hewlett-Packard Operations Agent for NonStop

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Operations Agent for NonStop Server. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must check the status of an existing node on the network.

The specific flaw exists within ELinkService process which listens on TCP
ports 7771 and 8976 by default. The process performs insufficient bounds
checking on user-supplied data within in a HEALTH packet prior to copying
it into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. Remote, unauthenticated
attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed message
packets to the target, which could ultimately lead to arbitrary code
execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.

- -- Vendor Response:
This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in
accordance with the ZDI 180 day deadline.
