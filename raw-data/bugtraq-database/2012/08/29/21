- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of EMC ApplicationXtender. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the WxSuperCtrl650.ocx ActiveX control. By
manipulating a combination of the DisplayImageFile, AnnoLoad and AnnoSave
methods, the vulnerable AnnoSave() method can enable an attacker to save
arbitrary files inside arbitrary locations. The attacker is able to control
the file extension and the creation path via a directory traversal issue.
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the
context of the process.
