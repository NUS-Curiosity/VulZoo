ZDI-12-171 : (0Day) Hewlett-Packard Intelligent Management Center UAM
sprintf Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-171
August 29, 2012

- -- CVE ID:


- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

- -- Affected Products:
Hewlett-Packard Intelligent Management Center

- -- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Intelligent Management Center.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the uam.exe component which listens by default on
UDP port 1811. When logging received actions to a log file, sprintf is used
to build the log message. The process does not properly verify the
destination buffer on the stack is of sufficient size to handle the newly
created string. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

- -- Vendor Response:


- -- Mitigation:
The overall design of the Intelligent Management Center assumes it runs as
an application on a Windows server. Given the stated purpose of Intelligent
Management Center, and the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient
mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted
machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural
relationship with the HP Intelligent Management Center should be permitted
to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways,
most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available
in the native Windows Firewall, as described in
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx and
numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.
