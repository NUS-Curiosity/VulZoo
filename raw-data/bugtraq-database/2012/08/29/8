ZDI-12-167 : (0Day) Novell File Reporter NFRAgent.exe VOL Tag Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-167
August 29, 2012

- -- CVE ID:

- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Novell

- -- Affected Products:
Novell File Reporter

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell File Reporter Agent. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within NFRAgent.exe which communicates with the
Agent component over HTTPS on TCP port 3037. When parsing tags inside the
VOL element, the process performs insufficient bounds checking on
user-supplied data prior to copying it into a fixed-length buffer on the
stack. This vulnerability can result in remote code execution under the
context of the SYSTEM account.

- -- Vendor Response:


- -- Mitigation:
Given the stated purpose of File Reporter, and the nature of the
vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict
interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and
servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the Novell File
Reporter Agent should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be
accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall
rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows
Firewall, as described in
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx and
numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.
