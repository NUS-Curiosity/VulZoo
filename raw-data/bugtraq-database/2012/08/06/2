ZDI-12-129 : Microsoft Windows TrueType Font Parsing Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability (Remote Kernel)
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-129
August  3, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0159

- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

- -- Affected Products:
Microsoft Windows XP SP3
Microsoft Windows Vista
Microsoft Windows 7


- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code from
the contact of kernelspace on vulnerable installations of Microsoft
Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that
the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the kernel's support for TrueType font
parsing of compound glyphs. A sign extension error exists in win32k.sys
when processing compound glyphs having a total number of contours above
0x7FFF. This can be exploited to corrupt kernel heap memory placed below
the space allocated for the "flags" buffer and potentially execute
arbitrary code in kernel space.

- -- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
