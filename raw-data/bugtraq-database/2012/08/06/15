Package        : isc-dhcp
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4539 CVE-2012-3571 CVE-2012-3954

It was discovered that the recent update for isc-dhcp, did not contain
the patched code included in the source package.  Due to quirk in the
build system those patches were deapplied during the build process.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze6.

We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.
