Package        : xen
Vulnerability  : Denial of Service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3432 CVE-2012-3433
Debian Bug     : 683279

Several denial-of-service vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen,
the popular virtualization software. The Common Vulnerabilities and 
Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2012-3432

 Guest mode unprivileged code, which has been granted the privilege to 
 access MMIO regions, may leverage that access to crash the whole guest.
 Since this be used to crash a client from within, this vulnerability is
 consider with low impact.

CVE-2012-3433

 A guest kernel can cause the host to become unresponsive for a period
 of time, potentially leading to a DoS. Since an attacker with full
 control in the guest can impact on the host, this vulnerability is
 consider with high impact.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
