CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2240 CVE-2012-2241 CVE-2012-2242 CVE-2012-3500

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in devscripts, a set of
scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier.
The following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ids have
been assigned to identify them:

CVE-2012-2240:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that dscverify does not perform
    sufficient validation and does not properly escape arguments to
    external commands, allowing a remote attacker (as when dscverify is
    used by dget) to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-2241:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that dget allows an attacker to delete
    arbitrary files when processing a specially-crafted .dsc or
    .changes file, due to insuficient input validation.

CVE-2012-2242:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that dget does not properly escape
    arguments to external commands when processing .dsc and .changes
    files, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    This issue is limited with the fix for CVE-2012-2241, and had
    already been fixed in version 2.10.73 due to changes to the code,
    without considering its security implications.

CVE-2012-3500:

    Jim Meyering, Red Hat, discovered that annotate-output determines
    the name of temporary named pipes in a way that allows a local
    attacker to make it abort, leading to denial of service.


Additionally, a regression in the exit code of debdiff introduced in
DSA-2409-1 has been fixed.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.10.69+squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.12.3.

We recommend that you upgrade your devscripts packages.
