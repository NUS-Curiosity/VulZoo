Package        : isc-dhcp
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3955

Glen Eustace discovered that the ISC DHCP server, a server for automatic
IP address assignment, is not properly handling changes in the expiration
times of a lease.  An attacker may use this flaw to crash the service
and cause denial of service conditions, by reducing the expiration time
of an active IPv6 lease.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze8.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.4-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.
