Cisco Response
==============

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) would like
to notify customers of an issue that may impact their network security
posture when upgrading the Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switches to
Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) with deployments that have Cisco
Virtual Security Gateway (VSG) integration. This issue will manifest
itself when administrators perform an in-service software upgrade to
Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) from Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.1a)
or earlier.

After the software upgrade, a bug in Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2)
could cause all the virtual Ethernet ports on the Virtual Ethernet
Modules (VEM) of the Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switch to stay in
No-Policy pass-through mode because a valid VSG license is not
actively installed. As a result, the VEMs no longer use a configured
Cisco VSG; therefore, the virtual machines (VM) are not firewalled and
traffic is not inspected by the VSG.

This software bug is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCud01427 and a
software bulletin for Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) is in the
process of being published. Additional Information
