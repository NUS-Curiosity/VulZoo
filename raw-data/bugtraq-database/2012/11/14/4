Subject: Security advisory for Bugzilla 4.4rc1, 4.2.4, 4.0.9 and 3.6.12

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Confidential product and component names can be disclosed to
  unauthorized users if they are used to control the visibility of
  a custom field.

* When calling the 'User.get' WebService method with a 'groups'
  argument, it is possible to check if the given group names exist
  or not.

* Due to incorrectly filtered field values in tabular reports, it is
  possible to inject code which can lead to XSS.

* When trying to mark an attachment in a bug you cannot see as
  obsolete, the description of the attachment is disclosed in the
  error message.

* A vulnerability in swfstore.swf from YUI2 can lead to XSS.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.
