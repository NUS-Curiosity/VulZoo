Package        : radsecproxy
Vulnerability  : SSL certificate verification weakness
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4523 CVE-2012-4566

Ralf Paffrath reported that Radsecproxy, a RADIUS protocol proxy, mixed up 
pre- and post-handshake verification of clients. This vulnerability may
wrongly accept clients without checking their certificate chain under 
certain configurations.

Raphael Geissert spotted that the fix for CVE-2012-4523 was incomplete, 
giving origin to CVE-2012-4566. Both vulnerabilities are fixed with this 
update.

Notice that this fix may make Radsecproxy reject some clients that are 
currently (erroneously) being accepted.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your radsecproxy packages.
