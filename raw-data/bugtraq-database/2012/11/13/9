I don't think this statement on your website makes much sense:

    A user can download Wisecracker™ on a GPU cluster virtual machine
    provided by Amazon EC2® and reverse an MD5 cryptographic hash for
    a 6 character password in about 20 minutes if using 1 virtual
    machine or in about 3 minutes if using 2 or more.

What does "2 or more" mean here? If I use two machines in parallel, that's
more than six times as fast as only using one machine? Seems weird to me.
