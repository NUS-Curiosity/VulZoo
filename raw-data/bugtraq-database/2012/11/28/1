Package        : rssh
Vulnerability  : insufficient filtering of rsync command line
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2251 CVE-2012-2252 
Debian Bug     : 

James Clawson discovered that rssh, a restricted shell for OpenSSH to be used
with scp/sftp, rdist and cvs, was not correctly filtering command line options.
This could be used to force the execution of a remote script and thus allow
arbitrary command execution. Two CVE were assigned:

CVE-2012-2251
	Incorrect filtering of command line when using rsync protocol. It was
	for example possible to pass dangerous options after a "--" switch. The rsync
	protocol support has been added in a Debian (and Fedora/Red Hat) specific
	patch, so this vulnerability doesn't affect upstream.

CVE-2012-2251
	Incorrect filtering of the "--rsh" option: the filter preventing usage of the
	"--rsh=" option would not prevent passing "--rsh". This vulnerability affects
	upstream code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.2-13squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.
