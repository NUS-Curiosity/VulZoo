Subject: Google Chrome HTTPS Address Bar Spoofing


Google awarded one of our security researchers a Chromium Security Reward for an
HTTPS address bar spoofing bug in Chrome 14 and 15 (although it may be present in
older versions too). The bug was fixed in Chrome 16, most browsers seem to be updated
and we're happy to share technical details with the research community.
