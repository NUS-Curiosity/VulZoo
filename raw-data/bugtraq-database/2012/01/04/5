We haven't verified whether local LAN could be sniffed or ARP tables of 
other
hosts manipulated. We focused on the ability to sniff http and https traffic
originating from the set-top box as they were in particular interesting for
us. And we did this sniffing at the middleware level by intercepting certain
API calls, not at the OS/raw socket level.

Taking into account set-top box's OS type and its available API 
interfaces, we
expect that raw network access (listening for and sending raw TCP/IP 
packets)
should be however possible.

Thanks.
