Advisory Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in ImpressCMS, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting and local file inclusion attacks. 

1) Input appended to the URL after notifications.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:


<form action='http://[host]/notifications.php/"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="del_not" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="delete_ok" value="">
<input type="submit" value="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>


Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that Apache's directive "AcceptPathInfo" is set to "on" or "default" (default value is "default"). 

2) Input appended to the URL after /modules/system/admin/images/browser.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/modules/system/admin/images/browser.php/%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E/?op=listimg&imgcat_id=1&target=&type=ibrow

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that Apache's directive "AcceptPathInfo" is set to "on" or "default" (default value is "default"). 

3) Input appended to the URL after /modules/content/admin/content.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/modules/content/admin/content.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E/

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that Apache's directive "AcceptPathInfo" is set to "on" or "default" (default value is "default"). 

4) Input passed via the "icmsConfigPlugins[sanitizer_plugins]" GET parameter to edituser.php is not properly verified before being used to include local files. 
This can be exploited to include local files via directory traversal sequences and URL-encoded NULL bytes.

The following PoC is available:

http://[host]/edituser.php?icmsConfigPlugins[sanitizer_plugins][]=../../../tmp/file%00

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the attacker is registered and logged-in, "magic_quotes_gpc" are off and "Profile" module is disabled.

Solution: Upgrade to ImpressCMS 1.2.7 Final or 1.3.1 Final
