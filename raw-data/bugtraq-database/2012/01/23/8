Vulnerability  : out-of-bounds read
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0050

Antonio Martin discovered a denial-of-service vulnerability in
OpenSSL, an implementation of TLS and related protocols.  A malicious
client can cause the DTLS server implementation to crash.  Regular,
TCP-based TLS is not affected by this issue.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8g-15+lenny16.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze7.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.0.0g-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
