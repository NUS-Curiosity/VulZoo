AdaCore Security Advisory
=========================

SA-2012-L119-003 Hash collisions in AWS

  Problem:    Impacted versions of AWS store key/value pairs from submitted
              form data in hash tables using a hash function that has
              predictable collisions. As a result, a single specially crafted
              HTTP request can cause the server to use hours of CPU time,
              thus causing a denial of service.

  Impact:     All AWS releases and wavefronts prior to 2012-01-21

  Status:     This was fixed in AWS 2.11 and 2.10.2 on 2012-01-21
