Subject: First-hop security in IPv6

Folks,

FYI:
<http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/tip/First-hop-security-in-IPv6>

"This article provides an introduction to the concept of first-hop
security and discusses the challenge of trying to apply the techniques
currently enforced in IPv4 networks to emerging IPv6 deployments."

P.S.: The whole article is available online, and you can read it even
without registering... just scroll the web page...

Best regards,
