- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within the JP2Deco component which is used when handling
an mjp2 sample. This sample format (JPEG2000) has a required COD marker
segment (0xff52) followed by a COD length value. When extracting the
contents of this section the application subtracts from this length
before passing it into a call to memcpy. A remote attacker can exploit
this error to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user.

- -- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
