Subject: SafeSEH+SEHOP all-at-once bypass explotation method principles

Hello,

I wrote this to introduce a small paper for my exploitation method of SafeSEH+SEHOP bypass in Oct, 2010.
(http://www.x90c.org/SEH all-at-once attack.pdf, http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15184)

Sadly it's not portable. But leave some thoughts about the method.
