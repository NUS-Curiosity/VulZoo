Subject: InfoSec Southwest 2012 Open Registration

Hello,

I just wanted to drop everyone a quick note and let you all know that
registration for InfoSec Southwest 2012 is now open.  You can register
for the conference using the links to our registration portal provided
on the conference registration page:

http://www.infosecsouthwest.com/registration.html

If you intend to attend the conference, we ask that you please register
as early as possible using our registration portal.  As this is our
first conference, it would greatly help us in planning and logistics
(such as ordering badges) to have a more accurate idea of expected
attendance, which early registration will definitely help with.  To
reward early registration, we have set up a tiered registration pricing
model.  Each block of registrations is limited in quantity up to the
final block which is unlimited in quantity and will be available both
via the registration portal and on-site:

Block		Price
Block 1		$110.00
Block 2		$120.00
Block 3		$130.00
Block 4		$140.00
Block 5		$150.00
Block 6		$160.00
On-site		$160.00 CASH ONLY

As each block of registrations is exhausted the next block will become
available.

We also have discounted registration available for students at $90.00.

Currently, we have the following speakers and lectures scheduled for
presentation at the conference:

Peiter "Mudge" Zatko - Keynote
Nick DePetrillo & Lurene "pusscat" Grenier - Le Chat-SEC
Joshua "jduck" Drake - Exploiting Memory Corruption in the Java Runtime
Joseph "AverageJoe" Giron - Creating your own windows debugger in C
Gursev Sing Kalra - Attacking CAPTCHAs for Fun and Profit
Karthik Raman - Selecting Features to Classify Malware

You can find out more about our speakers and lectures on the website:

Our remaining speakers and their lecture topics will be announced
shortly after our CFP closes on February 1st.  If you are interested in
speaking at the conference, you can review our CFP information here:

Finally, we would like to thank our sponsors, without whom this
conference would not be possible:

(Silver)     RIM BlackBerry Security
(Silver)     Leviathan Security Group
