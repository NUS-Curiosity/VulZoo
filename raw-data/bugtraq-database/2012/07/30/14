Vulnerable: TEMENOS T24 R07.03 

TEMENOS T24 is prone to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and obtain sensitive information.

TEMENOS T24 R07.03 is known to be vulnerable. Other versions may also be vulnerable.

To exploit this issue, an attacker must entice an unsuspecting victim into following a malicious URI, for example:

http://127.0.0.1/jsps/genrequest.jsp?&routineName=OS.NEW.USER&routineArgs=MENU&skin=default"></head><body+onunload=alert('XSS')>&compId=IE01&compScreen=COMPOSITE.SCREEN_PENTADMONE_000043700003&contextRoot=&windowName=menu000043700002&user=user1

Vendor is aware of this vulnerability.
