Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco TelePresence Recording Server

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20120711-ctrs

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 July 11 16:00  UTC (GMT)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco TelePresence Recording Server contains the following vulnerabilities:

 Cisco TelePresence Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability
 Cisco TelePresence Web Interface Command Injection
 Cisco TelePresence Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Exploitation of the Cisco TelePresence Malformed IP Packets Denial of
Service Vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to
create a denial of service condition, preventing the product from
responding to new connection requests and potentially causing some
services and processes to crash.

Exploitation of the Cisco TelePresence Web Interface Command Injection
may allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary
commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.

Exploitation of the Cisco TelePresence Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability may allow allow an unauthenticated,
adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

Cisco has released updated software that resolves the command and code
execution vulnerabilities.  There are currently no plans to resolve
the malformed IP packets denial of service vulnerability, as this
product is no longer being actively supported.

There are no workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Customers should contact their Cisco Sales Representative to determine
the Business Unit responsible for their Cisco TelePresence Recording
Server.
