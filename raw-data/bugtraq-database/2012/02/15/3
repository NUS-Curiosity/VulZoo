Subject: FreePBX Remote Exploit

FreePBX web interface remote vulnerability

The admin username and password for the web interface is stored in plain
text in this publicly accessible file:
http://yourip/admin/modules/framework/bin/gen_amp_conf.php

Which allows a hacker to access the web GUI and view the
secrets(passwords) for each extension in plain test, as well as change the
outbound routes.

Further details on this exploit can be found here:

This was claimed to have been fixed around December 2011, however the
vulnerability never made it to bugtraq.

I have confirmed this has been fixed as of:
FreePBX 2.10.0rc1.1 and distro release 1.88.210.57-1

And it appears to have affected versions for at least 1 year prior to
their fix.
