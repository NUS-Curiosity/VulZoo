1. ./administration/install.php opens ../functions/db_connect.php and writes to file without input validation leading to PHP code injection with all variables if any contains for example: ";} ?> <?php print("Hello World"); exit("") ?>

Note that install guide in web says: "after instalation is complete, delete the "install.php" file" and install.php does not need permissions.

2. ./administration/create_album.php does not have proper input validation leading to stored XSS, which can only be added by administrators, but I don't think this as a limit after other vulnerabilities. XSS will also be shown to normal users (mainpage).
