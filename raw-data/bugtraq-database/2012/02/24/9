- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Java Webstart handles the
'java-vm-args' parameter in the j2se tag within a jnlp file. Due to
insufficient sanitation it is possible to add additional double quotes
to the commandline argument string used to start a new java process.
This can lead to remote code execution under the rights of the current user.


- -- Vendor Response:

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
