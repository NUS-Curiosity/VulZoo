- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within JavaFX, a downloadable Java extension.
The JavaFX Jar file is signed by Oracle and can be installed without
user interaction. Once installed it is possible to invoke the main
method of any trusted class with arbitrary arguments and with a trusted
call stack. This can be leveraged to remote code execution under the
context of the user.
