Subject: DEF CON 20 Capture the Flag Announcement

The 20th anniversary of DEF CON is almost on us!

To help make this year even more memorable I have been working with DDTEK
and other CTF organizers to continue to grow the contest on a number of
levels.

Thinking of competing in the pre-qualifiers? Planning to seriously compete
this year? This announcement is to get you up to speed on what we have been
thinking.

First - Grow the CTF.
This year there will be more teams battling it out. 20 teams for DEF CON 20!
This is up from last year's 12. There will be more teams that pre-qual, as
well as more teams that get seated automatically by winning other well-known
and respected CTF contests around the world.
Here is the breakdown:

11 teams pre-qualify online - The announcement will be April 1st, 2012 at
DDTEK http://www.ddtek.biz/
7 winning teams from other CTF events - See below
1 The returning champions from DEF CON 19 CTF - The European Nopsled Team

    We have one other in mind and are waiting to see if/when they announce
for this year.

You can always compete in multiple CTF events as well as try to qualify
on-line. Your journey to DEF CON 20 CTF glory may be long, but there are
many paths to get there.
Second - Help out the teams

DEF CON has been running a Capture the Flag contest as an official event
since DEF CON 4, but it really started informally at DEF CON 3 (Some say 2).

Teams always battled it out because they wanted to, not because there was
any prize money or sponsorships from soda companies or manufacturers.

I want to help that original spirit of competition continue to grow! DEF CON
will do something it has never done before. All teams will get two hotel
rooms for four nights, Thursday through Sunday, for free. No, the mini bar
is not included! This should help remove some of the financial burden off
teams, and allow them to focus on the contest. By staying over Sunday you
can enjoy some of the after parties Sunday night too!

Good luck with your quest! I hope to see you at DEF CON 20!
