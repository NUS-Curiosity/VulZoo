This is not what the OP or CVE describe:

Which I read as: if I compromise user1's account then I can snoop user1's DBUS sessions.  It says nothing about me being able to snoop user2's sessions.  The leading phrase about attackers gaining user-level access implies that legitimate users on a system are not a relevant issue.

I believe that clarification is in order.
