Subject: Buffalo LinkStation LS-WTGL Default Admin Account & Guest Access Information

After reading l0rd lunatic's post about the Buffalo router
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Nov/234), noticed that going
to login page and clicking 'help' will show you the default admin
account. I think that is what he meant about information disclosure!
It also lets you login as guest and provides more information.

Clicking help:

Until you change it, the default username is "admin" and the default

and then press enter.

When you login as guest, it gives up this information:
