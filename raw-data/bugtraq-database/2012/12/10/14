Snare for Linux Cross-Site Request Forgery


I. BACKGROUND
----------------------
Snare for Linux provides a 'C2' or 'CAPP' style audit 
subsystem for the Linux operating system. It can be
used as a standalone auditing tool for Linux, or can 
send data to the Snare Server for analysis and storage. 


II. DESCRIPTION
----------------------
A cross-site request forgery vulnerability (CSRF) has 
been identified in the web interface of Snare for Linux.
The parameter "ChToken," which is designed to prevent
CSRF, was not properly implemented in versions prior
to 1.7.0.  As a result, an attacker could force an
authenticated user to execute unwanted actions on the
web interface.


III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS
----------------------
All versions of Snare for Linux prior to 1.7.0 are vulnerable.


IV.
----------------------
Users should upgrade to version 1.7.0 of Snare for Linux.


V. Credit
----------------------
This vulnerability was discovered by Andrew Brooks.
