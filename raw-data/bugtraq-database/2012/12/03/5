Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
A non persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected in Fortinets FortiWeb 4000C, 3000C/3000CFsx, 1000C, 400C & Virtual Appliance.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with low or medium required user inter action 
and without local privileged application user account. The vulnerability is located in the Regular Expression - Validation (pcre_expression/validate) 
module with the bound vulnerable redir and mkey parameters. Successful exploitation results in client side account steal, client side phishing & 
client-side appliance module context request manipulation.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Regular Expression - Validation Module (pcre_expression/validate)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] redir
				[+] mkey


Proof of Concept:
=================
The client side cross site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without application user account and 
with medium required user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Code Review: Regular Expression - Validation Module (mkey & redir)

Solution:
=========
The vulnerability can be patched by parsing all mkey and redir success parameter requests of the vulnerable Regular Expression - Validation module.
