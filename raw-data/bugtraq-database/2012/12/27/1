Subject: Open-Realty CMS 3.x | Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability

1. OVERVIEW

Open-Realty CMS 3.x versions are vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery.


2. BACKGROUND

Open-Realty is the world's leading real estate listing marketing and
management CMS application, and has enjoyed being the real estate web
site software of choice for professional web site developers since
2002.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Open-Realty 3.x versions contain a flaw that allows a remote
Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack. The flaw exists
because the application does not require multiple steps or explicit
confirmation for sensitive transactions for majority of administrator
functions such as adding new user, assigning user to administrative
privilege. By using a crafted URL, an attacker may trick the victim
into visiting to his web page to take advantage of the trust
relationship between the authenticated victim and the application.
Such an attack could trick the victim into executing arbitrary
commands in the context of their session with the application, without
further prompting or verification.


4. VERSIONS AFFECTED
