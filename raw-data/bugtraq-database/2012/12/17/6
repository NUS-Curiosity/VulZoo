Subject: RE: PHP Addressbook v8.2.5 Group Name XSS

I can confirm that the below vulnerability also applies v8.2.5, the
latest version.

PHP Addressbook software URL:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-addressbook/?source=directory

I don't mean to clog the list but I was doing research on an earlier
version and didn't realize that a later version was also released.

 Instructions.
 
 After authentication, click on the Group tab at the top. Click on the
 New Group Button on the group page.
 
 For the group name (the first field) enter the following XSS test
 string:
 
 &lt;SCRIPT&gt;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
 
 
 Then call the XSS string from the URL -- technically one calls the
group
 name -- through the group parameter as such:
 
 http://[server]/index.php?group=%3CSCRIPT%3Ealert%28String.fromCharCode%2888%2C83%2C83%29%29%3C%2FSCRIPT%3E
 
 
 I emailed the apparent author but did not receive a reply.
