Subject: Foswiki Security Alert CVE-2012-6329,  CVE-2012-6330   Remote code
 execution and other vulnerabilities in MAKETEXT macro

---+ Security Alert: Code injection vulnerability in MAKETEXT macro,
Denial of Service vulnerability in MAKETEXT macro.

This advisory alerts you of a potential security issue with your Foswiki
installation. A vulnerability has been reported against the core Perl
module CPAN:Locale::Maketext, which Foswiki uses to provide translations
when {UserInterfaceInternationalization} is enabled in the
configuration. Because of this vulnerability it may be possible for a
user to run arbitrary shell commands and code on the server through a
crafted %MAKETEXT% macro. If your wiki allows commenting by users
without first logging in, then it may be possible for such an anonymous
user to exploit this vulnerability.


---++ Severity Level

Severity 1 issue: The web server can be compromised
The severity level was assigned by the Foswiki
Community.SecurityTaskTeam as documented in Development.SecurityAlertProcess

---++ Vulnerable Software Versions

All released versions of Foswiki are vulnerable to these issues

 - Foswiki 1.0.0 - 1.0.10
 - Foswiki 1.1.0 - 1.1.6

---++ MITRE Name for this Vulnerability

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CVE-2012-6329 to this vulnerability, see
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6329
CVE-2012-6330 was assigned to the Denial of Service vulnerability, see
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6330

---++ Attack Vectors

Editing wiki pages and HTTP POST requests towards a Foswiki server with
enabled localization (typically port 80/TCP). Typically, prior
authentication is necessary.

A crafted %MAKETEXT{}% macro will pass through strings to
Locale::Maketext where they are executed under the control of the CGI
user on the server.  Any user with the authority to edit a topic,
comment on a topic, or execute the Foswiki rendering code (eg. The
RenderPlugin) can take advantage of the vulnerability. (CVE-2012-6329)

A crafted %MAKETEXT{}% macro will consume large amounts of memory and
exhaust swap space.  (CVE-2012-6330)

---++ Impact

Arbitrary code execution on the server can expose the file system.

A second less severe Denial of Service vulnerability is also addressed
by this alert.

---++ Details

A crafted %MAKETEXT{}% macro can cause multiple issues:
   * Execute arbitrary code on the server by passing unsanitized strings
to Locale::Maketext.
   * Consume memory and swap space resulting in potential lockup or
crash due to %<nop>MAKETEXT{}% not validating the parameter numbers
supplied in the [_nnn] tokens.
   * Cause an exception within Foswiki, also due to invalid parameters
in [_nnn] tokens


---++ Countermeasures

One of the following should be done as soon as possible.

   * Manually Apply hotfix (see patch below). __or__
   * Apply the
[[Extensions.PatchItem12285Contrib][http://foswiki.org/Extensions/PatchItem12285Contrib]]
to your Foswiki 1.1.x system (Does not apply to Foswiki 1.0.x) __or__
   * Disable {UserInerfaceInternationalization} in your  LocalSite.cfg
_(Does not protect against [[SecurityAlert-CVE-2012-6330]])_ __or__
   * The foswiki debian package has already been updated with the hotfix
- use your preferred package management tool to update to foswiki 1.1.6-2

In addition,  CPAN:Locale::Maketext version 1.23 or newer should be
installed.

Upgrade to the latest patched production Download.FoswikiRelease01x01x07
once released

*The Foswiki patch fixes other issues with the %MAKETEXT% macro beyond
the code execution issue. Even if the new Locale::Maketext is installed,
it is strongly recommended to apply the Foswiki patch.*


---++ Hotfix for Foswiki Release 1.1.0 - 1.1.6

Install http://foswiki.org/Extensions.PatchItem12285Contrib and verify
that the patch has been applied to lib/Foswiki/Macros/MAKETEXT.pm. The
extension will attempt to apply two patches, and should report that 1
file was patched. Only one of the patches will match your system.   This
patch fixes both CVE-2012-6329 CVE-2012-6330.

On a properly patched system, %MAKETEXT{" [_101] "}% should return an
error.
> Excessive parameter number 101, MAKETEXT rejected. 

Note that this Contrib will also install the
Extensions.PatchFoswikiContrib as a prerequisite. PatchFoswikiContrib
patches the Extensions installer to accept the new style version strings
used for modules released as of 1.1.6.

---++ Hotfix for Foswiki Archived Release 1.0.0-1.0.10

This patch fixes both [[SecurityAlert-CVE-2012-6329]] and
[[SecurityAlert-CVE-2012-6330]].

This release should be manually patched.
