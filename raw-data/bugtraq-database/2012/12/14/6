Subject: Wordpress Pingback Port Scanner

Hi folks,
Wordpress 3.5 has it's XML-RPC Interface enabled by default. See here for more information:
http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/security/introduction-to-the-wordpress-xml-rpc-api/
http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5#Settings

I read through the article and took a look at the Pinback API since it is public available on many Wordpress installations.
The cool thing is: you can do a port scan using the Pingback API
You can even scan the server itself or discover some hosts on the internal Network this server is on.
So i wrote this little Ruby Script to utilize this "feature":

You can even use multiple Wordpress XML-RPC Interfaces to scan a single host so this can be some kind of distributed port scanning.
