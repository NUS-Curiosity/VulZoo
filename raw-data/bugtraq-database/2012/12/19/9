Subject: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in Cerberus FTP Server <= 5.0.5.1 [CVE-2012-6339]

Overview
===============
Cerberus FTP Server (http://www.cerberusftp.com/) is a secure and
reliable FTP server with many features and available functionality.

It was discovered that the Web Administration interface has multiple
persistent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. In the log
viewer there is a XSS vulnerability which may be used by an
unauthenticated user against an authenticated user. In the server
manager a trivial XSS vulnerability exists which may be used by the
authenticated user.

Analysis
===============
To start, the vulnerabilities in the on the "/servermanger" page is
trivial to exploit by escaping the "<textarea>" tags for each
available server message.

The "/log" is less trivial to exploit in that the log page uses
async-javascript callbacks to collect and display log data to the
user. The log clears itself in 2-3 seconds as well. This occurs
normally on an 8 second cycle and I in my experience it was difficult
to have the log populated with appropriate attack vectors during a
window to achieve exploitation.

I believe an administrative user would have to be logged in at the
time of the attack and actively viewing the "/log" page to achieve
successful exploitation. Due to these limitations I believe this to
have a significant effect on the impact and reliability on any
possible exploit code.
