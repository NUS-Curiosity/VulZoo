I think some of this kerfuffle could have been avoided if the
backtrack (or wicd) team had been contacted for a response prior to
releasing the bug, as you would expect during a responsible disclosure
process (e.g. see RFPolicy, or just common sense). It would have then
been fairly obvious about who owned the bug, as it were.

It's not an uninteresting issue, but let's follow process a bit better
next please? Better for everyone involved.

cheers,
 Jamie
