Introduction:
=============
PRITLOG is an extremely simple, small (< 500K uncompressed) and powerful blog system. It does not use or need 
a MYSQL database and fully works based on Sqlite. Sqlite is very similar to flat files and does not need any 
server setup and comes as default with most PHP5 installations. Just drop Pritlog into your server and it 
starts running. No separate installation is required.

Feature(s):
* WYSIWYG editor - nicEdit
* Admin interface (change site properties, add authors, change password)\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\'
* Easy translation. Language selection available in the admin panel. Language files must be created.
* Sticky Posts
* Integrated login system with registration
* Pretty Urls
* SEO Optimization
* Page functionality for static pages
* Social Bookmarking widget: to enable easy sharing of post/blog
* Bbcode by editing html (work around)

Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in Pritlog v0.821 Content Management System.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-29:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Pritlog v0.821 Content Management System. The bugs 
allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). Successful exploitation 
of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires 
low user inter action. Attackers can inject malicious strings as author name to execute them when an admin is processing to preview, review 
or manage the listing of users. The bug is located on application side & the execution is persistent out of the user management web 
application context.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Manage User Listing - Username & Author

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ..
