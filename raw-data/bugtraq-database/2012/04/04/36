Arbor Networks has reviewed this report. This issue was addressed and 
fixed in Peakflow SP releases 5.1.1 patch 6 (released on November 30, 
2011) and later, 5.5 patch 4 (released on December 27, 2011) and later, 
and 5.6.0 patch 1 (released on September 14, 2011). This is not a current 
issue, therefore.

Customers who remain concerned should restrict web console access to 
trusted network locations via network access rules.

For future security issue reports, please use the address 
security@...or.net to establish communications. Arbor Networks take these 
reports very seriously and seeks to work with security researchers when 
possible to remedy any such issue.
