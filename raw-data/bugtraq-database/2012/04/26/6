Remote Firmware Update (RFU): The Remote Firmware Update (RFU) feature is enabled by default. A firmware update can be sent remotely to port 9100 without authentication. This could allow unauthorized modification of the device firmware. The unauthorized firmware could impact the confidentiality and integrity of data sent to and received from the device. The unauthorized firmware could also cause a Denial of Service (DoS) to the device.

RESOLUTION
The following steps can be taken to avoid unauthorized firmware updates:

Update the firmware to a version that implements code signing
Disable the Remote Firmware Update

The code signing feature verifies that firmware updates are properly signed. This will prevent the installation of invalid firmware updates.
