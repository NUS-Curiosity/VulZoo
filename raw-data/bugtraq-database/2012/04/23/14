Subject: [HITB-Announce] HITB Magazine Issue 008 (now with print edition!)

The 8th issue of the HITB Quarterly Magazine is now available for download!

http://magazine.hitb.org/

This edition is a little bit 'lighter' than previous issues as the
editorial team is busy working on an extra special release for our 10th
year anniversary conference in October, HITBSecConf2012 - Malaysia.

For the first time ever though, we're making print editions of the
magazine available (courtesy of HP MagCloud) - A print edition of the
HITB Quarterly is a perfect addition for your coffee table or office
reception area and we'll be making past issues also available for print
over the next couple of weeks.

We're hoping that print sales will allow us to pay our authors and
contributors for their articles, so ordering a print copy is a way for
you to help support them! Putting together content for the magazine is
practically a full time job and it would be nice to offer authors some
form of compensation for the time and energy taken to produce the high
quality articles that you all enjoy.

Enjoy the issue and hopefully see you at #HITB2012AMS in May:
