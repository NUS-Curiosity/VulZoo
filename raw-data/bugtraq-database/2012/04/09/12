Subject: OWASP ZAP 1.4.0 released

Hi folks,

I'm very pleased to announce that version 1.4.0 of the OWASP Zed
Attack Proxy (ZAP) has now been released.

This release adds the following main features:
* Syntax highlighting
* fuzzdb integration
* Parameter analysis
* Enhanced XSS scanner
* A port of some of the Watcher checks
* Plugable extensions

And a load of bugfixes!

I will also be talking about ZAP at the OWASP AppSec Asia Pacific
conference on Saturday 14th April:

- please come over and say hi!

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed code, language files,
enhancement requests, bug reports and general feedback.
