Forum very simple installation, this script is very light and yet it has several functionalities such as marking of read messages 
display tree with sending mail in case of response. It is also very easy to integrate in your site thanks to the insertion of pages

Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher discovered  a Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability on CsForum v0.8 application.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-08:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Low


Details:
========
A client side cross site scripting vulnerability is detected on the CsForum v0.8 application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker with privileged user account to hijack customer/moderator/admin sessions with high required user inter 
action. Successful exploitation can result in account steal or client side context manipulation when processing affected module
application requests.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                      [+] read.php
