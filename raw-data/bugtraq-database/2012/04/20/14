Subject: Oracle Enterprise Manager vulnerable to Session fixation
 (CVE-2012-0528)

Hash: SHA1

AppSecInc Team SHATTER Security Advisory

Oracle Enterprise Manager vulnerable to Session fixation.

Risk Level:
Low

Affected versions:
Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Control 10.2.0.5, 11.1.0.7 (and
previous patchsets)


Remote exploitable:
Yes

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martinez
Fayo of Application Security Inc.

Details:
Authenticating a web user without invalidating any existing session
identifier gives an attacker the opportunity to steal authenticated
sessions.
Oracle Enterprise Manager authenticates a user without first
invalidating the existing session ID, thereby continuing to use the same
session ID already associated with the session.  This can be exploited
in shared computer environments if the attacker navigates to the login
web page /em/console/logon/logon and records the session ID associated,
then closes the browser.  When a legitimate user logs on, the same
Session ID will be used so the attacker will be able to take over the
session and perform operations on the victim's behalf.

Impact:
An attacker who has access to a computer with a web browser that will
later be used in an Oracle Enterprise Manager web session, can know
which session ID will be used, therefore will be able to impersonate the
legitimate user.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update April 2012 available at Oracle Support.

CVE-2012-0528
