Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2012-0884

	Ivan Nestlerode discovered a weakness in the CMS and PKCS #7
	implementations that could allow an attacker to decrypt data
	via a Million Message Attack (MMA).

CVE-2012-1165

	It was discovered that a NULL pointer could be dereferenced
	when parsing certain S/MIME messages, leading to denial of
	service.

CVE-2012-2110

	Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team, discovered a vulnerability
	in the way DER-encoded ASN.1 data is parsed that can result in
	a heap overflow.


Additionally, the fix for CVE-2011-4619 has been updated to address an
issue with SGC handshakes.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze11.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1a-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
