Subject: Android information leak

----------------------------
Vulnerability Description
----------------------------

We found that any android application can read all world-readable files in 
the "/proc" directory without specifying any permissions in their manifest 
files. This can leak sensitive information. For example, if the user is not 
using a network proxy, a malicious application without any permission to 
access the user's browsing history can find the websites the user visits 
by simply periodically reading "/proc/net/tcp". 

Even if the user uses a network proxy we found that a malicious application 
can identify the websites the user visits by periodically monitoring the 
browser process's memory usage through "/proc/<pid>/statm" and comparing the 
measurements with pre-computed signatures. We also found that a malicious 
application can measure the inter key-stroke timings of user's typing by 
simply monitoring scheduling statistics from "/proc/<pid>/status".
