Introduction:
=============
Switchvox is based on the open source IP PBX, Asterisk, and the Linux operating system. It provides an easy 
to deploy solution for businesses looking for the power of an enterprise PBX with high reliability, excellent support, 
and low cost. The simple point-and-click online interface allows virtually anyone to set up and manage the system, 
and because it comes as a pre-configured turnkey package, the server and phones are all plug and play. Switchvox now 
offers a free edition. This edition is limited to 15 Extensions (Requires Free registration) and does not support the 
digital Digium cards, other than that it is similar to the SOHO version.

Switchvox supports unlimited extensions and has all the basic features that you d expect from a PBX, like voicemail, 
custom music on hold, time based behaviors, conferencing, call parking, intercom and paging. It also includes features 
that are typically associated with expensive enterprise systems, such as ACD queues, find me/follow me functionality, 
unlimited powerful IVR menus that can interact with your company s databases (Press one for sales or please enter your 
account number followed by the pound key...), MS Outlook integration, and advanced call reporting.

Starting at $995, Switchvox is suitable for businesses of one person to hundreds looking to elevate their communication, 
improve productivity, and save money on long distance charges. Switchvox supports VoIP, regular phone lines, and voice 
T1 connections, so that your business can configure the system to best handle your typical calling behavior.

Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple persistent web vulnerabilities in the Switchvox Appliance with Asterisk v5.1.2.


Report-Timeline:
================
2011-09-10:	Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Switchvox Appliance with Asterisk v5.1.2.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side. The vulnerabilities are 
located in setup and tools modules of the admin panel. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session 
hijacking (manager/admin) or stable context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & low or medium 
privileged user web application account.


Vulnerable Module(s): 
				[+] Tools -> Sound Manager -> Create sound 
				[+] Tools -> SugarCRM switchboard Panel -> setup
				[+] Setup -> Groups -> Create Extension Group
				[+] Setup -> Outgoing calls -> Create Outgoing Call rule
				[+] Setup -> Incoming Calls -> Caller DID routes -> Create Single DID Route
				[+] Setup -> Incoming Calls -> Caller ID Rules -> Create Call transfer Call

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] [Description]
				[+] [SugarCRM Web URL] [SugarCRM SOAP URL] 
				[+] [Note]


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent vulnerabilities can be exploited by local low privileged user account with low or medium required user inter action.
