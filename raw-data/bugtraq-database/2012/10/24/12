I. BACKGROUND
---------------------

Java is a programming language and computing platform released by Sun
Microsystems (now Oracle). It is the underlying technology that powers
state-of-the-art programs including utilities, games, and business
applications.


II. DESCRIPTION
---------------------

VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team discovered a critical vulnerability
in Oracle Java.

The vulnerability is caused by a heap overflow error within the "t2k.dll"
component when processing a malformed "maxPointCount" field within a Font,
which could be exploited by remote attackers to compromise a vulnerable
system via a specially crafted web page.

CVSS Score: 10 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)


III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS
---------------------------

Oracle Java JRE 7u7 and prior
Oracle Java JDK 7u7 and prior


IV. Binary Analysis & Exploits/PoCs
