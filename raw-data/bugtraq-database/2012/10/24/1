Subject: F5 FirePass SSL VPN 4xxx Series | Arbitrary URL Redirection

1. OVERVIEW

F5 FirePass SSL VPN is vulnerable to Open URL Redirection.


2. BACKGROUND

F5 FirePass SSL VPN provides secure remote access to enterprise
applications and data for users over any device or network while
protecting your corporate. (See
http://www.f5.com/pdf/products/firepass-overview.pdf)


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

F5 FirePass SSL VPN contains a flaw that allows a remote cross site
redirection attack. This flaw exists because the application does not
validate the "refreshURL" parameter upon submission to the
"my.activation.cns.php3" script. This could allow a user to create a
specially crafted URL, that if clicked, would redirect a victim from
the intended legitimate web site to an arbitrary web site of the
attacker's choosing.
