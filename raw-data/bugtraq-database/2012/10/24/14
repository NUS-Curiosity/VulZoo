Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, Debian's
version of the Mozilla Firefox web browser.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2012-3982
	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
	allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
	corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
	Iceweasel does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
	A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
	implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
	code via unspecified vectors, related to the
	nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
	Iceweasel does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
	GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
	the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
	impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
	attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
	service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
	remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
	vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
	memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
	allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
	unspecified vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.5.16-19.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 10.0.8esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
