For what is is worth...
I'm running MR4 version (11.0.4000.2295) and executing the command under a non-privileged account does throw a dialog box with the error message.  It also puts an event in the application event log to the effect of "Faulting application smc.exe, version 11.0.4000.2261, faulting module msvcr80.dll, version 8.0.50727.1433, fault address 0x000079f", but watchng task manager SMC.EXE running under the SYSTEM user and SMCGUI.EXE running under the same non-privileged account never dies.  I do see an additional SMC.EXE process startup under the non-privileged user, but it is the process failing.  I also tried this running the command with an admin account with the same results.
