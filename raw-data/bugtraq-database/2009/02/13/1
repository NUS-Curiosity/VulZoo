Subject: Re: Denial of Service using Partial GET Request in Mozilla
 Firefox 3.06

It's been confirmed that this is not problem in IE. Sorry I didn't mention that. Microsoft uses Silverlight:

GET /index.php?page=Poem/Poem.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-application, application/vnd.ms-xpsdocument, application/xaml+xml, application/x-ms-xbap, application/x-shockwave-flash, application/x-silverlight, */*
Accept-Language: en-au
UA-CPU: x86
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30618)
Host: www.footprints-inthe-sand.com
Connection: Keep-Alive

It could either be because of what Sean said with the Range request or the Partial GET Request in Firefox. But I think you are probably correct Rolphin, as I've had a lot of Windows Media Player crashes recently. Either way, Windows Media Player should probably not be incorporated into Firefox if it's going to crash. A more stable platform should be used (such as Silverlight)
