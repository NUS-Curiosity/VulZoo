Hi Sandeep,

Are you saying this is supposed to affect 11.0.4000.x? If so, what
sub-sub-minor versions did you test it on?

I just tested this on 11.0.4000.2295 (on a managed client) and all it
did was crash the smc.exe process started by the command you supplied,
not smcgui.exe process. I tested as an administrator and an unprivileged
user and got the same results - smc.exe crashes, but not the smcgui.exe
process.

It would be interesting if you could provide more information, since if
this is actually doing what you say it's doing it would be a horrifying
attack vector for worms and viruses.

As an aside, I noticed that if I run "smc.exe -p" it crashes too, with
or without the tilde ("~") on the end. If I run "smc -p" (omit the .exe)
it doesn't crash, but "smc -p ~" crashes. (qualifying note: in all these
cases this is just the smc.exe process that was started by the command
that crashed, not the smcgui.exe process.) And yes, I tried adding the
space after the tilde as you originally quoted in the email :)

Regards,
Jon.

ps: A list of smc.exe command line parameters is available here:
