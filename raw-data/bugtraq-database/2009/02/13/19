Subject: ACM CCS '09: Call for Workshop Proposals

======================================================================
Call for Workshop Proposals:
16th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) 2009

Web page: http://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2009/cfw.shtml
======================================================================
Important Dates:

* Submission deadline: Saturday, February 28, 2009
======================================================================

Proposals are solicited for workshops to be held in conjunction with
ACM CCS 2009. Each workshop provides a forum to address a specific
topic at the forefront of security research.

A workshop must be a full day in length. Proceedings of all workshops
will be available (on a CD) to the workshop attendees. Each workshop
will also offer on-line proceedings through ACM Digital Library, with
a separate ISBN.


Workshop Proposal Submission
======================================================================

For new workshops, proposals should include:

* Workshop title
* A draft "Call for Papers" articulating the scope and topics covered
   by the workshop
* A brief summary and justification for the workshop, including
   anticipated benefits to the ACM CCS community.
* Planned activities
* Expected number of submissions and acceptance rate
* Expected number of attendees
* Program chair(s), and, if available, tentative program committee
* A one-paragraph biographical sketch for each organizer, describing
   relevant qualifications, including research and conference/workshop
   organizing experience

For previously-held workshops, in addition to the above, proposals
must provide the following information, for the most recent
incarnation of the workshop:

* Number of submissions
* Number of accepted papers
* Number of registered attendees

Please submit workshop proposals by email to the ACM CCS Workshop
Chair, Ting Yu (yu@....ncsu.edu). All workshop proposals will be
reviewed by the CCS Steering Committee.


Proposal Evaluation Criteria
======================================================================

* The workshop is within scope of computer and communications
   security and concerns a coherent and worthwhile technical
   topic.

* Its novelty with respect to other forums, especially with respect to
   other CCS workshops.

* Its likely impact on the target community, including likely high
   participation.

* One of the best ways to show likely interest is to have a strong set
   of researchers who have agreed to serve on the PC.


CCS Support for Workshops
======================================================================

If a workshop proposal is accepted, the ACM CCS workshop chair will
work closely with workshop organizers. The ACM CCS workshop chair will
help create/maintain the submission and reviewing websites for
workshops, and is responsible for monitoring and coordinating
organizational aspects of all workshops.
