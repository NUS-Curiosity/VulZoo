Hash: SHA1

CVE-2008-4308: Tomcat information disclosure vulnerability

Severity: Low

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Tomcat 4.1.32 to 4.1.34
Tomcat 5.5.10 to 5.5.20
Tomcat 6.0.x is not affected
The unsupported Tomcat 3.x, 4.0.x and 5.0.x versions may be also affected

Note: Although this vulnerability affects relatively old versions of
Apache Tomcat, it was only discovered and reported to the Apache Tomcat
Security team in October 2008. Publication of this issue was then
postponed until now at the request of the reporter.

Description:
Bug 40771 (https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40771) may
result in the disclosure of POSTed content from a previous request. For
a vulnerability to exist the content read from the input stream must be
disclosed, eg via writing it to the response and committing the
response, before the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs which will
halt processing of the request.

Mitigation:
Upgrade to:
4.1.35 or later
5.5.21 or later
6.0.0 or later

Example:
See original bug report for example of how to create the error condition.

Credit:
This issue was discovered by Fujitsu and reported to the Tomcat Security
Team via JPCERT.
