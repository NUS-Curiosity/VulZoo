Subject: Re: SFX-SQLi: A new SQL injection technique for MSSQL (dumps a table 
	in one request!)

Apparently the concept has been known to white hats as well, for some time.

Dennis Hurst from HP has this blog entry from December 2007:
http://www.communities.hp.com/securitysoftware/blogs/dennis/archive/2007/12/07/Project-Management-Institute-meeting-in-Alpharetta-GA-_2D00_-4-Dec-2007.aspx

In it, there's a link to a presentation he gave at Project Management
Institute meeting on December 6th, 2007. The link to the presentation
is:
http://www.communities.hp.com/securitysoftware/blogs/dennis/attachment/72396.ashx

In it, it's pretty clear that Dennis was aware of the "SELECT ... FOR
XML" trick at that time, and he also probably demonstrated it in
public. One of his slides reads as following:

demo
SQL Injection
(how to do this:' union select 1,1,(select * from
customers for xml auto) from sysobjects where '' = ')

I hope that settles it...
Thanks,
-Amit
