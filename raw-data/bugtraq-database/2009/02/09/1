Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in sudo may allow for privilege escalation.

Background
==========

sudo allows a system administrator to give users the ability to run
commands as other users.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/sudo       < 1.7.0                             >= 1.7.0

Description
===========

Harald Koenig discovered that sudo incorrectly handles group
specifications in Runas_Alias (and related) entries when a group is
specified in the list (using %group syntax, to allow a user to run
commands as any member of that group) and the user is already a member
of that group.

Impact
======

A local attacker could possibly run commands as an arbitrary system
user (including root).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All sudo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/sudo-1.7.0"
