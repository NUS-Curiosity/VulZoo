4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Free Download
Manager, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the Remote
Control Server when processing "Authorization" headers in HTTP
requests. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow
via an HTTP request containing an overly long "Authorization" header.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
