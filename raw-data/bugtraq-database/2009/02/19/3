Please note the following. I have reported this to Symantec at
https://forums.symantec.com/syment/board/message?board.id=endpoint_protection11&thread.id=25786&view=by_date_ascending&page=2




Symantec,



I have reported the second part of this to bugtraq, The first part I will in 
some time, Once I am done with this thread. The part before that is what 
this thread looks to be about.



1)



POC:



::Save the following as a batch file and execute it.

:here

taskkill /im smcgui.exe /f

goto :here



Its mainly bruteforcing the icon not to appear in the taskbar but doing more 
than that. The communication with the manager is lost(Though with smc.exe 
running under system account) and NTP is over and out from the SEP client 
console while this is running.



POC:



With the batch file running, Open the following executable which is the 
GUI(Not Icon) for SEP

"c:\Program Files\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection\symcorpui.exe"



If you have NTP installed, It would not be there and if you only have the 
NTP installed, It will say "No Problems detected- No protection technology 
is installed" and nothing in that board. If you go to help and support > 
Troubleshooting. The server is offline for the client.







All this might be purely cosmetic but guess there's time to get that patched 
up before mp2 rolls out.





2)



When the following command line is executed



"c:\program files\symantec\symantec endpoint protection\smcgui.exe" ~



 The error is thrown as below which lasts for a split second.



"Serious problem reading transaction from pipe - probable loss of 
synchonisation a and GetlastError return 6"



http://www.postimage.org/image.php?v=aV2in8dJ



and if executed in a batch file in the following way.



POC:



::Save the following as a batch file and execute it.

:here

"c:\program files\symantec\symantec endpoint protection\smcgui.exe" ~

goto :here





and run the filemon with the filter as smc.exe, Whenever it tries to access 
the smcgui.exe. There is a "Buffer Overflow" detected. As I have said at 
bugtrax as well, I am not sure if the buffer overflow has happened or 
averted but its all very interesting.





Regards, Sandeep Cheema
