Subject: Web Hacking Incidents update for Feb 10th

The Web Hacking Incidents Database (http://whid.webappsec.org), or WHID for
short, is a Web Application Security Consortium (http://www.webappsec.org)
project dedicated to maintaining a list of web applications related security
incidents. WHID goal is to serve as a tool for raising awareness of the web
application security problem and provide information for statistical
analysis of web applications security incidents.

The following incidents where added to WHID last week:

* WHID 2009-19: Kaspersky site breached using SQL injection, sensitive data
