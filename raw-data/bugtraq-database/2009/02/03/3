Subject: Web Hacking Incidents update for Feb 3rd


The incidents reported on WHID (the web hacking incidents database) last
week where:

* WHID 2009-15: Kanye West has been Hacked
(http://whid.xiom.com/whid/2009/15/Kanye_West_has_been_hacked):
	Rappers hacking problems seem never stop

* WHID 2009-14: My.BarackObama.com Infects Visitors With Trojan
(http://whid.xiom.com/whid/2009/14/My.BarackObama.com_Infects_Visitors_With_
Trojan)
	And so does presidents'

* WHID 2009-13: Wikipedia Biography Hacking
(http://whid.xiom.com/whid/2009/13/wikipedia_biography_hacking)

* WHID 2009-12: Embassy of India in Spain found serving remote malware
through iFrame attack
(http://whid.xiom.com/whid/2009/12/embassy-of-india-in-spain-found-serving-r
emote-malware-through-iframe)

It is interesting to note that everything of interest seem to evolve around
"Web 2.0" sites. On another note, the Heartland incident we queried about
last week seems not to be related to web hacking
