Subject: Full Path Disclosure In Photolibrary 1.009

============================================================
!vuln
Photolibrary 1.009
Previous versions may also be affected.

!risk
Low
There are currently just a few websites circulating with 
Photolibrary enabled.

============================================================
!discussion
Null user input in the following PHP file results in full 
path disclosure of the document root folder because of the 
include function:
site.com/photolibrary.1.009/photolibrary/css/style.php?page=
============================================================

============================================================
!solution

Change line 48 so that the include statement stops null
input:

if($page == '')
echo ("Get lost! Stop Trying to get full path disclosure!");
else
{
include($page.'.css');
}

The vendor has not yet been notified.
