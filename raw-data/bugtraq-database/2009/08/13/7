Subject: Chris Paget Defcon RFID Presentation Slides Now Online

Greetings.  

The slides for Chris Paget's DEFCON 17 RFID Presentation are now online and available at:

http://www.h4rdw4re.com/public/H4RDW4RE_RFID_Defcon17.zip

As the many who attended the session know, the presentation was cut short due to time restrictions (the Adam Savage talk behind us rolled up quickly).  As such, we have video recorded the presentation in its entirety, and are working on post-production now.  I will let you know when that posts as well.

Thanks.
