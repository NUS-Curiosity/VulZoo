Subject: Windows 7 Firewire Attacks - and Defense Techniques

Hello,

In the course of the Windows 7 RTM release, the Security Research Lab would like to share some results on firewire/DMA based hacks and Windows 7, which is susceptible to such attacks.

While the attack vector itself is already known from previous Windows versions, we also describe the impact of Firewire-based Windows authentication bypassing on Microsoft's full-disk encryption solution BitLocker, the Encrypted File System (EFS) and Windows domains. A comprehensive section on countermeasures on different layers concludes this whitepaper, which can be downloaded from:

Moreover, we have developed a software solution to protect against Firewire-based physical security attacks on Windows systems which is discussed in a separate whitepaper:

The software can be downloaded here - use at your own risk:

Kind regards,
Benjamin
