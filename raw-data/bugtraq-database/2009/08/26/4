Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Unified Communications Manager Denial
of Service Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20090826-cucm

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2009 August 26 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (formerly CallManager) contains
multiple denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities that if exploited
could cause an interruption to voice services. The Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) and Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP) services are
affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has released free software updates for select Cisco Unified
Communications Manager versions that address these vulnerabilities.
There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20090826-cucm.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following products are affected by vulnerabilities described in
this advisory:

  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager 4.x
  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager 5.x
  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager 6.x
  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.x

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express is not affected by these
vulnerabilities. No other Cisco products are currently known to be
affected by these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager is the call processing component
of the Cisco IP Telephony solution that extends enterprise telephony
features and functions to packet telephony network devices, such as
IP phones, media processing devices, VoIP gateways, and multimedia
applications.

Malformed SIP Message Vulnerabilities
+------------------------------------

Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains two DoS vulnerabilities
that involve the processing of SIP packets. Each vulnerability is
triggered by a malformed SIP message that could cause a critical
process to fail, resulting in the disruption of voice services. All
SIP ports (TCP 5060 and 5061, UDP 5060 and 5061) are affected by
these vulnerabilities.

The first SIP DoS vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID
CSCsi46466 and has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2009-2050.
The first vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager versions 6.1(1) and later.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager 4.x versions are only affected
by the first SIP DoS vulnerability if a SIP trunk is explicitly
configured. To determine if a SIP truck is configured on a Cisco
Unified Communications Manager version 4.x system, navigate to
Device > Trunk and choose the option SIP Trunk in the Cisco Unified
Communications Manager administration interface. To mitigate against
this vulnerability, administrators are advised to restrict access to
TCP and UDP port 5060 on vulnerable Cisco Unified Communications
Manager 4.x systems that are configured to use SIP trunks with
screening devices to valid SIP trunk end points.

The second SIP DoS vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID
CSCsz40392 and has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2009-2051.
The second vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager versions 5.1(3g), 6.1(4), and 7.1(2).

Network Connection Tracking Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------

Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains a DoS vulnerability
that involves the tracking of network connections by the embedded
operating system firewall. By establishing many TCP connections with
a vulnerable system, an attacker could overwhelm the operating system
table that is used to track network connections and prevent new
connections from being established to system services. Any service
that listens to a TCP port on a vulnerable system could be affected
by this vulnerability, including SIP and SCCP.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsq22534 and has
been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2009-2052. The vulnerability is
fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 5.1(3g),
6.1(4), 7.0(2), and 7.1(2).

Related SIP and SCCP DoS Vulnerabilities
+---------------------------------------

Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains two DoS vulnerabilities
involving the processing of SIP and SCCP packets. By flooding a
vulnerable system with many TCP packets, an attacker could exhaust
operating system file descriptors that cause the SIP port (TCP 5060
and 5061) and SCCP port (TCP 2000 and 2443) to close. This action
could prevent new connections from being established to the SIP and
SCCP services. SIP UDP (5060 and 5061) ports are not affected.

The SCCP vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsx32236 and
has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2009-2053. The SCCP
vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager
versions 5.1(3g), 6.1(4), 7.0(2a)su1, and 7.1(2).

The SIP vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsx23689 and
has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2009-2054. The SIP
vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager
versions 5.1(3g), 6.1(4), 7.0(2a)su1, and 7.1(2a)su1.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities described in this
advisory could result in the interruption of voice services. To
restore voice services, affected Cisco Unified Communications Manager
services may require a manual restart.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities in this advisory.
Administrators can mitigate the SCCP- and SIP-related vulnerabilities
by implementing filtering on screening devices to permit access to
TCP ports 2000 and 2443, and TCP and UDP ports 5060 and 5061 only
from networks that need SCCP and SIP access to Cisco Unified
Communications Manager servers.

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:
