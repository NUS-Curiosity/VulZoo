Subject: Re: [IVIZ-08-009] Grub Legacy Security Model bypass exploiting
 wrong BIOS API usage

This problem is not a threat because root user is able to boot any kernel without going through boot sequence (kexec) and is able to recover disk encryption key by inspecting dmcrypt module in memory. If an OS allows user to read raw memory without being root it's a security hole in OS and not in GRUB
