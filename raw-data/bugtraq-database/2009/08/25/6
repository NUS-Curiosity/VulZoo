Subject: Re: DoS vulnerability in Google Chrome

Hello MaXe!

Thanks for information.

It's interesting why your Firefox 3.5.2 is vulnerable, because on my
computer only Chrome was vulnerable, and not Firefox 3.0.13 and other
browsers (Mozilla, IE6 and Opera). Yes, I have Chrome installed on the same
system and it does not affect other browsers (not in case of this DoS hole,
not in case of other holes which I found).

Besides, which exploit works in Firefox 3.5.2 in your case? Maybe it's hole
in Firefox 3.5.x. Then it'll be better for you to check it on the system
with Firefox, but without Chrome. In case if it's Cross-Application DoS
(http://websecurity.com.ua/2600/, which you can read on English
http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http://websecurity.com.ua/2600/&sl=uk&tl=en),
and Firefox 3.5.2 is affected via Chrome (you must test it by running
exploit in Firefox 3.5.2 on systems with and without Chrome installed), then
there are things which we need to know. Which browsers (Firefox 3.5.x and
others) are affected, and which versions of Chrome lead to this issue.

Besides, as I was informed recently, Google Chrome 1.0.154.65 is also
vulnerable.

P.S.

Different people have different signatures ;-). It's like: show me your
signature and I'll tell you who you are.
