Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflows, leading to heap-based buffer overflows in
the Subversion client and server might allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Subversion is a versioning system designed to be a replacement for CVS.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-util/subversion       < 1.6.4                        >= 1.6.4

Description
===========

Matt Lewis of Google reported multiple integer overflows in the
libsvn_delta library, possibly leading to heap-based buffer overflows.

Impact
======

A remote attacker with commit access could exploit this vulnerability
by sending a specially crafted commit to a Subversion server, or a
remote attacker could entice a user to check out or update a repository
from a malicious Subversion server, possibly resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the server or
client.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Subversion users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =dev-util/subversion-1.6.4

==========
