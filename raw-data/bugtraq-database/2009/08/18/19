Synopsis
========

Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in CDF might result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

CDF is a library for the Common Data Format which is a self-describing
data format for the storage and manipulation of scalar and
multidimensional data. It is developed by the NASA.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sci-libs/cdf       < 3.3.0                               >= 3.3.0

Description
===========

Leon Juranic reported multiple heap-based buffer overflows for instance
in the ReadAEDRList64(), SearchForRecord_r_64(), LastRecord64(), and
CDFsel64() functions.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted CDF
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All CDF users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =sci-libs/cdf-3.3.0

References
==========
