Subject: Re: Multiple vulnerabilities in several ATEN IP KVM Switches

I emailed you last week but did not receive a response.

What about units like the CN5000 that do not appear anywhere on your 
website?  We have two of these and are very concerned about the below-
referenced vulnerability.

Will a firmware upgrade for these units be forthcoming as well, or do 
we now own hundreds of dollars worth of paperweights?
