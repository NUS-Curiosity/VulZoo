-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the WINS.exe process which provides name
resolution services for NetBIOS networks. While parsing a push request
the WINS service copies packet data to a static heap buffer while within
a controlled loop. By providing a specially crafted request an attacker
can overflow this heap buffer leading to arbitrary code execution under
the SYSTEM context.
