Subject: Vulnerable MSVC++ runtime distributed with OpenOffice.org 3.1.1 for Windows

The just released latest version of OpenOffice.org 3.1.1 for Windows
distributes (once again) a completely outdated and vulnerable MSVC++
runtime.

The unpacked installation archive contains in subdirectory \REDIST\
the installer of the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable",
VCRedist_x86.exe, time stamp 2009-01-19, version 9.0.21022.8.

This file was digitally signed by "Microsoft Corporation" on 2007-11-07,
i.e. it contains the initial release of the VC++ 2008 runtime.

This runtime but has been updated serveral times since its first
release, the last update was published just a month ago: see
<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973551/en-us> as well as
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-035.mspx>,
for the current version and
<http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf>
as well as
<http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a5c84275-3b97-4ab7-a40d-3802b2af5fc2>
for the previous updates.

Fortunately the eventually installed outdated VC++ runtime will be
updated by the "Automatic Updates" feature of Windows with the hotfix
MS09-035 alias KB973551, IFF the Windows administrator has opt'd-in
to "Microsoft Update".
If not, all users of OpenOffice.org (as well as other poorly crafted
software which distributes outdated 3rd-party DLLs) are put at risk!
