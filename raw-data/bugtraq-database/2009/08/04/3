Not Vulnerable: SAP Business One 2007


Discovered By: Mike Arnold

Information:

NT_Naming_Service.exe (part of the License Manager for SAP Business One 2005) is vulnerable to a stack-based remote buffer overflow allowing for full system compromise by an unauthenticated user that has TCP/IP access to SAP's license service on TCP port 30000.

Sending a large GIOP request will cause a buffer overflow allowing for remote code execution.
NT_Naming_Service.exe runs with SYSTEM level privledges
