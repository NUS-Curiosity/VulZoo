> #9 Telnet service enabled by default
Anyone in LAN is able to log in using default admin:admin account with root privileges. There is no possibility to change this password (sic!)

You can change telnet admin password on this device.
1. telnet as admin with passwd admin
2. type: nvram set admin_passwd=SOMESTRONGPASSWD <enter>
3. type: nvram commit <enter>
4. restart router (by switching off the power)

thats all
