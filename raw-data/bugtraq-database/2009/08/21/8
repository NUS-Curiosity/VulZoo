Subject: Cuteflow Version 2.10.3 "edituser.php" Security Bypass Vulnerability

It's possible edit the users (including the admin account), bypassing the
authentication through the address:
http://localhost/cuteflow/pages/edituser.php?userid=1&language=pt&sortby=st
rLastName&sortdir=ASC&start=1

The vulnerability is caused due to the application not properly restricting access to the pages/edituser.php script. This can be exploited to modify a user's username and password without having proper credentials.
