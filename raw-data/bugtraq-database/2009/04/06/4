3. Problem Description

 a. Denial of service guest to host vulnerability in a virtual device

    A vulnerability in a guest virtual device driver, could allow a
    guest operating system to crash the host and consequently any
    virtual machines on that host.

    VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of
    Defense for reporting this issue.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-4916 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

 b. Windows-based host denial of service vulnerability in hcmon.sys

    A vulnerability in an ioctl in hcmon.sys could be used to create
    a denial of service on a Windows-based host. This issue can only
    be exploited by a privileged Windows account.

    VMware would like to thank Nikita Tarakanov for reporting this
    issue to us.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-1146 to this issue.

    Note: newly released hosted products (see table in this section)
    address another potential denial of service in hcmon.sys as well.
    Also this issue can only be exploited by a privileged Windows
    account.
 
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-3761 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    ESX            2.5.5     ESX      not affected

 c. A VMCI privilege escalation on Windows-based hosts or Windows-
    based guests.

    The Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) is an
    infrastructure that provides fast and efficient communication
    between a virtual machine and the host operating system and
    between two or more virtual machines on the same host.

    A vulnerability in vmci.sys could allow privilege escalation on
    Windows-based machines. This could occur on Windows-based hosts or
    inside Windows-based guest operating systems.
 
    Current versions of ESX do not support the VMCI interface and
    hence they are not affected by this vulnerability.
 
    Note: Installing the new hosted releases will not remediate the
    issue on Windows-based guests. The VMware Tools packages will need
    to be updated on each Windows-based guest followed by a reboot
    of the guest system.

    VMware would like to thank Nikita Tarakanov for reporting this
    issue to us.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2009-1147 to this issue.

    Refer to VMware KB article 1009826 on the steps that are needed to
    remediate this vulnerability on Windows-based hosts. This KB article
    is found at http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1009826.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    on Windows-based guests (column 4) if a solution is available.

    ESX            2.5.5     ESX      not affected

 d. VNnc Codec Heap Overflow vulnerabilities

    The VNnc Codec assists in Record and Replay sessions. Record and
    Replay record the dynamic virtual machine state over a period of
    time.

    Two heap overflow vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to
    execute arbitrary code on VMware hosted products. For an attack to
    be successful the user must be tricked into visiting a malicious web
    page or opening a malicious video file.

    VMware would like to thank Aaron Portnoy from TippingPoint DVLabs
    for reporting these issues to us. TippingPoint has issued the
    following identifiers: ZDI-CAN-435, ZDI-CAN-436.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    has assigned the names CVE-2009-0909 and CVE-2009-0910 to these
    issues.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

 e. ACE shared folders vulnerability

    The VMware Host Guest File System (HGFS) shared folders feature allows
    users to transfer data between a guest operating system and the
    non-virtualized host operating system that contains it.

    A vulnerability in ACE shared folders could allow a previously disabled
    and not removed shared folder in the guest to be enabled by a non ACE
    Administrator.
     
    VMware would like to thank Emmanouel Kellinis, KPMG London, penetration
    testing team for reporting this issue to us.

 f. A remote denial of service vulnerability in authd for Windows
    based hosts.

    A vulnerability in vmware-authd.exe could cause a denial
    of service condition on Windows hosts.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)

g. VI Client Retains VirtualCenter Server Password in Memory

    After logging in to VirtualCenter Server with VI Client, the
    password for VirtualCenter Server might be present in the memory
    of the VI Client.

    Note: This vulnerability is present in VI Client and in order to
    remediate the vulnerability, you will need to replace VI Client
    with a fixed version (see below).

    VMware would like to thank Craig Marshall for reporting this
    issue to us.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-0518 to this issue.
 
    To determine if your copy of VI Client is not vulnerable, check the
    about box under the help menu of VI Client. Your copy is not
    vulnerable if this box mentions one of the following:
    - ESX 2.5.5,
    - ESX 3.0,
    - VC build number 147704, 147694, or 147633 (or higher).

    A VI Client copy that remediates the problem can be obtained from:
    - VirtualCenter 2.5 Update 4,
    - ESXi 3.5 after applying patch ESXe350-200903201-O-UG
      (this patch is part of the ESXi 3.5 Update 4 release),
    - ESX 3.5 after applying patch ESX350-200903201-UG
      (this patch is part of the ESX 3.5 Update 4 release).
