Subject: Remote iodinetd DoS vulnerability on Debian Lenny

Hi,

I attach an exploit that lets you shutdown a remote iodinet server
(version <= 0.4.2). This bug was found some weeks before on Debian
Lenny, but it hasn't been fixed in the stable branch and the bug has
been closed :S.

This is the Debian bug:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=521260

Greetings.
