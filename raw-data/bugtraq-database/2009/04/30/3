WTF?  What ever happened to using the threat of disclosure to get 
vendors to patch their bugs in a timely manner?  They even released new 
major versions of the product during that time and they're still vulnerable.

I guess responsible disclosure (from the consumer's point of view) isn't 
something polite corporations do.
