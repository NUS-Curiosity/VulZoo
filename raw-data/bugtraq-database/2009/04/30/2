Subject: Security tools list: First Version


Hello anyone,
	With all the information, that voluntarily we have all added, this is
the first version of the tools list. I have to add many tools 
that I have collected.

http://securitytoolslist.domandhost.com/

		I have to review it thoroughly and add no a lot more that I sent, but
this is a first approximation. I'm working on a more elaborate site, but
for now I'll publish the list in this way. I hope to have the site ready
in a couple of days, more or less. 
	I hope your comments and your help for adding news tools to build,
together, a great collection. I remember the URL where you can add:
