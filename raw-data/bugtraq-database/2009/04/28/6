Subject: security tools list


hello everyone. 
	I'm making a list of security tools. The idea is that a list be made by
all and for all. This email is also sent to the people of the project
backtrack and wifislax. For those who want to collaborate, I have
created a form using google docs, for send your ideas to me. We accept
all kinds of suggestions: commercial software, free ... Linux, Windows,
*BSD, Mac OS ... 
	When I have a enough long list, send to the list, but if someone wants
to ask before you can smoothly. 
	The URL to add tools is:

Greetings to all.
