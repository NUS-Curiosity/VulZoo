Addonics NAS Adapter Post-Auth DoS

Addonics NAS Adapter is prone to several post authentication buffer overflows. Each of these buffer overflows will crash the entire TCP/IP stack and the device will have to be power cycled to restore any functionality. Addonics currently has implemented GUI level (client side) controls for preventing long inputs, but by simply doing a direct HTTP GET request (the device doesn't use POST) this can be bypassed.

Addonics was notified of the buffer overflows via ticket 497283 on March 25, 2009.  Vendor acknowledgment on March 26, 2009.

Exploiting these issues will crash the network stack and create a Denial of Service condition.

Firmware NASU2FW41 Loader1.17 are vulnerable; other versions may also be.

Attackers can use a browser to exploit these issues.

The following GET requests will result in the TCP/IP stack crashing and the device requiring a reboot
