Description
***********


cFolders (Collaboration Folders) is the SAP web-based  application for collaborative sharing of information. 
cFolders is part of a suite of applications powered by SAP NetWeaver that integrate project management, 
knowledge management and resource management in collaborative inter-enterprise and intra-enterprise 
environments. 

cFolders is integrated to SAP ECC, SAP Product Lifecycle 
Management (PLM), SAP Supplier Relationship Management (SRM), SAP Knowledge Management and SAP 
NetWeaver cRooms (collaboration rooms). Virtual teams can access, view online, subscribe for changes, and 
redline documents and product information. Partners and suppliers can interact with cFolders in predefined 
collaborative or competitive scenarios. 



Details
*******

Multiple Stored XSS vulnerabilities found in SAP Cfolders engine. User which is a business partner of 
organization can steal Administrators cookie by inserting javascript into CFolders system.
He can do this using 2 Stored XSS vulnerabilities.

SAP Server dont associate session identificators with users IP adress or with any other additional data.
IT autentificate users Only by cookies. So any user which can steal administrators cookie can use them to authentificate with administrator rights.


1. User can insert javascript code into site using  link creation option 

He can inject javascript code into LINK field on page

https://[site]/sap/bc/bsp/sap/cfx_rfc_ui/hyp_de_create.htm


example LINK value:

http://test.com" onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)">

Then when administrator will browse for user folders script will execute. 


2. Second XSS vulnerability found in document uploading area.
User can create a document with file name included javascript code.


example filename value:

aaaa"><script>alert()</script>.doc

To do this user must change file name in http request when sending a request for file uploading.

So using this vulnerability user can steal cookie like he do in first example.
