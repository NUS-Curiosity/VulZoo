I think you're confused, these scripts can execute programs, create and
modify files, modify running processes, and so on. Perhaps you're confusing
the concept of "modelines" with editor automation (modelines are hints to
the editor how to display a file, and are untrusted, where as automating an
editor requires the ability to modify files, create filters and so on to be
useful).

The documentation is online here:

http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/manual/FuncInterface.htm
http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/manual/EditingProcesses.htm

Start here:

int Exec( const char program[], const char arguments[] ) 

Executes an external application using the given program and arguments.

This is like saying "A vulnerability has been fixed parsing perl scripts,
upgrade and it's safe to run hostile.pl again", It's obviously not the case.
While what you describe is clearly a bug, it's hard to see any security
impact - users couldnt previously safely execute untrusted scripts, and
after upgrading they still can't.

You may want to read up on modelines, Guninski famously broke vim modelines
in interesting ways several times.
