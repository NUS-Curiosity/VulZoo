Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Tor might allow for heap corruption, Denial
of Service, escalation of privileges and information disclosure.

Background
==========

Tor is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a
connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/tor     < 0.2.0.34                           >= 0.2.0.34

Description
===========

* Theo de Raadt reported that the application does not properly drop
  privileges to the primary groups of the user specified via the "User"
  configuration option (CVE-2008-5397).

* rovv reported that the "ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses"
  configuration option is not always enforced (CVE-2008-5398).

* Ilja van Sprundel reported a heap-corruption vulnerability that
  might be remotely triggerable on some platforms (CVE-2009-0414).

* It has been reported that incomplete IPv4 addresses are treated as
  valid, violating the specification (CVE-2009-0939).

* Three unspecified vulnerabilities have also been reported
  (CVE-2009-0936, CVE-2009-0937, CVE-2009-0938).

Impact
======

A local attacker could escalate privileges by leveraging unintended
supplementary group memberships of the Tor process. A remote attacker
could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a heap corruption with
unknown impact and attack vectors, to cause a Denial of Service via CPU
consuption or daemon crash, and to weaken anonymity provided by the
service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tor users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tor-0.2.0.34"
