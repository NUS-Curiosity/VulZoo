Subject: HP Deskjet 6800 XSS in Web Interface

A Cross-site scripting input validation error has been identified in the web interface of the HP Deskjet 6800 printer family.  By sending a string such as <script>alert("found XSS on this page")</script> via a POST request to /refresh_rate.htm the resulting error page will execute the script.  

Verified on Deskjet 6840 firmware version: XF1M131A, but the firmware seems to be generic to the 6800 family, so possibly the entire family is vulnerable.
