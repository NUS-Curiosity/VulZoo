Is this grabbing the authentication credentials in plain text or just the hash?

Trillian SSL Certificate Vulnerability

I. The Vulnerability

Trillian does not check SSL certificate before sending MSN user
credentials. An attacker is able to obtain MSN username and password
with a spoofed certificate and no alert is generated to the user.
This vulnerability was found in Trillian Basic 3.1. Other versions
and/or protocols may also be affected.
