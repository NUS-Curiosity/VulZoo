Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2009-0580 Apache Tomcat User enumeration vulnerability
 with FORM authentication

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

CVE-2009-0580: Tomcat information disclosure vulnerability

Severity: Low

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Tomcat 4.1.0 to 4.1.39
Tomcat 5.5.0 to 5.5.27
Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.18

The unsupported Tomcat 3.x, 4.0.x and 5.0.x versions may be also affected.

Description:
Due to insufficient error checking in some authentication classes,
Tomcat allows for the enumeration (brute force testing) of usernames by
supplying illegally URL encoded passwords. The attack is possible if
form based authenticiaton (j_security_check) with one of the following
authentication realms is used:
 * MemoryRealm
 * DataSourceRealm
 * JDBCRealm

Mitigation:
6.0.x users should do one of the following:
 - upgrade to 6.0.20
 - apply this patch http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=747840&view=rev
5.5.x users should do one of the following:
 - upgrade to 5.5.28 when released
 - apply this patch http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=781379&view=rev
4.1.x users should do one of the following:
 - upgrade to 4.1.40 when released
 - apply this patch http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=781382&view=rev

Example:
The following POST request should trigger an error (500 server error or
empty response, depending on the configuration) if the ROOT web
application is configured to use FORM authentication:

POST /j_security_check HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

j_username=tomcat&j_password=%
