Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.11.09: Microsoft Windows 2000 Print
 Spooler Remote Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.09.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 09, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

The Windows Print Spooler manages the printing process, and loads files
to memory for later printing. For more information about Print Spooler,
please visit following website:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa506181.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 2000 operating system could allow an
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with system-level
privileges.

This vulnerability exists in the EnumeratePrintShares function in
win32spl.dll. The vulnerable function does not correctly validate the
length of the printer server's response. When a malformed response is
received from the printer server, the stack buffer can be overflowed,
resulting in an exploitable condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with
system-level privileges.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker has to setup a malicious
printer server that can be accessed by the target system. No user
interaction is required and no authentication is required. The attacker
just needs to connect to the print spooler service and send a request.
This request will cause the target system to enumerate shared printer
resource on the malicious printer server and trigger the vulnerability.

This vulnerability only exists in Windows 2000. The Spooler Service is
running by default on Windows 2000 with SYSTEM privileges.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in
win32spl.dll version 5.00.2195.7054, as included in Windows 2000
Service Pack 4, with all available patches as of September 2008. All
previous versions are suspected vulnerable.

Windows XP SP2 and later versions of Windows are not affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Consider disabling the print spooler service; however, by doing this,
users cannot print locally or remotely.

For hosts that do need the print spooler service running, disable
anonymous connections to the service by removing the print spooler
service from following registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\NullSessionPipes
Remove 'SPOOLSS' from the registry key. This will allow only
authenticated access to the print spooler service, disabling the vector
for anonymous attack.

Alternatively, ports 139, 445, 631 both UDP and TCP can be firewalled.
This will largely prevent access to any print services remotely on a
host system.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Microsoft has released a patch which addresses this issue. For more
