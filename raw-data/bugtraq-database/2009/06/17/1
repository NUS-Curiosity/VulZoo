Subject: CERT-FI statement on the Outpost24 TCP issues updated

>From the statement:

"June 15 2009
In the issue #66 of the Phrack magazine there was an article on exploiting TCP Persist Timer weaknesses (http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=66&id=9#article )
to cause Denial of Service conditions.
The article discusses issues similar but not the same as the issues reported by Outpost24.
The publication of the Phrack-magazine article will not affect the coordination and schedule related to the issues reported by Outpost24.
CERT-FI emphasizes that the eventual release of the issues reported by Outpost24 will be done in a coordinated fashion."
