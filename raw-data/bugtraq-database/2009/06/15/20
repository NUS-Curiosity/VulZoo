Zoki Catalog
Smart Catalog is unique and convenient software. It is designed for
many purposes whether you want to create blog, product catalog,
classifieds, events, jobs or many others. This software gives you
opportunity to create general categories and unlimited number of
subcategories, create static pages, upload images, rate and comment
listings. The Smart Catalog has SEO optimized URLs, RSS feeds and fast
indexed with major search engines.

Description
This PHP based catalog is vulnerable to SQL Injection on search form.
Injecting a quote mark will break the SQL query and even provide
sensitive database information that could help a malicious user to
complete and enter a valid SQL injection query.


Impact
A malicious user could manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary
SQL code and return private information.
