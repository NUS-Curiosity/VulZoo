==============================================

5th European Conference on Computer Network Defence (EC2ND)
12-13 November 2009, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy
http://2009.ec2nd.org/

*** Call for Papers ***

The 5th European Conference on Computer Network Defence
will take place in November 2009 at the Politecnico di Milano technical
university in Milano, Italy.

The theme of the conference is the protection of computer networks. The
conference will draw participants from academia and industry in Europe
and beyond to discuss hot topics in applied network and systems
security.

EC2ND invites submissions presenting novel ideas at an early stage with
the intention to act as a discussion forum and feedback channel for
promising, innovative security research. While our goal is to solicit
ideas that are not completely worked out, and might have challenging and
interesting open questions, we expect submissions to be supported by
some evidence of feasibility or preliminary quantitative results.

Topics include but are not limited to:

      * Intrusion Detection
      * Denial-of-Service
      * Privacy Protection
      * Security Policy
      * Peer-to-Peer and Grid Security
      * Network Monitoring
      * Web Security
      * Vulnerability Management and Tracking
      * Network Forensics
      * Wireless and Mobile Security
      * Cryptography
      * Network Discovery and Mapping
      * Incident Response and Management
      * Malicious Software
      * Web Services Security
      * Legal and Ethical Issues

The conference will be technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer
Society - Italy Chapter.

*** Submitting a Paper ***

You are hereby invited to submit papers up to 6-8 pages, 8.5" x 11",
two-column format. We particularly encourage position papers on
preliminary work that shows promise, rather than mature and
well-polished papers. Surprising results and thought-provoking ideas
will be strongly favored. All submissions will be reviewed by the
Program Committee. Authors of accepted papers will be given the option
of including their paper in the proceedings of the conference.

We suggest you to format your paper according to IEEE-CS guidelines:
