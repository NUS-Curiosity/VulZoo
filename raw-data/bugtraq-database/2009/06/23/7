Overview:

Quoting http://www.apple.com/safari/:
"What is Safari ?
It's a browser. It's a platform. It's an open invitation to innovate. 
Whether on a Mac, PC, iPhone, or iPod touch, Safari continuously 
redefines the browser, providing the most enjoyable way to experience 
the Internet."



Description:

Passing the file protocol handler to a certain HTML allows to read local 
files. 
On Windows it is possible to create an instance of Windows Explorer by 
calling an executable file. Other operating systems were not tested.  


In detail, the following flaw was determined:

- Safari fails to sanitaze the file protocol handler thus leading to an 
  information disclosure, e.g. local file theft. 
  Creating dynamically a certain HTML tag and using a valid file path to
  an executable may lead to a Denial of Service condition.



Impact

An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by constructing a specially
prepared html file. When a user views this file, local content can be 
send to a third party. Additionaly, various ghost instances of Window 
Explorer may harm the stability of the users system.



Solution:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
