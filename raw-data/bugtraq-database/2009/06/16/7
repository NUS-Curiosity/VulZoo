Title: CA20090615-01: CA ARCserve Backup Message Engine Denial of 
Service Vulnerabilities


CA Advisory Reference: CA20090615-01


CA Advisory Date: 2009-06-15


Reported By: iViZ Security Research Team


Impact: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service.


Summary: CA ARCserve Backup contains multiple vulnerabilities in 
the message engine that can allow a remote attacker to cause a 
denial of service. CA has issued an update to address the 
vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities, CVE-2009-1761, occur due to 
insufficient verification of data sent to the message engine. An 
attacker can make requests that can cause the message engine to 
crash.


Mitigating Factors: None


Severity: CA has given these vulnerabilities a Medium risk rating.


Affected Products:
CA ARCserve Backup r12.0 Windows
CA ARCserve Backup r12.0 SP 1 Windows


Non-Affected Products:
CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 SP 4 Windows
CA ARCserve Backup r12.0 SP 2 Windows
CA ARCserve Backup r12.5


Affected Platforms:
Windows


Status and Recommendation:
CA has issued the following patches to address the vulnerabilities.

CA ARCserve Backup r12.0, r12.0 SP1 Windows:
Install Service Pack 2 RO08383.


How to determine if the installation is affected:

CA ARCserve Backup r12.0, r12.0 SP1 Windows:
   1. Run the ARCserve Patch Management utility. From the Windows 
      Start menu, the program can be found under 
      Programs->CA->ARCserve Patch Management->Patch Status.
   2. The main patch status screen will indicate if the patch in 
      the below table is applied. If the patch is not applied, 
      then the installation is vulnerable.

Product                                          Patch

CA ARCserve Backup r12.0, r12.0 SP1 Windows      RO08383


For more information on the ARCserve Patch Management utility, 
read document TEC446265.


Workaround: 
As a workaround solution, disable the Apache HTTP Server with the 
"stopgui" command. To re-enable the server, run "startgui".

Stopping the Apache HTTP Server will prevent the ARCserve user 
from performing GUI operations. Most of the operations provided by 
the GUI can be accomplished via the command line.

Alternatively, restrict remote network access to reduce exposure.
