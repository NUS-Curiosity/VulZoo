Subject: New paper by Amit Klein (Trusteer) - Temporary user tracking in major
 browsers and Cross-domain information leakage and attacks

Hi

I would like to announce a new paper, titled "Temporary user tracking in 
major browsers and Cross-domain information leakage and attacks". The 
paper is available to download from the following page:

http://www.trusteer.com/temporary-user-tracking-in-major-browsers

Abstract:
User tracking across domains, processes (in some cases) and windows/tabs is
demonstrated by exploiting several vulnerabilities in major browsers 
(Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and to a 
limited extent Google Chrome). Additionally, new cross-domain 
information leakage, and cross domain attacks are described, which 
provide a foundation for attacks such as “in session phishing”.

According to Opera’s security team, Opera is vulnerable as well, but it 
was not researched by the author.

Apple released Safari 4.0 today, which contains a fix for this problem.

Thanks,
-Amit
