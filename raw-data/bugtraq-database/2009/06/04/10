I know I'm likely to get a vague response, but could you provide some
more info about this issue?

I'm not sure how the patch (I read the patch for TC5.5
DataSourceRealm.java) changes anything at all: it appears to be merely a
performance optimization.

No changes are made to the behavior of Tomcat, since the same null is
returned to the caller if the credentials do not match.

I don't see any information disclosure vulnerability in the first place,
and I don't see how your patch would have fixed it.

??!
