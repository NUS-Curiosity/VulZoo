Synopsis
========

Multiple insecure calls to the sscanf() function in HTMLDOC might
result in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

HTMLDOC is a HTML indexer and HTML to PS and PDF converter.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/htmldoc      < 1.8.27-r1                    >= 1.8.27-r1

Description
===========

ANTHRAX666 reported an insecure call to the sscanf() function in the
set_page_size() function in htmldoc/util.cxx. Nico Golde of the Debian
Security Team found two more insecure calls in the write_type1()
function in htmldoc/ps-pdf.cxx and the htmlLoadFontWidths() function in
htmldoc/htmllib.cxx.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
HTML file using htmldoc, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
NOTE: Additional vectors via specially crafted AFM font metric files do
not cross trust boundaries, as the files can only be modified by
privileged users.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All HTMLDOC users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =app-text/htmldoc-1.8.27-r1

==========
