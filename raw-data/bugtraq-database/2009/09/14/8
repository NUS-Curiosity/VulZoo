Subject: War FTP Daemon Remote Denial Of Service Vulnerability

There has been reported an exploit where War FTP Daemon 1.82 RC 12 could 
be crashed from any logged in users, included anonymous users (if they 
are allowed to log in). The exploit might also affect previous versions 
of the server.

The exploit was reported to me Thu Sep 10 16:46:20 2009 by 
"corelanc0d3r". Exploit code was posted on the web before a fix was ready.

Please upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible.

War FTP Daemon can be downloaded from:
