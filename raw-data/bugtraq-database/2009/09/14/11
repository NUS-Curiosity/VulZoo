Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark which allow
for Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Wireshark is a versatile network protocol analyzer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/wireshark       < 1.2.1                     >= 1.2.1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Wireshark:

* A buffer overflow in the IPMI dissector related to an array index
  error (CVE-2009-2559).

* Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth L2CAP,
  RADIUS, and MIOP dissectors (CVE-2009-2560).

* An unspecified vulnerability in the sFlow dissector
  (CVE-2009-2561).

* An unspecified vulnerability in the AFS dissector (CVE-2009-2562).

* An unspecified vulnerability in the Infiniband dissector when
  running on unspecified platforms (CVE-2009-2563).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending
specially crafted packets on a network being monitored by Wireshark or
by enticing a user to read a malformed packet trace file to cause a
Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =net-analyzer/wireshark-1.2.1
