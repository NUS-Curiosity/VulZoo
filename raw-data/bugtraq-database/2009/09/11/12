Subject: Re[2]: Regular Expression Denial of Service

Hi ,

With all due respect - this is known to be a vulnerability class since
over  a  century.  Just  because  it  doesn't  have a acronym à la XSS
doesn't mean it's not known to be a vulnerability. Can we please stop
the  attitude of inventing acronyms for vulnerabilites, making it look
like it's something new and funky.

It's  the  impact  of  something  that makes it a vulnerability no the
name.

GE> Alex, nice work. Thank you for sharing it with us.
