Alex, it isn't a new technique in web-application security. If you queried Google, or did some research on recent (2007) Blackhat talks, you'll probably noticed that this is very well known and understood technique. Even Charles Miller talked about it (on the OSX Safari exploits). So the claim that security researchers are not aware of it, it somewhat misleading. I personally (and many others too) used the same techniques, albeit slightly different for over 8 years when auditing applications. Since you seem to propose a serious "new" research area, i expect you to research it's history first before claiming "new" research, at least I would appreciate it.
