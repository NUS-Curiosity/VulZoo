Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Dnsmasq might result in the remote
execution of arbitrary code, or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP
server. It includes support for Trivial FTP (TFTP).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/dnsmasq       < 2.5.0                            >= 2.5.0

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the TFTP functionality
included in Dnsmasq:

* Pablo Jorge and Alberto Solino discovered a heap-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2009-2957).

* An anonymous researcher reported a NULL pointer reference
  (CVE-2009-2958).

Impact
======

A remote attacker in the local network could exploit these
vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted TFTP requests to a machine
running Dnsmasq, possibly resulting in the remote execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the daemon, or a
Denial of Service. NOTE: The TFTP server is not enabled by default.

Workaround
==========

You can disable the TFTP server either at buildtime by not enabling the
"tftp" USE flag, or at runtime. Make sure "--enable-tftp" is not set in
the DNSMASQ_OPTS variable in the /etc/conf.d/dnsmasq file and
"enable-tftp" is not set in /etc/dnsmasq.conf, either of which would
enable TFTP support if it is compiled in.

Resolution
==========

All Dnsmasq users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =net-dns/dnsmasq-2.5.0
