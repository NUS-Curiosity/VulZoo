several vulnerabilities

###########################################################

Ubuntu Privacy Remix (UPR), based on Ubuntu 9.04, is a live,
read-only CD that seals off your private data from the outside world to
offer protection against spying measures such as the german
„Bundestrojaner“, with which the German government and federal police
tries to spy on its citizens.
UPR does this using encryption and isolation methods. This method of
booting off a read-only CD provides a isolated and unmodifiable system
that is exceedingly difficult to compromise by spyware.
The following security issues affect the "Ubuntu Privacy Remix" releases
prior 9.04_r2.

Ubuntu Privacy Remix 9.04_r2 can be downloaded from
https://www.privacy-cd.org/

A. UPR-specific
- ---------------
The UPR Team has released the second stable release of Ubuntu Privacy
Remix 9.04,
which includes a new kernel to fix USN-819-1 (local root privilege
escalation). We think that this hole is very difficult to exploit under the
UPR environment, nevertheless we recommend all users to use the new version.


B. Security Updates adopted from Ubuntu
- ---------------------------------------
All packages with security-fixes in Ubuntu 9.04 until 09/01/2009 have
been updated.
