Subject: Peiter "Mudge" Zatko petition to be named U.S. Cybersecurity Chief

http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/mudge4cyberczar/index.html

This petition is posted in support for the nomination of Peiter Zatko
(aka mudge) to the President's post of Cybersecurity Chief. We've all
seen how effective past efforts have been regarding this initiative,
and realize the importance of nominating someone who understands not
only all facets of cybersecurity, but has garnered the respect of both
peers and adversaries in the space.
