Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] 3rd party patch for XP for MS09-048?

On http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifepolicy MS says that the
"Extended Support Phase" includes "Security Update Support". If I have
a Premier Support contract (which entitles me to Extended Support)
aren't MS contractually obliged to make this fix available to me?
