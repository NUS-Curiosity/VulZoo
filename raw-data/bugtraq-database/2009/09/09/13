Synopsis
========

An insecure temporary file usage has been reported in TkMan, allowing
for symlink attacks.

Background
==========

TkMan is a graphical, hypertext manual page and Texinfo browser for
UNIX.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/tkman      < 2.2-r1                            >= 2.2-r1

Description
===========

Dmitry E. Oboukhov reported that TkMan does not handle the
"/tmp/tkman#####" and "/tmp/ll" temporary files securely.

Impact
======

A local attacker could perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary
files with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All TkMan users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =app-text/tkman-2.2-r1
