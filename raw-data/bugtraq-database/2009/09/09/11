Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in the pluto IKE daemon of Openswan might
allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Openswan is an implementation of IPsec for Linux.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/openswan      < 2.4.15                         >= 2.4.15

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Openswan:

* Gerd v. Egidy reported a NULL pointer dereference in the Dead Peer
  Detection of the pluto IKE daemon as included in Openswan
  (CVE-2009-0790).

* The Orange Labs vulnerability research team discovered multiple
  vulnerabilities in the ASN.1 parser (CVE-2009-2185).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending
specially crafted R_U_THERE or R_U_THERE_ACK packets, or a specially
crafted X.509 certificate containing a malicious Relative Distinguished
Name (RDN), UTCTIME string or GENERALIZEDTIME string to cause a Denial
of Service of the pluto IKE daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Openswan users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =net-misc/openswan-2.4.15
