Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus (short: ClamAV) is an anti-virus toolkit for UNIX,
designed especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.95.2                      >= 0.95.2

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in ClamAV:

* The vendor reported a Divide-by-zero error in the PE ("Portable
  Executable"; Windows .exe) file handling of ClamAV (CVE-2008-6680).

* Jeffrey Thomas Peckham found a flaw in libclamav/untar.c, possibly
  resulting in an infinite loop when processing TAR archives in clamd
  and clamscan (CVE-2009-1270).

* Martin Olsen reported a vulnerability in the CLI_ISCONTAINED macro
  in libclamav/others.h, when processing UPack archives
  (CVE-2009-1371).

* Nigel disclosed a stack-based buffer overflow in the
  "cli_url_canon()" function in libclamav/phishcheck.c when processing
  URLs (CVE-2009-1372).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to process a
specially crafted UPack archive or a file containing a specially
crafted URL, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application, or a
Denial of Service. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial
of Service by supplying a specially crafted TAR archive or PE
executable to a Clam AntiVirus instance.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Clam AntiVirus users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =app-antivirus/clamav-0.95.2
