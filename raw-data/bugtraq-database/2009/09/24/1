the CFP closes December 1, 2009.

This year features no anime con or people in superhero outfits.

If you are planning to submit, think of topics of that would be of interest
to a predominantly federal audience.
    - Audit and Attack
    - Application Security
    - Bots 'n Stuff
    - Forensics & anti-Forensics
    - Hardware reversing and subversion
    - The Infrastructure
    - OTA Mobility and Wireless

Just read the news feeds for a few weeks and you know their networks are
being hammered. The feds and their many contractors are out there looking
for strategies and solutions. 

As always if you register for Black Hat DC you can participate in the CFP
process by helping review the current submissions. Registration opens
October 15.
