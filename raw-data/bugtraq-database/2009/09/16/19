Subject: RE: [Full-disclosure] 3rd party patch for XP for MS09-048?

Hey Larry- hope everything's going well... 

When you've got a systemic vulnerability, in this case the TCP/IP stack itself, exploitation information must be explicit and definitive.  I'm fine with risk classification, and I appreciate efforts to categorize risk into manageable exposure metrics, but we shouldn't have to infer potential vulnerability information from vague disclosure data.  I know many response teams base patch paths on the published severity, but one also has to be able to make decisions on their own.  For me, no big deal.  But it's not that simple for others.   

But there's not enough information for me to make that call.  Is it for ANY "listening service?"  TCP or UPD?  Does the "statefull" firewall introduced in subsequent versions stop it?

The answers are "yes," "yes," and "no."  They should just say that.  Is it "low" because the firewall doesn't have any exceptions by default?  If so, that's silly.  Everyone using XP for anything has incoming connections for something, and well known if on a domain.  I feel sorry for Diebold and NEC with all the ATMs out there running XP, but fortunately, I'm not responsible for clients using their systems anymore :) 

Anyway, the DoS suxx0rz, but I'm more irritated with the lack of real, straight-forward, no-nonsense information and technical sleight of hand.  The information should be painfully obvious, not obviously painful.
