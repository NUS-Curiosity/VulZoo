Subject: Re: 3rd party patch for XP for MS09-048?

Reference:

http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9138007/Microsoft_No_TCP_IP_patches_for_you_XP

MS claims the patch would require to much overhaul of XP to make it
worth it, and they may be right.  Who knows how many applications might
break that were designed for XP if they have to radically change the
TCP/IP stack.  Now, I don't know if the MS speak is true, but it
certainly sounds like it is not going to be patched.

The other side of the MS claim is that a properly-firewalled XP system
would not be vulnerable to a DOS anyway, so a patch shouldn't be necessary.
