Vulnerability found: May 2008 Revalidated 23 July 2009

Vendor informed: 27th July 09

Vulnerability fixed: 

Severity: Medium

Description: 

Various Orion application application server example pages are vulnerable to XSS. Orion application server is a java based web application server, http://www.orionserver.com/.


Note: Orion application server was tested on Windows XP and JRE 1.6.0_14


The following demonstrate XSS:

1) http://10.0.2.177:8080/examples/jsp/sessions/carts.jsp?item=<body><script>alert(1)</script></body>&submit=add

2) http://10.0.2.177:8080/examples/jsp/checkbox/checkresult.jsp?fruit=<script>alert(1)</script>

3) http://10.0.2.177:8080/examples/jsp/cal/cal2.jsp?time=<script>alert(1)</script>
Consequences: 

An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code in the browser of a user who clicks on a link to a Orion Application server site. Such code would run within the security context of the target domain. This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the target site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e.: session IDs) to unauthorised third parties.



Fix:
