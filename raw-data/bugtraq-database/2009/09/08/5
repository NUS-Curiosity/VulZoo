Synopsis
========

An error in the handling of user names of Linux-PAM might allow remote
attackers to cause a Denial of Service or escalate privileges.

Background
==========

Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is an architecture
allowing the separation of the development of privilege granting
software from the development of secure and appropriate authentication
schemes.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-libs/pam       < 1.0.4                               >= 1.0.4

Description
===========

Marcus Granado repoted that Linux-PAM does not properly handle user
names that contain Unicode characters. This is related to integer
signedness errors in the pam_StrTok() function in libpam/pam_misc.c.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a Denial of
Service. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this
vulnerability to log in to a system with the account of a user that has
a similar user name, but with non-ASCII characters.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Linux-PAM users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =sys-libs/pam-1.0.4

References
==========
