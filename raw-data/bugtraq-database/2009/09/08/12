Hi Kingcope,

Thanks to a hint by "Petar" on the G-SEC blog [1] it  appears
that the  very same bug was present in IIS3 and IIS4 and discovered
by eeye in 1999 :
http://research.eeye.com/html/advisories/published/AD19990124.html

"Microsoft  IIS  (Internet  Information Server) FTP service contains a
buffer overflow in the NLST command. This could be used to DoS a remote
machine and in some cases execute code remotely."

Is this the same bug andwas the bug re-introduced ? Has Microsoft
fixed  LS  but  not NLST?  "svn" mishap ?

Maybe Mudge and/or Dildog can comment - would certainly be interesting
to know whether and if HOW this bug was reintroduced.
