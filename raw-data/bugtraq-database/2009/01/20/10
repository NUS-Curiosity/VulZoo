>From the Cisco advisory:

  The Cisco IOS FTP Server feature contains multiple vulnerabilities that 
  can result in a denial of service (DoS) condition, improper verification 
  of user credentials, and the ability to retrieve or write any file from 
  the device filesystem, including the device's saved configuration. This 
  configuration file may include passwords or other sensitive information.

None of those sound like "remote overflow" to me. If this exploit code 
included in this mail is accurate, that means the Cisco advisory used 
crafty wording to hide the nate of the bug. Given they scored CSCek55259 / 
CVE-2007-2586 as 10.0 (and the other issue 2.0), that means that "improper 
verification of user credentials" and "Improper authorization checking in 
IOS FTP server" is really "remote overflow that allows unauthenticated 
code execution".

Andy or Cisco, could you confirm?
