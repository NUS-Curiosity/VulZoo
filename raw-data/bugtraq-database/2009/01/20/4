Subject: Re: Remote Cisco IOS FTP exploit

Good morning,

Look in the 'Impact' section of the advisory.   We break out the
probable impact into a separate section.

In that section, we clearly state that arbitrary code execution is
possible.  We also included the access vector in the bug scoring
(Remote, no authentication required).

Hopefully it clarifies your question.


Here is the section:

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow unauthorized,
remote users to access the filesystem on the IOS device, cause the
affected device to reload, or execute arbitrary code.

Unauthorized users could retrieve the device's startup-config file from
the filesystem. This file may contain information that could allow the
attacker to gain escalated privileges.

Repeated exploitation of the vulnerabilities could lead to an extended
Denial of Service (DoS).

Thanks-
Russ
