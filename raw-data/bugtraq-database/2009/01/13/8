Description:
    When the existing_ticket option is enabled, previous versions of the
    pam_krb5 package use incorrect privileges when reading a Kerberos
    credential cache, which allows other local users to gain privileges
    by setting the KRB5CCNAME environment variable to an arbitrary cache
    filename and running the su or sudo program.  It may be possible to
    mount a similar attack using sshd if sshd is configured insecurely,
    but such a configuration will be otherwise vulnerable and so this
    is not considered relevant.
    
    rPath Linux does not ship with the existing_ticket option enabled
    by default, and therefore is by default not vulnerable to this attack.
