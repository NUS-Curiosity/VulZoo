Subject: Web Hacking Incidents update for Jan 28th


The incidents reported on WHID (the web hacking incidents database) last
week where:

* WHID 2009-11: Lil Kim Facebook Hacked
(http://whid.xiom.com/WHID/2009/11/Lil_Kim_Facebook_Hacked):
	Together with the Soulja Boy Incident last year
(http://whid.xiom.com/WHID/2008/56/Soulja_Boy_Myspace_Hacked) and the
Twitter hack earlier this month (http://whid.xiom.com/whid-2009-2) shows
that inherent insecurity of Web 2.0 due to mismanagement by the (often
hi-profile) users.

* WHID 2009-10: MacRumorsLive feed hack
(http://whid.xiom.com/WHID/2009/10/MacRumorsLive_feed_hacked)

Health Story

	If I had ten cents for each hack involving Steve Jobs health....

* WHID 2009-9: MetaFilter suffers an SQL injection attack
(http://whid.xiom.com/whid-2009-9-MetaFilter_suffers_an_SQL_injection_attack

In addition we are looking for information about two high profile incidents
to determine if they where web hacks or not. If you have public information
shedding light on either the Monster or Heartland incidents, let us know
