Published:

Updated:

Vendor:
SonyEricsson

Platforms:
Multiple


Vulnerability Details
---------------------
Class:
Denial of Service

Remote:
Yes

Local:
No

Public References:
Not Assigned

Affected:
Multiple devices.

Successfully tested on:

W910i
W660i
K618i
K610i
Z610i
K810i
K660i
W880i
K530i

Other devices based on the same (or earlier) platform are likely to be
vulnerable.

Not Affected:
More recent devices may be not vulnerable.

Description:
A malformed WAP Push packet is able to remotely reboot the handset and,
in some cases, completely hang it.

In case the handset hangs, battery removal is needed in order to restore
normal functionalities.
By sending multiple malformed packet via SMS, an attacker may be able to
reboot the handset multiple times, effectively performing an extended
denial of service.

The attack can also be performed over an IP bearer using UDP port 2948.
In this case a single malformed broadcast packet can be used to attack
and disable a large number of devices, leading to a much heavier impact.

Solutions & Workaround:
Not available
