======================================================================

The annual ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference is a
leading international forum for information security researchers,
practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and
results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences.  The
conference seeks submissions from academia, government, and industry
presenting novel research on all practical and theoretical aspects of
computer and communications security, as well as case studies and
implementation experiences. Papers should have relevance to the
construction, evaluation, application, or operation of secure
systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing argument for the
practical significance of the results. All topic areas related to
computer and communications security are of interest and in scope.
Accepted papers will be published by ACM Press in the conference
proceedings. Outstanding papers will be invited for possible
publication in a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Information
and System Security.

Paper Submission Process:

Submissions must be made by the deadline of April 20, 2009, through  
the website:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ccs2009. Submitted papers
must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that
are simultaneously submitted to a journal, conference or
workshop. Simultaneous submission of the same work is not
allowed. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers
will be presented at the conference.

Paper Format:

Submissions must be at most ten pages in double-column ACM format
(note: pages must be numbered), excluding the bibliography and
well-marked appendices and at most 12 pages overall. All submissions
must be anonymized (an author's name should only occur in references
to that author's related work, which should be referenced in the third
person and not overtly distinguishable from the referenced work of
others). Only PDF or Postscript files will be accepted. Submissions
not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of
their merits.

Tutorial Submissions:

Proposals for long (3-hour) and short (1.5-hour) tutorials on research
topics of current and emerging interest should be submitted
electronically to the tutorials chair by May 25, 2009. The guidelines
for tutorial proposal can be found on the website.
