Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Security Manager Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20090121-csm

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20090121-csm.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2009 January 21 1600 UTC (GMT)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Security Manager contains a vulnerability when it is used with
Cisco IPS Event Viewer (IEV) that results in open TCP ports on both
the Cisco Security Manager server and IEV client. An unauthenticated,
remote attacker could leverage this vulnerability to access the MySQL
databases or IEV server.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. A workaround is also available to mitigate this
vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20090121-csm.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

All 3.1 and 3.2 versions prior to 3.2.2 of Cisco Security Manager are
affected by this vulnerability. Cisco IEV is installed with Cisco
Security Manager by default, but the vulnerability is not exposed
until IEV has been launched.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The following products have been confirmed not vulnerable:

  * Cisco Security Manager 3.2.2
  * Cisco Security Manager 3.0.x and earlier
  * Standalone implementations of Cisco IEV
  * Cisco IPS Manager Express

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco Security Manager is an enterprise-class management application
that is designed to configure firewall, VPN, and intrusion prevention
security services on Cisco network and security devices. As part of
Cisco Security Manager installation, the Cisco IEV is installed by
default. The IEV is a Java-based application that allows users to
view and manage alerts for up to five sensors, including the ability
to report top alerts, attackers, and victims over a specified number
of hours or days. Users can connect to and view alerts in real time
or via imported log files, configure filters and views to help manage
alerts, and import and export event data for further analysis.

A vulnerability exists in the Cisco Security Manager server. When the
IEV is launched, it opens several remotely available TCP ports on the
Cisco Security Manager server and client. These ports could allow
remote, unauthenticated root access to the IEV database and server.
When IEV is closed, it closes open ports on the Cisco Security
Manager client that launched the IEV but fails to close open ports on
the server. If the IEV has never been used on the system, the Cisco
Security Manager server is not vulnerable.

The IEV database contains events that are collected from Cisco
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) devices. The IEV server allows an
unauthenticated user to add, delete, or modify the devices that are
added into the IEV.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID: CSCsv66897 

This vulnerability have been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) identifiers CVE-2008-3820.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss 

CSCsv66897: Cisco Security Manager/IEV: TCP Ports open for remote 
            connection without any authentication

CVSS Base Score - 8.8

 Access Vector           - Network
 Access Complexity       - Medium
 Authentication          - None
 Confidentiality Impact  - Complete
 Integrity Impact        - Complete
 Availability Impact     - None

CVSS Temporal Score - 7.3

 Exploitability          - Functional
 Remediation Level       - Official-Fix
 Report Confidence       - Confirmed

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in remote
root access to the IEV database or to the IEV Server. Upon launching
the IEV remotely accessible ports are opened on the Cisco Security
Manager server and the client where the IEV is launched. When the IEV
application is closed these ports are subsequently closed on the
client however remain open on the Cisco Security Manager server.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

A software patch for Cisco Security Manager versions 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.2
and 3.2.1 is available for download at: 
http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/csm-app?psrtdcat20e2

Please read the corresponding readme files for installation
instructions.

Workarounds
===========

In the event that Cisco IEV is not being used, administrators are
advised to disable the functionality until a patch is applied. To
disable IEV on Cisco Security Manager, perform the following steps:

 1. Access the Microsoft Windows Server that Cisco Security Manager
    is installed on.

 2. Open the Services dialog box (Choose Start > Administrative Tools
    > Services).

 3. Locate the Cisco IPS Event Viewer service and open Properties.

 4. Change Startup Type: to Disabled and click Ok.

 5. Stop the Cisco IPS Event Viewer service.

 6. Stop and Restart the Cisco Security Manager Daemon Manager
    service.

 7. Confirm that the Cisco IPS Event Viewer service has not
    restarted.

    Upon disabling the Cisco IPS Event Viewer service, the open ports
    on the Cisco Security Manager server will be closed.

    Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices
    within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation
    Bulletin companion document for this advisory: 
    http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20090121-csm.shtml
