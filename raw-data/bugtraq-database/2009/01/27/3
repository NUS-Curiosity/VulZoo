ASPR #2009-01-27-1: HTML Injection in BEA WebLogic Server Console
=========================================================================

Document ID:     ASPR #2009-01-27-1-PUB
Vendor:          ORACLE (http://www.oracle.com)
Target:          Oracle WebLogic Server 10.0
Impact:          There is an HTML Injection vulnerability in WebLogic
                 Server 10 Administration Console that allows the
                 attacker to gain administrative access to the server.
Severity:        High
Status:          Official patch available, workarounds available
Discovered by:   Sasa Kos of ACROS Security

Summary
=======

There is an HTML Injection vulnerability in WebLogic Server 10 
Administration Console that allows the attacker to gain administrative 
access to the server. It is possible to craft such URL that will, when 
requested from the server, return a document with arbitrarily chosen HTML 
injected. An obvious use for this type of vulnerability is cross- site 
scripting that can be used, among other things, for obtaining session 
cookies from WebLogic administrators. These cookies, when stolen, provide 
the attacker with administrative access to WebLogic Administration 
Console, compromising the security of the entire web server. 

This vulnerability is exploitable even if the Administration Console is 
only being accessed via HTTPS, and even if the Administrative Port is 
enabled.


Product Coverage
================

- WebLogic Server 10.0
 
Note: Our tests were only performed on the above product version. Other 
versions may or may not be affected. 


Analysis 
========

Some URL argument in the WebLogic Server 10 Administration Console is 
not properly sanitized against HTML injection, which allows the attacker 
to introduce additional, malicious HTML to the server's response. The 
most common type of HTML injection is injection of malicious client-side 
script, commonly known as cross-site scripting.

In an actual attack the user would not be required to open URLs specified 
by the attacker. Instead, a malicious web page visited by the logged-in 
WebLogic administrator would mount the entire attack automatically and 
covertly. For instance, a tiny 0x0 pixel iframe could be used for loading 
the URL from the demonstration immediately upon administrator's visit to 
the malicious page, injecting the malicious script to the WebLogic 
server's response. This malicious script would then silently send these 
cookies to the attacker's server, where she could pick them up and use 
them for entering the administrator's session in the Administration 
Console.


Mitigating Factors 
==================

- In order to execute the above attack, the attacker would need to make 
the administrator's browser visit a malicious web page while the 
administrator is logged into the Administration Console. This can be 
achieved using social engineering, network traffic modification or a 
combination of both. 

- If the attacker manages to obtain a valid ADMINCONSOLESESSION cookie 
(and optionally _WL_AUTHCOOKIE_ADMINCONSOLESESSION cookie), these will 
only be useful until the administrator logs out of the Administration 
Console. However, the attacker knowing that might rush to create a new 
administrative user in the console and use that user for WebLogic 
administration after the legitimate administrator has logged off.


Solution 
========

ORACLE has issued a security bulletin [1] and published a patch which 
fixes this issue.


Workaround 
==========

- WebLogic administrators can be trained not to browse other web pages 
while logged in to the Administration Console. However, since some 
hyperlinks in the console point to servers on the Internet (e.g., 
http://support.bea.com) the attacker could watch the administrator's 
Internet traffic and detect such requests as a strong sign that the 
administrator is currently logged in to the Administration Console. She 
would then slightly modify the Internet server's response so as to include 
the malicious code. Such an attack could only be mounted by attackers 
capable of monitoring and modifying the administrator's Internet traffic 
(most likely an ISP or someone who broke into an ISP). 

- The WebLogic Administration Console can be disabled, which would 
neutralize this vulnerability.
