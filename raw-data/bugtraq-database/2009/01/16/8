Subject: Announce: RSBAC 1.4.0 released

Rule Set Based Access Control (RSBAC) 1.4.0 has been released for both
Linux kernels 2.4.37 and 2.6.27.10
You can download the new version from http://www.rsbac.org

RSBAC is one of the leading access control systems for the Linux
kernel with a good selection of access control models, see
http://www.rsbac.org/why for more details.

Important changes since 1.3 series:

  *  VUM (Virtual User Management) support (http://rsbac.org/redir.php?t=vum)
  * One time password support for user management 
(http://rsbac.org/redir.php?t=otp)
  * Code for kernels 2.4 and 2.6 has been separated. 2.4 kernels might
be phased out at a later date.
  * PAM module does not send a message "User not authenticated" anymore
if authentication failed. (To match other PAM modules behavior)
  * Made PAM password prompt standard and definable to RSBAC's custom
prompt if the user wants it only.
  * rsbac_useradd -K to copy a user with password.
  * rsbac_mount now uses kernel's vfs_mount


About RSBAC 1.4:
---

RSBAC 1.4 mainly introduces the new Virtual User Management feature ( 
(http://rsbac.org/redir.php?t=vum),
which allows to isolate complete sets of users in so-called "virtual sets". 
Every user in every set can have individual passwords and access rights.

As an example, you can start your mail server in a different set, and
the users getting the email will not be part of the system users.

Likewise, your jails can be started in a different set, so that the
users in that jail will never be the same ones as the real system users.

You can specify the user set with the usual tools by specifying the
full user path, e.g.:

0/0 defines user id 0 (root) in virtual set 0 (eg system user root)
0/1000 defines user id 1000 in virtual set 0 (eg a system user)
1/secoff defines user secoff in virtual set 1 (e.g. with uid 400)
2/1000 defines user id 1000 in virtual set 2 (for example, mail users
could be in set 2)
