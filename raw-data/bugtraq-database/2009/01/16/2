Vulnerability Description: Syslserve 1.058 is vulnerable to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to handle user-supplied input. Sending a specially crafted UDP Syslog request will cause the application to become unstable and stop responding.

Impact: A remote or local attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted packet to the Syslog server. Successful exploitation of this flaw will cause the Syslog server process to crash preventing valid users or devices from using the service. The Syslog server will need to be restarted to resume normal Syslog server operations.
