 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2009:016
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/

 Package : xen
 Date    : January 16, 2009
 Affected: Corporate 4.0

 Problem Description:

 Ian Jackson found a security issue in the QEMU block device drivers
 backend that could allow a guest operating system to issue a block
 device request and read or write arbitrary memory locations, which
 could then lead to privilege escalation (CVE-2008-0928).
 
 It was found that Xen allowed unprivileged DomU domains to overwrite
 xenstore values which should only be changeable by the privileged
 Dom0 domain.  An attacker able to control a DomU domain could possibly
 use this flaw to kill arbitrary processes in Dom0 or trick a Dom0
 user into accessing the text console of a different domain running
 on the same host.  This update makes certain parts of xenstore tree
 read-only to unprivilged DomU domains (CVE-2008-4405).
 
 A vulnerability in the qemu-dm.debug script was found in how it
 created a temporary file in /tmp.  A local attacker in Dom0 could
 potentially use this flaw to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink
 attack (CVE-2008-4993).  Since this script is not used in production,
 it has been removed from this update package.
 
 The updated packages have been patched to prevent these issues.
