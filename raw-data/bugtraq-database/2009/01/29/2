Subject: Re: Advisory: Google Chrome 1.0.154.43 ClickJacking Vulnerability.

Hello Aditya,

> http://www.secniche.org/gcr_clkj

1) It is by now well-understood that because of the inherent and
broadly depended on properties of HTML, every sufficiently featured
browser is and likely will remain susceptible to the behavior known as
clickjacking. A more thorough analysis, also covering Chrome, is
provided here:

2) To my best knowledge, the proof of concept provided in your post,
where a same-origin <div> follows a mouse pointer, is not a valid
demonstration of the issue at hand.
