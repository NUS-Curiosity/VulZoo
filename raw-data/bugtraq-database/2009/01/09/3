					Shakacon III 
		"Sun, Surf, and C Shells"
				 CALL FOR PAPERS
		www.shakacon.org\2009CFP.html
------------------------------------------
Who:   Shakacon Crew
What:  Shakacon III
When:  June 11 - 12 2009 
Where: Paradise (Honolulu, HI - Hawaii Convention Center)
Why:	 Why NOT?
How:   By plane, boat, canoe, yacht, hydrofoil, stand-up paddle board, jet ski, 
long board, dolphin, whale sled, nuclear submarine, etc.



[Overview]
Sitting around somewhere freezing your a$$ off?  Dreaming about warm days, rainbows, decadent 
tropical drinks sipped out of coconuts? Sure you could drop your 0day in Vegas, bring down the 
Internet in Germany, or satisfy your dark desires in Asia but we think you should submit your 
research or topics to our CFP and maybe win yourself a paid trip to Hawaii.  

The Shakacon security conference is a laid back conference where industry, government, academia 
and independent experts will get together to share knowledge and experience in one of the most
beautiful places on Earth.  

Shakacon will offer local, national, and international participants a casual, social, learning 
environment designed to present a "holistic" security view and the opportunity to network with 
peers and fellow enthusiasts in a relaxed setting.  Leave your ego at the airport (or shoreline 
if you come in via another method)as we look forward to attendees varying in skill level from N00b 
to Ninja.
  
During the day, sessions will include: best practices, case studies, research projects, etc. 
covering all different aspects of the information security landscape .  There will be something 
for everyone and if sitting through talks isn't your cup of kava, there will be exciting events 
and contests for you to sharpen your skills and knowledge on.

[Trainer Opportunities]
Don't want to speak at the Con but have an uncanny ability to teach and a proven track record for 
delivering quality courseware and want to come to Hawaii? We're also interested in bringing in trainers
to provide world class training leading up to ShakaCon (June 8, 9, 10). Submit a synopsis/class agenda, prior 
teaching experience, and maybe get selected to teach in Hawaii.

 
[CFP Details]
(1) Abstract for papers must be submitted to the review committee by _February 15th, 2009_.

(2) Selection notification will occur by _February 27th, 2009_ and abstracts posted to the site 
on _March 1, 2009_.

(3) Slides for your papers must be submitted by _April 15, 2009_.

 
There are only a limited number of speaking sessions for which the conference organizers will provide 
travel and accommodations.  Speaking slots should be generally limited to 1 hour; however we will
accept "turbo" talk submissions and if we have enough we'll blend them into a block of the conference.

The audience will be a broad mix of professional, academic, and enthusiast, so we welcome both technical 
and non-technical submissions on all aspects of security.  The key criteria are practicality and timeliness.  
We want to provide our attendees with up to date materials they can take away and immediately gain
benefit from as well as new research or tools.  Absolutely NO SALES presentations will be accepted - our 
attendees don't show up to hear people talk about what you can sell them or why they need your services - or how 
your new anti0daySaaSuberfuzzymagadget will solve all their security woes.

Proposals should include:
