Affects: TFTPUtil GUI versions 1.2.0 and 1.3.0
Fixed in: 1.4.0
Risk: High

Vulnerability Description: TFTPUtil GUI versions 1.2.0 and 1.3.0 are vulnerable to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to handle user-supplied input. Sending a specially crafted TFTP request with a overlong filename will cause the application to become unstable and stop responding.

Impact: A remote or local attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted packet to the TFTP server. Successful exploitation of this flaw will cause the TFTP server process to crash preventing valid users or devices from using the service. The TFTP server will need to be restarted to resume normal TFTP server operations.
