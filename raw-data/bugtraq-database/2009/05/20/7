I wouldn't agree entirely. It depends on who is given the password for
the local administrator account. You only have no accountability if more
than one person knows that password.

Please elaborate. What attack scenarios do you see that aren't mitigated
by a strong password? Besides, even if you change the login name, the
SID of the account (which is well-known) still remains the same.

I entirely fail to see what additional security that will gain you, so
please explain.

I don't believe they're actually used by anyone anymore. However, the
use of LM-hashes is still enabled by default on any XP.
