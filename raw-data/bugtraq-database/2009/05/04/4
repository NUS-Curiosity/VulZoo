4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in IBM Tivoli
Storage Manager Agent Client (dsmagent.exe), which can be exploited by
malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

1) A boundary error in a generic string handling function when parsing
strings from request packets can be exploited to cause stack-based 
buffer overflow.

2) A boundary error when copying the NodeName from a request packet in
dicuGetIdentifyRequest can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer
overflow.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
