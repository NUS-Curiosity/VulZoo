Subject: [SecNiche WhitePaper ] -  PDF Silent HTTP Form Repurposing Attacks

Hi

This paper sheds light on the modified approach to trigger web attacks
through JavaScript protocol handler
in the context of browser when a PDF is opened in it. As we have seen,
the kind of security mechanism
implemented by Adobe in order to remove the insecurities that originate
directly from the standalone PDF
document in order to circumvent cross domain access. The attack is
targeted on the web applications that
allow PDF documents to be uploaded on the web server.
