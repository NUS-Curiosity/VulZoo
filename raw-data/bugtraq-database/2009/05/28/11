Well MaXe,

That's very clever of you.  The "vendor" is rolling out a patch and new version to address the issues you have raised.  Not sure why you beleive this software, developed with untold manhours and effort, and then offered for a very modest fee, should be released without appropriate pirating protections.  ..and why you woouldn't warn them and subsequently countless innocents of the issue.  Isn't this what your site is about?

But thanks for raising the issue.
