I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quote: "Panda Security is one of the world's leading creators 
and developers of technologies, products and services for 
keeping clients' IT resources free from viruses and other 
computer threats at the lowest possible Total Cost of Ownership."

II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The parsing engine can be bypassed by a specially crafted CAB
archive.

III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~
A general description of the impact and nature of AV Bypasses/evasions
can be read at : 
http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

The bug results in denying the engine the possibility to inspect
code within CAB archives. There is no inspection of the content
at all and hence the impossibility to detect malicious code.

IV. Disclosure timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DD/MM/YYYY
13/04/2009 : Send proof of concept CAB, description the terms under which 
             I cooperate and the planned disclosure date
                         
13/04/2009 : Panda acks receipt and starts investigating 
                         
15/04/2009 : Panda denies DoS and bypass condition and considers the bug a reporting
                         issue as a MAX Size rule blocks the sample.
                         
16/04/2009 : Ask if the Gatedefender product ranges, detects, flags or
             blocks the POC file. 

17/04/2009 : Provide a new POC file to Panda that aims at evading
             the Max Size rule and detection.
                                                 
17/04/2009 : Panda acks receipt and will investigate.

20/04/2009 : Inform Panda that I sent the wrong POC on the 17/04/2009
             and attached the correct one.

28/04/2009 : Ping Panda for updates

28/04/2009 : Panda states that they are planning the patch timeline
