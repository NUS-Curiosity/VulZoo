Subject: Serena Dimensions CM Desktop Client does not validate the server
 SSL certificate

Application: Serena Dimensions CM
Affected versions: 10.1 and later
Vulnerability: man-in-the-middle attacks
Problem type: remote

Problem description:
====================

The client/server connection can be SSL encrypted by setting "-ssl" in the listener.dat. The problem is that the Desktop client accepts any server certificates. They may be self signed or signed by a CA. But there is no user interaction required to accept the certificate. There is also no possibility to configure trusted certificates.

The vulnerability allows a man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker can read and modify the data betweeen client and server. This requires to modify the network traffic between client and server.

Resolution:
===========

There is currently no patch available for this problem.
