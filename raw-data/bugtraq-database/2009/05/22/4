email addresses via SMTP, which could be exploited by remote
unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM
privileges.

the Novell GroupWise Internet Agent (GWIA) when processing certain
SMTP requests, which could be exploited by remote unauthenticated
attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
