I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quote: "Avira AntiVir is a reliable free antivirus solution, that constantly 
and rapidly scans your computer for malicious programs such as viruses, 
Trojans, backdoor programs, hoaxes, worms, dialers etc. Monitors 
every action executed by the user or the operating system and reacts 
promptly when a malicious program is detected.

The protection experts have numerous company locations throughout 
Germany and cultivate partnerships in Europe, Asia and America. 
Avira has more than 180 employees at their main office in Tettnang 
near Lake Constance and is one of the largest employers in the region. 

AV-Comparatives e.V. have chosen Avira AntiVir Premium as the 
best anti-virus solution of 2008"


II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The heuristics can be bypassed by a special formated PDF "container", this
leads to the bypass of malicious PDF files, old or new. This is not a 
bypass that relies on archive structures but relies on evading certain 
code paths in the av engine "through various means".


III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~

To know more about the impact and type of "evasion", I updated the 
description at http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

Interestingly this opens the possibility to evade at scan time and
run-time.
