Subject: PAPER: Dynamic Data Flow Analysis via Virtual Code Integration (aka The SpiderPig case)

SpiderPig is a project created for performing and visualizing data flow 
analysis of a selected binary program. SpiderPig was created in the purpose 
of providing a tool which would be able to help vulnerability and security 
researchers with tracing and analyzing any necessary data and it's further 
propagation. Such tasks are very often crucial in the vulnerability 
discovering/identifying process and typically require a lot of time 
consuming manual work. Following paper discusses methods and techniques 
implemented in SpiderPig in order to perform semi-automatic data flow 
analysis.
