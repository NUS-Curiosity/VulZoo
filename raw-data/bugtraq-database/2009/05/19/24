Affects: NetDecision TFTP Server 4.2
Fixed in: N/A
Risk: MEDIUM

Vulnerability Description: NetDecision TFTP Server 4.2 is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sanitize TFTP GET and PUT requests. By using a specially crafted TFTP request an attacker is capable of putting (PUT) and retrieving (GET) files outside of the TFTP root directory.

Impact: The ability to PUT and GET files outside of the TFTP root directory may allow an attacker to obtain more information about the underlying operating system and applications running on the host. Additionally, malicious code can be uploaded to the host operating system.

[--Background--]

Type of vulnerability: Input validation flaw
Who can exploit it: Local and remote users
