iDefense Security Advisory 05.12.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 12, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Mac OS X is a computer operating systems available from Apple Inc. OS X
is the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for Macintosh
computers and is Unix-based.

For more information, see the vendor's site found at the following link.

http://www.apple.com/support/leopard/internet/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an index validation vulnerability in Apple Inc.'s
Mac OS X xnu kernel could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
in the security context of the kernel.

The Mac OS X xnu (Mach) kernel implements workqueues. This allows the
kernel to schedule events to take place in a task. An input validation
error exists within this implementation, which can lead to execution of
arbitrary code in the kernel.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code
in the security context of the kernel. An attacker would need a local
account on a vulnerable system to exploit this issue. Upon successful
exploitation, the attacker could elevate privileges by changing the
effective user id to root of an attacker controlled process.
Alternatively an attacker could also add or alter kernel code in memory
that is commonly referred to as a rootkit.

IV. DETECTION

Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X 10.5.2 and earlier is considered vulnerable to
this issue.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.
