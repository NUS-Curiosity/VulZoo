Subject: Re: Insufficient Authentication vulnerability in Asus notebook

While we are at it... quite a few Thin Clients based on Windows XPe  
deply with Administrator / Administrator and User / User as default  
user / pass combinations.  By default User is part of the  
Administrator group. For an Aded bonus there is a VNC password of Wyse  
or viewonly with the default VNC service.
