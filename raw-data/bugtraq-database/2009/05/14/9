Subject: RE: Insufficient Authentication vulnerability in Asus notebook

Agreed, it is an oversimplification (or a surrender) to say that good security practice is useless on a laptop or tablet because it is not a case of if you will not have complete control, but rather when and for how long.  Indeed, a comprehensive security plan becomes that much more important.  Look at every laptop as if you will never see it again and ensure that your data remains yours, to the best of your ability.

Of course, having XP home may be considered a vulnerability in and of itself, but that is another matter.

What we as a community have to realize is that we have new blood coming in all the time and issues like this being brought back up are good to ensure that something as simple as this is not missed because it is assumed that we all know it.

Thanks,

I disagree. You are involved in intense business negotiations. During lunch you leave your notebook unattended assuming it is safe with a password protected
userID. Your competitor goes in to the conference room and logs in with
Administrator and installs something like eBlaster to log everything
you do and email it to him.

Far fetched, but not a non-issue.

Once someone has physical access all bets are off, there's a lot the
can do.

1) steal it
2) boot off cd and reset/enable admin acct
3) boot off cd and grab all hashes
4) pour a perfectly good frappucino on the keyboard
5) cover it with smiley face stickers


You get the idea.  This is non issue.
