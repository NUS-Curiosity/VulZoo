Subject: RE: Insufficient Authentication vulnerability in Asus notebook

A better option is to set a strong password and set a local policy that the local admin account cannot be accessed over the network.  I'm a big advocate of that in all environments and prevents the need for renaming the account to prevent automated attacks.

Thanks,

We're talking XP Home here, right?  A admin account without a password
cannot be access remotely over the internet, so if you have physical
access at all times of that Asus netbook it's arguably more secure in
some circumstances.
