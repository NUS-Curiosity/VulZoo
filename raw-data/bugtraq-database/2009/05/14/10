im the years and years ago..  maybe.

Dell's response was to ask me for my serial number.
IBM fixed it.

my biggest compliant was that XP pro (non OEM) asked you to set a 
password.  XP pro (OEM) didn't.
In fact, if you were smart enough to figure out how to set the local 
admin password, it would in fact warn you NOT to, telling you that if 
you did you were likely to lose data.

but, as you said, most XP OEM's do ship this way, for whatever reason.

network access to them is restricted, as you said, and once you do get 
physical access, password or not, the guy trying to install a keystroke 
logger when you are on a biobreak just needs a linux password reset boot 
disk.

Its easy enough to fix (IBM did it) but seems IBM was the only company 
that saw this very easy fix something they wanted to do.

(its a flag in the sysinstall ini files.. its just a flag that needs to 
be set)
