Not just XP Home. I can confirm that this "vulnerability" is a standard feature 
of several OEM and MS released versions of both XP Home and XP Professional. 
In both cases I've had to manually re-set the password to something.

This seems to be a "feature" - since if you have to use the recovery console 
it'll ask you for the password for "Administrator"... by default it's blank 
and you can just hit enter.
