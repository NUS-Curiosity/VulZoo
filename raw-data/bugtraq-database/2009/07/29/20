Subject: Re: Citrix XenCenterWeb Multiple Vulnerabilities

It should be noted that Citrix does not offer a feature or product called "XenCenterWeb."  At one time, this tool was included in the informal XenServer Resource Kit, to serve as an example of how to utilize the XenServer SDK and provide web-based consoles for specific types of administrators (where customers had such a need).  It was never a supported product or feature, and is in fact no longer available.
