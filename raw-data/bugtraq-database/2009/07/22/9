There's one significant difference in this one, though: while a bunch  
of nested <div>s (for instance) will just mess with the HTML renderer,  
a malformed or oversized <select> element may end up passing bad data  
to native menu APIs. It's one of the only elements I can think of  
offhand that often has effects which extend outside the HTML canvas.
