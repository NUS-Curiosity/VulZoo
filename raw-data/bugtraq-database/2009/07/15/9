"Refresh" or "Location" redirection in Firefox will not bestow a
security context derived from the referring site upon the executed
code. This is different from the behavior on javascript: URLs.
Granted, it and also somewhat counterintuitive, as other types of
data: navigation - e.g., link navigation, IFRAMEd content, location.*
updates - do inherit that context.

This means that there is nothing to be gained by redirecting to data:
through www.example.com; he could as well just redirect to his own
site and run any potentially malicious JavaScript there.
