Subject: Re:[GSEC-TZO-44-2009] One bug to rule them all - Firefox, IE, Safari,Opera, Chrome,Seamonkey,iPhone,iPod,Wii,PS3....


Dear List,
To  all  those  sending in reports, thank you, *but* please read the patch
section.  It  is  normal  that  it doesn't work in Safari, Chrome, FF,
Opera any longer, they have been patched. Try IE for an example.

To stop the flood of mails, explaining that the POC doesn't work
on mozilla x.y, or safari x.y. Read the "PATCH" section. Please.


Regards,
Thierry
