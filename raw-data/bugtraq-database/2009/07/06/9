Subject: High security hole in NullLogic Groupware

Hi,

I've identified a couple of security flaws affecting the NullLogic Groupware  
which may allow compromise of accounts, denial of service or even remote code 
execution.  These issues were reported by email to the developer but no 
response was forthcoming.
