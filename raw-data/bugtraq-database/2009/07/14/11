-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is
required in that a target must visit a malicious page or open a
malicious video file.

The specific flaw exists within Microsoft's DirectShow module
quartz.dll. While parsing QuickTime atoms the NumberOfEntries field is
trusted and if modified can control the location of several pointers
meant to track stream positions.  Specifying values that are larger than
the number of bytes left to process in the input file will cause
corruption that can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.


-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
