Subject: computer crime statistics

Good day to all of you,

I'm having loads of troubles finding computer crimes' statistics (crimes
that are related to physical security - eg. Login, root access, ntlm/sam,
etc). I did some search on google and many other websites. But I've yet to
encounter a statistics or survey for the mentioned above computer crime.

Does anyone have any idea where I can get them?

Thank you.
