Hello Jeremiah!

It's possible that Microsoft made IE8 more stable then IE6, so you have such
result with this exploit.

Also take into account the hardware of your computer. If your computer is
powerful enough, then this attack on IE8 and even on IE6 and IE7 can be not
so effective (because it's resource consumption in case of IE as I wrote),
as it can be at not powerful computers. And many people in the world have
not so powerful computers.
