Hi Michal,

Yes,  we  all  know  that.  The  flaw here was not looping on itself a
thousands  of  times,  wow.  It was a DOM implementation flaw. That's
what made it interesting. A border case that was not accounted for.

That's  all,  still  interesting.  I don't see how Javascripts endless
loops are similar at all - sorry.
