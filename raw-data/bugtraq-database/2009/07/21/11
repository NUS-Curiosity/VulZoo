Adobe Acrobat 9.1.2 NOS Local Privilege Escalation Exploit

This exploit is based on the brief information provided by
Nine:Situations:Group (http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/9199).

Exploiting improper permissions is fun.

A few notes are in order though. The getPlus service (that I tested,
via 9.1.2) isn't installed as an "Automatic" service, therefore making
it slightly harder (but not hard) to practically use to your
advantage. But I tested running this code under a GUEST account and it
worked pretty good (just the first time though). Change the values as
needed, compile and run.

Things could be more or less silent, lethal or non-lethal... it is
completely up to you. Things cannot get much simpler than this :)

Tested on Windows XP SP3 + Adobe Acrobat 9.1.2 (installed from adobe's
download manager, then updated).
