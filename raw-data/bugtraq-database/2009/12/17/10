VUPEN Security Research - Winamp PNG and JPEG Data Integer Overflow 
Vulnerabilities

http://www.vupen.com/english/research.php


I. BACKGROUND
--------------------- 

Winamp is a proprietary media player written by Nullsoft,
now a subsidiary of AOL. It is skinnable, multi-format
freeware/shareware (from Wikipedia).

Winamp is a one of the world's most popular media players
with over 73 million users globally (comScore Media Metrix,
January 2009).


II. DESCRIPTION
--------------------- 

VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team discovered critical
vulnerabilities affecting Winamp.

These vulnerabilities are caused due to integer overflow errors within
the "jpeg.w5s" and "png.w5s" filters when processing malformed
JPEG or PNG data in a media (e.g. MP3) file, which could allow
attackers to execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into opening
a specially crafted MP3.


III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS
--------------------------------

Winamp version 5.56 and prior


IV. Exploits - PoCs & Binary Analysis
----------------------------------------
