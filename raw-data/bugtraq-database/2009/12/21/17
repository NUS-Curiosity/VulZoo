Subject: TLS Renegotiation Vulnerability: Proof of Concept Code (Python)

Information about a vulnerability in the TLS protocol was published in the
beginning of November 2009. Attackers can take advantage of that vulnerability
to inject arbitrary prefixes into a network connection protected by TLS. This
can result in severe vulnerabilities, depending on the application layer
protocol used over TLS.

RedTeam Pentesting used the Python module "TLS Lite" to develop proof of concept
code that exploits this vulnerability. It is published at

http://www.redteam-pentesting.de/publications/tls-renegotiation

to raise awareness for the vulnerability and its potential impact. Furthermore,
it shall give interested persons the opportunity to analyse applications
employing TLS for further vulnerabilities.
