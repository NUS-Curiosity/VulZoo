Subject: RE: TLS Renegotiation Vulnerability: Proof of Concept Code (Python)

Also, can you change this:

"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Renegotiation Indication Extension, IETF
draft standard that addresses the vulnerability."

To:

"Transport Layer Security (TLS) Renegotiation Indication Extension, IETF TLS
Working Group draft that addresses the vulnerability."

Where "IETF TLS Working Group" is hyperlinked to
http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/tls-charter.html

That would help people who do not have a clue who the IETF or the TLS WG or
that both are open standards forums.

Thanks,

Barry
