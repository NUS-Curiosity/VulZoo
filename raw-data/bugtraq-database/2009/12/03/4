Often, risk is not big, agreed.

Exactly. Imagine someone posting (anonymously) copy of EvilCorp's
internal web pages, that prove EvilCorp is planning  to produce bonsai
kitten, as .pdf. If the pdf contains 'e:\nethome\joe_kitten_lover'
.. then, well, Joe has a problem.

(It would be bad if that .pdf contained username/hostname, too; I
could imagine even timestamps being problematic.)

(And yes, similar problems are elsewhere. Exif contains way too much
information, if you try to leak pictures of bonsai kitten from digital
camera.)
