This isnt a security issue its a privacy issue.

(Fixing rejected post)

Meh.   I replied to something similar off-list.

"Leaking" a pdf with 'e:\nethome\joe_kitten_lover' doesn't remotely "prove"
anything.  If I create a user called MayIMommaDogFaceToTheBannanPatch and
"leaked" a pdf, it doesn't mean Steve Martin was culpable.  This is a
non-issue, no matter how much you might want to create some fanciful "bonsai
kitten" theory to get Joe in trouble, dawg.

While the risk may not be large it is still information that should not be
leaked.  Leaky computers should always be plugged.

Often, risk is not big, agreed.

Exactly. Imagine someone posting (anonymously) copy of EvilCorp's
internal web pages, that prove EvilCorp is planning  to produce bonsai
kitten, as .pdf. If the pdf contains 'e:\nethome\joe_kitten_lover'
.. then, well, Joe has a problem.

(It would be bad if that .pdf contained username/hostname, too; I
could imagine even timestamps being problematic.)

(And yes, similar problems are elsewhere. Exif contains way too much
information, if you try to leak pictures of bonsai kitten from digital
camera.)
