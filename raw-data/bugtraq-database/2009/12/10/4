Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 12.08.09: Microsoft Windows Indeo32 Codec
 Parsing Heap Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.08.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Dec 08, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Indeo Video is a video codec developed by Intel and included in
Microsoft Windows. For more information about Indeo codec, please the
visit following website:
http://ligos.com/index.php/home/products/indeo/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap corruption vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Indeo32 Codec could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
in the context of the affected user.

This vulnerability especially exists in Indeo32 codec ir32_32.dll. The
Indeo32 codec uses the "IV32" FourCC code inside an AVI file. When this
FourCC code is specified in the "strf" chunk in a AVI file, it tells the
movie player to decode the movie stream using Indeo32 codec. When
malformed data is supplied in the Indeo stream, heap corruption can
happen, which results in an exploitable condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the
affected host in the context of the affected user.

Exploitation of this vulnerability would require a user to open a
malicious media file, usually an AVI file; however, since the
vulnerability is in the streaming component of Microsoft Windows,
attacks can be launched from a malicious website or any application
that delivers Web content. In Windows Explorer, if the Web View Content
is enabled, which is the default setting, a single click will open the
malicious file in the preview pane and trigger the vulnerability. An
attacker can host a malicious AVI file and use social engineering
techniques to trick a user into visiting the site or to deliver the
hostile code to a user via e-mail, for example.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed that ir32_32.dll version 3.24.15.3, as included
in fully patched Windows XP as of October 2008, is vulnerable. All
previous versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Restrict access to ir32_32.dll by executing Echo y|cacls
"%SystemRoot%\system32\ir32_32.dll" /E /P everyone:N Impact of
workaround: Video encoded with Indeo codec can't be viewed.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Microsoft has released a patch which addresses this issue. This patch
mitigates the vulnerability by blocking the Indeo codec from being
launched in Internet Explorer or Windows Media player, and by removing
the ability to load this codec from Internet zone by any other
applications. For more information, consult its advisory at the
following URL:
