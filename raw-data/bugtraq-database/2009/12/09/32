-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node
Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the ovsessionmgr.exe application. The
session manager is passed credentials originating from POST variables
sent from the ovlogin.exe CGI application. Both the 'userid' and
'passwd' variables are copied in to a static 0x100 byte heap buffer via
a sprintf() call. By specifying large enough strings this buffer can be
overflowed leading to arbitrary code execution.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
