Subject: UPDATE:  DISA Unix SRR root compromise / CVE-2009-4211 / VU#433821

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

After the issue in CVE-2009-4211 was made public, the Unix SRR script
was removed from http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/SRR/unix.html with a note
saying:

?Due to a recently identified security issue, please do not run any
version of the UNIX SRR scripts until further notice.  The UNIX SRR
scripts will be corrected and posted as soon as possible. Please check
back at a later time for the updated scripts. Thanks for your
understanding and support.?

As of today, a new version dated December 7, 2009 is available for
download.  Unfortunately, although some changes were made, it is still
vulnerable to the issue described in CVE-2009-4211.

The CVE should be updated to reflect that the December, 2009 version is
also vulnerable.  The script should be re-evaluated to remove any
invocations of untrusted programs (especially any done as root).  Users
should continue to avoid running the Unix SRR script until a fixed
version is available.

Below is a walk-through:
