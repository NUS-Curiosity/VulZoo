-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious web page or open a malicious SWF file.

The specific flaw exists in the parsing of JPEG dimensions contained
within an SWF file. Due to the lack of sanity checking when calculating
the frame size of an image it is possible to overflow a heap based
buffer. Successful exploitation of this issue can lead to remote system
compromise under the credentials of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
