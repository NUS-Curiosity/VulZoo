Subject: Notepad++ buffer overflow issue

Hi,

I am the project leader and the maintainer of Notepad++.
Regarding your report, Notepad++ has a vulnerable issue due to a buffer 
overflow
issue (Bugtraq ID:  36426).
Several tests with Notepad++ v5.4.5 and the Notepad++ v5.6.1 (latest 
version)
are processed under XP SP3 and Vista SP1.

However, the buffer overflow issue (crash) can not be reproduced at all 
with the
provided exploit :

Could you check again this vunerable issue?

Thank you in advance
Don
