-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node
Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the OvWebHelp.exe CGI application.
During a string concatenation the process takes the value of the Topic
POST variable and copies it without any length checks into a static
0x400 byte heap buffer. By providing a large enough string this buffer
can be overrun leading to arbitrary code execution.
