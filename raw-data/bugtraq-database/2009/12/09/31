-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node

authentication both the userid and passwd POST variables are passed to
this CGI and copied in to a static 0x100 byte heap buffer via a
sprintf() call. By specifying large enough strings this buffer can be
overflowed leading to arbitrary code execution.
