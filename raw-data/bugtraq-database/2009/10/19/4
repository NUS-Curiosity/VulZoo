Subject: In-depth research on the recent PDF zero-day exploit (CVE-2009-3459)

Hi there,

Just want to let you know, the Fortinet's FortiGuard Global Security
Research Team has provided an in-depth research on the recent PDF
zero-day exploit (CVE-2009-3459).

http://www.fortiguard.com/analysis/pdfanalysis.html

"Taking a look back over this 0-day attack as a whole, each single
part of it is somehow ingenious - whether it be the vulnerability,
operational exploitation, the logic behind it, the way to leverage it
or the final shellcode. The exploitation method through the heap
overflow, which may also be used in future Adobe Reader exploits, is
particularly innovative in itself."
