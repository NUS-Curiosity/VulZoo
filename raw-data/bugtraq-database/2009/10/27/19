Aruba Networks Security Advisory

Title: Malformed 802.11 Association Request frame causes Denial of
Service condition on an Access Point.

Aruba Advisory ID: AID-102609
Revision: 1.0

For Public Release on 10/26/2009

+----------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY

A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered during standard
bug reporting procedures. A malformed 802.11 association request frame
causes a crash on the Access Point (AP) causing a temporary DoS
condition for wireless clients. Prior successful security association
with the wireless network is not required to cause this condition. The
AP recovers automatically by restarting itself.


AFFECTED ArubaOS VERSIONS

 3.3.1.x, 3.3.2.x, RN 3.1.x, 3.4.x, 3.3.2.x-FIPS

 Note: ArubaOS 2.5 is not affected by this issue.

DETAILS

Association Request management frame is used by wireless clients in a
WLAN to initiate an association with the wireless network and negotiate
various connection parameters. A malformed association frame may cause a
crash on the Aruba APs. An attacking station does not need to have
completed a successful security association prior to launching this
attack since association frame is an unprotected management frame. This
vulnerability affects all Aruba APs.


IMPACT

An attacker can inject a malformed association request frame and cause
an AP to crash. This causes a service outage for all clients connected
to that AP. The AP recovers automatically by restarting.  An attacker
could however cause a prolonged DoS condition by flooding the WLAN with
malicious association request frames.

This vulnerability applies equally to both encrypted and unencrypted
WLANs. This vulnerability does not affect wired devices connected the
Aruba Mobility Controller.

CVSS v2 BASE METRIC SCORE: 6.1 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)


WORKAROUNDS
