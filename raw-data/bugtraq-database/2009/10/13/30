-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the copy constructor for a specific DOM
object. When duplicated, more than one reference can be made of anything
assigned to it's properties. When the variable/object goes out of scope,
these properties will be deallocated twice. This results in a heap
corruption which can lead to code execution under the context of the
current user.
