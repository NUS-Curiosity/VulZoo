Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.13.09: Adobe Acrobat and Reader U3D
 File Invalid Array Index Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.13.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 13, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Acrobat Reader/Acrobat are programs for viewing and editing
Portable Document Format (PDF) documents. For more information, see the
vendor's site found at the following link.

http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an invalid array index vulnerability in Adobe
Systems Inc.'s Reader and Acrobat could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs when parsing a U3D file embedded inside of a
PDF. U3D is a file format used to represent 3D images.

When parsing a U3D file, the parsing code fails to validate a value from
the file used as index into a list of objects. This results in an
attacker being able to specify an arbitrary value for a function
pointer, which leads to the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user opening the file. If the Adobe
Reader browser plugin is enabled (this is the default setting), then
this vulnerability can be exploited automatically by simply visiting a
malicious webpage with an embedded PDF. If the browser plugin is
disabled, an attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious
file.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Reader and
Acrobat versions 9.1.3 and 8.1.6. Previous versions may also be
affected.

V. WORKAROUND

A possible mitigation is to prevent Adobe Reader/Acrobat from opening
files directly in the browser. If this functionality is disabled, then
the user will have to open the file via the 'Open' button (or save it
and open it later manually) if it is embedded in a webpage.

Additionally, disabling JavaScript in Adobe Reader/Acrobat will make the
vulnerability more difficult to exploit in a reliable fashion.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Adobe has addressed this issue with an update. Further details and
patches can be found at the following URL.
