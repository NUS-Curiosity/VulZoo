Vulnerability #2

DETAILS

Avast! installs some program files with insecure permissions. "Everyone" group has "Full Control" rights to the files/folders in the following path: "%Program Files%\Alwil Software\Avast4\Data". Its mean that any unprivileged user can modify, delete or change permissions of any file in DATA folder. The folder consists of data, executable and configuration files. In result multiple attack vectors are possible.

Vulnerability #1 Local privilege escalation (CVE-2009-3524)

A local attacker (unprivileged user) can modify %Program Files%\Alwil Software\Avast4\Data\avast4.ini file. "ISAPIFilter1" parameter in avast4.ini contains filename or full path to ISAPI filter module � originally "ashWsFtr.dll". An attacker can replace the original path by path to the attackers malicious dynamic library (DLL). After restart attackers DLL will be loaded with SYSTEM privileges. This is local privilege escalation vulnerability.

Vulnerability #2 Denial of Service

A local attacker (unprivileged user) could cause denial of service conditions in Avast! by deleting %Program Files%\Alwil Software\Avast4\Data\400.vps file. After system restart all Avast! modules failed to load.

EXPLOITATION

An attacker must have valid logon credentials to a system where vulnerable software is installed.
