Subject: Corsaire White Paper: Attacking Magstripe Gift Cards

Hi there,

We just published a research paper on the topic of attacking magstripe
gift cards with a focus on unauthorized purchases. It is based on
research conducted on a large number of UK gift cards.

The paper also provides a series of guidelines and tips for developers
and systems architects who are involved in the process of implementing
their own gift card technology.
