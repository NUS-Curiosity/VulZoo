Do your homework and test it. You can't create the hardlink - the link(oldpath, newpath) call will fail with EACCES if search permission is denied for any directory in oldpath or newpath. Documented in the manpage, and I just tested and verified it.

Fact is, directory permissions are relevant in Unix. Despite it's permissions, under the Unix access permission semantics the file is unwriteable for anyone but the owner, and this bug pokes a hole into that.
