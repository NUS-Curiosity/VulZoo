I repeat: Show me how to gain write access without using /proc, and
I'll agree with you.

(To recap:

While file permissions allow writing, directory permissions do not
allow any access at all.

guest has open file descriptor for reading.

Trouble is that guest can upgrade file descriptor to one that allows
writing.)
