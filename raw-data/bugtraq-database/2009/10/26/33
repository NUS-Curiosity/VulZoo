Dear Pavel,

> ... that's exactly the problem.

I see, the /proc/*/fd/* objects seem "confused": are they symlinks,
hardlinks, or open file descriptors? I guess should always act as
the latter, where access mode flags (O_RDONLY or O_RDWR) are set at
open() and not changeable afterwards in fcntl(). Any open() on them
should behave as a dup().

Cheers, Paul
