Improper parsing of the PDF structure leads to evasion of detection of 
malicious PDF documents at scantime and runtime.
  
This has been tested with several malicious PDF files and represents
a generic evasion of all PDF signatures and heuristics.

General information about evasion/bypasses can be found at :
