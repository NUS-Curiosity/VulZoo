Synopsis
========

The Real VNC client is vulnerable to execution of arbitrary code when
connecting to a malicious server.

Background
==========

Real VNC is a remote desktop viewer display system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/vnc       < 4.1.3                               >= 4.1.3

Description
===========

An unspecified vulnerability has been discovered int the
CMsgReader::readRect() function in the VNC Viewer component, related to
the encoding type of RFB protocol data.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious VNC
server, or leverage Man-in-the-Middle attacks, to cause the execution
of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the VNC
viewer.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Real VNC users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/vnc-4.1.3"
