Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow might lead to the execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service.

Background
==========

The Irrlicht Engine is an open source cross-platform high performance
realtime 3D engine written in C++.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-games/irrlicht        < 1.5                            >= 1.5

Description
===========

An unspecified component of the B3D loader is vulnerable to a buffer
overflow due to missing boundary checks.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted .irr
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service
(crash).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All irrlicht users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-games/irrlicht-1.5"

==========
