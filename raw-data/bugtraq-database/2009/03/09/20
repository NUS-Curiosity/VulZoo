Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in gitweb allow for remote execution of
arbitrary commands.

Background
==========

GIT - the stupid content tracker, the revision control system used by
the Linux kernel team.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-util/git      < 1.6.0.6                            >= 1.6.0.6

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in gitweb that is part of
the git package:

* Shell metacharacters related to git_search are not properly
  sanitized (CVE-2008-5516).

* Shell metacharacters related to git_snapshot and git_object are not
  properly sanitized (CVE-2008-5517).

* The diff.external configuration variable as set in a repository can
  be executed by gitweb (CVE-2008-5916).

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands via
shell metacharacters in a query, remote attackers with write access to
a git repository configuration can execute arbitrary commands with the
privileges of the user running gitweb by modifying the diff.external
configuration variable in the repository and sending a crafted query to
gitweb.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All git users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/git-1.6.0.6"
