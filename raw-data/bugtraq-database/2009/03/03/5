4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Winamp, which can 
be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow error in the 
libsndfile.dll library while processing CAF description chunks. This 
can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by tricking a
user into processing a specially crafted CAF audio file.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
