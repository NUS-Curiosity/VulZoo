Steve, ActiveX is cross-application software component. These components
are  written  for  very  different  tasks, sometimes specially to manage
hardware,  sensitive data, e.g. to extend scripting facilities of server
sofware,  etc.  Limiting  ActiveX  to safe operations only is inadequate
loss  of  functionality.  It's like blaming some non-suid administration
utility  to be insecure if used as CGI (if it's not developed to be used
in such way) and requiring _any_ utility to be safe if copied to cgi-bin
folder.

If somebody allows controls not marked safe for scripting in his browser
-  it's  like  enabling  ssh  access with pre-defined account. If vendor
recommends  to  do  so  -  you  should  make a choice between vendor and
security.
