Hash: SHA1

Hey everyone, for those of you who don't know DEFCON CTF organizers Kenshoto
are stepping down, and we have sent out a call for new CTF organizers. The
submissions are in, and it is time to pick one to carry the flag forward!

There are four submissions worthy of consideration, and I've posted them
(with some private details omitted or redacted) here:

https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=10246

Please read and comment on them, we'll decide next week who the winner will
be, and announce that in the future.


Oh, here are the links to DEFCON 16 audio and video files - freshly
uploaded!
