Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-09-015
March 30, 2009

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2009-1044

-- Affected Vendors:
Mozilla Firefox

-- Affected Products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw exists in the XUL tree method _moveToEdgeShift(). In
some cases this call will trigger garbage collection routines on in use
objects which will result in a future call to a dangling pointer. This
can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
current user.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
