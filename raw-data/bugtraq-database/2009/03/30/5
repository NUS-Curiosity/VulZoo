Synopsis
========

A Denial of Service vulnerability was discovered in Analog.

Background
==========

Analog is a a webserver log analyzer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/analog      < 6.0-r2                          >= 6.0-r2

Description
===========

Diego E. Petteno reported that the Analog package in Gentoo is built
with its own copy of bzip2, making it vulnerable to CVE-2008-1372 (GLSA
200804-02).

Impact
======

A local attacker could place specially crafted log files into a log
directory being analyzed by analog, e.g. /var/log/apache, resulting in
a crash when being processed by the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Analog users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/analog-6.0-r2"

NOTE: Analog is now linked against the system bzip2 library.
