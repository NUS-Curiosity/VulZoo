================================================================


Topics:
-------
This symposium, the 12th in an annual series, brings together leading
researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry
to discuss issues and technologies related to intrusion detection and
defense. The Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID)
International Symposium series furthers advances in intrusion defense
by promoting the exchange of ideas in a broad range of topics. As in
previous years, all topics related to intrusion detection, prevention
and defense systems and technologies are within scope, including but
not limited to the following:

* Network and host intrusion detection and prevention
* Anomaly and specification-based approaches
* IDS cooperation and event correlation
* Malware prevention, detection, analysis and containment
* Web application security
* Insider attack detection
* Intrusion response, tolerance, and self protection
* Operational experience and limitations of current approaches
* Intrusion detection assessment and benchmarking
* Attacks against IDS including DoS, evasion, and IDS discovery
* Formal models, analysis, and standards
* Deception systems and honeypots
* Vulnerability analysis, risk assessment, and forensics
* Adversarial machine learning for security
* Visualization techniques
* Special environments, including mobile and sensor networks
* High-performance intrusion detection
* Legal, social, and privacy issues
* Network exfiltration detection
* Botnet analysis, detection, and mitigation

Important Dates:
----------------
Paper submission deadline:            April 5, 2009
Paper acceptance or rejection:        June  8, 2009
Final paper camera ready copy:        June 18, 2009
Poster abstract submission deadline:  June 20, 2009
Poster acceptance or rejection:       June 28, 2009

Submissions:
------------
RAID 2009 invites two types of submissions:

1. Full papers presenting mature research results or summarizing
   operational experience protecting or monitoring large real-world
   networks. Papers can be 10-20 pages long and, if accepted, they will
   be presented and included in the RAID 2009 proceedings published by
   Springer Verlag in its Lecture Notes in Computer Science
   (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html) series. Papers must be
   formatted according to the instructions provided by Springer Verlag
   (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html), and include an
   abstract and a list of keywords.

2. Posters describing innovative ideas not mature enough for a full
   paper and works in progress. A two-page poster abstract formatted as
   a full paper with an abstract must be submitted. If accepted, it
   will be published in the proceedings and the poster will be presented.

All submissions (papers and poster abstracts) must be submitted
electronically; details will be provided on the conference
web site. Papers should list all authors and their affiliations; in case
of multiple authors, the contact author must be indicated (RAID does not
require anonymized submissions).  For accepted papers, it is required
that at least one of the authors attends the conference to present the
paper. Further questions on the submission process may be sent to the
program chair.  Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that
any of the authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel
to a journal or to any other conference or workshop with proceedings.
Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission
of previously published work, and plagiarism constitute dishonesty or
fraud. RAID, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals,
prohibits these practices and may, on the recommendation of the program
chair, take action against authors who have committed them.
