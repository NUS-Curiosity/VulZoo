TOORCAMP 2009 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


INTRODUCTION

ToorCamp is the United State's first ever full-scale hacker camp. Modelled after the camps in Holland and Germany, ToorCamp will focus on all of the technology topics that ToorCon has become famous for but will expand out into other areas of society. ToorCamp will offer 2 days of talks on many different topics -- Security, Internet, Emerging Technologies, Hardware Hacking, and Privacy are just some of the areas we will be covering. ToorCamp will also feature 2 days of hands-on workshops on a multitude of different skills that you may have never found yourself interested in learning about before. Blacksmithing, Lock Picking, Orienteering, Logic Design, Archery -- These are just a few of the topics you can expect.

ToorCamp is run by the same group that runs ToorCon and will also be heavily supported by many other hacker conferences in the US. ToorCamp will be organized as a bunch of different campsites which will be fully run by autonomous groups. We will provide the power and internet -- you provide the rest. We're heavily encouraging groups to build structures, setup art projects, throw parties, and generally do things that will show to the world that US hackers can throw a kickass hacker camp too!

Oh, and did we mention it'll be at a Titan-1 Missile Silo? We've managed to find one of the best locations in the northwest to throw this event. We've partnered with a group of people who are currently retrofitting the Silo into an ultra-secure datacenter so internet connectivity won't be a problem. ToorCamp will be situated in central Washington roughly 3 hours driving distance from Seattle and within 15 minutes drive of a private international airport. Don't miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to make history with us and help launch the first public US hacker camp!

CAMPSITE ORGANIZER SUBMISSION INFORMATION

We're looking for campsite organizers that can help out by taking charge of parts of the camp. Campsites that have at least 10 occupants will be given a 10% discount on admission for everyone registered for the campsite. Part of being a campsite organizer is helping fellow campers get shelter, community food, throwing parties, and possibly organizing group transportation out to the camp. The 10% discount refund can be given back to the campsite organizer to help fund these types of things, can be refunded to all of the campsite inhabitants, or donated to the ToorCon Foundation.
