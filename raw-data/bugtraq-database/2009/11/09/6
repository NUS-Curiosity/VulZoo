Subject: FRHACK01 DVDs

Hi list,

FRHACK01, International IT Security Conference, was held in Besancon,
France - http://www.frhack.org
FRHACK was not commercial, but technical.

We decided to sell DVDs of the conference to cover our expenses.
If anyone has a problem with this, with FRHACK or with me => he's
invited to contact me directly and we should be able to speak about it
in an eyes2eyes way, like men. If u just want to flame on your blog,
just go in hell.

Anyway, so here it is, the first 2 DVDs of FRHACK available for FREE:

Enjoy

RIP mil
I never forget my brothers
