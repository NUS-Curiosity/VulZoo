Subject: Announcement: Critical Internet Infrastructure WG is now open to
 public participation

ISOTF Critical Internet Infrastructure WG is now open to public
participation.

The group holds top experts on internet technology, critical
infrastructure, and internet governance, from around the globe.

Together, we discuss definitions, problems, challenges and solutions in
securing and assuring the reliability of the global internet
infrastructure, which is critical infrastructure for a growing number of
nations, corporations and indeed, individuals -- world wide.

The group started as a closed and private forum, to discuss technical
and operational risks, as other venues limited discussion of critical
internet resources to politically charged subjects such ascontrol of
ICANN and ARIN, thus overshadowing other important aspects.

As of November 18th 2009, the list is open for public access, to advance
public awareness of the issues, and bring new talent on board.

The group is hosted by the ISOTF, but is governed by members.

Note: SCADA, network operations, and other related issues should be
discussed in the appropriate forums, elsewhere. This group deals with
the internet.
