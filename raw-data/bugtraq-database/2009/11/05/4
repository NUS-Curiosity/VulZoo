-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sun Microsystems Java. User interaction is
required in that a user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious
web page.

The specific flaw exists in the parsing of long file:// URL arguments to
the getSoundbank() function. Due to a lack of bounds checking on user
supplied data a stack overflow can occur leading to remote code
execution. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to system
compromise under the credentials of the currently logged in user.
