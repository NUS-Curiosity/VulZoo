Subject: NSA Iraqi Computer Attacks And U.S. Defense

In a recent article in the National Journal Magazine, the NSA
supposedly admits to using computer attacks in Iraq, attacking
cellular systems. Aside to the hacking part, which is obviously
"cool", the impact on the US cyber defense stance as well as
international relations is staggering.

I spent some time trying to figure out what facts were given in the
story, and analyze it.
