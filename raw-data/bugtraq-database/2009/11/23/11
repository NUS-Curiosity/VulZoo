Autodesk 3DS Max Application Callbacks Arbitrary Command Execution



1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Autodesk 3DS Max Application Callbacks Arbitrary Command Execution
Advisory Id: CORE-2009-0909
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/3dsmax-arbitrary-command-execution
Date published: 2009-11-23
Date of last update: 2009-11-20
Vendors contacted: Autodesk
Release mode: User release



2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Failure to Sanitize Data into a Different Plane [CWE-74]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 36634
CVE Name: CVE-2009-3577



3. *Vulnerability Description*

Autodesk 3D Studio Max [2] is a modeling, animation and redering
package widely used for video game , film , multimedia and web content
developement. The software provides a built-in scripting language,
allowing users to bind custome code to actions performed in the
applciation. Execution of scripting code does not require explicit
permission from the user. This mechanim can be exploited by an
attacker to execute arbitrary code by enticing a victim to open .max
file with MaxScript application callbacks embedded.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Autodesk 3DSMax 2010
   . Autodesk 3DSMax 2009
   . Autodesk 3DSMax 2008
   . Autodesk 3DSMax 9
   . Autodesk 3DSMax 8
   . Autodesk 3DSMax 7
   . Autodesk 3DSMax 6


5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

The vendor did not provide fixes or workaround information.

You can disable the automatic loading of embedded MaxScript by
following these steps:

   . Go to Customize menu > Preferences > Preference Settings dialog >
MAXScript.
   . Uncheck "Load/Save Scene Scripts".
   . Uncheck "Load/Save Persistent Globals".


6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Sebastian Tello
from Core Security Technologies during Bugweek 2009 [1].

The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Fernando Russ from
Core Security Advisories Team.


7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Autodesk 3D Studio Max provides built-in scripting language called
MaxScript, which can be used to automate repetitive tasks, combine
existing functionality in new ways, develop new tools and user
interfaces and much more. Max allows users to bind MaxScript to
application callbacks in a way that could be exploited by an attacker
to execute arbitrary code by enticing a victim to open .max file with
MaxScript application callbacks embedded.

A Proof of Concept file can be obtained by following these simple
steps. Open Max, press F11 (MaxScript Listener), and paste this code:

/-----
     callbacks.addScript #filePostOpen ("DOSCommand(\"calc.exe\")")
id:#mbLoadCallback persistent:true  
    
- -----/
