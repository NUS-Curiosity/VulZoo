It's been a while since I looked at the /dev/random design on Linux (probably 
the early 2.4 days), however one thing that was quite clear was that they did 
not use any network I/O as entropy sources because an attacker, particularly 
one that already had control of other machines on the same LAN segment, could 
have a high degree of control over that source. I would be most interested if 
that has changed since the last time I looked at it.

Checking the /dev/random manpage on Darwin, it indicates that entropy is 
input from the system "Security Server", which uses "kernel jitter". 
Unfortunately, a quick check did not reveal exactly what the source of this 
kernel jitter is. Never-the-less, the manpage does indicate that this 
/dev/random design is from FreeBSD and likely shared with other BSDs.

All I can observe here is that F-secure SSH still (at least the most recent 
version I've used) collects its own entropy when running on Win2K, which 
indicates to me that either they want to operate the same on all Windows 
versions (as memory serves, Win95/98 does not have a RNG), or that Win2k does 
not have a suitable RNG.

You would only want to use one or the other, since the fan rotation is a 
function of the CPU temperature measurement -- if you used both you would 
essentially be entering the same measurement into the RNG twice, which isn't 
very random.

Indeed -- certainly the recent advisory regarding information leakage through 
the cache between threads on multi-core CPUs (CVN: CAN-2005-0109) indicates 
that we're starting to find problems of this nature already.
