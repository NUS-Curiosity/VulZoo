Subject: Critical Patch Update April 2005 for Database 9.2 and 10.1 Update
 - Correction


Dear Oracle Customer, 

If you have applied the patches for Critical Patch Update July 2005 (CPUJul2005) already, you can skip this message.  

You are receiving this email because you were sent an email subjected "Critical Patch Update April 2005 for Database 9.2 and 10.1 Update" on July 6 or July 7, depending on your time zone.  The email stated that a step was missing in the installation script of the patches for Critical Patch Update April 2005 (CPUApr2005) that caused a jar file not to be uploaded to the database.  There are two corrections to the email.  

Firstly, Database 9.2.0.6 was listed as one of the affected products.  This was incorrect.  This issue did not affect the CPUApr2005 patch for Database 9.2.0.6.  There was no action required.  As a result, only the following Database Server versions are affected:

9.2.0.5 (Patches 4193299, 4195791, and 4214192) 
10.1.0.2 (Patches 4193293, 4181849, and 4213305) 
10.1.0.3 (Patches 4193286, 4269715, and 4158888) 
10.1.0.4 (Patches 4210374, 4287619, and 4287611) 

Secondly, it was discovered that the steps provided earlier did not rectify the problem completely.  This affects all platforms of the database versions listed above.  Even if JVM was not installed, you should still follow the steps described below after the CPUApr2005 patch is installed to complete the installation.  This issue is corrected in the patches for Critical Patch Update July 2005 (CPUJul2005), thus applying CPUJul2005 is another workaround.  

To rectify the problem, please implement the following steps after the CPUApr2005 patch is installed, irrespective of whether you have already completed the instructions in the previous email message or not:

    1.     Startup all the database instances running out of the ORACLE_HOME being patched.
    2.     For each database instance running out of the ORACLE_HOME being patched, execute the following command, after replacing <passwd> with the correct password, as a user in the operating system DBA group:
          
           For non-Windows platforms:
           > cd $ORACLE_HOME/bin
           > ./loadjava ï¿½user sys/<passwd> $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/jlib/CDC.jar

           For Windows platforms:
           > cd  %ORACLE_HOME%\bin
           > loadjava -user sys/<passwd>  %ORACLE_HOME%\rdbms\jlib\CDC.jar

Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience you may have experienced, and we thank you for your patience and cooperation in securing your Oracle server products. 

Regards, 
Oracle Global Product Support
