Subject: Re: Peter Gutmann data deletion theaory?


The NSA disagree and have conducted laboratory tests.
I work for NYC as a unix admin (Solaris). We use the sun format purge to 
erase disks (that can be written to; drives that won't spin up or can't be 
written are another problem).

I guarantee that a sufficiently strong degausser will erase your 
data...along with the timing tracks and possibly burning out micromotors 
and ball bearings. Its a question of how many oersteds you need for the 
drive so that the magnetic field penetrates the housing (take out the 
platters and you have another situation entirely).

I don't have the site bookmarked at home but NIST or NSA have a site which 
reviews the degaussing equipment and other data erasure techniques.
