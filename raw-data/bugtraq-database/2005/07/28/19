Nope. This cannot work, you probably messed up your basic auth settings in 
Apache. If you perform a HEAD /protected/video.avi, you will already see the 401 
header - and there is no way to bypass that with a client.

For the sake of the argument, I actually tried it out - and it doesn't work (of 
course).

I'd suspect that you a) didn't configure the basic auth properly or b) have run 
into the infamous basic auth caching issue (a.k.a. "we can't log out users with 
basic auth").
