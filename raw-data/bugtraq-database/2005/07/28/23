There is no 7 pass government wipe. It is a 3 pass wipe. It is referred to 
as a 7 pass wipe because an app that did a 7 pass wipe passed govt muster 
and was purchased. Odds are that if it had done it in 3 wipes it would 
have still passed. If a vendor is saying "we do a 7 pass govt wipe" ask 
them if one of those passes involves *verifiying* the writing of random 
data, and if one of the passes in the inversion of another wipe (i.e. a 
wipe with 0x0f and a wipe with 0xf0) to the drive. If not, it won't pass 
that "government standard" I referred to in another post a few days ago.

I basically agree with this. If any government can recover data via some 
ninja electron microscope fu, odds are it is a state secret and they 
wouldn't reveal they got your data nor reveal it in court (then it 
wouldn't be a state secret anymore...) so it truly is a moot point, unless 
the recovered data makes you an enemy combatant or something. Again, we 
really have covered this topic several times here.
