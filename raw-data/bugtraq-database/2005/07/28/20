It's probably pretty good for TippingPoint customers.  Seems pretty
reasonable from a commercial point-of-view -- if enough extra people buy the
software to offset the cost of the purchases, then it's a win for 3Com.  I
doubt that they'll be offering the sort of money that is going to make a
real clueful zombiemaster roll over and play ball, however, so in the same
way that paying police informants hasn't eradicated crime, I don't think
this is going to be a solution to the problem.  It's an interesting take on
the situation, though.
