 Vulnerabilities


Hi,

This is a bugus bug report, I've tested this on both v0.8 and v0.9 and no problems.

Please remove this bug as it gives a bad name to the project.

It is possible to pass fake variables (as with most systems), but not executable code!! which is not a security issue.

If I'm missing something, please email me with details info. But as far as I can see this is a bugus report.

Stuart
