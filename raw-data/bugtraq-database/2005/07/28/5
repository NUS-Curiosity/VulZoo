Overwriting the data a couple of times seems to be relatively effective
for modern disks.

In my opninion, the best way to destroy your data is to keep it
encrypted and then destroy the keys.

Recovery will succeed in only recovering a fraction of the data;
but with an unknown key and a typical encryption algorithm where
a single bit changed in the input changes all bits in the output,
recovery will need to find quite a bit more than the 1 bit per byte
required to recover typical text.

Note that many of the people using such technologies do this
to prevent against future breakthrouhgs in recovery technology.
So it's required only for data with a long half-life.
