Hi

Is anyone here using Thomson Web Skill Vantage Manager for online training? If yes I suggest to take the system offline and to improve input validation.The system allows an SQL injection at the login - this gives a visitor easy access with complete Administrator privileges over the system. A malicious user could damage the installation.

Don't know if this has been posted already, hope this info is of use.
