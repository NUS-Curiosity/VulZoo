This issue is NOT present in out-of-the-box installations of 
SiteMinder.  All supported versions of SiteMinder have an
agent configuration parameter called "CSSChecking" that is,
by default, set to "YES".  A SiteMinder administrator would 
have to intentionally set this parameter to "NO" to become 
vulnerable to this issue.

The "CSSChecking" configuration parameter has been very well 
documented in SiteMinder product documentation since 2001.

This issue is also documented and addressed in a security 
advisory posted in October 2002 at this URL:

.asp?isNodeGroup=null&ProductNumber=735&Pare ntId=493&groupType=249

Note that SiteMinder customers should continue to go to 
support.netegrity.com for product support.
