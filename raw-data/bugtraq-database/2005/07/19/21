Just as an aside, no.

Operating systems run programs and control access to resources.  The
idea that any program can do anything to your system is a strange
one.  Systems like Goldberg and Wagner's Janus, or Cowan and co.'s
Subdomain, or heck, even the Java security manager, impose limits on
what a program that you run can do.

That most commercial operating systems lack these sorts of controls is
unfortunate.  I would really like to be able to limit what files and
directories my mail client or web browser can touch.

Again, the blame lies on your operating system for not letting you do
what you want in a common situation.

That's neither here nor there with regards to the local/remote or
credentialed/anonymous discussion.  But I think that on a security
list, we should not udnerestimate the value of OS features.
