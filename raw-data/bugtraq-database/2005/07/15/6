Subject: Re: Rooting Linux with a floppy


Uhhh.. Where to start. This is old.

First off you often don't need a floppy/boot media for older systems since 
they tend to have insecure lilo/grub configurations. Second off all, this is 
really old news (yup, mentioned that already).

Nice spam links by the way.
