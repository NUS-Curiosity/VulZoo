Subject: Multiple ZeroLen Attachments


Hello,

Recently I have been affected by a flood of email with multiple zero-length
attachments apparently aiming to DoS my mail server.

This message is (spoofed) from 'e_mark@...mediagateway.com'

Has anyone else encountered this lately, and if so, please let me know if
there are multiple addresses being used. Full headers would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks!
Tony
