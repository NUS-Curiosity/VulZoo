Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in dhcpcd may cause the dhcpcd daemon to crash.

Background
==========

dhcpcd is a standards compliant DHCP client daemon. It requests an IP
address and other information from the DHCP server, automatically
configures the network interface, and tries to renew the lease time.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /     Vulnerable     /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/dhcpcd      < 1.3.22_p4-r11             >= 1.3.22_p4-r11

Description
===========

infamous42md discovered that dhcpcd can be tricked to read past the end
of the supplied DHCP buffer. As a result, this might lead to a crash of
the daemon.

Impact
======

With a malicious DHCP server an attacker could cause a Denial of
Service by crashing the DHCP client.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All dhcpcd users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/dhcpcd-1.3.22_p4-r11"
