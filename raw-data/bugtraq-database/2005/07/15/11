Synopsis
========

PHP includes an XML-RPC implementation which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP script commands.

Background
==========

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language widely used to develop
web-based applications. It can run inside a web server using the
mod_php module or the CGI version of PHP, or can run stand-alone in a
CLI.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-php/php       < 4.4.0                                >= 4.4.0

Description
===========

James Bercegay has discovered that the XML-RPC implementation in PHP
fails to sanitize input passed in an XML document, which is used in an
"eval()" statement.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit the XML-RPC vulnerability to execute
arbitrary PHP script code by sending specially crafted XML data to
applications making use of this XML-RPC implementation.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/php-4.4.0"
