Subject: AW: Silently fixed security bugs in Oracle Critical Patch Update July 2005


Hi David and all,

You are right. 

Bug 2576249 (DAV_PUBLIC) was discovered by the Litchfield brothers and is already fixed with Alert 52. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I am not aware that the other bugs (Memory leak, webcache SSL 40bit encryption, oraaltpassword ...) are already covered by another Oracle security alert.

Cheers

I don't think this one was silently fixed - see
