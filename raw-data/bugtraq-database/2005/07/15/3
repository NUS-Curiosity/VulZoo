Synopsis
========

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox allow attacks ranging from
execution of script code with elevated privileges to information leak.

Background
==========

Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation web browser from the Mozilla
project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                         /  Vulnerable  /       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla-firefox           < 1.0.5             >= 1.0.5
  2  www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin       < 1.0.5             >= 1.0.5
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla Firefox:

* "moz_bug_r_a4" and "shutdown" discovered that Firefox was
  improperly cloning base objects (MFSA 2005-56).

* Michael Krax reported that Firefox was not correctly handling
  JavaScript URLs from external applications (MFSA 2005-53), and that
  the "Set as wallpaper" function in versions 1.0.3 and 1.0.4 could be
  abused to load JavaScript (MFSA 2005-47).

* Several researchers reported ways to trick Firefox into accepting
  events generated by web content (MFSA 2005-45).

* Kohei Yoshino discovered a new way to inject script from the
  sidebar panel using data: (MFSA 2005-49).

* "moz_bug_r_a4" reported that Firefox failed to validate XHTML DOM
  nodes properly (MFSA 2005-55), and that XBL scripts ran even when
  Javascript is disabled (MFSA 2005-46).

* "shutdown" discovered a possibly exploitable crash in
  InstallVersion.compareTo (MFSA 2005-50).

* Finally, Secunia discovered that a child frame can call top.focus()
  even if the framing page comes from a different origin and has
  overridden the focus() routine (MFSA 2005-52), and that the frame
  injection spoofing bug fixed in 1.0.2 was mistakenly reintroduced in
  1.0.3 and 1.0.4 (MFSA 2005-51).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could craft malicious web pages that would leverage
these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code with elevated
privileges, steal cookies or other information from web pages, or spoof
content.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.5"

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.5"
