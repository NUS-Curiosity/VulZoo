If interested, check out our old (2001) paper about gaining entropy from
the network delays

'Collecting randomness from the net'

or directly: http://www.crysys.hu/publications/files/BencsathV2001cms.pdf

abstract:  Random data in the work is collected from network time delay
measurements and its quality is checked by statistical tests.  A
special enhancement: the system of collector-servers is proposed and
analyzed.
