Package description:
  net-snmp:
  SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol used for
  network management. The NET-SNMP project includes various SNMP tools:
  an extensible agent, an SNMP library, tools for requesting or setting
  information from SNMP agents, tools for generating and handling SNMP
  traps, a version of the netstat command which uses SNMP, and a Tk/Perl
  mib browser. This package contains the snmpd and snmptrapd daemons,
  documentation, etc.

  zlib:
  The zlib compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.

Problem description:
  net-snmp:
  Fixed a denial of service vulnerability when stream sockets have
  been configured for use (E.G., TCP but not UDP). Bug#1038

  zlib:
  Security Fix: This flaw is due to a buffer overflow error when
  processing a malformed data stream, which could be exploited by
  attackers to execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted compressed
  stream embedded within network communication or an application file format.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2005-2096.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
