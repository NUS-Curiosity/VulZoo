ISTR that grsecurity has toggles that enable gathering entropy from network
traffic. Assuming the PRNG is any good, it shouldn't matter if an attacker can
manipulate such timings, because (by definition) a good PRNG will still behave
correctly even if an attacker does feed it lots of deliberately bad data (as
long as the PRNG also has been fed with a sufficient amount of unguessable
'good' input as well, of course).

Only Win95 pre OSR2 is missing CryptoAPI (and specifically CryptGenRandom).
However, it's my understanding that early versions of CryptGenRandom were not
that great.
