A vulnerability report has been send to Ipswitch on the date 8 june by
Peter Bluckens and Christophe Vandeplas.
We included a working exploit that allowed an attacker to grab the
password from a user without him noticing it.

They are currently working on a solution.

Public advisory will be released as soon as they correct the code.
