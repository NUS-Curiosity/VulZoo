I've published a shed-load of information on the internal OS of the Belkin, and have my own Linux distro running on this platform.

If you want to pull it apart, then take a look at the docco here;
  http://www.midnightcode.org/papers/

And the tools here;
  http://midnightcode.org/projects/pluto/code/

belky-0.5.c will pull apart or recreate firmware
images to/from kernel + fs binaries.

I didn't see the telnet interface on the 
F5D7230-4 models that I was grinding.
