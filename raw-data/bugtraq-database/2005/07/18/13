Maybe so, however with the case of the BIND attack, the vulnerability in
locally running code (named) is being exploited by a remote attacker via the
network.

In the case of an e-mail containing malicious code, the code being exploited
(parts of the Windows kernel or whatever) is being attacked by code running
locally - on the *same* machine. In this sense it can hardly qualify as a
"remote" exploit.
