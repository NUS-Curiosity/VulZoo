Why not encapsulate the data portion by encrypting it inside a jpeg file, 
or something like that? Trying to hide it inside HTML tags wouldn't be all 
that hard to detect by using a specialized proxy or firewall. Proxies 
already can filter out invalid html headers and line sizes, amongst other 
things. Not to mention the overhead you'd be creating with all the HTML 
tags in an effort to make it look like a standard web page. Considering 
the data itself could be used to determine the originator, (names, phone 
numbers, etc) you'll want to make sure that not only the transaction is 
anonymous, but the content is as well.

Overall, quite an interesting concept.
