Synopsis
========

pstotext contains a vulnerability which can potentially result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

pstotext is a program that works with GhostScript to extract plain text
from PostScript and PDF files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/pstotext      < 1.8g-r1                       >= 1.8g-r1

Description
===========

Max Vozeler reported that pstotext calls the GhostScript interpreter on
untrusted PostScript files without specifying the -dSAFER option.

Impact
======

An attacker could craft a malicious PostScript file and entice a user
to run pstotext on it, resulting in the execution of arbitrary commands
with the permissions of the user running pstotext.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All pstotext users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/pstotext-1.8g-r1"
