Synopsis
========

phpWebSite is vulnerable to the remote execution of arbitrary PHP
script code and to other, yet undisclosed, vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

phpWebSite is a content management system written in PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/phpwebsite      < 0.10.1-r1                 >= 0.10.1-r1

Description
===========

phpWebSite fails to sanitize input sent to the XML-RPC server using the
"POST" method. Other unspecified vulnerabilities have been discovered
by Diabolic Crab of Hackers Center.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit the XML-RPC vulnerability to execute
arbitrary PHP script code by sending specially crafted XML data to
phpWebSite. The undisclosed vulnerabilities do have an unknown impact.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpWebSite users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-app/phpwebsite-0.10.1-r1"
