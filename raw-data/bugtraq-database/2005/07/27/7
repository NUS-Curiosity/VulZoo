Subject: Re : [Firefox Bug 302187] New: Shared section vulnerability when
 opening microsoft office document resulting in DoS


Hello, 

More details about the potentiel vulnerability : Firefox is just starting a new process in the standard way, using CreateProcess
(see
<http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/nsprpub/pr/src/md/windows/ntmisc.c#391>).
Firefox is already passing NULL to lpProcessAttributes and lpThreadAttributes, so
it is using the "default" security descriptor. That might be the way that IE is
using, by using a modified descriptor. Windows is the issue if the default behaviour
provokes this error. But firefox in this case can't really be blamed for this problem, every
applicition that launches another one will need to be fixed.
