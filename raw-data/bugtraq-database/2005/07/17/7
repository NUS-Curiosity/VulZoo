Subject: PowerDNS 2.9.18 fixes two security issues affecting users of LDAP
 backend or limited recursion


PowerDNS 2.9.18 fixes two bugs with security implications, which only apply to installations running on the LDAP backend, or installations providing recursion to a limited range of IP addresses. If any of these apply to you, an upgrade is highly advised.

Version 2.9.18 release notes are on: http://doc.powerdns.com/changelog.html#CHANGELOG-2-9-18
Version 2.9.18 is available on:
http://www.powerdns.com/downloads/
Wiki, source, bugtracker: http://wiki.powerdns.com/
Security page: http://doc.powerdns.com/security-policy.html

Details:
    * The LDAP backend did not properly escape all queries, allowing it to fail and not answer questions. We have not investigated further risks involved, but we advise LDAP users to update as quickly as possible (Norbert Sendetzky, Jan de Groot)

    * Questions from clients denied recursion could blank out answers to clients who are allowed recursion services, temporarily. Reported by Wilco Baan. This would've made it possible for outsiders to blank out a domain temporarily to your users. Luckily PowerDNS would send out SERVFAIL or Refused, and not a denial of a domain's existence. 

Thanks for your attention.
