Synopsis
========

mlterm is vulnerable to an integer overflow, which could potentially
allow the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

mlterm is a multi-lingual terminal emulator.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-terms/mlterm       < 2.9.2                           >= 2.9.2

Description
===========

mlterm is vulnerable to an integer overflow that can be triggered by
specifying a large image file as a background. This only effects users
that have compiled mlterm with the 'gtk' USE flag, which enables
gdk-pixbuf support.

Impact
======

An attacker can create a specially-crafted image file which, when used
as a background by the victim, can lead to the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running mlterm.

Workaround
==========

Re-compile mlterm without the 'gtk' USE flag.

Resolution
==========

All mlterm users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/mlterm-2.9.2"
