I suspect that the router will not be found vulnerable from that side,
but the exploit becomes interesting again if users on the Wireless LAN
are granted the same level of trust as those on the wired LAN. None of
the wireless routers I've seen have made any distinction between those
two segments, and they all come with default administration passwords
(and no requirement for the user to change them).

Of course, this 'exploit' really looks like just another example of an
'insecure by default' consumer device, rather than an issue with the
firmware.
