Subject: Re: several vulnerabilities present in Belkin wireless routers


Interesting study, I have seen quite the same configuration on a very
common broadband router sold in France. There were also operator-defined
data stored in the configuration files, such as the VoIP gateway
parameters, the administrative console IP address, and the like.

FYI, I think the operating system is an ATMOS/ISOS rather than a GNU/Linux.

In my case, there was also an undocumented but very useful command :
"debug". It was only available through the console port, but if it works
for you, you will access a kernel mode debugger.
