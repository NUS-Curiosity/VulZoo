Hi,

What do you understand by "Vendor informed"? We haven't received any 
email from you neither to private addresses nor ekg-users/ekg-devel 
mailing lists. Please also note that the script you pointed at is 
contributed by a third-party author and isn't part of ekg itself, 
neither is installed by default.

Greetings,

Adam Wysocki
ekg team
