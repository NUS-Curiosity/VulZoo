I usually open it in OpenOffice and remove the protection there (use openoffice2.0) then save it as a word file again

Where can I find the "how to" to get around the password protection?  I have a form that I need to modify, but whoever created it is no longer with the company and as a result, the password is "gone"

Many Thanks
