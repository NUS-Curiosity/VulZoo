Update
======

Stefan Esser of the Hardened - PHP Project discovered that some of
the recent vulnerabilities were incorrectly fixed, as well as a new
vulnerability.

The updated sections appear below.

Synopsis
========

Cacti is vulnerable to several SQL injection, authentication bypass and
file inclusion vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

Cacti is a complete web-based frontend to rrdtool.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/cacti      < 0.8.6f                        >= 0.8.6f

Description
===========

Cacti fails to properly sanitize input which can lead to SQL injection,
authentication bypass as well as PHP file inclusion.

Impact
======

An attacker could potentially exploit the file inclusion to execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the web server. An attacker
could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication or inject
SQL queries to gain information from the database. Only systems with
register_globals set to "On" are affected by the file inclusion and
authentication bypass vulnerabilities. Gentoo Linux ships with
register_globals set to "Off" by default.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cacti users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/cacti-0.8.6f"

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.
