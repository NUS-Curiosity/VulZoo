Subject: Vulnerability in IBM access


Hello, 

I would like to make to Bugtraq knowledge the existence of a security vulnerability in IBM access software. IBM access is vulnerable to a Shared Section vulnerability. The processes QCWLICON.exe and QCTRAY.exe have the section \BaseNamedObjects\QCONDB with invalid rights which allows everyone to read the configuration of all connections and to write arbitrary data to create a dos against the application. 
This could be shown with the Process Explorer tool by sysinternal and used by the ListSS, DumpSS and TestSS tools written by C Cerrudo. 
Regards,
