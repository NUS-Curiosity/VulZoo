> ClamAV is the most widely used GPL antivirus library today. It provides file format support for virus analysis. During analysis ClamAV Antivirus Library is vulnerable to buffer overflows allowing attackers complete control of the system. These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without user interaction or authentication through common protocols such as SMTP, SMB, HTTP, FTP, etc.

Specifically, during the processing of TNEF, CHM, & FSG formats an attacker is able to trigger several integer overflows that allow attackers to overwrite heap data to obtain complete control of the system. These vulnerabilities can be reached by default and triggered without user interaction by sending an e-mail containing crafted data.

In addition, ClamAV has been ported to windows and a variety of other platforms by third parties who’s implementations are also likely vulnerable. Refer to vendor for specifics.

The clamav.net front page says "Latest ClamAV stable release is: 0.86.2".
