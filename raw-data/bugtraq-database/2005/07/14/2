Details
#######
If the number of records in a Oracle Forms application retrieved from the 
database exceeds the parameter "buffered records" Oracle Forms will create 
a temp file located in the temp directory of the application server. This 
temp file contains an unencrypted copy of the database table used in the Forms 
application (e.g. creditcard). The default permission for these temp files 
(format: AAAa<processid>.TMP) is -rw-rw-r--. Every UNIX user on the application 
server can read the content of this file (e.g credit card information, ...).


Example
#######
ls -la /tmp
-rw-rw-r-- 1 oracle oinstall 47600 Aug 17 20:30 AAAa15400.TMP



Workaround
##########
Set the environment variable TMP, TEMP and TMPDIR to a secure location. It depends on the OS of the application server what environment variable will be used.

Delete old AAA* files on a regular basis.
