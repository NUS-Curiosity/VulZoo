Synopsis
========

Adobe Acrobat Reader is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could lead
to remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Adobe Acrobat Reader is a utility used to view PDF files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/acroread       <= 5.10                            >= 7.0

Description
===========

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the UnixAppOpenFilePerform()
function, which is called when Adobe Acrobat Reader tries to open a
file with the "\Filespec" tag.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF document, a remote
attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Since Adobe will most likely not update the 5.0 series of Adobe Acrobat
Reader for Linux, all users should upgrade to the latest available
version of the 7.0 series:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/acroread-7.0"
