Regarding Google - yes, if you log only connections.
However, when you use translate.google.com service, Google will add a new
header in the HTTP request:

X-Forwarded-For: <IP address>

All proxy servers should add this header, even in the case of multiple
proxying, in which case all IP addresses should be listed under this header.

For Apache, there is even a mod_extract_forwarded module which should change
the connection so it looks like it's coming from the IP behind the proxy
server.


I don't see any special risk with this, even for mobile devices (mentioned
in the original post) -- a proxy just does it's job, no matter which proxy
it is. If Google keeps logs, even if you don't save X-Forwarded-For header
and parse them, you can find out who visited the web page, if it goes to
investigation.

Cheers,

Bojan
