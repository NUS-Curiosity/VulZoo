1. Topic:

Updated Kerberos (krb5) packages that correct multiple security issues
are now available.

Kerberos is a networked authentication system that uses a trusted third
party (a KDC) to authenticate clients and servers to each other.

Note that some of these issues have already been fixed in Fedora Core 1.
Please refer to previous advisories for details.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Several buffer overflows were possible for all Kerberos versions up to
and including 1.3.3 in the krb5_aname_to_localname library function. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0523 to this issue.

Several double-free bugs were found in the Kerberos 5 KDC and libraries.
A remote attacker could potentially exploit these flaws to execuate
arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-0642 and CAN-2004-0643
to these issues.

A double-free bug was also found in the krb524 server. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0772 to this issue.

An infinite loop bug was found in the Kerberos 5 ASN.1 decoder library.
A remote attacker may be able to trigger this flaw and cause a denial of
service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0644 to this issue.

A heap based buffer overflow bug was found in the administration library
of Kerberos 1.3.5 and earlier. This bug could allow an authenticated
remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a realm's master
Kerberos KDC. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1189 to this issue.

Additionally a temporary file bug was found in the Kerberos krb5-send-pr
program. It is possible that an attacker could create a temporary file
that would allow an arbitrary file to be overwritten which the victim
has write access to. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0971 to this issue.

The krb5-workstation package includes a Kerberos-aware telnet client.
Two buffer overflow flaws were discovered in the way the telnet client
handles messages from a server. An attacker may be able to execute
arbitrary code on a victim's machine if the victim can be tricked into
connecting to a malicious telnet server. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2005-0468
and CAN-2005-0469 to these issues.

All users of krb5 should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported security patches to resolve these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
