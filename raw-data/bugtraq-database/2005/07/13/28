 Author              Alexander Kornbrust (ak at red-database-security.com) 
 Date                13 July 2005 (V 1.00) 
 Advisory            AKSEC2003-006
 Oracle Vuln#        AS09
 Time to fix         148 days


Details
#######
Starting an external program and passing the password as a parameter is unsecure. 
This is the easiest way to decrypt an encrypted password. Replace the sqlplus.exe with a fake version which stores the passwords in a local file.

JDeveloper starts sqlplus with the following parameter:
system/alexora1@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=picard)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=ora10103)))


Workaround
##########
Do not start sqlplus from JDeveloper.


Patch Information
