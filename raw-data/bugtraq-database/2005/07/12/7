Subject: Detecting vulnerable zlib versions (CAN-2005-2096)


Based on data kindly provided by Mark Adler, I've created Clamav
signatures which can be used to detect copies of vulnerable zlib
versions.  This is useful mainly for discovering statically linked
zlib copies in program binaries, which must be patched separately.

The Clamav signature database is available form:

  http://www.enyo.de/fw/security/zlib-fingerprint/

If necessary, updates to these signatures will be announced on the
security-announce@...ts.enyo.de mailing list, see:

  http://lists.enyo.de/mailman/listinfo/security-announce

These signatures perform a similar task to the old find-zlib Perl
script, but Clamav should be significantly faster.  Furthermore,
clamscan can look inside certain archive formats used for software
distribution (mainly .tar.gz and Debian packages, RPM packages aren't
supported at the moment, AFAICS).
