Microsoft Word 2000 and Word 2002 Font Parsing Buffer Overflow
Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 07.12.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=281&type=vulnerabilities
July 12, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Word is the word processing component of the Microsoft Office
package. More information can be found at the following link:

 http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft 
Corp.'s Word could allow execution of arbitrary code.

A specially crafted .doc file, containing long font information, can 
cause Word to overwrite stack space.

No checks are made on the length of data being copied, allowing the 
return address on the stack to be overwritten.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary 
code in the context of the target user that opened the malicious 
document. The data that is written onto the stack is in the form 
"00xx00yy", where "xx" and "yy" are controlled by the input. While this 
tends to make exploitation more difficult, it does not prevent it, as it
may be possible for an attacker to cause controlled data to be put into 
a memory location matching the required format.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE Labs has confirmed that Microsoft Word 2002 is vulnerable. 
Additionally, Microsoft has confirmed that Word 2000 is vulnerable. 

Microsoft Word 2003 is not vulnerable to this issue.

V. WORKAROUND

User awareness is the best method of defense against this class of 
attack. Users must be wary when opening files from untrusted sources. 

When possible, run client software, as regular user accounts with 
limited access to system resources. This may limit the immediate 
consequences of client-side vulnerabilities.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor security advisory and appropriate patches are available at:
