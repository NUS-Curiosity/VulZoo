Yep; that's why at NGSSoftware we're absolutely thorough about testing these 
things. By only looking at one version, serious problems like this can slip 
through the net.

As it happens, after retesting, having used Oracle's suggested remediation:

exec sys.dbms_java.loadjava('-v -f -r -s -g public rdbms/jlib/CDC.jar');

there are _still_ problems. The new java classes are still not being loaded.

To properly fix the problem use the loadjava utility:

$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/bin
$ ./loadjava -user sys/password ../rdbms/jlib/CDC.jar

On all our systems executing the above solved the problem whereas the 
DBMS_JAVA.LOADJAVA procedure did not.
