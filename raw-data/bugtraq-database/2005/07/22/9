Synopsis
========

zlib is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could potentially lead to
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

zlib is a widely used free and patent unencumbered data compression
library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-libs/zlib       < 1.2.3                              >= 1.2.3

Description
===========

zlib improperly handles invalid data streams which could lead to a
buffer overflow.

Impact
======

By creating a specially crafted compressed data stream, attackers can
overwrite data structures for applications that use zlib, resulting in
arbitrary code execution or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All zlib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/zlib-1.2.3"
