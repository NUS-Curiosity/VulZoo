      Advisory: Multiple vulnerabilities in Contrexx
  Release Date: 2005/07/21
Last Modified: 2005/07/18
        Author: Christopher Kunz <christopher.kunz@...dened-php.net>
   Application: Contrexx < 1.0.5
      Severity: Cross-Site Scripting, SQL injection and information
      	       disclosure, password hash disclosure
          Risk: High
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version

                (also includes a GnuPG signature for this advisory)


Overview:

    Contrexx is a commercial content management system that has been released as
    an open source product lately. It features typical CMS features like content
    pages, polls, news, RSS feed aggregation and newsletters, split up in modu-
    les.
    The search and the blog aggregation module are vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting, allowing malicious users to hijack user or admin sessions. Unfil-
    tered user input in the poll module allows for MySQL version disclosure, and
    might faciliate further SQL injection attacks under MySQL 5 with subselects.
    SQL Injection in the gallery module can be used to select arbitrary data,
    including a complete list of username/password hash combinations.
    A bundled XML file discloses the Contrexx version in use.


Details:

    1) SQL injection in poll module
    The poll module in Contrexx is made up like any other web-based poll: users
    can vote for one of several choices by clicking a radio button and submitt-
    ing the poll form. The value of the radio button is an integer value that
    is passed to the SQL abstraction layer without any checks or casts:

    $query="SELECT voting_system_id from ".DBPREFIX."voting_results WHERE
     	id=".$_POST["votingoption"]." ";
    $db->query($query);

    By saving, changing and submitting a modified poll form to the server, an
    attacker can get the MySQL server to disclose its version.
    On top of that, the results of aforementioned query are fed directly into an
    UPDATE statement that thus can be modified by changing the WHERE clause.
    This can be used to spike polls and may be used for other injection with
    MySQL5's subselects. With magic_quotes_gpc=Off, more evil can be done.
    This is faciliated by the ridiculous input filtering that basically checks
    for SELECT, UPDATE, AND and OR, but leaves /**/SELECT, UPDATE/**/, &&, ||
    untouched.

    2) SQL injection in gallery module
    The pId parameter in Contrexx's gallery module is passed to the database
    layer completely unfiltered:

    if(isset($_GET['pId']) && !empty($_GET['pId'])){
       $this->showPicture($_GET['pId']);
    }
    and in method showPicture():
    $objDb->query("SELECT id,name,path,linkname,link,size_show
                   FROM ".DBPREFIX."module_gallery_pictures
                   WHERE id=".$pictureId);

    An attacker can append arbitrary SQL to the pId parameter, including UNION
    SELECT. However, since there is some - err - "filtering" going on, keywords
    like SELECT, UNION, AND or similar need to be pre- or postfixed with an
    empty SQL comment.
    Using this injection, it is very easy to obtain a full list of usernames and
    password hashes which can then be cracked with a premade MD5 rainbow table.

    3) XSS in the search form
    Plain and simple XSS, exploitable via GET and POST on the front-end search
    form. See below for PoC, it's very straightforward. The input sanitation
    functions seem to differ between Contrexx versions - it was possible to
    inject script code without any additional characters on the Contrexx web
    site (http://www.contrexx.com/).
    Contrexx' input filters filter out "<script>", but, for some unknown reason,
    do not touch "<scr\ipt>".

    4) XSS in blog aggregation module
    Blog aggregation is used to create a "blog roll" for daily perusal by admin-
    istrators or normal web site users. A malicious person could use their leet
    social engineering skills to persuade a Contrexx administrator that their
    blog is worth a daily read - prompting said admin to include this blog in
    their Contrexx blog aggregation.
    Then, the attacker could embed script code in one of their blog entries.
    Since no input filtering is done on incoming RSS aggregations, this script
    code is displayed in the front-end aggregation module and also in the admin
    backend (if the administrator clicks on "preview"). With the resulting XSS
    an attacker could steal the admin's cookies and hijack their session.

    5) Version information disclosure
    In a default installation of Contrexx, a file named "config/version.xml" is
    created upon installation. It contains the exact version information for the
    Contrexx installation.


Proof of Concept:

    1) Modify one of the poll "votingoption" parameters to read like this:
    	value="1 /*!50030%20s*/"
       and submit the form. Repeat until no SQL error is displayed - you have
       found the MySQL version running on the server.
       More SQL injection:
       	value="123 UNION/**/ SELECT/**/ '1 OR 1=1'"

    2) /index.php?section=gallery&cmd=showCat&cid=41&pId=1%20/**/UNION/**/%20
       /**/SELECT/**/%201,1,CONCAT(username,'-',password),1,1,1%20/**/FROM%20
       contrexx_access_users

    3) /index.php?section=search&term=%22%3E%3Cscr\ipt%3Ealert(%22xss%22)
        %3C/sc\ript%3E

    4) Create a blog entry with the title <script>alert('xss')</script>. Have
       this blog aggregated by Contrexx. Stir. Enjoy.

    5) See /config/version.xml in your Contrexx installation.
