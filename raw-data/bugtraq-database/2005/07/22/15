you will find a range of MTU sizes in radio links of various sorts which 
is not just 802.11 but also cellular including GPRS CDMA and WCDMA.
Now, in many instances there is a proxy between the mobile station and the 
public network. In fact I wrote a powerpoint presentation summarizing such 
a paper on transparent TCP proxy in WCDMA and its on my site 
http://www.networkengineer.biz  (I took a course in wireless 
architecture).
