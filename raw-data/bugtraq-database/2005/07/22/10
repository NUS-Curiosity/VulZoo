To be completely correct
<quote RFC 791>
Every internet module must be able to forward a datagram of 68 octets 
without further fragmentation. This is because an internet header my be up 
to 60 octets, and the minimum fragment is 8 octets.
Every internet destination must be able to receive a datagram of 576 octets 
either in one piece or in fragments to be reassembled.

So 576 is the minimum packet size you can get to a destination without 
fragmentation
