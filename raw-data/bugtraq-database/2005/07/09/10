I just did this many years ago for a scientific project called xpulsar. 

The interesting part about xpulsar was that it required only minimal 
bandwidth and was immune against malicious clients providing faked 
results.

The scientific question solved was about the motion of photons in a 
riemann metric (general relativity) when matter falls on a neutron star.

During four months about 75 computational years (P-III-600 MHz) got 
donated. This amount of computational power led to interesting scientific 
results.
