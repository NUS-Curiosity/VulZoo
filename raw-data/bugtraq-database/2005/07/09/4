Subject: Re: A comment on using CPU resources


Hi Ken,

There have been java applets that did this with the user's consent, e.g. 
the MD5crack distributed computing effort had one: 
http://distributedcomputing.info/recent.html , 
http://www.engsoc.org/~jlcooke/
It is not inconceivable one could do something useful with 
ecma/java/j-script too, however it would have to be some variant of AJAX 
to be useful to whomever wrote/hosted the script?
However, I don't think you're likely to see anyone stealing your CPU 
time with this as of yet.

Maybe someone else has different thoughts on the matter :)

- Jeroen.
