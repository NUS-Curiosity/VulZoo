Hi everyone,

phpBB Group announces the release of phpBB 2.0.17, the "no, we did not
forget naming it last time" release. This release addresses several
bugfixes and some low security issues as well as the recently seemingly
wide-spread XSS issue (only affecting Internet Explorer).

Please have a look down this announcement for the code changes necessary
to fix the XSS issue, we are again astounded about the energy people put
into finding the smallest issue in phpBB 2.0.x, those must have a lot of
time available. But on the other hand it is always increasing the products
security since we do not introduce new features into the 2.0.x codebase.

With this announcement I want to give you some more information regarding
phpBB's security. psoTFX (Paul S. Owen, Project Manager) initiated and
brought forward the idea and concept of a complete security audit of the
2.0.x codebase. We introduced some top-notch security people,
phpBB-Modders and very talented people from our teams to participate in
this audit. We intend to implement the changes necessary - and also fixing
the found issues, hopefully giving the now very aged codebase (it is still
on a technical level from three years ago) a lift and bringing it
up-to-date with security mechanisms and techniques which are common
nowadays.

We also intend to open our private bugtracker system to the public for
reporting 2.0.x bugs within the next days.

As with all new releases we urge you to update as soon as possible. You
can of course find this download available on our downloads page at
http://www.phpbb.com/downloads.php.
As per usual three packages are available to simplify your update.

The Full Package contains entire phpBB2 source and English language package.
The Changed Files Only contains only those files changed from previous
versions of phpBB. Please note this archive contains changed files for
each previous release.
Patch Files contains patch compatible patches from the previous versions
of phpBB.

As always, our Code Changes Tutorial is available too for those with
heavily modded boards.
It can be downloaded from http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=308426

Select whichever package is most suitable for you.

Please ensure you read the INSTALL and README documents in docs/ before
proceeding with installation or updates!.
