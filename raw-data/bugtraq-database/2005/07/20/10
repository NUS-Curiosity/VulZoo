Subject: Oracle Security Advisory: Various Cross-Site-Scripting
    Vulnerabilities in Oracle Reports


Dear Bugtraq Reader

3 months ago (15-april-2005) I informed the Oracle Security Team (secalert_us@...cle.com) that I will publish bug details if the bugs are not fixed with the next critical patch update (CPU July 2005). I know that Oracle products are complex and a good patch quality need some time. That's why I offered Oracle additional time if 3 months are not sufficient for fixing the bugs. Oracle never asked for more time.

Oracle's behaviour not fixing critical security bugs for a long time (over 650 days) is not acceptable for their customers. Oracle put their customers in danger. At least one critical vulnerability can be abused from any attacker via internet.

I decided to publish these vulnerabilities because it is possible to mitigate the risk of these vulnerabilities by using the workarounds provided in the advisories.
