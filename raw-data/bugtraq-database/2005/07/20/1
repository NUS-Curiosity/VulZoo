Subject: Oracle Security Advisory: Read parts of any file via desformat in
 Oracle Reports


Dear Bugtraq Reader

3 months ago (15-april-2005) I informed the Oracle Security Team (secalert_us@...cle.com) that I will publish bug details if the bugs are not fixed with the next critical patch update (CPU July 2005). I know that Oracle products are complex and a good patch quality need some time. That's why I offered Oracle additional time if 3 months are not sufficient for fixing the bugs. Oracle never asked for more time.

Oracle's behaviour not fixing critical security bugs for a long time (over 650 days) is not acceptable for their customers. Oracle put their customers in danger. At least one critical vulnerability can be abused from any attacker via internet.

I decided to publish these vulnerabilities because it is possible to mitigate the risk of these vulnerabilities by using the workarounds provided in the advisories.

Details
#######
Oracle Reports is Oracle's award-winning, high-fidelity enterprise reporting
tool. It enables businesses to give immediate access to information to all
levels within and outside of the organization in an unrivaled scalable and
secure environment. Oracle Reports, a component of the Oracle Application
Server, is used by Oracle itself for the E-Business Suite. Many large customers
are using Oracle Reports as reporting tool for their enterprise applications.

The Oracle Reports parameter desformat can read any file by using an absolute or
relative file name.
Parts of the file content are displayed in the Reports error message (see test
case)

The DESFORMAT parameter specifies the format for the job output. In bit-mapped
environments, use DESFORMAT to specify the printer driver to be used when
DESTYPE is FILE. In character-mode environments, use it to specify the
characteristics of the printer named in DESNAME.
