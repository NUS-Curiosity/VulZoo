This whole discussion is entirely pointless.

On modern systems, installing software is *by definition* highly
dangerous, no matter what.  If you let someone drop files in places of
their choosing (or even with a few restrictions), you've basically
agreed to give up control of your machine.

Consider how many packages need to install startup scripts or cron jobs.
And consider how those could be used to compromise a system.
