*yawn*

This was old news 10 years ago.

Unless you are facing a very special setup (for instance crypto disks 
even for system installation), you can easily take over most UNIX systems
if you are able to boot from a medium of your choice.

That's why physical security is important too.

As a rule: You usually can take control of any system provided you have
sufficient physical access to it. 

BTW: there are plenty of errors and omissions in the web page
     advertised by you.

Regards,
      Alex.
