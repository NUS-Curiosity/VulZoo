---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated cpio package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152891
Issue date:        2005-07-15
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CAN-1999-1572
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated cpio package that fixes a umask bug and supports large files
(>2GB) is now available.

GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

It was discovered that cpio uses a 0 umask when creating files using the
-O (archive) option. This creates output files with mode 0666 (all can
read and write) regardless of the user's umask setting. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-1999-1572 to this issue.

All users of cpio should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves
this issue, and adds support for large files (> 2GB).

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
