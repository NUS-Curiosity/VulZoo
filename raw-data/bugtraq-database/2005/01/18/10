Unfortunately, this raises more questions than it creates answers.

For example, if the people of Japan, an island nation isolated until a
series of big wars in the 1600s, were capable of developing long
before external contact ethnic footwear in which this problem is not
endemic, who else has done so?  Is there any other ethnic footwear out
there that by design is resistant to this type of attack?

I suppose I could begin the list by contributing another solution.

Entry 1.  The Japanese - Tabi boots.
Entry 2.  The Dutch - Clogs.

These wooden devices couldn't be any less comfortable if one were to
hammer nails through the soles before putting them on.  And merchants
that sell them always try to bundle them as part of a package deal,
including a smoke and a pancake.  However, they seem immune to the
vulnerability.

Any other contributions?

Chrz,
