Hi

I have just created a security advisory for the issue I found that is
fixed in Oracle latest security patch. The issue is with abuse of
DIRECTORY objects and can be found here 
http://www.petefinnigan.com/directory_traversal.pdf - I have also
updated my Oracle security alerts page to link to this advisory and also
those of other researchers who found bugs fixed by the same Oracle
patch. My alerts page is http://www.petefinnigan.com/alerts.htm - There
is also some discussion about Oracles new quarterly critical security
patch schedule in my Oracle security weblog http://www.petefinnigan.com/
weblog/entries/index.html

Kind regards

Pete
