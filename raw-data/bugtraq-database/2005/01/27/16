Summary
=========

WinAMP is a popular media player that supports various media and playlist
formats, including playlists in m3u or pls format.
  
NSFocus Security Team has found a buffer overflow vulnerability in the 
plug-in by which WinAMP plays CD. An attacker can construct a malicious playlist
file that is embedded in a HTML page. If a user is persuaded to click it, 
then the attacker can gain complete control over the user's system.

Description
============

WinAMP implements various functionalities through different plug-ins that
are stored in "plugins" sub-directory of WinAMP installation directory. For
example, in_mp3.dll is used to play MP3 files and in_cdda.dll is used to 
play CD.
  
The in_cdda.dll of WinAMP supports play path requests in the following format:

  1. <Driver\><PathName\>[FileName].cda
  2. linein://
  3. cda://
  4. cda://<Driver>
  5. cda://<Driver>,<TrackNumber>
  
Brett Moore of Security-Assessment.com discovered a stack overflow when in_cdda.dll
handles the first path. WinAMP released version 5.07 to fix that vulnerability.

Actually, in_cdda.dll will still cause an overflow when handling 4th and 5th
path above. Stack overflow will be triggered only by adding an over-long device 
name or sound track number behind "cda://".

Any method that can pass a play path to WinAMP can be used to trigger this 
vulnerability, for example, command line.

One possible remote attacking vector is to construct a playlist file in m3u 
or pls format with an over-long path embedded in HTML. Once a user visits
such a malicious page, it will execute the code of attacker's choice.   

Workaround
=============

NSFOCUS suggests to remove in_cdda.dll from Plugins of WinAMP.
