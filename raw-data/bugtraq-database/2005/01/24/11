Ideally, yes.  But as demonstrated by the Microsoft GDI exploit, just 
because a file is not executed proper doesn't necessarily mean it's safe 
from problems in the underlying application.

I'd still say that this isn't really a problem directly (after all, it's 
considered "safe" to view a webpage with images that are loaded without 
prompting), but the fact that attachments are automagically loaded does 
provide a spectacular way to automatically infect a large amount of 
phones if somebody were to come up with a way to payload an attachment.
