Subject: RealPlayer 10.5 Denial of Service and possible
	Overflow


Well i was trying to find something in .ra format. I found something
interesting(I think)
I had an old .Ra and tryed to change some information of the file(via
an hexadecimal editor):
All my .ra files begin always with the following code:
.ra......ra4.........r.........>................+........
If i change ONE byte at the beginning RealAudio crashes like the
following example:
.ra......Aa4.........r.........>................+........

In this case I just overwrited the second 'r' for 'A' and RealPlayer crashed.
I could not see if i overwrite with more A´s be possible to write into
stack cause I´m with no good debugger here and I don´t understant
windows debug report.
It was tested only with RealPlayer 10.5. *** If possible some one try
to write into stack will be great. ***

I´m making files avaliable at           www.debarry2.com.br/carlos/rapoc.zip
as an proof of concept for this.

You could also get the rapoc.zip at www.debarry2.com.br/carlos by a
link I put at first page(top);

If its possible to write into stack all of u comrades know that we can
execute arbitrary code into affected systems.

Sorry for my bad Brazilian-english.

Carlos A. Ulver.
