Subject: wifi AP + broadcoast ping


Hello Bugtraq,

I really don´t know, I´ve found a bug but who knows :)

I tryed to test wifi networks by broadcast pings and I have found out that 
almost every AP send icmp reply. So I think it could be easily abused for 
DoS attack. I can confirm that Ovislinks and Compex accepts broadcast icmp 
pings.
