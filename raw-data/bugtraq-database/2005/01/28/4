Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Alt-N WebAdmin <= 3.0.2


WebAdmin is a web application to administer MDaemon and RelayFax. It
can be run on its own or as an ISAPI application under Microsoft
Internet Information Services (IIS). MDaemon is an e-mail server for
Microsoft Windows. RelayFax is a fax server also for Microsoft
Windows. Both applications have been developed by the same company
than WebAdmin, Alt-N Technologies, and is not included by default with
MDaemon, nor with RelayFax.

>From Alt-N Website:

WebAdmin allows administrators to securely manage MDaemon, RelayFax,
and WorldClient from anywhere in the world. This convenient remote
administration tool is FREE of charge and is a separate download from
MDaemon.

The current version of WebAdmin is 3.0.4.

The Problems:

(1) Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
    ==========================

A Cross Site Scripting exists on the useredit_account.wdm file. Example:
http://server/WebAdmin/useredit_account.wdm?user=%3Cscript%3Ealert('test')%3C/script%3E



(2) Users can edit all the user accounts
    ====================================

There is no validation on the useredit_account.wdm script to disable
access to other user accounts. Example:
http://server/WebAdmin/useredit_account.wdm?user=otheruser@domain



(3) HTML Injection
    ==============

The file modalfram.wdm allows to load any web page to make it look as
if comes from the WebAdmin server. Example:
http://server/WebAdmin/modalframe.wdm?file=http://other_server/page.wdm



- This vulnerabilities would not enable an attacker to gain any
privileges on an affected computer.

- An attacker will need to be able to logon to WebAdmin to take
advantage of vulnerability number 2, but he will only be able to view
or modify the settings that he can modify on his own account (for
example, if an user cannot modify his own "Name", he won't be able to
modify the name in any other account, but if he can modify his own
"Name", he will be able to modify the name in any other account).
