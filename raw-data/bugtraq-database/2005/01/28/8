This vulnerability could be used for causing denial of service (DOS) conditions or access to arbitrary files on affected system. From files user.dat, users.dat attacker could get users and administrators passwords (vulnerability #3) and take complete control of a Merak Mail Server. With administrator privileges on Merak Mail Server the attacker using [Executables] function of the product could execute arbitrary commands on remote system with mailserver privileges.

This vulnerability also could be used for verifying existing of the arbitrary files on 
 remote system.
