Subject: New Whitepaper available on security best practices


Hello List,

Driven by multiple requests to provide some kind of guidance on what 
constitutes "best security practice", I've created a whitepaper focusing 
on host naming and URL conventions.  I've found that by following these 
simple principles the avenue for attack on many Internet-based 
applications is greatly limited.

I'm planning on releasing a number of new whitepaper this year focusing 
on plain-English explanations and advice on best security practices -- 
primarily dealing with web-app security.  I'd welcome any suggestions on 
other topics "industry" would like covered in more detail.

The paper is available at: 
http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/NISR-BestPracticesInHostURLNaming.pdf

Abstract:
A consideration often neglected by many organisations when rolling out 
new servers or developing web-based applications that will be accessible 
by Internet clients and customers is that of host and URL naming 
conventions. There are a number of simple steps that can be taken to 
strengthen the security of an environment or application making it more 
resilient to several popular attack vectors. By understanding how an 
attacker can abuse poorly thought out naming conventions, and by 
instigating a few minor changes, it is possible to positively increase 
the defence-in-depth stature of an environment.

Cheers,

Gunter Ollmann
