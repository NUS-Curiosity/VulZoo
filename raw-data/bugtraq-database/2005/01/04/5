Description:
PhotoPost was designed to help you give your users exactly 
what they want. Your users will be thrilled to finally be 
able to upload and display their photos for your entire 
community to view and discuss, all with no more effort than 
it takes to post a text message to a forum. If you already 
have a forum (vBulletin, UBB Threads, phpBB, DCForum, or 
InvisionBoard), you'll appreciate that PhotoPost was designed 
to seamlessly integrate into your site without the need for 
your users to register twice and maintain two logins. Where you 
see [INT] in this advisory, it represents an integer such as a 
valid category. [XSS] and [SQL] represent where an attacker could 
insert code to conduct a cross site scripting attack, or inject 
data to influence SQL queries.



Cross Site Scripting:
PhotoPost is prone to cross site scripting in several different 
scripts throughout the application. Below are examples:


http://path/showgallery.php?cat=[INT]&page=[XSS]
http://path/showgallery.php?si=[XSS]
http://path/showgallery.php?cat=[INT][XSS]
http://path/showgallery.php?ppuser=[INT]&cat=[INT][XSS]

This can be used to render hostile code in the context of the 
victims browser, or to steal cookie based credentials or other
sensitive info.



SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:
There are a substantial number of SQL Injection vulnerabilities in 
this application. Some are easy to exploit, others are not so easy.

http://path/showgallery.php?cat=[INT][SQL]
http://path/showgallery.php?ppuser=[INT][SQL]&cat=[INT]

These SQL issues can possibly be exploited to influence SQL queries 
and disclose arbitrary data. These will alse cause XSS if unsuccessful.



Proof Of Concept:
Due to the fact that some people feel the issues in this advisory and 
our last PhotoPost advisory were not accurate and unexploitable we have 
decided to include a proof of concept.

http://path/showgallery.php?ppuser=-2'%20UNION%20SELECT%200,email,
0,0,0,0,0,0%20FROM%20user%20WHERE%20userid='1&cat=500

The above example is relatively harmless, but will pull the private 
email address of a user. This could just as easily be an admin password 
hash. This works on all versions prior to recently released PhotoPost 4.86



Solution:
PhotoPost 4.86 has been released to address these issues. Users should
upgrade their installation as soon as possible.
