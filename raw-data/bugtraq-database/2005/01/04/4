Original Release Date: 2005-01-01
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20050101-1.txt

1. Systems affected:

        All KDE releases up to including KDE 3.3.2.


2. Overview:

        KDE applications which use the ftp kioslave, e.g. Konqueror, allow
        remote attackers to execute arbitrary FTP commands via an ftp://
        URL that contains an URL-encoded newline ( %0a ) before the ftp
        command, which causes the commands to be inserted into the resulting
        FTP session. 

        Due to similiarities between the ftp and the SMTP protocol, this
        vulnerability allows to misuse the ftp slave to connect to a
        SMTP server and issue arbitrary commands, like sending an email.


3. Impact:

        The FTP kioslave can be misused to execute any ftp command on the
        server or be a vector for sending out unsolicited email.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
