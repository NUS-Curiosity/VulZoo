Subject: Windows Media files allow opening any url in Internet Explorer


PC World has published an interesting article:
http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,119016,00.asp

Short version:
The Digital Rights Management for Windows Media files allows opening
arbitrary urls in Internet Explorer.

Impact:
MSIE browser vulnerabilities can now be exploited through wma files,
allowing virii, worms and other kinds of malware to spread through P2P
networks.

Happy new year!

Cheers,
