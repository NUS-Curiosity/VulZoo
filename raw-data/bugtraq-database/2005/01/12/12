Synopsis
========

Multiple overflows have been found in Windows Explorer, potentially allowing
a remote user to open Explorer and run files remotely.


Background
==========

Windows Explorer is an advanced browsing tool made by Microsoft. It is used
in daily tasks to open folders, copy files, delete files, rename files and
view files on a system. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and used
by billions worldwide. It runs on an array of machines.


Affected versions
=================

All versions of Windows' Explorer are vulnerable

Description
===========

Shogun Suzuki discovered that a remote user can connect to any machine via
numerous exploits and use Windows Explorer to view files, rename files,
delete files, change permissions on files stored on a remote machine that
has been pwned.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could install something similar to PCAnywhere after
exploiting Windows and use Windows' Explorer to view, copy and or open any
file on a victims machine.

Workaround
==========

On a command prompt: del C:\WINDOWS\explorer.exe


Concerns?
=========

Security is a primary focus of TEAM PWN4GE and ensuring the progress of
secure Windows machines be our dreams. As security concerns should be
addressed to respective vendors, we feel the urge to bypass standards and
bring our common dreams of a secure homeland to the Interweb.
