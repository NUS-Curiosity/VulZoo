Support for extracting RFC2397 encoded data within HTML documents has
been added to the CVS version of Clam AntiVirus, the open source virus
scanner.

The next stable release containing this feature, version 0.81 is
scheduled to become a Release Candidate on 19th Jan.

Until that time, access to the current development code is available via
CVS and nightly tarballs. See www.clamav.net for download details.

Thanks,
