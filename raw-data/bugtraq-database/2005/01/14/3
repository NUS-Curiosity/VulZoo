Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 01.13.05: MySQL MaxDB WebAgent websql logon Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


MySQL MaxDB WebAgent websql logon Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 01.13.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=181&type=vulnerabilities
January 13, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

MaxDB by MySQL is a re-branded and enhanced version of SAP DB, SAP AG's
open source database. MaxDB is a heavy-duty, SAP-certified open source
database that offers high availability, scalability and a comprehensive
feature set. MaxDB complements the MySQL database server, targeted for
large mySAP ERP environments and other applications that require maximum
enterprise-level database functionality.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability in 
MySQL MaxDB could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. 

The vulnerability specifically exists due to a lack of bounds checking 
in the websql CGI application. In this case, the value of the password 
parameter is converted to unicode and then copied to the stack. The 
resulting overflow can overwrite the saved values for eip and ebp if 
supplied with a 294 byte value. The stored register values are 
overwritten with portions of the unicode copy of the string which may be

leveraged to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. A simple 
overwrite with a long password value will result in the following 
debugger output:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can allow remote attackers 
to execute code with SYSTEM privileges. Note that the vulnerability is 
in the web administration service which should be configured to not 
allow connections from untrusted hosts or listen on public facing 
network interfaces.
