Subject: RE: Paper: SQL Injection Attacks by Example


Hi Steve, 
Nice paper. However, one small nitpick - under "Mitigations" you list using
stored procedures if the database supports them. I've seen other people
suggest this as a defensive strategy as well.

Using stored procedures will *not* protect you from SQL injection attacks.
Firstly, they can be injected into just as easily as a select statement.
Secondly, the procedure itself can be vulnerable to SQL injection. I have
seen for example, procs that use double quotes internally and single quotes
on input.

That said, stored procedures are generally faster so it's better to use them
for performance reasons, anyway.

Cheers,
David Litchfield
