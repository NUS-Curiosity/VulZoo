Description
***********
IBM DB2 is vulnerable to Denial of Service conditions when processing
certain function calls.

Details
*******
The numbers below are NGS BUGID reference numbers mentioned in
http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/db2-02.txt

112) If the to_char function is called with an empty string for its
second parameter, DB2 dereferences a null pointer and terminates:

select to_char('aaa','') from sysibm.sysdummy1

113) If the to_date function is called with an empty string for its
second parameter, DB2 dereferences a null pointer and terminates:

select to_date('aaa', '') from sysibm.sysdummy1

In both cases, DB2 must be restarted in order to restore normal
functionality.

Fix Information
***************
IBM has written a patch and can be obtained with the latest fixpak.
