Subject: firewall 1.4


Mods:  Sorry for the shameless plug, but I think some might be interested.

I've recently put together firewall 1.4, available at
http://tje.ssllink.net/firewall.tar.gz

firewall lets you configure your rules with flat text files such as
/etc/firewall/tcp.ssh or /etc/firewall/udp.nfs.  1.4 comes with a
small daemon that monitors the st_mtime of all of the files in
/etc/firewall.  You can cause the firewall to reload and pick up the
changes in the files with 1 second granularity.  This is the closest
thing to real-time manipulation of a Linux-based firewall I've come
across.  There is little to no cost in my environment (console only,
sitting idle).

Comments, feedback, complaints, etc... are welcome.
