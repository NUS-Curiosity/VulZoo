Subject: Trend Micro Control Manager - Enterprise Edition 3.0 Web application Replay attack



Dear Bugtraq,

Here is Trend Micro's reply to this claim

This kind of sniffing and "hijacking" of login could be done to almost
all ordinary installed http products with login procedure.
Since we offer a way to install it with HTTPS(SSL) and making login and
communicating with the server secure, we have a internal discussion
about if we should call this a "Vulnerability" or not.
We have made the R&D promise that next version will be with the question
in the installation program for installing SSL support.
On the other hand this product should be installed by IT professionals.
And it should be obvious to them that IIS in http mode is not security
enough.
We thank you for pointing out this to us and we are grateful that our
products are "checked" for security issues! We can sometime like in this
case just assume that all think of security issues but the truth is that
IT personal have more than security to think about. So things like this
are constantly missed!

Here is a link on how to enable HTTPS support for Trend Micro Control
Manager
