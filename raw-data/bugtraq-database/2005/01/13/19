In some fairly reasonable circumstances, this may not be enough.
I wonder whether the security community is generally aware of a
paper I co-authored on defeating PaX and address space
randomization in general on 32-bit systems, titled "On the
Effectiveness of Address Space Randomization".  It was presented
at CCS 2004 and available on my webpage, among other places:
