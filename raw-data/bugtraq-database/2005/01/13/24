Look for return-into-libc exploits.  There are quite a few.

Even with non-executable stack and heap, no one guarantees that buffer
overflows aren't exploitable.  Randomization of load addresses is
intended to provide additional protection, but the number of available
bits is fairly low on 32 bit machines (problably less than 16).  I
don't know if Windows is doing it.
