This article in Phrack is being cited as this guys
qualifications for conducting a security seminar?
Getting fired for writing an article (an article so
clueless --devoid of substance-- as this one) is cited
as a good thing (just because it appeared in phrack)?
Phrack Editors: please apply some standard in choosing
articles, because people do think that having an
article published in phrack amounts to something, and
mostly your articles are superb (except when you plug
articles like this because your friend wrote it)

Just because one tool does not check bad cluster,
doesn't mean that you can use this method of data
hiding to defeat forensics as a whole.

Encryption as an anti-forensics technology.
<sarcasm>Wow. who knew that?</sarcasm>

Logging to a different Syslog server. <sarcasm>Wow.
who knew that?</sarcasm>

Anthony Zboralski: We would expect yot to plug some
article with substance when you promote your speaker
and conference in a lot of security mailing lists. Oh
yeah and you are going to jail if you talk about
anti-forensics in US, you stupid promoter.
