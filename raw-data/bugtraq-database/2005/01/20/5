After reading the review of Dan Farmer and Wietse's Forensic Discovery, 
you should hear about
The Grugq who got fired from @stake after writing a Phrack Article in 
which he exposed numerous
flaws in The Coroner's Toolkit by Dan & Wietse.

Before you read this book, check out the video (bittorrent) of The 
Grugq on The Art of Defiling and
see how to defeat "industry grade" forensic tools and techniques .

You can also meet him at a hacker convention near you (in March at 
BCS2005 in Jakarta, in April
  at Black Hat in S'pore and Amsterdam and at HITB2005 Bahrain.

Grugq's Profile:
   http://www.bellua.com/bcs2005/asia05.speakers.html#grugq

The Grugq has been researching anti-forensics for almost 5 years. He 
has presented
to the UK's largest forensic practitioner group where he scared 
Scotland Yard.
  Grugq has worked to secure the networks and hosts of global 
corporations, and
he's also worked for security consulting companies. His work as a 
security consultant
was cut short temporarily following the publication of an article on 
anti-forensics.

P.S. Is it illegal to talk about anti-forensics under the Patriot Act?
