Portcullis Security Testing Service
 
Affected systems: 
 
Emotion MediaPartner Web Server Version 5.0 (5.1 not confirmed)
 
Details:
 
The MediaPartner 5.0 web-server is vulnerable to directory

web-published file system is installed to.
 
An attacker can craft a URL that contains malicious code.  When a
victim follows the URL the malicious code is executed by their
browser.
 
 
Exploit:
 
No exploit Code required. Examples: http://target_ip/../../../boot.ini
