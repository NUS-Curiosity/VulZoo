Portcullis Security Advisory
 
Vulnerable System: 
      
Webseries Payment Application
 
Vulnerability Title:  
 
Password Policy Implemented At Client rather than Server
 
Vulnerability discovery and development: 
 
Portcullis Security Testing Services
 
Affected systems: 
 
Bottomline Webseries Payment Application 
 
Details:
 
The password policy, enforcing the minimum length of passwords, is implemented in the client browser using JavaScript which can be bypassed using any local proxy system, allowing for single character passwords.
 
Impact:
 
Whilst client side data validation can be of assistance in aiding a user to
correctly enter the required information, client side scripts can be easily
by-passed in a number of ways.  This allows a user to set their password to
a value not acceptable to the implemented security policy.
 
Exploit:
 
Exploit code not required.
