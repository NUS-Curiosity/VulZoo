Portcullis Security Advisory
 
Vulnerable System: 
      
Webseries Payment Application
 
Vulnerability Title:  
 
Execute Of Arbitrary Reports
 
Vulnerability discovery and development: 
 
Portcullis Security Testing Services
 
Affected systems: 
 
Bottomline Webseries Payment Application 
 
Details:
 
Portcullis consultants have discovered that by manipulating the values of certain
Variables used during report selection it was possible to cause the application to
download and execute arbitrary reports from any machine on the network
capable of supporting Windows shares.
 
In normal usage the Webseries application references report templates
located on the web server itself:
 
        ReportPath=E:\server\apps\WSWEB\Web+Application+Files\reports\
        ReportName=User%20Activity%20Report.rpt
 
When the value of the ReportPath variable is changed to contain a UNC path
referencing another machine on the network (as shown below), the Webseries
application appears to download and attempt to execute the report.
 
        ReportPath=\\192.168.1.2\Shared\
        ReportName=Test.rpt
 
 
Impact:
 
A malicious user with knowledge of the structure of the backend database
could design a report template to disclose any information contained within
the database.  Portcullis consultants believe that it is possible to create
a report template that would display usernames and passwords (in what ever
form they are stored in the database)..
 
Exploit:
 
Exploit code not required.
