Subject: Metasploit Framework v2.3


The Metasploit Framework is an advanced open-source exploit
development platform. The 2.3 release includes three user interfaces,
46 exploits and 68 payloads.

The Framework will run on any modern operating system that has a working
Perl interpreter. The Windows installer includes a slimmed-down version
of the Cygwin environment.

Some highlights in this release:

 - Complete overhaul of the Framework payload collection
    + Win32 ordinal-stagers are now included (92-byte reverse connect)
    + A handful of new sparc payloads have been added (sol, linux, bsd)
    + Reliability problems have been resolved in bsd, linux, and win32
    + New udp-based linux shell stagers and shell payloads
    + New size-optimized Mac OS X encoders and payloads

 - Includes the win32 version of the Meterpreter
    + Dynamically load new features over the network w/o disk access
    + In-memory dll injection of the basic meterpreter shell
    + Current extensions include Fs, Process, Net, and Sys
    + Extensive documentation is available online:
      * http://metasploit.com/projects/Framework/docs/meterpreter.pdf

 - Complete rewrite of the 'msfweb' user interface
    + Generate and encode stand-alone shellcode from the web interface
    + The interface is skinnable and includes three different themes
    + Streaming HTTP is used to provide a 100% web-based shell
    + Ability to set advanced options in the web interface

 - Massive speed enhancements in msfconsole and msfweb
    + Snappier response and quicker load times on older systems
    + Optimizations made to various sort/search algorithms
    + Modules are no longer reloaded after each exploit

 - New exploits
    + Microsoft WINS Service Memory Overwrite (MS04-045) 
    + Samba trans2open() Buffer Overflow (Mac OS X)
    + 4D WebSTAR FTP Server Buffer Overflow (Mac OS X)
    + Veritas Name Service Registration Buffer Overflow    
    + AOL Instant Messenger 'goaway' Buffer Overflow
    + IPSwitch IMail IMAPD 'delete' Buffer Overflow
    + Seattle Labs Mail Server POP3 Buffer Overflow
    + UoW IMAPD Buffer Overflow (sparc, ia32)
    + IRIX lpdsched Remote Command Execution    
    + CDE dtspcd Buffer Overflow (Solaris)
    + IIS 4.0 ism.dll HTR Buffer Overflow 
    + IIS w3who.dll ISAPI Buffer Overflow

Exploit modules designed for the 2.2 release should maintain
compatibility with 2.3. If you run into any problems using older
modules with this release, please let us know.

The Framework development team consists of four active members and a
handful of part-time contributors. Check out the 'Credits' exploit
module for a complete list of contributors.

You can subscribe to the Metasploit Framework mailing list by sending a
blank email to framework-subscribe[at]metasploit.com. This is the
preferred way to submit bugs, suggest new features, and discuss the
Framework with other users.

If you would like to contact us directly, please email us at:
msfdev[at]metasploit.com.

Starting with the 2.2 release, it is now possible to perform a system-wide
installation of the Framework. Simply extract the tarball into the
directory of your choice and create symbolic links from the msf*
executables to a directory in the system path. Users may maintain their
own exploit module collections by placing them into ~/.msf/exploits/. If
you are interested in adding the Framework to a operating system
distribution, please drop us a line and we will gladly help with the
integration and testing process.

For more information about the Framework and this release in general,
please refer to the online documentation, particularly the User Guide:

The Opcode Database has been refactored in order to support more granular
queries. The new version provides users with the ability to easily cross
reference specific opcode types, classes, and meta classes across one or
more modules for one or more operating system versions. This level of
granular control allows for a robust and flexible interface that can be
used to determine opcode portability. Aside from opcodes themselves, the
opcode database also contains detailed information about the segments,
imports, and exports that are associated with each module in the database.

A quick overview of the features included in the new database are:    
  - Granular searching of opcodes of a specific type, class, and meta class.  
  - Searching modules provided directly from Windbg's module list. 
  - Cross referencing opcodes across various operating system version. 
  - Detailed module information including segments, imports, and exports.

You can access the beta version of the new Opcode Database at:
