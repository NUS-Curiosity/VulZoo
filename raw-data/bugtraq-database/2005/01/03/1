For this particular strain it would certainly help, but that is why there 
exists new variations.  Certainly doing it to /tmp, /usr/tmp, /var/tmp 
could help, but it isn't 100% foolproof, and some don't even consider it 
security.  Another measure one might use is chmod 700 (or 400 depending on 
your needs) wget.

Then again, you can always disable the functions in php.ini for exec and 
system for instance to help stave off other similar attacks.
