MySQL MaxDB Web Agent Multiple Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 01.19.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=187&type=vulnerabilities
January 19, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

MaxDB by MySQL is a re-branded and enhanced version of SAP DB, SAP AG's
open source database. MaxDB is a heavy-duty, SAP-certified open source
database that offers high availability, scalability and a comprehensive
feature set. MaxDB complements the MySQL database server, targeted for
large mySAP ERP environments and other applications that require maximum
enterprise-level database functionality. Further details are available
at:

   http://www.mysql.com/products/maxdb/

II. DESCRIPTION

Two remotely exploitable denial of service conditions have been found to
exist in MySQL MaxDB and SAP DB Web Agent products.

The first vulnerability specifically exists due to a null pointer
dereference in the sapdbwa_GetUserData() function. A remote attacker can
request the webdav handler code with invalid parameters to cause a null
pointer dereference resulting in a crash of SAP DB Web Agent.

The second vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of malformed
HTTP headers. A remote attacker can submit a HTTP request with invalid
headers to cause a denial of service.

III. ANALYSIS

A remote attacker can send simple HTTP requests to cause MaxDB Web Agent
to crash.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities in MySQL 
MaxDB 7.5.0.0 on Linux and Windows platforms. It is believed that all
versions prior to 7.5.0.21 are affected. 

V. WORKAROUND

mechanisms to limit access to administrative systems and services.
