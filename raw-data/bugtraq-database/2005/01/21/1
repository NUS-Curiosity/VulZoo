Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal, which may allow an attacker
to run arbitrary code, crash the program or perform DoS by CPU and disk
utilization.

Background
==========

Ethereal is a feature rich network protocol analyzer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/ethereal      < 0.10.9                     >= 0.10.9

Description
===========

There are multiple vulnerabilities in versions of Ethereal earlier than
0.10.9, including:

* The COPS dissector could go into an infinite loop (CAN-2005-0006).

* The DLSw dissector could cause an assertion, making Ethereal exit
  prematurely (CAN-2005-0007).

* The DNP dissector could cause memory corruption (CAN-2005-0008).

* The Gnutella dissector could cause an assertion, making Ethereal
  exit prematurely (CAN-2005-0009).

* The MMSE dissector could free statically-allocated memory
  (CAN-2005-0010).

* The X11 dissector is vulnerable to a string buffer overflow
  (CAN-2005-0084).

Impact
======

An attacker might be able to use these vulnerabilities to crash
Ethereal, perform DoS by CPU and disk space utilization or even execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Ethereal, which
could be the root user.

Workaround
==========

For a temporary workaround you can disable all affected protocol
dissectors by selecting Analyze->Enabled Protocols... and deselecting
them from the list. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to
the latest stable version.

Resolution
==========

All Ethereal users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.9"
