Hi again,

it is quite funny how Immunitysec is supporting the kids that
first stole Paul's linux local root exploit and then sent it
out to the whole world in my name. Otherwise it is hard to
explain why dailydave again and again lets those obviously
faked emails through moderation. My original reply email
is reachable through the web interface only by number
juggling, because of pipermail bugs or a manipulation of the
generated archive. Whatever it was "replaced" by another
fake email with a faked e-matters gpg signature.

And the same bunch of kids accuse me again and again to have
stolen "their" bugs, they even sent me dead bugs (aka. insects)
within an anonymous letter from somewhere in the neatherlands
after I released the CVS advisories. (Well this is of course
only a guess and I cannot be sure that these are the same idiots)

Just spreading a rumour again and again f.e. that I am married
to divenint or that he gave me that CVS remote does not make it
more true.
You demonstrated today that you are able to read vendor-sec
emails... So you should actually know that I told vendor-sec,
that I reaudited CVS, because I had heard from a friend that
there is atleast one more CVS remote. Why in hell should I tell
that to them if I had stolen the exploit and wanted to hide that
fact?

It is your bad luck, that I found a bug that was obviously
circulating in the undergrounds for years. And now I have to
face the anger of a little kid that lost one of his toys.
And I will most probably face it again and again until you
die by a heart attack.

Yours,
Stefan Esser
