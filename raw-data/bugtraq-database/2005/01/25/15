Subject: Re: SECURITY.NNOV: Multiple applications fd_set structure bitmap array index overflow


This issue was fixed in Citadel 6.29, which can be obtained from
http://uncensored.citadel.org/citadel/

Previous versions of Citadel are only vulnerable when running on BSD,
or Linux with a non-default number of max open files, as discussed in
the article. No exploits against Citadel using this vulnerability are
known at this time, but all users, especially those on BSD systems,
should upgrade at the earliest opportunity.
