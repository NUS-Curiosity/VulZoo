Why subvert the form at all? If a HTML form contains JavaScript to check
the fields entered, it is trivial to craft your own form or HTTP request
to send arbitrary data to the server. Trying to get around JavaScript
checks to accomplish this just serves to make the task more difficult.

JavaScript really ought only to be used in this fashion to sanity check
form content and not as a security device. This paper does raise the
issue of the fundamental flaw in the trust some people put into
client-side validation.
