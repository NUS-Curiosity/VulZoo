1. Topic:

An updated gpdf package that fixes a number of integer overflow security
flaws is now available.

GPdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files for GNOME.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

During a source code audit, Chris Evans and others discovered a number
of integer overflow bugs that affected all versions of xpdf. These
issues also affect gpdf as it is based on xpdf source code. An attacker
could construct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause gpdf to
crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0888 to this issue.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Gfx::doImage function of Xpdf.
This flaw also affects gpdf as it is based on xpdf source code. An
attacker could construct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause
gpdf to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-1125 to this issue.

A buffer overflow flaw was found when processing the /Encrypt /Length
tag. An attacker could construct a carefully crafted PDF file that could
cause gpdf to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2005-0064 to this issue.

Users of gpdf are advised to upgrade to this errata package, which
contains backported patches correcting these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

5. Bug IDs fixed:

http://bugzilla.fedora.us - bug #2353 - xpdf buffer overflows apply to gpdf

6. RPMs required:

Fedora Core 1:

SRPM:

i386:
http://download.fedoralegacy.org/fedora/1/updates/i386/gpdf-0.110-1.4.legacy.i386.rpm

7. Verification:

SHA1 sum                                 Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

     rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

     sha1sum <filename>
