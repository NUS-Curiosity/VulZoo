Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup UniversalAgent Backdoor 
Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 02.10.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=198&type=vulnerabilities
February 10, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

BrightStor ARCserve Backup r11.1 delivers leading backup and restore 
protection for all classes of Windows, NetWare, Linux and UNIX servers, 
as well as Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, UNIX, AS/400 and VMS client 
environments. 

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a design flaw in Computer Associates 
International Inc's BrightStor ARCserve Backup UniversalAgent for UNIX 
may allow execution of arbitrary code.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to hard coded credentials 
being left in the production release of the UniversalAgent for UNIX. An 
attacker may use the following credentials to gain full access to the 
remote file system and potentially execute arbitrary commands with 
permissions of the root user. 

Username: \x02root\x03 
Password: \x02<%j8U]`~+Ri\x03

III. ANALYSIS

The BrightStor software uses a network agent to perform backups on 
nodes across the network. Typically, the agent service requires either 
administrative credentials or a node-specific password and is capable 
of backing up files and remotely executing commands. The agent will 
listen on TCP and UDP ports 6051 by default and is installed on every 
node that the BrightStor server is configured to backup.

IV. DETECTION

Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup r11.1 for Linux and UNIX 
have been confirmed vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Employ firewalls, access control lists or other TCP/UDP restriction 
mechanism to limit access to the backup port on affected systems and 
services. The login credentials are sent in cleartext and may also be 
used to detect connections from attackers.
