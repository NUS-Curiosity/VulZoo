Maybe I'm naive, but shouldn't a trustworthy root CA not sign
certificates for domain names which are obviously meant to be
deceptive?  Isn't this the entire reason for browsers coming with a
small list of CAs which are deemed trustworthy?

If the holders of widely-trusted root certificates can't be trusted to
avoid even the most rudimentary deceptions, many of the protections of
SSL have only very limited value.

Perhaps some more care on the part of browser packagers in deciding
which CAs have their certificates included by default is the solution.
