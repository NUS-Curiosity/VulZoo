Subject: Symantec UPX Parsing Engine Heap Overflow


There is an article about a vulnerability in Symantec's NAV and other
products:
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2005.02.08.html

The details are somewhat lacking on what specifically needs to be
updated.  We are running several NAV servers from 7.5 to 8.1 and I can't
tell whether or not I need to patch or if LiveUpdate is taking care of
this.  There are mixed comments (as always) on Slashdot:
http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/10/1327220&tid=172

Does anyone have information or experiences to share?
