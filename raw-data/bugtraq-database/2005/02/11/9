Subject: RE: MSN Messenger PNG Image Buffer Overflow Download Shellcoded Exploit


Ok after switching to MSN 6 still couldn't load the image as my display 
picture. It turns out that the instructions provided with this file are 
wrong! You have to send the victim the image via the file transfer mode on 
MSN.

I have tested this and can varify that it works. It isn't an auto 
exploitation, the user has to click the link to view the file, at which 
point there msn will freeze and a .exe will be dropped onto the 
system(assuming HTTP isn't blocked by the firewall). The victim will know 
that something dodgy has happened since in each case their MSN 
closes/freezes.
