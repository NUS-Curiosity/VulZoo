Subject: [SePro Bugtraq] SQL-Injection in PerlDesk 1.x




SQL-Injection in PerlDesk
 
Discovered by deluxe89 and Astovidatu
[ www.security-project.org ]
 
 
Vendor: LogicNow
Homepage: http://www.perldesk.com/
Vulnerable versions: 1.x
Login required: no
 
 
Description:
"PerlDesk is a feature packed web based help desk and email management application designed to streamline the operation of managing emails or support requests, with built in tracking and response logging. It is an ideal help desk solution for companies with one or more members of staff or for those who want to organise client support." 
(direct quote from www.perldesk.com)
 
Summary:
PerlDesk has got a SQL-Injection vulnerability, which allows potential users to read informations from the database.
The "view"-parameter isn't filtered, so an attacker can manipulate the query. 
 
Proof of Concept:
[code=vulnerable]
if ($ENV{'QUERY_STRING'} =~ /^view/)
  {
 
    $id        = $q->param('view');
        $statement = 'SELECT * FROM perlDesk_kb_entries WHERE id = ' . "$id";
[/code]
 
As one can see the "view"-parameter is stored in $id which is then passed to the SQL-Statement completely unfiltered.
Using a malformed query string one can exploit this issue.
 
For example "http://www.site.com/dir/kb.cgi?view=0 UNION SELECT 1,3,password,username,3,7 FROM users"
 
If the user table is named "users", this query will read the username and password.

Patch:
Upgrade to version 2.x.
