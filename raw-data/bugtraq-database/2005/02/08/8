IBM AIX chdev Local Format String Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 02.07.05
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?type=vulnerabilities
February 07, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

The chdev program is a setuid root application, installed by default 
under multiple versions of IBM AIX, that facilitates the changing of 
device characteristics.

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a format string vulnerability in the chdev command

included by default in multiple versions of IBM Corp.'s AIX operating 
system could allow for arbitrary code execution as the root user. 

The vulnerability specifically exists due to an improperly used 
formatted printing function. When provided with an incorrect argument 
(argv[1]) that contains a format string, the format string will be fed 
into a formatted printing function, and the user supplied format string 
will be evaluated, allowing for a malicious user to examine stack memory

and write to arbitrary memory locations. With a properly crafted string,

this can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

This vulnerability can only be exploited by a local user who has been 
granted access to the "system" group. Successful exploitation leads to 
root-level access. 

Due to the nature of the vulnerability, information leakage is trivial 
and aids the attacker in exploitation.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in IBM AIX 
version 5.2. It is suspected that previous versions are also vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Only allow trusted users local access to security critical systems. Only

allow trusted system administrators access to the "system" group. 
Alternately, remove the setuid bit from chdev using chmod u-s 
/usr/sbin/chdev.
