Not sure either but I think it's quite serious as the name of the database,
among other things, is displayed.
Maybe it's good idea to alter that line so "irrelevant" information remains
hidden (at least until a better solution arrives):

if ( !($result = $db->sql_query($sql)) )
{
  message_die(GENERAL_ERROR, "Couldn't obtain list of matching users
(searching for: $search_author)");
}
