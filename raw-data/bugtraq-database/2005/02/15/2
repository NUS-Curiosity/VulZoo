Subject: Re: Exploit on tcp/4128?


I can certainly think of at least one trojan in living memory which used
this port as a backdoor; it's also a fairly common port for proxy
servers to be running on, so it would be my guess that someone is
looking either for boxes to break into and use for spam/ddos/whatever or
proxy servers for the same purpose.

There are lots of sites which specialise in providing lists of free
socks/http proxy servers, and many more which sell them - it's also
possible that this is one of them trawling your IP block for open proxy
servers on this port, as I don't see how else they would get such
comprehensive lists, as I can only assume that as most of these proxy
servers are on cable/adsl/broadband connections, they're misconfigured
or operating without their owner's knowledge or consent.

Do you have any other traffic logged from the IP Address(es) or range
which this came from? What does the rdns/whois look like?

regards,

 - James.
