Subject: SecurityForest - Public Release no.2


Hey Guys,

For those of you who don't know what SecurityForest is, check out:
http://www.securityforest.com/wiki/index.php/SecurityForest_-_Public_Release_no.1

I'll keep this mail short. There have been major additions and changes 
to the forest, here are just a few.
  - The "ExploitTree update phase I" has been completed. (Thnx a lot to 
all those who assisted).
  - ExploitTree v2 has been released, it includes much more exploits and 
is more categorized and organized than ever before. (anonymous CVS 
access is now available)
  - The ToolTree has grown massively.
  - *new* The EducationTree is currently in beta-stage but includes a 
lot of great resources.
  - *new* The BookTree includes almost all the great security/hacking 
books ever published.
  - The LinkTree includes loads of great resources.
  - Lots more...

And finally, the "SecurityForest Exploitation Framework Beta" is soon to 
be released, screenshots and a demo movie are available. (A pre-beta 
version is available for those willing to help and PROVIDE FEEDBACK!).
	
Cheers,
Loni
