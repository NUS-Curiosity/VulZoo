Looks like a probe from Netcat, passing the IP required by the -n switch, and -v, echo back as  much information as you can about the connection attempt)  The question would be, what on your network, that you know of, is responsive to that port? Are any of the probed machines running processes you don't recognize?  Most likely looking for a backdoor that is assumed there by the command switch invoked.  This response looks like a neg response.

Anyone know what this is:

D:\nc>nc -n -v 64.132.205.69 4128

The same host above is scanning the *world* for this port:
