Subject: RE: RE: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer no
	t seeing KB887742 and KB886185


KB887742: "A computer that is running Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack
2 (SP2), Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, or Microsoft
Windows Server 2003 unexpectedly stops. Additionally, the following Stop
error message appears on a blue screen: Stop 0x05
(INVALID_PROCESS_ATTACH_ATTEMPT)".

That's a denial of service.  There are security implications there.

KB886185: "After you set up Windows Firewall in Microsoft Windows XP
Service Pack 2 (SP2), you may discover that anyone on the Internet can
access resources on your computer when you use a dial-up connection to
connect to the Internet."

That looks like a major security hole to me.

Cheers,

Phil
