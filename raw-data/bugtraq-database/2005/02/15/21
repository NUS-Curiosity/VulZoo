The difference between CAs and the BBB is that the BBB is well known and 
highly accountable.  CAs are not necessarily. 

There is no widely screened public discussion or understanding of the 
function of CAs.  The accepted root CAs do their jobs on the browser 
entirely in the background.  Their "seal of approval" is considered 
implicit by the lack of a message at all.

Therefore, when a CA screws up, all the CA has to do is say "Mea Culpa - 
it wasn't that way when we approved them." and they wash their hands of 
it and only a very small percentage of people (who are more likely to be 
labelled paranoid than listened to by the masses) are ever actually 
talking about it.

The same is not true of the BBB and as such the argument that there's a 
valid trust relationship there is invalid.  There is no relationship 
between the end user and the CA in the first place, nevermind a trusted one.
