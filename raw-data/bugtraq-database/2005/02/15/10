Subject: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer not seeing KB887742 and KB886185

Subject line says it all....just did a fresh install of WinXP SP2....was using MBSAFU to make sure it would patch...which it did.  However Windows Update shows still needing KB887742 and KB886185.  MBSA shows no critical patches need updated.  Systeminfo shows that both KB887742 and KB886185 are NOT installed.  I'm using latest MBSA.  Anyone else see this?  Kinda sucks :(
