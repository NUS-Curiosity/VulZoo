This is only partially correct. The error is in the function glob() in
glob.c, not in wu_fnmatch(), which contains code to treat sequences
of * characters as a single *:

        case '*':
            c = *pattern;
            while (c == '*')
                c = *++pattern;


The same can be done in glob:

*** glob.c.~1~  2001-11-29 18:01:38.000000000 +0100
--- glob.c      2005-02-27 01:08:14.219711901 +0100
***************
*** 437,442 ****
--- 437,444 ----
            continue;

        case '*':
+           while (*p == '*')
+               p++;
            if (!*p)
                return (1);
            if (*p == '/') {


With this change, a command like

    dir ***********************************.*

is treated like "dir *.*" and does not cause a time cosuming recursion.
