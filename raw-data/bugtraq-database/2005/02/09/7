Hi all, 


I know how this hole works and where it hits, also I have found a fix for it, so start applying or end up dieing....lmao


This is an example of the source code for the forum script:

Line 126:''''''''''End Add '''''''''''''''''''''
Line 127:
Line 128:hostInfo = Dns.GetHostByAddress(clientIp)
Line 129:
Line 130:if IsDBNull(hostInfo) then


and here is the fix:

[SocketException (0x2afc): The requested name is valid, but no data of the requested type was found]
   System.Net.Dns.GetHostByAddress(IPAddress address) +264
   System.Net.Dns.GetHostByAddress(String address) +54
   ASP.WriteDeny_aspx.__Render__control1(HtmlTextWriter __output, Control parameterContainer) in D:\Inetpub\wwwroot\ProcessDeny\WriteDeny.aspx:128
   System.Web.UI.Control.RenderChildren(HtmlTextWriter writer) +27
   System.Web.UI.Control.Render(HtmlTextWriter writer) +7
   System.Web.UI.Control.RenderControl(HtmlTextWriter writer) +243

What this does is denys access to the link (script) your trying to get into, meaning this one is passwd.txt via the wwwboard.

you will need to create a /processdeny script which ain't that hard, but I may be wrong just look into it.
