Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 02.08.05: IBM AIX auditselect Local Format String Vulnerability


IBM AIX auditselect Local Format String Vulnerability 

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 02.08.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=193&type=vulnerabilities
February 08, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

The auditselect program is a setuid root application, installed by 
default under multiple versions of IBM AIX, that selects audit records 
for analysis according to defined criteria. 

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a format string vulnerability in the auditselect 
command included by default in multiple versions of IBM Corp.'s AIX 
operating system could allow for arbitrary code execution as the root 
user. 

The vulnerability specifically exists due to an improperly used 
formatted printing function. When provided with an incorrect argument 
(argv[1]) that contains a format string, the format string will be fed 
into a formatted printing function, and the user supplied format string 
will be evaluated, allowing for a malicious user to examine stack memory

and write to arbitrary memory locations. With a properly crafted string,

this can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

This vulnerability can only be exploited by a local user who has been 
granted access to the "audit" group. Successful exploitation leads to 
root-level access. 

Due to the nature of the vulnerability, information leakage is trivial 
and aids the attacker in exploitation.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in IBM AIX 
version 5.2. It is suspected that previous versions are also vulnerable.

IBM has reported that AIX 5.3 is also vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Only allow trusted users local access to security critical systems. Only

allow trusted system administrators access to the "audit" group. 
Alternately, remove the setuid bit from auditselect using chmod u-s 
/usr/sbin/auditselect. 

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor has not released a patch for this issue, however, the
