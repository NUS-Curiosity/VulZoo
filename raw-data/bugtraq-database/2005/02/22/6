Note that, on the arkeia user list, somebody pointed out that clients
can be configured to disallow this from anybody but the server. But that's
not the default configuration, the default is "plug and play", that is, you
throw the software on the client and it works.

The relevant section is Appendix B of the user manual. It tells you how
to setup your client with the equivalent of tcp_wrapper security.

Even then, you still have a small vulnerability, in that anyone who
has access to the server system can still impersonate the arkeia software
to access the client. But you can't do that from any random machine.
