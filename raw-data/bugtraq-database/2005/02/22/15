Subject: The WebConnect 6.4.4 and 6.5 contains several vulnerabilities


The WebConnect 6.4.4 and 6.5 contains several vulnerabilities such as: 
 - Denial of Service when requesting an DOS Device in Path Name 
 - Reading of files outside webroot (Directory traversal)

Requesting "DOS Device in Path Name" Denial of Service
When requesting a DOS device in the URL the server will stop responding 
to any further requests before a manual restart of service has been made. 
This attack can be preformed on both the client website and the 
administration interface. 

Vulnerable versions: 
 - WebConnect 6.4.4 (Possible previous versions) 
 - WebConnect 6.5 
 
CERT response: 
 - VU#552561 CAN-2004-0466 

 
Reading of files outside webroot (Directory traversal) 
When sending a specially crafted request to the server it is possible to 
read files outside the webroot. Since the service as default runs with 
system rights, this could give access to the entire partition that
WebConnect 
are installed on. 

Vulnerable versions:
 - WebConnect 6.4.4 (Possible previous versions) 

CERT response: 
 - VU#628411 CAN-2004-0465
