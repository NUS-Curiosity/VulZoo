                Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated sox packages fix buffer overflows
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1945
Issue date:        2005-02-20
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1945
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0557
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated sox packages that fix buffer overflows in the WAV file handling
code are now available.

SoX (Sound eXchange) is a sound file format converter. SoX can convert
between many different digitized sound formats and perform simple sound
manipulation functions, including sound effects.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Buffer overflows existed in the parsing of WAV file header fields. It
was possible that a malicious WAV file could have caused arbitrary code
to be executed when the file was played or converted. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0557 to these issues.

All users of sox should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
a security patch to resolve these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
