I tried this and got the message on admin.php initially.  Subsequent
attempts return search results normally so it looks like Google will let it
through after you try it enough times.  It's likely they implemented this
because of the press surrounding the most recent phpBB exploit.  Several of
the news items covering the worm mentioned its use of google to find more
vulnerable sites.  While this isn't a new concept (using a search engine to
find vulnerable sites) it's likely Google wanted to avoid being perceived as
an attack vector.

Hi,

I noticed today that a simple search in Google using
inurl causes Google to display this message when you
try to access the second page:

===================================================

We're sorry...
... but we can't process your request right now. A
computer virus or spyware application is sending us
automated requests, and it appears that your computer
or network has been infected.

We'll restore your access as quickly as possible, so
try again soon. In the meantime, you might want to run
a virus checker or spyware remover to make sure that
your computer is free of viruses and other spurious
software.

We apologize for the inconvenience, and hope we'll see
you again on Google.

==================================================

No, i do not have a virus or spyware, tested that
already ;)

This as been attempted from multiple Internet
connections.

Basicly, any name that as an  entry in Google and ends
with "php" will cause this.

Ex: inurl:admin.php
    inurl:test.php
    inurl:whatever.php

I've tried it with cgi, html, asp, sh, pl and this
does not happen.

What will it be next ???

John
