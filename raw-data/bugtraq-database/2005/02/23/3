 Vulnerable: PBLang 4.65 (current) (and earlier?)  
  
  
 ---  
  
 General information:  
  
 PBLang is an international BBS-software based on 
PHP. It does not require any database but bases on a 
flatfile system. Many professional features. More 
info on the project website.

 Description:  
  
 When a user receives a PM with a HTML in the 
subject, it will be executed as soon as the user 
opens his pm.php. This may give an attacker the 
opportunity for a session steal. The link for the PM 
will not be linked, so viewing the contents of the 
message gets harder. An attacker could also flood a 
users PM box by sending messages with a title like 
&lt;script&gt;  
 and the PM will not appear in the receivers window, 
while it will say he/she has got a new PM.  
  
 ---  
  
 Proof Of Concept:  
  
 Type in the subject box "&lt;script 
language="javascript">alert("Hackerlounge.com pwns 
joo");&lt;/script&gt;" and submit. An alertbox with the 
text "Hackerlounge.com pwns joo" should come up when 
a user visits pm.php.

 Fix and Vendor status:  
  
Vendor has been notified, expect an official patch 
soon.
