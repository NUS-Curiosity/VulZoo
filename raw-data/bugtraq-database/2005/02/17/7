Subject: Re: AWStats <= 6.4 Multiple vulnerabilities - can't reproduce in 6.3?




	I'm going to have to disagree.  Execution of Perl functions
is still possible in 6.3.  You just have to jimmy it a little and 
try/guess different plugins that may be installed.  I got a hit
with 'hostinfo'.  Try this on your server:

http://server/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?config=someconfig&PluginMode=hostinfo+time 

	Unix time shows up just below 'Whois command failed' error message.  
That's game over in my book.
