Subject: RE: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer not seeing KB887742 and KB88 6185  Correction


>From http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-009.mspx
under the FAQ section:

"Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine
if this update is required?
MBSA will determine if this update is required for Windows Media Player.
MBSA will not determine if this update is required for Windows Messenger
or MSN Messenger. It will provide a note message to this effect. See
Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460 for information regarding note
messages in MBSA.

Microsoft has made available an Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) to
assist customers with the detection of needed security updates not
currently supported by MBSA.

For detailed information about the programs that MBSA currently does not
detect, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460"


Microsoft actually did a great job of recognizing the fact that the MBSA
doesn't detect flaws in Windows Messenger yet people still need to scan
and developing a tool for you to do so.  If you read the FAQ you could
be scanning your network right now instead of complaining about a known
limitation with the MBSA ;)

Ok....so it's actually KB887472 which was the other one....which is an
MSN Security Update.  Yea...MS needs to fix this ASAP for MBSA.

Subject: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer not seeing KB887742 and
KB88 6185


Subject line says it all....just did a fresh install of WinXP SP2....was
using MBSAFU to make sure it would patch...which it did.  However
Windows Update shows still needing KB887742 and KB886185.  MBSA shows no
critical patches need updated.  Systeminfo shows that both KB887742 and
KB886185 are NOT installed.  I'm using latest MBSA.  Anyone else see
this?  Kinda sucks :(
