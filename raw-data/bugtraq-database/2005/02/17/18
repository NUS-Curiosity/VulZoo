Subject: iDEFENSE Labs Website Launch


iDEFENSE Labs is pleased to announce the launch of our community site:

    http://labs.idefense.com

This site will serve as our repository for sharing our research and
development with the security community, including the release of free
software tools. Currently you can find the following at the site:

- News
A blog discussing current events such as upcoming speaking engagements,
the release of new tools, pending research and VCP reward winners.

- Public Advisories
Access to all current and historical public security advisories.

- Speaking Engagements
A list of upcoming and past speaking engagements, including an archive
of slides, white papers and related tools/code.

- Software
Free software tools designed to automate vulnerability research. Tools
are released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and we encourage
feedback and improvements from the open source community.

- VCP
The Vulnerability Contributor Program (VCP) has now been in existence
since 2002 and has grown tremendously since that time. The program is
designed to compensate security researchers for vulnerability
discoveries and to work with iDEFENSE Labs to further their research and
offload the burden of coordinating vendor/public disclosure.
Contributors have the option to remain anonymous or to be given full
credit for their findings. A listing of historical vulnerabilities is
available at:
