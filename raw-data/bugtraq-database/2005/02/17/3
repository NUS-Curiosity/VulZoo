	Correct. And the browser vendors gain trust because they only include
reputable CAs.

	How do you think you get the bundling?

	To put it another way, what would happen if a CA violated the trust? If the
vendors didn't immediately ship patches to remove the untrustworthy CA,
there would be a great oppurtunity for third parties to do so, and rest
assured they would. Immediately.

	This is no different than the case of Burger King buying inferior beef.
While it's true the beef vendor only has to convince Burger King to buy the
beef, not Burger King's customers, there wouldn't be any customers as soon
as they found out that Burger King was reselling food made from inferior
beef.

	This is just like any other indirect relationship. Buyers never want poor
quality raw materials because they result in poor quality finished goods.
