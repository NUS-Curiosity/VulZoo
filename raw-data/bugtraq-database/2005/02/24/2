Thanks for the reply.  As an added note, Slashdot has also picked up the

Doug Muth writes "According to this article over on DSL Reports, yet 
another spyware author, iDownload, has been sending out cease and desist 
letters to sites that classify their iSearch toolbar as Spyware. Some

A search on Spyware Guide also turns up a writeup on iSearch."
