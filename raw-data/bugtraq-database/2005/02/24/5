---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated zlib package fixes security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:2043
Issue date:        2005-02-23
Product:           Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=2043
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0797
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated zlib package that fixes a security flaw is now available.

Zlib is a general-purpose, patent-free, lossless data compression
library which is used by many different programs.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Johan Thelmen reported that a specially crafted file can cause a
segmentation fault in zlib as the inflate() and inflateBack() functions
do not properly handle errors. An attacker could construct a carefully
crafted file that could cause a crash or possibly execute arbitrary code
when opened. The specific impact depends on the application using zlib.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0797 to this issue.

Users of zlib are advised to upgrade to this errata package, which
contains a backported patch correcting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
