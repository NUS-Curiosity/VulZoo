Security Advisory: SQL injection and path disclosure in EveryDNS.net service

Discovered by: Calum Power [Enune]
Versions Affected: <= 24/01/2005
Unaffected versions: > 25/01/2005

Product Description:
EveryDNS.net is a free, online DNS service. From vendor website:
"We provide static DNS services as well as many advanced services such as
Dynamic DNS resolution, Secondary service,
AXFR service, and domain2web redirection."

Summary:
* SQL Injection vulnerability may lead to viewing of secure information,
including access to private DNS accounts.
* Path disclosure provides privileged information to potentially malicious
users, which could be used in an attack.

Details:
The main EveryDNS website script, 'index.php' has a blue login form in the
bottom left corner of the page.
All data in this form is sanitized, except for the 'username' field. When
unexpected characters, such as single-quotation
marks are submitted using this field, a SQL error may occur, disclosing
the location of the EveryDNS.net scripts on their
webserver.

Additionally, due to the unfiltered nature of this form field, a malicious
user may be able to manipulate the database
query into providing them with access and/or information they would not
otherwise be authorized to see.


Impact: Critical
This vulnerability could lead to the compromise of private DNS accounts,
including records and zone information.
If a malicious user was to gain access to a private account, he/she would
be able to 'hijack' the domain via the redirection
of the domain records to an internet server under their control.

Credit:
This vulnerability was discovered by Calum Power [Enune] on the 24th day
of January 2005. The vendor was subsequently
notified and the hole fixed within 24-hours. Calum would like to thank
David Ulevitch for his prompt response to this
advisory, and commends the EveryDNS service on it's great service to the
internet community.
