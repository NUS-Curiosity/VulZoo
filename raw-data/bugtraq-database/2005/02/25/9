CALL FOR PAPERS

WORM 2005 - The 3rd Workshop on Rapid Malcode (WORM)
Fairfax, VA, USA, November 11th, 2005 in conjunction with ACM CCS
Submissions due June 23rd, 2005

http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~angelos/worm05/

In the last several years, Internet-wide infectious epidemics have
emerged as one of the leading threats to information security and
service availability. The vehicles for these outbreaks, malicious codes
called "worms", take advantage of the combination of software
monocultures and the uncontrolled Internet communication model to
quickly compromise large numbers of hosts. Such worms are increasingly
being used as delivery mechanisms for various types of malicious
payloads, including remote-controlled "zombies", spyware and
botnets. Recent incidents have also reveals the use of new propagation
techniques as well as the use of worms to target small user communities
or specific applications. Current operational practices have not been
able to manage these threats effectively.

This workshop continues the efforts of the previous years to provide a
forum to bring together ideas, understanding and experiences bearing on
the worm problem from a wide range of communities, including academia,
industry and the government.  We are soliciting papers from researchers
and practitioners on subjects including, but not limited to:

	Automatic detection and characterization
	Reactive countermeasures
	Proactive defenses
	Threat assessment
	Email and web-based malcode
	Measurement studies
	Testbeds & evaluation
	Reverse engineering
	Significant operational experiences
	Surveys of the field
	Analysis of worm construction, current & future
	Modeling and analysis of propagation dynamics
	Forensic methods of attribution
	The combination of different types of malware

Important Dates:
	Paper submissions due:		June 23rd, 2005
	Acceptance notifications:	August 14th, 2005
	Camera ready date:		August 28th, 2005
