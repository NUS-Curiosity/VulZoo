Subject: Re: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 02.25.05: WU-FTPD File Globbing Denial
 of Service Vulnerability


Okay this is getting really old.

This is a problem with almost any service that allows multiple
wild-card characters.  UW-IMAPD is another example where this
type of exploit works and has been discussed in great detail
in the past.  The only difference here is that the ftpd doesn't
allow a compile time limit to the number of wildcards.

The attack specifically requires that the ftproot has a rather
large directory structure or else the wildcards are parsed
quickly (I.E. the ftp server must be huge).  If this is the case
than you shouldn't be allowing wildcards AT ALL, regardless of
what kind of service it is.  Aside from that who the hell uses
wu-ftpd for large sites anymore?  It's performance without
wildcards is pretty dismal to start with.
