That's not an improvement. If you can fiddle data so that the inner hash
has the same value as before the fiddling, the outer hash remains the
same as well -- doesn't give you anything except a false sense of
security. Kent's idea was better in that you would have to find common
collisions in both algorithms in order to keep both hashes.
