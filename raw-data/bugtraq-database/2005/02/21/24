In essence, if you encrypt something, and destroy the key, you destroy
the data.  At least, the point of encrypting something is so that it
"can't" (reasonably) be accessed without the key (or a 4096 qubit
computer) (in the life of the universe).  There's no point to cyphering
something if it can be retrieved without the key in some interval which
ends within the period that the data is supposed to remain secret.

Because of this, I consider encryption to be a physical barrier.  You
can get the disk, you can use another OS on it, you can hardware hack
the machine, you can take it apart, you can do a MFM examination, splice
it in a chemical vat, spectral analyze it, put it in a tractor beam and
try to extract the data that way, fire phasers at it, whatever, you
don't get to the data without the key.

(note too that a lock is a physical barrier; but a good sledgehammer
will shatter the mechanism if it's bigger than the lock)
