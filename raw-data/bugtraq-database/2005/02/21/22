The data remains encrypted, until the key is known. So only the key needs to
be distributed. Keywords: Reed-Solomon, FEC, Vandermonde matrices, PAR2.
Extra requirement is, that you don't want 90% of the key known when M=10 and 9
key-secrets are collected, so you need an extra 'layer'.

A change of 1 bit in one 'layer' should change in average 50% of the bits in
the next 'layer', because basically you want each key-bit to remain unknown
(and unguessable) until (at least) M secrets are known.
