It's somewhat harsh to single out ClamAV for this issue. AFAICT, the
only two virus scanners that do currently protect against this are
ClamAV and AntiVir.

According to current testing, all the others, including:

AVG
Avast
BitDefender
DrWeb
eTrust-Iris
eTrust-Vet
F-Prot
F-Secure
Kaspersky
mks_vir
NOD32
Norman Virus Control
Panda8
Sophos
Sybari
Symantec

do not offer protection against this issue. If anyone sees any errors in
the list above, please let me know
