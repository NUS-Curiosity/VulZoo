Subject: Mozilla Firefox 1.0.1 Javascript Images are Draggable




Author: Paul
Affected Software: Mozilla Firefox 1.0.0, 1.0.1 (tested only on these versions)
Risk: Low/Medium

A minor security vulnerability exists in the way that Firefox handles cross-domain image dragging. Dragging an image into the address bar will cause Firefox to navigate to the image url even if it is a javascript url and the page to be navigated from is in a different domain than the page on which the image is shown. This may potentially allow attackers to steal cookies, etc.

A proof of concept is available at

Vendor Reccomendations: 
Disable dragging images with javascript urls.

User Reccomendations:
Do not drag images into the address bar.
