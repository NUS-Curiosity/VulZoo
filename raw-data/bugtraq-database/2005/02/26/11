 	Considering that Microsoft is a multi-billion dollar corporation, 
I cannot agree that it deserves any slack.  If Microsoft can afford to 
sell software that leaves its customers at risk, it can afford to issue 
hotfixes to remedy the problems that it created.  And I don't buy into the 
"get the Service Pack" argument after having dealt with the ridiculously 
FUBAR'd mess called SP2 for XP that went down last year.

 	Bottom line: Microsoft customers are paying gourmet prices for 
Redmond's products and are getting McDonald's quality for security.
