You believe that Microsoft should release a hotfix for this vulnerability, although a service pack allegedly fixes it. This does not make sense to me and only seems like an attempt by you to bash Microsoft and make yourself look "powerful". Service packs are released to fix large quantities of vulnerabilities such as this one and releasing hotfixes for each individual vulnerability fixed by a service pack would require large sums of money and time. Seriously, people, cut Microsoft some slack. They're doing the best they can.
