Subject: Patch available for high risk IBM DB2 Universal Database flaw



-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Researchers at NGSSoftware have discovered a high risk vulnerability
in IBM's DB2 Universal Database Version 8.1 and earlier.

IBM has just released Fixpak 8 for DB2 UDB 8.1 which addresses the
security flaw

http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/support/downloadv8.html


NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about this flaw for three
months. Full details will be published on the 9th of May 2005. At
that time an updated advisory will be published at 

http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/db2-09-05-05.htm

No updated advisory will be posted to the security mailing lists.


This three month window will allow DB2 database administrators the
time needed to test and apply the Fixpak before the details are
released to the general public. This reflects NGSSoftware's new
approach to responsible disclosure.

NGSSQuirreL for DB2, NGSSoftware's advanced vulnerability assessment
scanner and security manager for IBM DB2, has been updated to check
for and positively identify this flaw in DB2 database servers on the
network. More information about NGSSQuirreL for DB2 can be found at
