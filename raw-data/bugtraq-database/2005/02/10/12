The actual nature of this flaw was a bug that resulted in memory
exhaustion.  What you uncovered was a DoS that didn't actually affect
the security of the system, only the availability.  We'd like to
stress that this didn't affect our users as the resulting behavior
merely delays email.  Since we fixed the bug quickly, this didn't
happen.

We do read external communications sent to us and are greatly
appreciative of any and all reports we receive.  As for communicating
with others I would hope that recent press articles would alleviate
the misconception that we do not work with others.  We even post to
our company blog (http://www.google.com/googleblog/) about various
incidents as necessary.  So I am sadly disappointed that you were
under the impression we wouldn't take action on your report.

Just so that everyone knows, we have an official external email address 
for reports of this kind: security@...gle.com

Gmail is a Beta product and we are still working out the kinks!
