III.  Solutions
===============

A. Official Fix

IBM provides the following fixes:

      APAR number for AIX 5.1.0: IY67741 (available approx. 03/23/05)
      APAR number for AIX 5.2.0: IY67455 (available approx. 04/15/05)

the chdev command. This can be done by executing the following command as
root:

# chmod 500 /usr/sbin/chdev

Verify that the file mode bits have been changed to 500:

# ls -la /usr/sbin/chdev
- -r-x------  1 root system 22238 2003-05-02 01:19 /usr/sbin/chdev
