Subject: Re: International Domain Name [IDN] support in modern browsers
 allows    attackers to spoof domain name URLs + SSL certs.


I tested the following browsers against the proof of concept page
(www.shmoo.com/idn):

  - dillo (0.8.3)
  - lynx (2.8.5)
  - konqueror (3.3)

Testing was done on Linux 2.6.9 (generic)

Dillo and lynx handle the links well (dillo returns a DNS error and lynx
reports an invalid URL).  Konqueror opens the non-SSL link and displays
the URL as "http://www.paypal.com/".  For the SSL page, Konqueror provides
a warning that the IP address does not match the issuer domain. If the
user accepts the certificate, the page is presented showing the URL as
"https//www.paypal.com".
