Judging rightness of domain names is not a job of X.509 CA, and never was.

The job of the organization is to check whether the one applying for the
certificate is the rightful owner of the domain, and that's all that is
included in the protocol trust and threat model.

Not to mention that it would damage the revenue stream and make the CA prone
to litigation.

X.509/TLS is not for assuring if the server you are connected to is lawful.
