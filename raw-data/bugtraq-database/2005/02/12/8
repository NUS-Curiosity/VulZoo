                 Mandrakelinux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           cpio
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2005:032-1
 Date:                   February 11th, 2005
 Original Advisory Date: February 10th, 2005
 Affected versions:	 10.1
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability in cpio was discovered where cpio would create world-
 writeable files when used in -o/--create mode and giving an output
 file (with -O).  This would allow any user to modify the created cpio
 archive.  The updated packages have been patched so that cpio now
 respects the current umask setting of the user.
  
Update:

 The updated cpio packages for 10.1, while they would install with
 urpmi on the commandline, would not install via rpmdrake.  The updated
 packages correct that.
