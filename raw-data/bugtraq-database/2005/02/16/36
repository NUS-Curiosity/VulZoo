Actually, the number of people who are aware of the functioning and 
usage of certificates is very important to the web of trust and, as 
such, the business model.  The "trustworthiness" of the CA is only 
affected if enough people refuse to accept their certificates.

No - implying that my logic implies anything itself implies that I made 
a recommendation against certification.  I did no such thing. 

The CAs have many uses and the way that they are used right now is 
good.  However, the question is whether you can trust them to moderate 
IDN or any other site as trusted authorities.

My proposition is that the argument that they (and their associated webs 
of trust) are inherently trustworthy because of external pressures is a 
flawed assumption because they do not have the proposed level of 
pressure applied to them since most of the people affected by their web 
of trust don't understand it.

Until the average person can read and understand certs, my point stands.
