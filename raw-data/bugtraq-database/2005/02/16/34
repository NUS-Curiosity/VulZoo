Simple:  relative physical location.

The local BBB is accountable to local laws.  CAs are spread throughout 
the world and are global in nature.  As a member of a local community, I 
can choose to familiarize myself with those regulations, understand 
them, and use them against the BBB if they violate their trust.  I can 
also choose to go on a crusade against the local BBB.

Listen, I'm sure that you have a bone to pick with the BBB and I have no 
quarrel with that.  My point isn't that the BBB is a reputable, great 
organization (I don't really believe that it is).  My point is that the 
CAs aren't trustworthy in that way and are even less trustworthy in my 
view than the BBB.

I think that deep down we're agreeing on the point that they're 
inherently untrustworthy.  My point in saying "if you take my meaning" 
was to hi-light that rather than focus on this relatively minor 
nitpicking of point.  I'm not the first one in this thread to bring up 
the BBB.  So take your point up with the person who did bring it up, please.
