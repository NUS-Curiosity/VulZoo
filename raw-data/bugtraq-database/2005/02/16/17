Actually, the KB article is incorrect.  Only other users from the same 
dial-up ISP given IP's considered in the same "local" subnet would be able 
to have NBT traffic considered local and thus pass through the firewall.  It 
is not "anyone on the Internet" as the KB states.  They would still need a 
username and password to access the resource.  Additionally, one should note 
that on non-domain member systems, administrators would have to explicitly 
allow FPS exceptions after the fact for this to be an issue in the first 
place, and even so, only after going in and manually binding FPS to the 
dial-up interface which is disabled by default.  You really have to go 
around your gluteus maximus to present this as an issue.  So, IMO, it is not 
a major security hole.

The Invalid_Process_Attach_Attempt bug does not have security implications, 
though in particular configurations a DOS does condition exists.  DOS != 
security vulnerability in this case.

But, not withstanding the above caveats, I agree with you that 886185 is 
still a potential security issue, and for that reason, should be checked by 
MBSA.
