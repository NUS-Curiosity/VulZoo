Ermmmmmm.  Well, yes and no.  CAs publish CPSs (Certification Practice 
Statements).  The purpose of the CPS is to provide:  a) and auditable 
statement of what the CA does when it certifies a public key at a given 
level.  If one doesn't like what one sees in the CPS, one doesn't need 
to accept keys certified by that CA.  It is up to the relying party (the 
entity which needs to decide whether or not to accept a key) to read the 
CA's CPS(s).  The problem with PKIs is that 99.99999% of the people who 
use public key cryptography are absolutely clueless when it comes to 
understanding the technology, its applications or how to use it. 
*/Theoretically/* CAs have *real* liabilities.  BBBs don't.  Having said 
that, after reading the fine print in the CPSs, most disclaim things to 
such a point that nailing them for anything real would not be worth the 
effort . . .
