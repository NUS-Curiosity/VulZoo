[NORTHSHOREINTERNET.COM.AU: #1] amihotornot.com.au vulnerability

Hello All,

This is my first post to bugtraq, Hope its worthwhile.

A bug has been found in the amihotornot.com.au gallery that lets a
registered user
modify other members gallery photo's.

Vulnerable Site: http://www.amihotornot.com.au


+-[Example:]----------------------------------------------------+

For this to work, you have to be a member yourself, membership
is free.

http://www.amihotornot.com.au/album/create_pictures.asp?gid=1111

Where 1111 is the ID of the member.

All members recorded by amihotornot are assigned an auto-incrementing
identifier, This makes it easy to guess an entire range of valid members
ID's.


+-[Notes:]------------------------------------------------------+
