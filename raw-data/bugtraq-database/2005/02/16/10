Actually Steven's example is supposed to be:
http://cgi4.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=RedirectToDomain&DomainUrl=http://www.website.com 

note the http:// prefix following the RedirectToDomain&DomainUrl=

As of Tuesday Feb 15 7am PST it still works (both examples).

PS Steven, For the "Place or Update Credit Card on File" page, post-login it states for the user to "Sing Out", you may want to change it to "Sign Out".

I just tried this with my own URL, and eBay didn't forward me to some 
other site. Perhaps they've plugged this already?
