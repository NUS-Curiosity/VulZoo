Subject: XSS in MySpace.com RuWeb.net and Primus.com




I keep seeing more people submitting XSS vulns on particular sites so I decided to submit the ones I'd found.

MySpace.com:

XSS exists in MySpace search fields.  Some fields are protected but the profiles search field is not. query: ">;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;

RuWeb.net:

XSS exists in searching for unused domain names. query: ">;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;

Primus.com:

XSS exists in the logon to the Customer Care Center.  It is limited by the 20 char limit ;].  username: ">;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;

Consequences of this type of vulnerability could lead to session cookie theft.  There are a few techniques in wich XSS vulnerabilities like this can be exploited, such as convincing a user to click on a malicious link or sending out massemails that load malicious iframes to steal said users cookies.

Vendors were notified no response recieved.
