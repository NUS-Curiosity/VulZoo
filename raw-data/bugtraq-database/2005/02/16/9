Ok....so it's actually KB887472 which was the other one....which is an MSN
Security Update.  Yea...MS needs to fix this ASAP for MBSA.

KB88 6185


Subject line says it all....just did a fresh install of WinXP SP2....was
using MBSAFU to make sure it would patch...which it did.  However Windows
Update shows still needing KB887742 and KB886185.  MBSA shows no critical
patches need updated.  Systeminfo shows that both KB887742 and KB886185 are
NOT installed.  I'm using latest MBSA.  Anyone else see this?  Kinda sucks
:(
