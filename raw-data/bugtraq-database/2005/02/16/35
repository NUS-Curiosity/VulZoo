Actually I'm just trying to be explicitly clear about the path that
you're using for trust.  The BBB just happens to be the example that
you'd used as an organization that you'd trust more than your average CA.

As I'm reading you, you're saying that you:

 	(1) trust establishments that you can see and touch more
 		than you trust establishments that you can't see or touch.

 	(2) trust establishments that are bound by a legal system that
 		you're familiar with more than establishments that are bound
 		by a legal system that you aren't familiar with.

IMHO the question is more about what your particular grounds for trust
happen to be than whether CAs are all/partially/not trustworthy - or
if the BBB in your area happens to be trustworthy.

Personally I'd really debate the concept that physical proximity is 
in any respect grounds for trust - and that familiarity implies the same.

I'd be far more inclined to suggest using consistent long term behaviour
as a predictor - and implementing a system where significant incentives 
towards desired behaviour exist.

cheers!
