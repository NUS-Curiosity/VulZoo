Subject:		UnixWare 7.1.3 UnixWare 7.1.1 : Vulnerabilities in long-lived TCP connections / Rose attack
Advisory number: 	SCOSA-2005.14
Issue date: 		2005 February 07
Cross reference:	sr890247 fz529384 erg712598 sr890286 fz529414 erg712605

1. Problem Description

	TCP, when using a large Window Size, makes it easier for
	remote attackers to guess sequence numbers and cause a
	denial of service (connection loss) to persistent TCP
	connections by repeatedly injecting a TCP RST packet,
	especially in protocols that use long-lived connections,
	such as BGP. 

	Reference : NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 236929
	Reference : CERT Technical Cyber Security Alert TA04-111A

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-0230 to this issue.
