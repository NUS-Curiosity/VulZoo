Subject:		UnixWare 7.1.4 : racoon multilple security issues
Advisory number: 	SCOSA-2005.10
Issue date: 		2005 February 07
Cross reference:	sr890909 fz529836 erg712650 CAN-2004-0155 CAN-2004-0164 CAN-2004-0392 CAN-2004-0403 CAN-2004-0607

1. Problem Description

	Racoon is the daemon which negotiates and configures a set
	of parameters of IPsec. Several security issues are addressed
	with this patch. 

	The KAME IKE Daemon Racoon, when authenticating a peer during 
	Phase 1, validates the X.509 certificate but does not verify 
	the RSA signature authentication, which allows remote attackers 
	to establish unauthorized IP connections or conduct 
	man-in-the-middle attacks using a valid, trusted X.509 
	certificate. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-0155 to this issue. 

	KAME IKE daemon (racoon) does not properly handle hash values, 
	which allows remote attackers to delete certificates via a 
	certain delete message that is not properly handled in isakmp.c 
	or isakmp_inf.c, or a certain INITIAL-CONTACT message that
	is not properly handled in isakmp_inf.c. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned th e name CAN-2004-0164 to this issue. 

	racoon before 20040407b allows remote attackers to cause a denial 
	of service (infinite loop and dropped connections) via an IKE 
	message with a malformed Generic Payload Header containing 
	invalid "Security Association Next Payload" and "RESERVED" fields. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned th e name CAN-2004-0392 to this issue. 

	Racoon before 20040408a allows remote attackers to cause a denial 
	of service (memory consumption) via an ISAKMP packet with a large 
	length field. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned th e name CAN-2004-0403 to this issue. 

	The eay_check_x509cert function in KAME Racoon successfully
	verifies certificates even when OpenSSL validation fails,
	which could allow remote attackers to bypass authentication.

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-0607 to this issue.
