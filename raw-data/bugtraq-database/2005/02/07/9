Subject: New version of ike-scan (IPsec IKE scanner) available - v1.7


ike-scan v1.7 has been released.  The new version is available at 
http://www.nta-monitor.com/ike-scan/

The key changes from the previous version (v1.6) are:

a) new psk-crack program to crack IKE Aggressive Mode pre-shared keys using 
either dictionary or brute-force methods.
The new --pskcrack (-P) ike-scan option outputs the psk parameters to a 
file or stdout for cracking with psk-crack.

b) Support for IKE over TCP.
Two variants are supported: raw IKE over TCP as used by Checkpoint VPN-1, 
and encapsulated IKE over TCP as used by Cisco VPN Concentrator.

c) New --random (-R) option to randomise the target list.

d) The identity payload for aggressive mode may be specified as either a 
string or hex (previously, it could only be specified as hex).

e) Ability to use the OpenSSL MD5 and SHA1 hash functions.
This is enabled with the --with-openssl option to ./configure.
The OpenSSL hash functions are generally faster than the ike-scan built-in 
functions, which is useful for pre-shared key cracking.

f) Many more backoff fingerprints and vendor ID patterns added.

g) Tested on many new platforms. Too many to mention them all, but 
significant ones are MacOS X, HP-UX and SCO Openserver.

For full details of the changes, please read the ChangeLog and NEWS files 
in the tarball.
For usage notes, please read the README and README-WIN32 files in the tarball.
