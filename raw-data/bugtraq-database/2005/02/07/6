Subject: Fireflashing [Firefox 1.0]


__Summary

Using plugins like Flash and the -moz-opacity filter it is possible to 
display the about:config site in a hidden frame or a new window.

By making the user double-click at a specific screen position (e.g. using a 
DHTML game) you can silently toggle the status of boolean config parameters.

As long as the number of about:config parameters is unchanged (unlikely a 
casual user will change them) you can move the parameter you want to the 
specified screen position by using CSS.

You can also load about:config using the real player plugin and merged url 
events. See the real producer documentation for details and merge a command 
like "u 0:0:0:0.0 0:0:0:30.0 &&targetframe&&about:config"
