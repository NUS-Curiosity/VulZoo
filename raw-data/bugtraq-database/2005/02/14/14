Advisory: Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability in Openconf Conference  
Management Software

A group of students at our lab called RedTeam found a cross site  
scripting vulnerability in openconf which
results in possible session takeover.

Details
=======

Product: openconf
Affected Version: 1.04, probably also older versions
Immune Version: 1.10 (unverified)
OS affected: all
Security-Risk: high
Remote-Exploit: yes
Vendor-URL: http://www.openconf.org

Advisory-URL:
http://tsyklon.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/redteam/advisories/rt-sa-2005 
-007
Advisory-Status: public
CVE: CAN-2005-0407

Introduction
============

Openconf is a php/mysql based conference management system. Authors can
submit papers and the conference organisers can review these.

Cross site scripting is possible because the user input is not
filtered. Through this the session of a user with higher privileges can
be taken over.

More Details
============

Inputs from an anonymous author submitting a paper can contain script
code. This code will be executed when another user reviews this paper.

Proof of Concept
================

Submit a paper and enter "title <script>alert('evil');</script>" as
title. The script will be executed when the admin "chair" reviews this
paper.

Workaround
==========

None known.

Fix
===

Update to 1.10 (unverified).

Security Risk
=============

High. Conferences managed by openconf could be arbitrarily influenced.
