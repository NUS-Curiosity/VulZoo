Wow.  You just conceded that there is significant pressure on major 
vendors to not counter the CA, and then claimed that some ethereal other 
would magically be able to enforce it where Symantec couldn't.

Market demand sometimes does create solutions, however to claim that it 
does without fail is a bit naive.

So, if not Symantec, then who else do you propose would?

History disagrees with you.  So do a number of economists.

It would harm them, yes, but they very well can get away with it.

It's interesting how you cite market dynamics in your arguments, but 
disregard them when they aren't favorable to your point.

If hundreds of thousands of sites use a particular CA as their root, 
then removing the CA trust from the browser will cause an annoyance for 
the browser consumer, resulting in 1 of 2 possible outcomes:

1) People learn to modify their configs and setup the CA as trusted.

2) People move to browsers that trust that CA by default.

The only way that a CA can lose the trust of the browser users is if the 
browser users understand how the CAs work and understand how to put 
pressure on the browser market to achieve that end result.

Again, we get back to the fact that most end users (browser market 
customers) can barely turn on their PCs, nevermind understand or care 
about CA trust relationships.  You have to put yourself into that 
position and think like they do before you should ever propose a 
pie-in-the-sky market solution to something like this.

There are millions of people out there who don't trust the MPAA or the 
RIAA, for that matter.  Not having the trust of the people hasn't 
stopped them.  Again, you've chosen a very poor example.

The market does not inherently protect people.  Anyone who believes that 
is reality impaired and doesn't have a very good understanding of 
history nor economics.
