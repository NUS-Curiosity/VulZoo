Simple.  If a major CA root is revoked, a large number of major sites 
will all start displaying browser warnings which will be an annoyance to 
the user, causing at least a decent percentage of them to question why 
they are getting a constantly recurring pop-up whenever they go to a 
large number of sites.

Users are only interested (and not always so, but often) in things that 
pop up in front of their faces and annoy them. 

The user wasn't aware of the CA before (since a root CA being 
automatically accepted by a browser will result in no warning message 
for the user on sites that use certs supplied by the CA) but  are aware 
that something is up (and annoying) after (if) they update their browser.

So, no - it's neither specious nor is it confusing.  It just requires 
some common sense and actual exposure to the user population.  Something 
which some people here seem to be lacking.

David is the one who used the term sales - bring it up with him.  Yeah, 
pretty simple stuff - which is why I disagreed with it.

Who said anything about not-for-profit?

Suffice it to say that I'm involved in maintaining one for a very large 
corportation. 

Frankly, I could care less how you prioritize what I say.  You clearly 
have your own opinions on the matter, I personally feel that they don't 
take into account factors that are important.

You talk about browsers revoking trust in CAs as if it has no impact on 
the end user.

You talk as if it's a simple proposition for Microsoft or any other 
browser manufacturer to revoke a CA trust.

I'm saying that it's not, and that the browsers have to consider the 
affects on their customers.  I'm also saying that corporations, in this 
case, don't always make the secure decision, but rather the decision 
that gives the user the greatest amount of likelihood of using their 
product.

If you disagree with this concept, I say that you're wrong.

It is a simple concept, yet you are continuing to disagree with it.

I'm sorry if you don't feel like you can learn anything from me, but I'm 
not here to teach you.  I'm simply saying that you are not taking all of 
the factors into account.  Feel free to disagree with that, but you'd 
still be wrong.

The CA and browser markets do not exist in a vacuum.
