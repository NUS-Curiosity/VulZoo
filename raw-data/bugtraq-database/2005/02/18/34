Hey all,

we might think of changing the requirement of collision resistance
to "collision resistance in input data that is valid ASCII text". The
attacks on MD5 used the weak avalanche of the highest-order bit
in 32-bit words for producing the collision, basically precluding the
possibility of generating colliding ASCII text.
