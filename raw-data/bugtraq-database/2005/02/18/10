Hmmm...  I'm confused now... You just said in your last post that average 
users don't want, need, or know how certificates work, and how your previous 
(and specious) point stood because of that fact.  Yet here, you state that 
enough of a backlash from these users exists to keep a global entity like 
Symantec from taking action should they revoke a trusted CA from a users' 
certificate store even though the user (according to you) didn't know they 
trusted in the first place.   Explain that.

David was not comparing accountability to sales.  He compared trust to 
trust.  Pretty simple stuff.

Excellent point.  I retort by saying that I have a stamp collection of New 
Zealand butterflies.

Um, *you* made those assumptions.  And I agree: they are wrong.

I acquiesce.  I failed to take into account the multi-national 
not-for-profit CA's out there making a killing by scooping up the free 
end-user business that you claim does not exist in the first place.

No Barry, we just understand that the market corrects itself in these 
matters.  That's how the market works.  Once upon a time, there was no such 
thing as a certificate.  Now it is a billion dollar biz.  It has nothing to 
do with the BBB or who you think is the average user.  I deploy and maintain 
an extensive PKI infrastructure for my company as I do for many of my 
clients.  I'm happy to engage in further dialog regarding this subject so 
that I may have the opportunity to learn something, but before I do so, I'd 
like to get a glimpse into the vast PKI infrastructure you maintain so that 
I may prioritize your input.   Please describe your Cert/PKI infrastructure 
so that we may all benefit from your knowledge.
