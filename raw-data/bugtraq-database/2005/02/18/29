After reading your advisory I do agree it is a security issue, and is 
certainly worthy of reporting/posting.  However a HIGH impact? I just 
don't see it; at most they can read CGI scripts, and most of the time 
they can't even do that.  For example, I tested it on my OSX Apache 
server and my (perl) scripts were forbidden to read by default using the 
method mentioned("/path/to/file/..namedfork/data").

Sorry if this seems like a rant.
