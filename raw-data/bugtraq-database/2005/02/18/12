Quickly? When Verisign issued in 2001 a certificate for "Microsoft" to
somebody who simply said he was a Microsoft employee, and they didn't
do any check about the identity of the person, what happened?

Nothing. Except issuing a couple of "oops" certificate revocations.

I can't even find a public announce by Verisign stating they would take
actions to correct their own validation procedures and avoid repetition
of the incorrect (and for a public CA, inexcusable) behaviour. Everybody
here hopes they fixed their procedures... but no one even knows.

Obviously, CA can get away with it. They merely have to say "oops", and
4 years later, they're still in all browsers. Heck, they're still in mine:
if I remove their root CA, all I get for my vigilance is lots of popups
insisting that the site I'm visiting is "not trusted".

Probably.

But the market pressure isn't there in the case of CA. Because 99% of the
"users" of CAs do not even know that CA even exists. CAs are not selling
the trust of users. They're selling slots in popular browsers to web sites.
They're not saying "we're trusted by people", they say "we're trusted by
browser makers".
