Subject: Re: Mozilla Firefox "Host:" Buffer Overflow Exploit

Skylined, is there anything that you can't exploit? ;-)

On a side note, an article quoting Ferris saying that "Microsoft takes too long to patch stuff so that's why I'm going public" recently was slashdotted (regarding a vulnerability he found in Internet Explorer). Now he goes public with this thing. Does he think that Mozilla and Microsoft have the lengthy patch process in common, or is he just being hypocritical, something that I have found to be quite common among anti-MS zealots.

  (Just a little heads up, no details or PoC attached)

  The security vulnerability in Mozilla FireFox reported by Tom Ferris is exploitable on Windows.
  I developed a working exploit that seems to be 100% stable, though I've only tested it on one system.
  The exploit will not be released publicly untill patches are out.

  On a side note: it took only about 3 hours and 30 minutes to develop the exploit, so I might not be the only one able to write it.

  Cheers,
  SkyLined
