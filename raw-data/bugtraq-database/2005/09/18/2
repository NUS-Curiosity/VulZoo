Synopsis
========

Mozilla Suite and Firefox are vulnerable to a buffer overflow that
might be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that includes a
mail and news reader. Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation browser
from the Mozilla project. They both support Internationalized Domain
Names (IDN), which are domain names represented by local language
characters.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                         /   Vulnerable   /     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla-firefox          <= 1.0.6-r6       >= 1.0.6-r7
  2  www-client/mozilla                 <= 1.7.11-r2      >= 1.7.11-r3
  3  www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin      <= 1.0.6-r2       Vulnerable!
  4  www-client/mozilla-bin               <= 1.7.11        Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     4 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

The Mozilla Suite and Firefox are both vulnerable to a buffer overflow
while processing hostnames containing multiple hyphens. Note that
browsers that have disabled IDN support are immune to this flaw.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could setup a malicious site and entice a victim to
visit it, triggering the buffer overflow and potentially resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the victim's privileges.

Workaround
==========

You can disable the IDN support by opening the "about:config" page in
the browser and manually toggling the "network.IDN" property to
"false". Alternatively, you can install a security patch by following
the patching instructions given in References.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.6-r7"

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.11-r3"

There are no fixed Mozilla Firefox or Mozilla Suite binaries yet. Users
of the mozilla-bin or mozilla-firefox-bin packages should either switch
to the source-based versions or apply the workaround.
