Synopsis
========

Mantis is affected by an SQL injection and several cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

Mantis is a web-based bugtracking system written in PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/mantisbt      < 0.19.2                         >= 0.19.2

Description
===========

Mantis fails to properly sanitize untrusted input before using it. This
leads to an SQL injection and several cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities.

Impact
======

An attacker could possibly use the SQL injection vulnerability to
access or modify information from the Mantis database. Furthermore the
cross-site scripting issues give an attacker the ability to inject and
execute malicious script code or to steal cookie-based authentication
credentials, potentially compromising the victim's browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mantis users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/mantisbt-0.19.2"
