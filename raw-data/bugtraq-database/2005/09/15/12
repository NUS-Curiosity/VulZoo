Risk Level:
High. Remote attacker can execute code.

Summary:
vxTftpSrv is a simple, easy to use, Trivial File Transfer Protocol Server (TFTP) program which can be used to transfer files to and from routers, switches, hubs and other network devices. vxTftpSrv is typically used by Network Administrators to configure such equipment. Due to a improperly checked strcat call, it is possible to injection and execute code remotely via a buffer overflow.

Details:
When a long file name (>512 bytes) is sent to the tftp server, a strcat function overflows the stack. When the subroutine is complete, the Program Counter is loaded from the stack, which results in a crash or remote code execution depending on the contents of the injected file name. 

Workaround:
None

Vendor Response:
Waiting response.
