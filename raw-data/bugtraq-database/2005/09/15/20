Subject: Is netcraft publishing URL of your intranet sites?


Hello All,

Seems like netcraft is publishing URLs of the "IntrAnet" sites on
their "Most Visited Web Sites"  webpage. For e.g. see
http://toolbar.netcraft.com/stats/topsites?s=BC2835548233105D201D1B94E743#1440209

It has listed IBM's secure intranet site: <
https://w3esapp1.endicott.ibm.com > in the list, and also <
http://nindsplus.ninds.nih.gov > . Both of these are intranet sites. I
can list many others.

This provides attackers/hacker an easy way to collect hostnames of
your application servers that reside inside your firewall.

This goes against the Netcraft's policy of collecting information
about IntrAnet sites and publishing it on the internet. See "Will
Netcraft know which pages I visit?" @
http://toolbar.netcraft.com/help/faq/index.html#riskrating

Verify that your intranet sites are not listed on this website. If
they are contact Netcraft and complain.

P.S. This information is collected by netcraft's anti-phishing
toolbar. This is a good example of how a seemingly harmless browser
plugin can cause security issues.
