Subject: CastleCops ramps up fight against CoolWebSearch/HomeSearch


CastleCops keeps and maintains various databases on malware and legitimate 
items for browser helpers objects, toolbars, startups, services, and 
activex objects. 

Thanks to the collaboration of many Team CastleCops Expert members, CC is 
frequently among the first to indentify and analyze a new emerging pest, 
and hence to add information on its components to the various Lists. We 
were for example the first to spot and categorize a new BHO co-responsible 
for an all new version of SpySheriff/PsGuard/SmitFraud, one of the most 
insidious and prevalent pests around:

CastleCops is also in progress of entering all BHOs pertaining to the 
notorious CoolWebSearch/HomeSearch parasite variant to its CLSID database 
list. That information is used to power publicly accessible applications 
such as (in addition to researcher based utilities): 

BHODemon - http://www.definitivesolutions.com/bhodemon.htm
BHOList - http://merijn.org/downloads.html

The BHO database in its entirety is made available to the public here:
