               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated squirrelmail package fixes security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:163047
Issue date:        2005-09-14
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CAN-2005-1769 CAN-2005-2095
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated squirrelmail package that fixes two security issues is now
available.

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

A bug was found in the way SquirrelMail handled the $_POST variable. If
a user is tricked into visiting a malicious URL, the user's SquirrelMail
preferences could be read or modified. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project assigned the name CAN-2005-2095 to this issue.

Several cross-site scripting bugs were discovered in SquirrelMail. An
attacker could inject arbitrary Javascript or HTML content into
SquirrelMail pages by tricking a user into visiting a carefully crafted
URL, or by sending them a carefully constructed HTML email message. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name
CAN-2005-1769 to this issue.

All users of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches that resolve these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
