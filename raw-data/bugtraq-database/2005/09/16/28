Subject: Greyhats Security back online

It's been a while, but I have decided that because a lot of valuable information is hosted on greyhatsecurity.org, that it is within everyone's best interest to share the material.

Some things that have changed:
- The layout. The navigation system looks a lot cooler now (IMHO) and is easier to follow/more categorical.
- Bias is gone. No more criticism to either Microsoft nor Mozilla will be found on my website unless I deem it necissary for the progress of computer security.

You can find Greyhats Security at its old address, http://greyhatsecurity.org.

Kind regards,
Paul
