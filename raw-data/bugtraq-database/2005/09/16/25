Only the newest 7.x version 7.2 has an internal Mail client. Version 
8.0.3.3 is browser-only version. Version 7.2 has unpatched, confirmed 
vulnerabilities due to older codebase like we know. Version 8 was 
released to fix them.
Your report will never reach Netscape due to non-working security [at] 
netscape.org (please read instructions to contact the vendor below).
