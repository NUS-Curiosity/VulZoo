Subject: Web Application Security Analyzer for
	PHP-Nuke/phpBB CMS


With all the discussions surrounding the PHP-Nuke CMS wrapping phpBB2 as 
its forums, I've released an application called Analyzer (version 2.0) 
available from Download.com.

It checks the following versions and reports if newer versions exist:

mysql
php
apache
phpnuke
phpbb

It also checks certain settings in the php.ini file such as 
register_globals and provides the full path.

Also assists in debugging the installation of the application.

Available here:

The script itself is written in PHP.
