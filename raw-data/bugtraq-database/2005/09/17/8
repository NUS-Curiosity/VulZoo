If you read the code and original advisory, there is filtering already in 
place within the PHP-Nuke framework that monitors HTTP GETs.  As such, 
this 'exploit' makes of variables which should only be passed via HTTP 
GETs and not POSTs nor cookies.  

Proper data sanitization for this is simply to retrieve what is expected:

$name = $_GET['name'];

The function you specify like http://php.net/addslashes is neither here 
nor there.  Why use that function for a variable in POST or cookies when 
it is clearly expected to be returned via GET alone?

Ergo:

register_globals off !
