Synopsis
========

Squid contains several bugs when handling certain malformed requests
resulting in a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Squid is a full-featured Web proxy cache designed to run on Unix-like
systems. It supports proxying and caching of HTTP, FTP, and other
protocols, as well as SSL support, cache hierarchies, transparent
caching, access control lists and many more features.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-proxy/squid      < 2.5.10-r2                     >= 2.5.10-r2

Description
===========

Certain malformed requests result in a segmentation fault in the
sslConnectTimeout function, handling of other certain requests trigger
assertion failures.

Impact
======

By performing malformed requests an attacker could cause Squid to crash
by triggering an assertion failure or invalid memory reference.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-proxy/squid-2.5.10-r2"
