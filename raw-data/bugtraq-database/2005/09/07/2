OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project

Package:             apache/modssl (apache::with_mod_ssl=yes only)
Vulnerability:       information disclosure
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= apache-1.3.33-20050713 >= apache-1.3.33-20050902 
OpenPKG 2.4          <= apache-1.3.33-2.4.0    >= apache-1.3.33-2.4.1    
OpenPKG 2.3          <= apache-1.3.33-2.3.3    >= apache-1.3.33-2.3.4    

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  An information disclosure vulnerability was discovered in mod_ssl [1],
  the SSL/TLS module of the Apache [2] webserver. When "SSLVerifyClient
  optional" was configured in the global virtual host configuration, an
  "SSLVerifyClient require" in per-location context was not enforced.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2005-2700 [3] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  apache" and "<prefix>/bin/rpm -qi apache | grep with_mod_ssl". If you
  have the "apache" package with option "with_mod_ssl" installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade (see Solution) [4][5].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [6][7], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [8][9] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [10], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [4] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary
  RPM [5]. For the current release OpenPKG 2.4, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.4/UPD
  ftp> get apache-1.3.33-2.4.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig apache-1.3.33-2.4.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild apache-1.3.33-2.4.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/apache-1.3.33-2.4.1.*.rpm
