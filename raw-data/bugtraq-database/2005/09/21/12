Subject: PocketPC exploitation


I would like to contribute to the list a paper i just had published that 
discusses the vulnerabilities of current virus detectors for pocket pc's, it 
is scary to think that such simplistic detectors are the current state of 
the art for such powerfull devices, it leads one to think that the lessons 
of the past have not been learned, feedback on the paper is appreciated and 
welcomed, i hope it helps those interested in this area of research feel 
free to contact me.  I should be presenting the paper at the workshop on 
software security assesment tools, tactics and metrics in long beach 
california in early november in conjunction with the automated software 
engineering conference. the paper can be downloaded at

Jose.
