1. Problem Description

	Tavis Ormandy has reported a vulnerability in libTIFF, which
	potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise
	a vulnerable system. 
	
	The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error and can 
	be exploited to cause a buffer overflow via a specially crafted 
	TIFF image containing a malformed BitsPerSample tag. 
	
	Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, 
	if a malicious TIFF image is opened in an application linked 
	against the vulnerable library. 
	
	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the following name CAN-2005-1544 to this issue.
