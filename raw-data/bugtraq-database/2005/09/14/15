I just grabbed the snapshot tarball from the website and it does
have the duplicate log Frag3 issues mentioned... It is correct in
CVS, so subsequent snapshot tarballs resolve this.

However, with the fixes to PrintTcpOptions being in the tarball,
it wouldn't be a DoS problem other than extra printfs.

The changes made on August 23 by Sourcefire are the same as those
in the patch to 2.3.3.  Those changes have been in the 2.4 CVS
repository [and are in the snapshot tarball] for almost a month
(since the original poster brought this to our attention).

End of story.

Cheers.
