Synopsis
========

mod_ssl and Apache are vulnerable to a restriction bypass and a
potential local privilege escalation.

Background
==========

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet. mod_ssl provides SSL v2/v3 and TLS v1 support for Apache 1.3
and is also included in Apache 2.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/mod_ssl       < 2.8.24                          >= 2.8.24
  2  net-www/apache      < 2.0.54-r15                    >= 2.0.54-r15
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

mod_ssl contains a security issue when "SSLVerifyClient optional" is
configured in the global virtual host configuration (CAN-2005-2700).
Also, Apache's httpd includes a PCRE library, which makes it vulnerable
to an integer overflow (CAN-2005-2491).

Impact
======

Under a specific configuration, mod_ssl does not properly enforce the
client-based certificate authentication directive, "SSLVerifyClient
require", in a per-location context, which could be potentially used by
a remote attacker to bypass some restrictions. By creating a specially
crafted ".htaccess" file, a local attacker could possibly exploit
Apache's vulnerability, which would result in a local privilege
escalation.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All mod_ssl users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/mod_ssl-2.8.24"

All Apache 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/apache-2.0.54-r15"
