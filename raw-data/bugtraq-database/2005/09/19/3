Synopsis
========

Clam AntiVirus is subject to vulnerabilities ranging from Denial of
Service to execution of arbitrary code when handling compressed
executables.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit, designed for integration
with mail servers to perform attachment scanning. Clam AntiVirus also
provides a command line scanner and a tool for fetching updates of the
virus database.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav       < 0.87                         >= 0.87

Description
===========

Clam AntiVirus is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in "libclamav/upx.c"
when processing malformed UPX-packed executables. It can also be sent
into an infinite loop in "libclamav/fsg.c" when processing
specially-crafted FSG-packed executables.

Impact
======

By sending a specially-crafted file an attacker could execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running Clam AntiVirus, or cause
a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Clam AntiVirus users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.87"
