Could you please stop topposting? I had to read the complete thread to
know what php*uke bug it was related to.

Adding slashes, using register_globals, it's all bad.

'Sanitizing' input has always been a problem. Mandrake once supported
phpnuke and therefor I commited a 11K line diff to them a few years
back. That was to 'sanitize' only part of the problem, mostly some
descent behaviour against the used dblayer.

Let's stop whining about phppuke, and start using some user input
validation.
