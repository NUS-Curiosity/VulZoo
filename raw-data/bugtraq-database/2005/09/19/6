Subject: killbits? should have named them kibbles and bits


Background:
Killbits are used to block certain activex controls from running within windows
It is possible using certain methods to bypass this remotely.

This goes out to my favorite company in the whole world Microsoft.
Thanks for the upcoming vacation. :)
MS security department head (Hi Terry) will stop at nothing to cover 
that killbit can be bypassed remotely and to keep it a secret from vendors
Heres a hint evil browser hax0rs:
play around with every different way to instantiate active x objects
More to come?
hack the planet
illwill
all your exploits are back to belonging to us
