Dear All,

On our anniversary Hack Dot AE renew the worldwide Hacking Contest and invite you all to a new challenge. The first contest attracted huge interest from challengers from all over the world. This year contest is similarly constructed of 7 different levels which are more advanced and diverse. Instructions and hints will be provided in each level.

There are seven levels for the Hack Dot AE Contest. Each level has a different problem which will test the candidates hacking capability. Passing level 8 means that the candidate shows his strengths in hacking. In addition to this, different ID and password are assigned for each level.

Wish you best of luck in the new contest.

Yours,
