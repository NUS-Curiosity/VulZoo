Subject: Internet Exploiter meets FireFox

Hi all,
 Since I stopped releasing browser exploits, development on them seem to
have slowed to a halt. For the latest FireFox vulnerability, I decided to
finally port Internet Exploiter and thus PwnZilla was born.
 Technical details and documentation are all inline.
 FireFox 1.0.7 is out which seems to patch the vulnerability, I could find
no release information in the website so far, but that may change in the
near future.
 Get the exploit at http://www.milw0rm.com.
 Cheers,
SkyLined
 PS. Does anybody ever talk to Dave Ahmad? All my posts from gmail seem to
bounce of securityfocus for this reason:
 <bugtraq@...ts2.securityfocus.com>:
ezmlm-reject: fatal: Sorry, I don't accept messages of MIME Content-Type
'multipart/alternative' (#5.2.3)
I'm wondering if it's just me or everybody that uses gmail?
