Subject: Protty v.01A (beta) - shellcode execution
 protection library for Windows NT based systems


Hi,

For those who are interrested i have released Protty lib:

Protty is a ring 3 library developed to protect against
shellcode execution on Windows NT based systems. The full
description of the mechanism was published within the
Phrack magazine volume #63, available here:
http://www.phrack.org/phrack/63/p63-0x0f_NT_Shellcode_Prevention_Demystified.txt 

(sources of the initial release are also available) .
Currently Protty stops most known Windows shellcodes.
Moreover it can block some types of viruses which use
similiar methods as shellcodes do.



Main Protty v.01a (test phase) features are:

- Process Environment Block protection (currently 2 modules protection used)
- Structured Exception Handling protection
- Import section killing (currently main application only)
- Export section protection (currently 2 modules protection used)
- RtlEnterCrticialSection protecting (currently disabled)

best regards,
