Subject: Av, spyware, ddl trojan assesment


Hey list, I know this is not a how to protect your pc list. But I would 
like to know what are some good AV, spyware, adware, and software 
firewalls to use. I have to come up with a plan for a few of my clients 
who are always being infected.

All help is welcome.
