Subject:		OpenServer 6.0.0 : TCP Remote ICMP Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities
Advisory number: 	SCOSA-2005.38
Issue date: 		2005 September 22
Cross reference:	sr894918 fz530661 erg712928 CAN-2004-0790 CAN-2004-0791 CAN-2004-1060

1. Problem Description

	The Internet Control Message Protocol is used to alert
	hosts on a network about certain situations, and the hosts
	then take automatic action to prevent network failures or
	to improve transport efficiency. The RFC recommends no
	security checking for in-bound ICMP messages, so long as
	a related connection exists, and may potentially allow
	several different Denials of Service. The following
	individual attacks are reported: A blind connection-reset
	attack is reported, which takes advantage of the specification
	that describes that on receiving a 'hard' ICMP error, the
	corresponding connection should be aborted. A remote
	attacker may terminate target TCP connections and deny
	service for legitimate users. 
	 
	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-0790 to this issue. 
	
	An ICMP Source Quench
	attack is reported, which exploits the specification that
	a host must react to ICMP Source Quench messages by slowing
	transmission on the associated connection. A remote attacker
	may effectively degrade performance for a legitimate
	connection. 
	
	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-0791 to this issue. 
	
	A suitable forged ICMP PMTUD message may be used to reduce the 
	MTU for a given connection in a similar manner. 
	
	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-1060 to this issue.
