There's been dramatic advances in router vulnerability research
recently- one hopes that Cisco and Juiper are keeping pace. While we
are still in the theoretical stages of these attacks, I wonder how we
might recover from such a worm. When the 'network-is-unreachable'
messages reach critical mass how do we distribute patches or
information on practical mitigates? Does Cisco have contingency plans
to open up gigantic pots-based BBS's and let the frantic network admins
dial in to receive IOS updates? I hope all you infrastructure owners
have a good plan.
