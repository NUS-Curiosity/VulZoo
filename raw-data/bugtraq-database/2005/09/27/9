With Microsoft not pushing out any patches this month what is a security
researcher to do?

How about try to find a  exploit for every MS Security Bulletin ever
released.  Microsoft has published 449 bulletins I have found 114
exploit so far and now turn it over the community. The project can be
found at 

http://elsenot.com

The library is sorted by MS bulletin release date and contains bulletin
description, affected software/service pack, bulletin severity rating
and were possible an exploit for the security bulletins. The goal is an
exploit for every MS Security Bulletin currently there are 114 Exploits
and all 449 Microsoft Security Bulletins. The page will be updated as
more information becomes known.
