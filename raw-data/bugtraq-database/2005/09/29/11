Subject: Re: Bypassing Personal Firewall (Zone Alarm Pro) Using DDE-IPC


It is issue with almost all the firewalls
firewalls don't protect the running applications
themselves.I think i don't get is what does it
have to do with DDE ?.Also one can read firewall
ACL from the settings and inject code into the
running trusted process.
