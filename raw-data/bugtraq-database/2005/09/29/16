Is it really proactive approach?  I didn't think someone having
M.Sc. in CS (not in Chemistry as I do) would seriously call AV
vendors "saviours" and not "parasites".

I'm not pro in AV software by any margin but from these trenches, 
it seems like it's easier to burst malicious code variations
which consume cycles and bytes than to pump up CPU and RAM,
technoeconomically.

It won't be pleasant world when people will accept their mobile
phones suddenly spreading (and taking) virii and their cars
crashing for no reason until they have really fresh and
definitely the most stron antivirus on the block installed.

Maybe it's time to start pressing vendors and voting for
alternatives with one's pouch before getting that far?
