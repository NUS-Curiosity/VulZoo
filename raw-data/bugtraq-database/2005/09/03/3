Synopsis
========

Gnumeric is vulnerable to a heap overflow, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The Gnumeric spreadsheet is a versatile application developed as part
of the GNOME Office project. libpcre is a library providing functions
for Perl-compatible regular expressions.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/gnumeric     < 1.4.3-r2                    >= 1.4.3-r2

Description
===========

Gnumeric contains a private copy of libpcre which is subject to an
integer overflow leading to a heap overflow (see GLSA 200508-17).

Impact
======

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a
user into opening a specially crafted spreadsheet, which could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Gnumeric.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Gnumeric users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/gnumeric-1.4.3-r2"
