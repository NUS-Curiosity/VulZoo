Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0047

Package names:	   apache, openssh, squid   
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2005-09-09
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  apache 
  Apache is a full featured web server that is freely available, and also
  happens to be the most widely used.

  openssh
  Ssh (Secure Shell) a program for logging into a remote machine and for
  executing commands in a remote machine.  It is intended to replace
  rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between
  two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and
  arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
  
  squid
  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
  supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
  caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single, non-blocking,
  I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially hot objects
  cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking DNS lookups,
  and implements negative caching of failed requests. 

Problem description:
  apache < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: ssl_engine_kernel.c in mod_ssl before 2.8.24, when using
    "SSLVerifyClient optional" in the global virtual host configuration,
    does not properly enforce "SSLVerifyClient require" in a per-location
    context, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access 
    restrictions.
  - The byte-range filter in Apache 2.0 allows remote attackers to cause a 
    denial of service (memory consumption) via an HTTP header with a large
    Range field.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CAN-2005-2700 and CAN-2005-2728 to this issue.

  openssh < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - New Upstream
  - SECURITY Fix: An error in handling dynamic port forwardings when no
    listen address is specified, can cause "GatewayPorts" to be incorrectly
    activated.

  - An error in handling GSSAPI credential delegation can allow a user, who
    did not login using GSSAPI authentication, to be delegated with GSSAPI
    credentials.
    
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CAN-2005-2798 to this issue.

  squid < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Fixed DOS Vulnerability, Alex Masterov has reported a 
    vulnerability in Squid, which potentially can be exploited by malicious
    people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service). The vulnerability is caused
    due to an unspecified error in the "sslConnectTimeout()" function after
    handling malformed requests.
  - Fixed Squid crashes with the assertion failure in certain conditions
    involving aborted requests.
