OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project

Package:             squid
Vulnerability:       denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:       Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= squid-2.5.10-20050709 >= squid-2.5.10-20050910 
OpenPKG 2.4          <= squid-2.5.10-2.4.0    >= squid-2.5.10-2.4.1    
OpenPKG 2.3          <= squid-2.5.9-2.3.0     >= squid-2.5.9-2.3.1     

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Two Denial of Service (DoS) security issues were discovered in the
  Squid [0] Internet proxy. The first DoS is possible via certain
  aborted requests that trigger an assertion error related to
  "STORE_PENDING". The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  project assigned the id CAN-2005-2794 [1] to the problem. The second
  problem allows remote attackers to cause a DoS via certain crafted
  requests and SSL timeouts. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2005-2796 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q squid". If you have the "squid" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [3][4].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.4, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.4/UPD
  ftp> get squid-2.5.10-2.4.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig squid-2.5.10-2.4.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild squid-2.5.10-2.4.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/squid-2.5.10-2.4.1.*.rpm
