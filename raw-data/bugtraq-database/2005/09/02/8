It is very nice to see some major vendors starting to publicly state
that they are aware of non-coordinated public disclosures, before
investigation is complete and a fix is available.  This helps
consumers and security professionals to be more confident that a
vendor is at least aware of reported issues, which is more productive
than complete silence after the real or imagined cat is out of the
bag.
