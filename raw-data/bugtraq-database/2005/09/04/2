Well that applies to when it is determined that it was innocent.  This could
be via pop-up, trojan, or maleware of some kind.

Well they do not usually prosecute ham sandwiches, BLT's maybe.

I love how everyone is quick to say things just magically accumulated on
their H/D.  However, they tend not back of when a file structure is found
with hundreds of images, often burned to CD's.

Well that may be, of course you missed the beginning of these threads, where
Mr. Combs suggested after discovering contraband on and employees H/D, to
make a copy of it take the copy to the companies attorney. Wipe the original
and "best course of action is to purposefully falsify the record of the
company's response to the incident"

The full threads can be read here:

Yes that crazy scaring people into good behavior....... Oh wait that is
right only reasonably prudent people follow the law, criminals tend to not
care if there is law against something, they are not scared into not
committing crimes, that is why they are criminals.

Kind of like the lawlessness that is occurring in the situation you
mentioned below.  Some people would say that the devastation has turned
these people into criminals. Although, the reality is the people committing
the crimes are the same ones that were committing them before the
devastation.
