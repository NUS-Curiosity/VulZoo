Subject: Re: [scip_Advisory 1746] Microsoft Internet Explorer
	6.0 embedded content cross site scripting


I discovered something similar recently, though, where a *valid* jpg 
containing an XML header was issued to IE (via a direct link to the 
image) with a content-type of application/octet-stream and IE attempted 
to render the XML rather than rendering the image (or prompting for an 
action by the user, which is what I was going for).  IE subsequently 
issued an error indicating that it was unable to render the XML page 
(although it was a jpeg image with a .jpg extension).

While this may not be a direct threat if the server is sending the 
correct content-type, it could be a threat otherwise.  This, being 
untested speculation, would require testing to see exactly what you can 
get IE to do with embedded code.


Regards,
Tim Tompkins
