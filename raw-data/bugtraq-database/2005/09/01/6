3Com Network Supervisor Directory Traversal Vulnerability 

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 09.01.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=300&type=vulnerabilities
September 9, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

3Com Network Supervisor is a network monitoring application which allows

monitoring services on multiple hosts. More information is available at 
the following site:

 http://www.3com.com/products/en_US/detail.jsp?tab=prodspec&sku=3C15100E

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a directory traversal vulnerability in 3Com 
Corp.'s Network Supervisor version 5.0.2 may allow an attacker 
unauthorized access to files.

3Com Corp.'s Network Supervisor 5.0.2 contains an httpd running on port 
21700. By constructing a URL containing '../' sequences it is possible 
to access files outside of the webroot for this service.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow a remote 
attacker unauthenticated access to any file on the same filesystem 
as the server is installed on. Typically this is the C: drive, which 
also typically contains the Windows operating system files. One 
potential target may be the [SYSTEMROOT]\repair\sam file, which contains

user password information for the system. Tools are available, which 
will recover the password from this file. With this password, an 
attacker may gain access to the vulnerable system.

As the vulnerable tool is designed for network administration, it is
likely that the users of an affected system will have elevated 
permissions on other systems on the network.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE Labs have confirmed that 3Com Corp.'s Network Supervisor 5.0.2 
is affected by this vulnerability. It is suspected that all previous 
versions are affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Restrict remote access to port 21700 at the network boundary, unless 
remote parties require service. Access to the affected host should be 
filtered at the network boundary if global accessibility is not 
required. Restricting access to only trusted hosts and networks may 
reduce the likelihood of exploitation.
