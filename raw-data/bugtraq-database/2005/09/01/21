SSRT051005 rev.1 - HP ProLiant DL585 Servers Unauthorized Remote
                   Access

NOTICE:
The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon
as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:
31 August 2005

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:
Unauthorized remote access

SOURCE:
Hewlett-Packard Company
HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
    -> During ongoing internal quality testing of the HP ProLiant
       DL585 server, a potential vulnerability has been
       identified, where a remote unauthorized user may gain
       access to the server controls, but only when the server is
       powered down.

    ->HP has determined that this issue only occurs on some
      ProLiant DL585 servers and that no other server models are
      exposed to this vulnerability.

REFERENCES:
None

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
   -> HP ProLiant DL585 Servers with Integrated Lights Out (ILO)
      firmware prior to version 1.82

   ->Includes: Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows Server
     2003, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (x86 & AMD64/EM64T), Red Hat
     Enterprise Linux 3 (x86 & AMD64/EM64T), Red Hat Enterprise

BACKGROUND:

RESOLUTION:

 ->IMPORTANT: The firmware upgrade prescribed by HP in this
   Bulletin is considered a critical fix and is required to
   eliminate this security vulnerability. HP strongly
   recommends immediate application of all required critical
   fixes. Neglecting to perform the required action may result
   in unauthorized remote access on the server. By
   disregarding this notification, the customer accepts the
   risk of incurring future related events.

 ->While this issue only affects some ProLiant DL585 servers,
   HP strongly recommends that all ProLiant DL585 customers
   perform the firmware update.

 ->The Integrated Lights-Out firmware upgrade version 1.82
   (or later) will eliminate this vulnerability in ProLiant
   DL585 servers.

 ->Firmware version 1.82 for iLO is available from the
   following downloadable software:

  ->Online ROM Flash Component for Windows -
    HP Integrated Lights-Out
    http://h18023.www1.hp.com/support/files/server/us/download/
    23468.html

  ->Online ROM Flash Component for Linux -
    HP Integrated Lights-Out
    http://h18023.www1.hp.com/support/files/server/us/download/
    23469.html

   ->Offline ROM Flash for SmartStart Maintenance:
     ROM Update Utility - Integrated Lights-Out
     http://h18023.www1.hp.com/support/files/server/us/download/
     23563.html

   ->To eliminate this vulnerability until ILO version 1.82 is
     installed, unplug the ProLiant DL585 server power cord
     whenever the server is powered down.  This will prohibit the
     remote access exploit.
