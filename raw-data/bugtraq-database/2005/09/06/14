Package:             proftpd
Vulnerability:       denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:           Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= proftpd-1.3.0rc1-20050610 >= proftpd-1.3.0rc2-20050725 
OpenPKG 2.4          <= proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.0    >= proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.1    
OpenPKG 2.3          <= proftpd-1.2.10-2.3.1      >= proftpd-1.2.10-2.3.2      

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  It was reported that ProFTPd [1] version before 1.3.0rc2 suffer from
  two format string vulnerabilities. In the first, a user with the
  ability to create a directory could trigger the format string error
  if there is a ProFTPd shutdown message configured to use the "%C",
  "%R", or "%U" variables. In the second, the error is triggered if the
  ProFTPd extension mod_sql is used to retrieve messages from a database
  and if format strings have been inserted into the database by a user
  with permission to do so. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2005-2390 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q proftpd". If you have the "proftpd" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [3][4].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.4, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.4/UPD
  ftp> get proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/proftpd-1.3.0rc1-2.4.1.*.rpm
