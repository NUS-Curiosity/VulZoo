3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in SqWebMail, which
can be exploited by malicious people to conduct script insertion
attacks.

The vulnerability is caused due to SqWebMail allowing usage of e.g.
the "<script>" tag within an HTML comment. This, combined with
"Conditional Comments" in Internet Explorer, can be exploited to
execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session in context
of a vulnerable site when a malicious email is viewed.

Successful exploitation requires that the user is using Internet 
Explorer.

Example in an HTML email:
<!--[if IE]>
<script>alert("Vulnerable!");</script>
<![endif]-->

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

The vendor has issued an updated version of SqWebMail, which fixes
this vulnerability.
