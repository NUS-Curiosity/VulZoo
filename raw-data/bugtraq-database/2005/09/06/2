	vulnerability


Hi list,
I haven't seen any information about this new local exploit for
Microsoft Windows :

http://www.haxorcitos.com/MSRC-6005bgs-EN.txt

Description from Haxorcitos :

As is Known, with the current Microsoft Security Model, applications
that share the destkop
are able to send messages between them.
Every Desktop application is able to obtain the handle of every process
executed in the same desktop.

This feature and the possibility of any application to emulate a virtual
keyboard by sending key strokes,
allows every process to send messages and keys as if there were an
interactive user.


Bests regards,
