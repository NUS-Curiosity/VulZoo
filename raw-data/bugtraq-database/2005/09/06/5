Synopsis
========

A flaw in phpLDAPadmin may allow attackers to bypass security
restrictions and connect anonymously.

Background
==========

phpLDAPadmin is a web-based LDAP client allowing to easily manage LDAP
servers.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /    Vulnerable    /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-nds/phpldapadmin     < 0.9.7_alpha6           >= 0.9.7_alpha6

Description
===========

Alexander Gerasiov discovered a flaw in login.php preventing the
application from validating whether anonymous bind has been disabled in
the target LDAP server configuration.

Impact
======

Anonymous users can access the LDAP server, even if the
"disable_anon_bind" parameter was explicitly set to avoid this.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpLDAPadmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-nds/phpldapadmin-0.9.7_alpha6"
