Synopsis
========

The Gentoo Net-SNMP package may provide Perl modules containing an
insecure DT_RPATH, potentially allowing privilege escalation.

Background
==========

Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement the Simple
Network Management Protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /   Vulnerable   /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/net-snmp     < 5.2.1.2-r1              >= 5.2.1.2-r1

Description
===========

James Cloos reported that Perl modules from the Net-SNMP package look
for libraries in an untrusted location. This is due to a flaw in the
Gentoo package, and not the Net-SNMP suite.

Impact
======

A local attacker (member of the portage group) may be able to create a
shared object that would be loaded by the Net-SNMP Perl modules,
executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the
Perl script.

Workaround
==========

Limit group portage access to trusted users.

Resolution
==========

All Net-SNMP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/net-snmp-5.2.1.2-r1"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:

=========

Security is a primary focus of Gentoo Linux and ensuring the
confidentiality and security of our users machines is of utmost
importance to us. Any security concerns should be addressed to
