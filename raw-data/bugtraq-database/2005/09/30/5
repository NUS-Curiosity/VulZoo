Synopsis
========

Hylafax is vulnerable to linking attacks, potentially allowing a local
user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

Hylafax is a client-server fax package for class 1 and 2 fax modems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/hylafax       < 4.2.2                       *>= 4.2.0-r3
                                                          *>= 4.2.1-r2
                                                              >= 4.2.2

Description
===========

Javier Fernandez-Sanguino has discovered that xferfaxstats cron script
supplied by Hylafax insecurely creates temporary files with predictable
filenames.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary file
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
the xferfaxstats script of Hylafax is executed, this would result in
the file being overwritten with the rights of the user running the
script, which typically is the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Hylafax users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose net-misc/hylafax
