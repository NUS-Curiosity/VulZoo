Subject: RE: "Exploiting the XmlHttpRequest object in IE"
	- paper by Amit Klein


Hi list.

I checked some ideas and think that reflected XSS in user-agent and
other http request headers fileds (cookies for example) can be exploited
via http request smuggling\splitting cache poisoning attacks using
described techniques.
So vendors who discard such vulnerabilities as not explotable should
take it into account.
