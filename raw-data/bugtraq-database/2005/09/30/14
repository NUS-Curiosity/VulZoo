Unfortunately not !! Besides Zone Alarm free version it has been tested for
ZA Pro 3x and it works like a charm. Again Symantec SecurityFocus has
probably tested this for ZA Pro 5.1. so they have mentioned the vulnerable
version here http://securityfocus.com/bid/14966

I am not sure whether ZoneLabs has tested this or not, as I found ZA Pro 3x
to be vulnerable but seems it has not appear in the advisory's affected s/ws
list http://download.zonelabs.com/bin/free/securityAlert/35.html . As per
the advisory only the ZA free version is vulnerable.... I am afraid this is
incorrect ...
