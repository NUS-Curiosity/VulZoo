Update
======

This advisory was originally released to fix the heap overflow in IDN
headers. However, the official fixed release included several other
security fixes as well.

The updated sections appear below.

Synopsis
========

Mozilla Suite and Firefox are vulnerable to multiple issues, including
some that might be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that includes a
mail and news reader. Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation browser
from the Mozilla project. Gecko is the layout engine used in both
products.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                         /   Vulnerable   /     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla-firefox          < 1.0.7-r2        >= 1.0.7-r2
  2  www-client/mozilla                  < 1.7.12-r2      >= 1.7.12-r2
  3  www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin        < 1.0.7            >= 1.0.7
  4  www-client/mozilla-bin               < 1.7.12           >= 1.7.12
  5  net-libs/gecko-sdk                   < 1.7.12           >= 1.7.12
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     5 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

The Mozilla Suite and Firefox are both vulnerable to the following
issues:

* Tom Ferris reported a heap overflow in IDN-enabled browsers with
  malicious Host: headers (CAN-2005-2871).

* "jackerror" discovered a heap overrun in XBM image processing
  (CAN-2005-2701).

* Mats Palmgren reported a potentially exploitable stack corruption
  using specific Unicode sequences (CAN-2005-2702).

* Georgi Guninski discovered an integer overflow in the JavaScript
  engine (CAN-2005-2705)

* Other issues ranging from DOM object spoofing to request header
  spoofing were also found and fixed in the latest versions
  (CAN-2005-2703, CAN-2005-2704, CAN-2005-2706, CAN-2005-2707).

The Gecko engine in itself is also affected by some of these issues and
has been updated as well.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could setup a malicious site and entice a victim to
visit it, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution with the
victim's privileges or facilitated spoofing of known websites.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround for all the issues.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.7-r2"

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.12-r2"

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.7"

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.12"

All Gecko library users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/gecko-sdk-1.7.12"
