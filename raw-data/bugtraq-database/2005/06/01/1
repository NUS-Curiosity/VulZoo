Synopsis
========

Various utilities from the GNU Binutils and elfutils packages are
vulnerable to a heap based buffer overflow, potentially resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and
analyse binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File
Descriptor library, to do low-level manipulation. Elfutils provides a
library and utilities to access, modify and analyse ELF objects.

Affected packages
=================

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy and Ned Ludd of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team
discovered an integer overflow in the BFD library and elfutils,
resulting in a heap based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would require a user to access a specially
crafted binary file, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose sys-devel/binutils

All elfutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/elfutils-0.108"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
