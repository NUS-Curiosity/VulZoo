Subject: Re: how to exploit SQL INJECTION?


Maybe ill be busted , me, but not all, If in Israel I cant Write an
article against the army, why should I take as my limit a stupid law
that allow to killers make difussion of their sickness religious and
nationalists?...
Why I should shut my mouth in country under "democracy"?...Im not
hacker, and is not something important for me to be, I want learn
about security because I like computers, and I want learn to hack
because is the one method some people have to express their ideas, if
I say in the street "israel is killing arabians like beatles" the
people will kill me legally, continue searching in google about other
people that dont think like u...u see like police...good luck,bye.
