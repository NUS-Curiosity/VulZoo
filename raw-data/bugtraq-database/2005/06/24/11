Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.1

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  cpio:
  GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive.

  razor-agents:
  Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and
  filtering network.

  sudo:
  Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain
  users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands
  as root while logging all commands and arguments.

  telnet:
  Telnet is a popular protocol for logging into remote systems over the
  Internet.  The telnet package provides a command line telnet client.

Problem description:
  cpio:
  Fix File Permissions Vulnerability, Race condition in cpio 2.6 and earlier
  allows local users to modify permissions of arbitrary files via a hard link
  attack on a file while it is being decompressed, whose permissions are changed
  by cpio after the decompression is complete.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CAN-2005-1111 to this issue.

  Fix Directory Traversal Vulnerability, cpio 2.6 and earlier allows remote
  attackers to write to arbitrary directories via a .. (dot dot) in a cpio file.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CAN-2005-1229 to this issue.

  razor-agents:
  New Upstream.
  Security Fix:Two vulnerabilities have been  reported in 
  Razor-agents, which can be exploited by malicious  people to
  cause a DoS (Denial of Service).

  An unspecified error in the preprocessing of certain HTML
  messages can be exploited to crash the application.

  A bug in the discovery logic causes Razor-agents to go into
  an infinite loop and consume a large amount of memory when
  discovery fails.

  sudo:
  New Upstream.
  Fix A race condition in Sudo's command pathname handling that could
  allow a user with Sudo privileges to run arbitrary commands.

  telnet:
  Security Fix: Telnet information disclosure vulnerability.
  Gael Delalleau discovered an information disclosure issue in the way the
  telnet client handles messages from a server.  An attacker could construct
  a malicious telnet server that collects information from the environment of
  any victim who connects to it.  

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned 
  the name CAN-2005-0488 to this issue.
