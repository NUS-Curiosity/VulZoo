	Vendor Cacti Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities


Multiple Vendor Cacti Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities 

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 06.22.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=267&type=vulnerabilities
June 22, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Cacti is a round-robin database (RRD) tool that helps create graphs from

database information and is available on multiple Linux distributions. 

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an input validation vulnerability in various
vendors implementations of Cacti graph creation tool allows an attacker
to make arbitrary SQL queries.

Cacti contains an input validation error in the config_settings.php
script which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This
in effect allows an attacker to recover the administrative password for
the Cacti installation. Various scripts are vulnerable to SQL injection
using the 'id' variable.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker 
to gain access to the encrypted administrative password for Cacti. An 
attacker can then attempt to crack the password and gain administrative 
access.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability on Cacti 
0.8.6c. Earlier versions are suspected vulnerable. The following vendors

distribute susceptible Cacti packages within their respective operating 
system distributions: 
	
	The FreeBSD Project 
	Gentoo Foundation 
	Novell, Inc. (SuSE) 
	The Debian Project (SuSE) 

V. WORKAROUND

Require authentication to access the Cacti installation. Restrict access

to web servers using Cacti to only trusted hosts.
