Synopsis
========

Trac may allow remote attackers to upload files, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Trac is a minimalistic web-based project management, wiki and bug
tracking system including a Subversion interface.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/trac       < 0.8.4                              >= 0.8.4

Description
===========

Stefan Esser of the Hardened-PHP project discovered that Trac fails to
validate the "id" parameter when uploading attachments to the wiki or
the bug tracking system.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability to upload arbitrary
files to a directory where the webserver has write access to, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Trac users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/trac-0.8.4"
