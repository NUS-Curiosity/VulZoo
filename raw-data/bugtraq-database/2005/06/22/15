Vulnerable System:

This vulnerability affects Asterisk 1.0.7 and the development Asterisk 
branch (known as CVS HEAD).
http://www.asterisk.org/

Vulnerability Title:

Asterisk Manager Interface Overflow

Vulnerability discovery and development:

Wade Alcorn discovered this vulnerability whilst performing an 
assessment of the Asterisk PABX software package. It was then verified 
that the instruction pointer could be controlled and made to point at 
arbitrary memory locations. This led to a remote shell proof-of-concept, 
which provides access to the user (root by default) running Asterisk. 
This will occur when the Asterisk Manager Interface is enabled and a 
valid manager username and password, with command line permissions, is used.

Affected systems:

The issue was initially found and verified on the Linux Operating 
System. Research is currently being undertaken to determine the extent 
to which other operating systems are vulnerable.

Details:

There is a programming error in the function that parses commands in the 
Asterisk system. This is used by the manager interface if the user is 
allowed to submit CLI commands. The coding error can result in the 
overflow of one of the parameters of the calling function. That is, the 
command parsing function will return without error. However, the calling 
function will cause a segmentation fault.

If the command string is specifically crafted, is it possible to use 
this stack overflow to execute arbitrary code on the Asterisk system. 
The resulting execution is (typically) run with root privileges.

A command consisting of a recurring string of two double quotes followed 
by a tab character will induce the segmentation fault within a Call 
Manager thread.

Impact:

Under the default configuration the Asterisk server does not start the 
Manager interface, so a default Asterisk installation will not be 
vulnerable to this avenue of attack.

The impact of this issue is mitigated by the Asterisk default 
configuration. Configuration is controlled by settings in manager.conf. 
The following options need to be in place for this vector of attack to 
be successful:

   [general]
   enabled = yes
   bindaddr = 127.0.0.1

   [mark]
   secret = mysecret
   permit = 127.0.0.1
   write = command

The relevant option is 'write = command'; without it, even properly 
authenticated Manager interface users will be unable to exploit this 
overflow.

The result of a successfully exploited Asterisk command parsing overflow 
will result in a remote root shell.

Exploit:

The error in the function means that any Asterisk server with the 
appropriate configuration using the Manager interface is vulnerable. It 
is possible for an authenticated user to gain a remote root shell on the 
system.

Vendor notified:

Mark Spencer, the primary developer of the Asterisk project, was 
contacted on Thursday 19th May 2005 via email. This email contained a 
summary of the vulnerability and explained Wade Alcorn had developed an 
exploit for the issue.

The Asterisk development team was prompt and responsive to the 
vulnerability alert. Portcullis was provided with an alternate means of 
contact additional to email, if it was to be required. Wade Alcorn 
(Portcullis), Mark Spencer (Asterisk), Kevin Fleming (Asterisk) 
cooperatively provided and verified a solution to the problem.

Vendor response:

The Asterisk project is thankful for the efforts of Wade Alcorn and 
Portcullis Computer Security to identify and diagnose the source of this 
problem. Wade Alcorn was able to provide a proposed solution and a 
simple means of reproducing the problem, which were instrumental in our 
ability to quickly solve the issue.

Workaround/Fix:

Options
1) For a temporary workaround, disable the setting in manager.conf 
detailed in the impact section.
2) Upgrade to version 1.0.8, or for development branch users, the most 
recent CVS version available.
