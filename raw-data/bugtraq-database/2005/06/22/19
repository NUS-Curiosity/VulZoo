Subject: IIS Unicode still a threat?


Hello everyone, I was interested in learning about unicode exploits in IIS 
5.0 so I created a Windows 2000 Server and IIS 5.0 and was able to find a 
lot of information about this subject after googling it and playing around 
with it.  My question is, is unicode still a real threat in IIS 6.0?  And if 
so, if you guys could please give me some links of some pages and papers 
that discuss newer use of unicode.

Thanks,
