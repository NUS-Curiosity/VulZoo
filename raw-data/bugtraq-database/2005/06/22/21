IpSwitch WhatsUp Professional 2005 (SP1) SQL Injection Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 06.22.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=268&type=vulnerabilities
June 22, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

WhatsUp Professional 2005 SP1 is a network management solution for small
and mid sized organizations. Further information is available at:

   http://www.ipswitch.com/Products/WhatsUp/professional/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a SQL injection vulnerability in IpSwitch Inc.'s
WhatsUp Professional 2005 Service Pack 1 could allow a remote attacker
to gain administrative access to the application.

The main logon screen for the web based front end does not properly
validate input, allowing for SQL injection attacks to occur. SQL
commands can be submitted through the "User Name" and "Password" fields	
on the default login page.

The web front end is not enabled by default and must be running for the
application to be vulnerable. It can be enabled under the "Configure",
"Program Options" menu by checking the "Enable web server on port [80]"
checkbox.

Exploit code for this vulnerability is unnecessary; the following SQL
injection attacks can be executed in the "User Name" field of the
http://[target]/NmConsole/Login.asp page:

Reset the Admin user password with a blank password:
- 'UPDATE WebUser SET sPassword=DEFAULT WHERE sUserName='Admin'--

Elevate Guest user privileges to Admin privileges:
- 'UPDATE WebUser SET nUserRightsMask=-1 WHERE sUserName='guest'--

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated remote attackers to gain
administrative access to the WhatsUp Professional application. SQL
injection attacks can be used to either elevate the privileges of the
Guest user or to change/erase the password of the Admin user. Either
approach will provide a remote attacker with full administrative access
to the application. By default, the Guest user is enabled but has
limited access to the application and the account has a blank password.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability against
WhatsUp Gold Professional 2005 SP1 running on Windows XP Professional
SP1.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling the web front end to WhatsUp Gold Professional 2005 (SP1) will
prevent the ability to exploit this vulnerability. It can be disabled
under the "Configure", "Program Options" menu by unchecking the "Enable
web server on port [80]" checkbox.
