	input validation issue

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drupal security advisory                                  DRUPAL-SA-2005-002
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advisory ID:    DRUPAL-SA-2005-002
Date:           2005-jun-29
Security risk:  highly critical
Impact:         system access
Where:          from remote
Vulnerability:  arbitrary PHP code execution
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
-----------
Kuba Zygmunt discovered a flaw in the input validation routines of Drupal's
filter mechanism.  An attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code on a target 
site when public comments or postings are allowed.

Versions affected
-----------------
Drupal 4.5.0, 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3
Drupal 4.6.0, 4.6.1

Solution
--------
Either disable public comments and postings, or upgrade to the latest Drupal
version:
- If you cannot upgrade immediately, you can secure your site by disabling
  public postings and comments.  Log in as an administrator, go to
  "administer >> access control" and make sure that untrusted roles don't
  have the permissions to submit or edit content.
- If you are running Drupal 4.5.x, then upgrade to Drupal 4.5.4.
- If you are running Drupal 4.6.x, then upgrade to Drupal 4.6.2.
