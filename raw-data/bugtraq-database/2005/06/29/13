Subject: Auditing Privilged Oracle Passwords - hashattack


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I've put together a tool that can be used to build a table of Oracle
password hashes from a dictionary file for a designated username.
Hashes are calculated by creating a user account similar to the
target account to be audited and repeatedly changing the password
with "ALTER USER" for each dictionary word, storing the hash for each
password in a table.

Once the table of hashes is built, a simple SELECT can be issued to
determine if the password hash for a target user is a simple
dictionary word:

SQL> select h.username, h.password, h.hash
  2  from hashattack h, dba_users d
  3  where d.password = h.hash and h.username = 'SYS';

USERNAME   PASSWORD             HASH
- ---------- -------------------- --------------------
SYS        KILTPLEAT            2BBDC477FFB28563
