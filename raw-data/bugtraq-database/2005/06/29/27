Subject: Re: Oracle Question Slightly OT


Oracle has some security specific information on the OTN page -
http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/db_security/index.html
One you may find particularly useful is the 9iR2 security checklist -
http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/oracle9i/pdf/9ir2_checklist.pdf
(although I couldn't find this linked anywhere on that page...odd)

Pete Finnigan, though, is propably the best reference for Oracle
security information.  He has a comprehensive list of Oracle security
references here: http://www.petefinnigan.com/orasec.htm

There have been several other good Oracle whitepapers including those
written by AppSec, Inc
(http://www.appsecinc.com/techdocs/whitepapers/research.html),
Integrigy (http://www.integrigy.com/info/Integrigy_OracleDB_Listener_Security.pdf),
and NGSSoftware (http://www.nextgenss.com/papers/hpoas.pdf).

Happy reading!
