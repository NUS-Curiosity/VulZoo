Synopsis
========

Clam AntiVirus is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack when
processing certain Quantum archives.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit, designed for integration
with mail servers to perform attachment scanning. Clam AntiVirus also
provides a command line scanner and a tool for fetching updates of the
virus database.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.86.1                      >= 0.86.1

Description
===========

Andrew Toller and Stefan Kanthak discovered that a flaw in libmspack's
Quantum archive decompressor renders Clam AntiVirus vulnerable to a
Denial of Service attack.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a Denial of
Service by sending a specially crafted Quantum archive to the server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Clam AntiVirus users should upgrade to the latest available
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.86.1"
