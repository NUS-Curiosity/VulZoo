Synopsis
========

LutelWall is vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially allowing a
local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

LutelWall is a high-level Linux firewall configuration tool.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-firewall/lutelwall       < 0.98                       >= 0.98

Description
===========

Eric Romang has discovered that the new_version_check() function in
LutelWall insecurely creates a temporary file when updating to a new
version.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary file
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
the update script is executed (usually by the root user), this would
result in the file being overwritten with the rights of this user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All LutelWall users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-firewall/lutelwall-0.98"
