Synopsis
========

GNU shtool and ocaml-mysql are vulnerable to symlink attacks,
potentially allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

GNU shtool is a compilation of small shell scripts into a single shell
tool. The ocaml-mysql package includes the GNU shtool code.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-util/shtool        < 2.0.1-r2                     >= 2.0.1-r2
  2  dev-ml/ocaml-mysql     < 1.0.3-r1                     >= 1.0.3-r1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Eric Romang has discovered that GNU shtool insecurely creates temporary
files with predictable filenames (CAN-2005-1751). On closer inspection,
Gentoo Security discovered that the shtool temporary file, once
created, was being reused insecurely (CAN-2005-1759).

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When a
GNU shtool script is executed, this would result in the file being
overwritten with the rights of the user running the script, which could
be the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU shtool users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/shtool-2.0.1-r2"

All ocaml-mysql users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-ml/ocaml-mysql-1.0.3-r1"
