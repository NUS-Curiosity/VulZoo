Subject: `tattle`, now with goodness


http://sodaphish.com/files/tattle

This new version of `tattle` brings:
* a shift away from using whois information to using the abuse.net dns
lookup to get contacts to report abuse to.
* no more domain-based reporting -- all is done by IP.  hopefully this
will quell much of the concern about abuse being reported to the wrong
parties.
* no more dependancy on external system binaries (such as `host` or
`whois`.)  Thus, there should be no threat of some remote maliciousness
and the the code should be somewhat more portable.  

Let the next barrage of e-mails telling me how wrong my implementation
is begin!  ;-P

Ciao,
-C
