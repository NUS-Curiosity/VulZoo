Synopsis
========

A format string vulnerability in Ettercap could allow a remote attacker
to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Ettercap is a suite of tools for content filtering, sniffing and man in
the middle attacks on a LAN.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/ettercap       < 0.7.3                      >= 0.7.3

Description
===========

The curses_msg function of Ettercap's Ncurses-based user interface
insecurely implements formatted printing.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could craft a malicious network flow that would
result in executing arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
the Ettercap tool, which is often root.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ettercap users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/ettercap-0.7.3"
