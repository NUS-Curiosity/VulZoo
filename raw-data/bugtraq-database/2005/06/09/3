Subject: Re: IpSwitch IMAP Server LOGON stack overflow

Ah, you refer to this one.
"The first vulnerability specifically exists in the handling of a long 
username to the LOGIN command. A long username argument of approximately 
2,000 bytes will cause a stack based unicode string buffer overflow 
providing the attacker with partial control over EIP. As this 
vulnerability is in the LOGIN command itself, valid credentials are not 
required. "

Later it reads 
"The second vulnerability also exists in the handling of the LOGIN 
command username argument, however it lends itself to easier 
exploitation."

I guess I shouldn't have trusted this statement :) 
Perhaps I'll take a look at this one next, or just use your CANVAS example :)
Cheers
