Subject: Re: Backdoor in FortinetÂ´s firewall Fortigate



This is a documented feature of the FortiGate and FortiLog devices.
You must have a local serial connection. So, this is not remotely exploitble. If
someone has physical access to your firewall to make a serial connection, then
you have plenty of other problems too.
