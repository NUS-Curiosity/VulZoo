Thanks for the code.
In any case I get 'Unable to retrieve username' and 'hash of password'

That's quite strange since I run a exploitable version. 
According to wp-includes/version.php this is Wordpress 1.5 (old install from a
gentoo system)

GLSA 200506-04 says that Wordpress < 1.5.1.2 is vulnerable, but it seems not to
be the case.

Who can clarify?
Thanks,

Giorgio
