Subject: Contact Request - Comcast


I realize this is slightly off topic, but... I'm trying to get in 
contact with someone at Comcast who can address a... well, lets call it 
an /issue/ I discovered.  So far, my attempts at providing the 
information to someone who can understand it have been met with 
failure.  Does anyone out there have any contact info for someone within 
the engineering ranks or someone of a similar mindset?  Thanks much.
