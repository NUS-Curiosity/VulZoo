Microsoft Outlook Web Access Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 06.14.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=261&type=vulnerabilities
June 14, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Outlook Web Access is an optional component included in 
Microsoft Exchange that allows users to access their mailboxes using a 
web front end. More information is available at the following address:

http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/owa/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in 
the Outlook Web Access (OWA) component within version 5.5 of Microsoft 
Corp.'s Exchange Server allows an attacker to force to inject arbitrary 
script code into a users session, possibly stealing logon credentials.

To demonstrate the vulnerability, simply embed the following encoded 
text into an HTML e-mail:

<IMG SRC="jav&#X41sc&#0010;ript:alert('XSS')">

This will have the affect of popping up an alert window when the 
targeted user views the mail using Outlook Web Access. This proof of 
concept could easily be altered to cause the script to return 
authentication credentials to an attacker controlled server.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker 
to inject arbitrary script code into the Web Access session. This could 
allow for the theft of authentication information, which could lead to 
a compromised mail account.

In order for exploitation to occur, the targeted user would only have 
to view an e-mail from an attacker. As it is trivial to spoof the 
source of e-mail, this vulnerability has a high potential for 
widespread exploitation.

IV. DETECTION

Version 5.5 of Exchange Server has been confirmed vulnerable. Microsoft 
has reported that Version 2000 and 2003 of Exchange Server are not 
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDEFENSE is currently unaware of any effective workarounds that can be 
implemented on the server in order to mitigate the risk of this 
vulnerability; however, there are workarounds available for client 
protection. Since exploitation allows for the execution of malicious 
code in web browsers, successful exploitation could be thwarted by 
disabling script code and active content support within a client 
browser. Take note that employing this workaround could adversely 
affect web sites reliant upon the execution of browser-based script 
code. The following steps can be taken to disable active scripting in 
Mozilla and Internet Explorer:

Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.01, 5.5, 6

    a. On the Tools menu, click Internet Options, click the Security
tab, 
       click the Internet Web content zone, and then click Custom Level.
    b. In the Settings box, scroll down to the Scripting section, and
click 
       Disable under Active scripting and Scripting of Java applets.
    c. Click OK, and then click OK again.

Mozilla Firefox

    a. On the Tools menu, click Options and click the Web Features tab.
    b. De-select the Enable JavaScript checkbox.
    c. Click OK.
