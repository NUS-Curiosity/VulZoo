Subject: RE: Exploits Selling / Buying


 Hello list,

conclusions too fast..

Well Stan here are some answers for you.

We are dedicated to penetration testing of our servers , we also work
with few hosting companies which names we were asked to keep private
for the time being .
We do NOT resell the exploits we buy to anyone(and i mean _anyone_) we
use them for improving security, we do realise however that gaining
your trust will take time but as for now we are still working on this.
Yes we are going to keep exploits sold to us private and we guarantee
no information leaks.Eventually in time some of the exploits will
naturally be disclosed to the general public.
Regarding the benefits of the community from this service we could
argue all day long but still the fact is - we buy exploits from
security experts and in this way ,admit it or not, those experts are
motivated and awarded for their work so that they can continue
researching and locating bugs/errors and etc.
There is going to be a site but its still in process of developing and
we thought direct communication could provide you with more dynamic
way of communication , this way more answers can be given in a shorter
time.

About the http://exploits.cx site i have to say its not the site
representing irc.exploits.cx whether there will be a part of the site
dedicated to this bussines or there will be a complete new site is
still under concideration.

Thanks for the right questions Stan.

Hello deeper , maybe the following will clear few things for you and
hopefully for others aswell ...

Yes , we do need to know what we are buying , reviewing your `1337'
sploits is something that has to be done , but by reviewing we dont
necessairly mean taking the source code and leave you waiting for week
and then come back saying "sorry but your shit is not worthed" !
We will provide an appropriate environment where you would be able to
show us your `1337' skills and tools :) we'll be following you every
step of the way and eventually come up with a decision wheter to buy
what you are offering or not.We are still in process of clearing out
how this should work more efficient and easy for both sides !
I agree that what we are doing still needs adjustements and
improvements but every beginning is hard , right ? :)

hello Todd ,
few easy answers for you 
1) We are also buying your exploits (buying in this case involves
money :P ) + we are paying a quite more than they do :)
2)  "The program is proven and used by many. Strange " - their program
is at first glance really very similliar to ours but we like to think
we provide a different more efficient process of doing the same thing
(which is not exactly correct becouse our goals are a bit different.)!
I cant really understand what's so strange? if they are doing it this
means there is no need of anyone else doing it? or anyone could do it
better than them ?

Hello xyberpix,

Here is my reply - 
Yes - thats a new service  , yes - we are not the first to think about
buying exploits , i think you fail to make a difference between having
the idea of something and realising it (and there's a big difference i
think you will agree once you put your mind on it :) ) If u read my
answer to Stan you will see how the community will benefit from this
:) . I'm not really in politics but still I do have some experience
with the communism and i have to say helping everybody and threating
everybody equally is not always the best thing to do.I will repeat
myself once agian we are not reselling the exploits to third parties !
We are no reselling them to anyone!
On a personal note - do you really believe starting flames is
something that is helpful to anyone ? or u just have a lot of free
time to spend ? :) no offense.

Hello Teo ,

Probably you should read a bit more about the IRC protocol and vhosts
in general :) but i can see you already got your answer from others :)
To clear things out there is a service working on this link called
Void that you may have encountered in other networks.

I'd like to thanks Mr.Guninski(even having you posting on this topic
makes us excited :) ) and Mr. Valdis Kletnieks for the reasonable
posts I just have to add something, an eventual price war or
competition of any kind could only be a benefit for everyone!

At the end i would like to thank you all for taking interest in this
post and for the questions you asked . I believe most of them would
find their way into the FAQ section of the upcomming site.
Please excuse my imperfect and rough english.
