Subject: reconsidering physical security: pod slurping


pod slurping
------------

I've written a report that explores an idea that has been known by the 
security community for decades: physical security is important to 
information system security.

A year ago a report was published by the Gartner Group warning that 
iPods <http://www.apple.com/ipod/> (and other multi-gigabyte portable 
storage devices) pose a security risk for enterprises 
<http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/07/06/HNipodsrisk_1.html>. I've 
created an application (*slurp.exe*) that demonstrates this concept. 
When the program is run from an iPod, it can __very__quickly__  copy 
thousands of  interesting files* from a PC to an iPod.

The full article and proof-of-concept application are available at:
