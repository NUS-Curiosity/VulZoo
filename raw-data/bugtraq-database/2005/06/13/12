Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0028

Package name:      kerberos5, mailman, mod_perl, openssl, php, spamassassin, tcpdump, telnet, wget
Summary:           Multiple security updates
Date:              2005-06-13
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kerberos5:
  (MIT) Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to
  provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using
  secret-key cryptography.  A free implementation of this protocol is
  available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is
  available in many commercial products as well.

  mailman:
  Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much like
  Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman gives
  each mailing list a webpage, and allows users to subscribe,
  unsubscribe, etc. over the Web. Even the list manager can administer
  his or her list entirely from the Web. Mailman also integrates most
  things people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving, mail
  <-> news gateways, and so on.
  
  When the package has finished installing, you sould read README.TRUSTIX for
  further instructions.
  
  Users upgrading from previous releases of this package may need to
  move their data or adjust the configuration files to point to the
  locations where their data is.

  mod_perl:
  Mod_perl incorporates a Perl interpreter into the Apache web server,
  so that the Apache web server can directly execute Perl code.
  Mod_perl links the Perl runtime library into the Apache web server and
  provides an object-oriented Perl interface for Apache's C language
  API.  The end result is a quicker CGI script turnaround process, since
  no external Perl interpreter has to be started.
  
  Install mod_perl if you're installing the Apache web server and you'd
  like for it to directly incorporate a Perl interpreter.

  openssl:
  A C library that provides various crytographic algorithms and protocols,
  including DES, RC4, RSA, and SSL. Includes shared libraries.

  php:
  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language.  PHP attempts to make it
  easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages.  PHP
  also offers built-in database integration for several commercial
  and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
  database-enabled web page with PHP is fairly simple.  The most
  common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI
  scripts.  The mod_php module enables the Apache web server to
  understand and process the embedded PHP language in web pages.

  spamassassin:
  SpamAssassin provides you with a way to reduce, if not completely
  eliminate, Unsolicited Bulk Email (or "spam") from your incoming email.
  It can be invoked by a MDA such as sendmail or postfix, or can be called
  from a procmail script, .forward file, etc.  It uses a
  genetic-algorithm-evolved scoring system to identify messages which look
  spammy, then adds headers to the message so they can be filtered by the
  user's mail reading software.  This distribution includes the
  spamd/spamc components which considerably speeds processing of mail.

  tcpdump:
  Tcpdump is a command-line tool for monitoring network traffic.
  Tcpdump can capture and display the packet headers on a particular
  network interface or on all interfaces.  Tcpdump can display all of
  the packet headers, or just the ones that match particular criteria.
  
  Install tcpdump if you need a program to monitor network traffic.

  telnet:
  Telnet is a popular protocol for logging into remote systems over the
  Internet.  The telnet package provides a command line telnet client.
  
  Install the telnet package if you want to telnet to remote machines.

  wget:
  GNU Wget is a file retrieval utility which can use either the HTTP or
  FTP protocols.  Wget features include the ability to work in the
  background while you're logged out, recursive retrieval of
  directories, file name wildcard matching, remote file timestamp
  storage and comparison, use of Rest with FTP servers and Range with
  HTTP servers to retrieve files over slow or unstable connections,
  support for Proxy servers, and configurability.
  
  Install wget if you need to retrieve large numbers of files with HTTP or
  FTP, or if you need a utility for mirroring web sites or FTP directories.

Problem description:
  kerberos5:
  - Security Fix: Buffer overflows in telnet client
  - The telnet client program supplied with MIT Kerberos 5 has buffer
    overflows in the functions slc_add_reply() and env_opt_add(), which
    may lead to remote code execution.
    
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CAN-2005-0469 and CAN-2005-0468 to this issue.
  
  mailman:
  - Fixing spool fcron directory for mailman
  - Cleanup of byte compiled python modules from spec
  - /etc/postfix/aliases should be updated with mailman settings
  - Restart only on upgrade situation, otherwise off.
  
  mod_perl:
  - Rebuilt on perl for effect changes in CGI.pm
  
  openssl:
  - Security Fix: Colin Percival reported a cache timing attack that could
    be used to allow a malicious local user to gain portions of
    cryptographic keys. The OpenSSL library has been patched to add a new
    fixed-window mod_exp implementation as default for RSA, DSA, and DH
    private key operations.  The patch was designed to mitigate cache
    timing and possibly related attacks.
  
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CAN-2005-0109 to this issue.

  php:
  - Added libxml2-devel, freetype, mhash-devel in buildrequires 
    Bug #877
  
  spamassassin:
  - New upstream
  
  tcpdump:
  - Fixed DOS Vulnerability, A vulnerability was identified in tcpdump,
    which may be exploited by attackers to cause a denial of service. This
    flaw resides in the "bgp_update_print()" function (print-bgp.c) that
    does not properly handle a specially crafted value returned by the
    "decode_prefix4()" function when processing BGP packets, which may be
    exploited by a remote attacker to cause the application to crash.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CAN-2005-1267 to this issue.
  
  telnet:
  - Security Fix: Buffer overflows in telnet client
  - The telnet client program supplied with MIT Kerberos 5 has buffer
    overflows in the functions slc_add_reply() and env_opt_add(), which
    may lead to remote code execution.
  
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CAN-2005-0469 and CAN-2005-0468 to these issues.

  wget:
  - Security Fix: wget allows a remote malicious web server to overwrite
    certain files via a redirection URL containing a ".." that resolves to
    the IP address of the malicious server, which bypasses wget's filtering
    for ".." sequences.
  - wget does not filter or quote control characters when displaying HTTP
    responses to the terminal, which may allow remote malicious web servers
    to inject terminal escape sequences and execute arbitrary code.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CAN-2004-1487 and CAN-2004-1487 to these issues.
