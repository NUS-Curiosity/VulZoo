Hi everyone,
phpBB Group announces the release of phpBB 2.0.16. This release addresses
some bugfixes and one critical security issue. To fix this, please apply
the following change: In viewtopic.php
Find:
$message = str_replace('"', '"',
substr(@preg_replace('#(>(((?>([^><]+|(?R)))*)<))#se',
"@preg_replace('#b(" . str_replace('\', '\\', $highlight_match) . ")b#i',
'<span style="color:#" . $theme['fontcolor3'] . ""><b>\\1</b></span>',
'\0')", '>' . $message . '<'), 1, -1)); Replace with:
$message = str_replace('"', '"',
substr(@preg_replace('#(>(((?>([^><]+|(?R)))*)<))#se',
"@preg_replace('#b(" . str_replace('\', '\\',
addslashes($highlight_match)) . ")b#i', '<span style="color:#" .
$theme['fontcolor3'] . ""><b>\\1</b></span>', '\0')", '>' . $message .
'<'), 1, -1)); If your mail program wraps the lines it is advised to get
the fix from the official announcement at:
http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=302011

We urge you to update as soon as possible. You can of course find this

those files changed from previous versions of phpBB. Please note this

contains patch compatible patches from the previous versions of phpBB.
Select whichever package is most suitable for you.
