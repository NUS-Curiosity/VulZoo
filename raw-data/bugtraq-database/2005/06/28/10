Subject: Whitepaper release: Risks of Passive Network Discovery Systems


I am pleased to announce the release of a new white paper titled: 
"Risks of Passive Network Discovery Systems"

From the abstract:
This paper sheds light on the weaknesses of passive network discovery and monitoring systems. It starts by defining passive 
network discovery, and goes over the advantages and disadvantages of the technology. It then demonstrates why passive 
network discovery cannot live up to its expectation, and is unable to deliver the promise of complete, accurate and granular 
network discovery and monitoring.
