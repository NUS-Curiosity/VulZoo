Does anyone know what the scope of this vulnerability actually is? "Critical
issue" isn't really enough to go on here. Are we talking arbitrary PHP code
execution or something lesser like SQL injection or slipping HTML into the
bbCode? Neither the phpBB Changelog or any advisories seem to mention what
the scope of this is. I'm guessing it's arbitrary PHP code execution based
on what previous vulnerabilities in phpBB have yielded, but it would be nice
to know for sure.
