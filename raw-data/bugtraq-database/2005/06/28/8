Subject: Weboot Window Washer Version 6.02.410 Will erase files from your PC


Hello All
This version will erase files from your PC. 

FYI: If you are running version 6.02.410 of Webroot's Window Washer, it will erase files and icons from your PC. Webroot's support team will not do anything to help you recover these files. Update to their latest build (411) immediately and hope (and prey) that this will fix the problem. 



Thank you 
Tamir Molamusa
