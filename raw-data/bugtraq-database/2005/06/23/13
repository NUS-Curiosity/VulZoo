To my knowledge the Red Hat Security Response Team received no notification
of this issue.  Please feel free to send all security related information
to security@...hat.com.

The bug the attached exploit tries to leverage has been assigned the name
CAN-2004-1235 by MITRE and to my knowledge has been fixed in the 2.6.11
kernel.  Since Fedora Core 4 contains a variant of the 2.6.11 kernel it
should not be affected.  I did compile then run the exploit with no
success.  If an aspect of this bug has not been correctly fixed, please
feel free to contact the Red Hat Security Response Team at the above
address.

Thanks, Josh
