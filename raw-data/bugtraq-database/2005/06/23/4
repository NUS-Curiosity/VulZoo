Subject: New release of the Auditor Security Collection available at http://www.remote-exploit.org


I am proud to announce the release of the new version of the Auditor
Security Collection CD-ROM. We put in a lot of effort to bring it into
that final look and feel. It seems to be the best version released
ever. Not only because of its completeness, no it seems to be the most
stable and bugfree version.

> '''!!IMPORTANT!!''' You will see that in this version you have to choose between two different ISO versions. This has to be done because systems with an integrated Intel b/g chip based wireless card will not boot with the ipw2100 driver on the cd. '''If you want to be able to use Auditor Security Collection on a system with an IPW2200 card you need to download the "-no-ip2100"''' version of the iso otherwise it will not boot.

> First of all there are now released two different iso's:
>
> ==== auditor-200605-02-no-ipw2100.iso: ====
> This version works with all systems including the laptops with intel B/G cards (ipw2200). Because there is not ipw2100 driver included, ipw2100 based intel B only wireless cards will not work. If you own/work on a system with an ipw2100 take the other iso, in any other case it is safe to take this one.

> ==== auditor-200605-02-ipw2100.iso: ====
> This version got the intel ipw2100 driver built int. This version will not work on systems which has ipw2200 based wireless cards built in. I repeat, dont use this version if you have an intel b/g wireless network card which is based on the ipw2200 driver. If you own a system with an ipw2200 supported card, take the other iso. All other should run fine.

> Sorry for that hassle about that damn ipw2200 instability, i hope the driver projects will fix their incompatibility soon so we can merge together. The funny thing is, that the ipw2100 card dont give a damn about the ipw2200 driver, but the ipw2200 system are hanging during booth, when an ipw2100 driver is probed during autodetection.
