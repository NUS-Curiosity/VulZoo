Subject: Windows IPSec Vulnerabilty - still exist

Hi list.
I found what mitm vulnerability in Microsoft's IPSec (http://lists.seifried.org/pipermail/security/2004-May/003394.html) still exists.
IPSec client don't verify subject field in certificate and accept certificates with OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2 (TLS Web client authentication). 
Certificates with OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2 (User Template) can be issued to any AD user by Enterprise CA by default.
