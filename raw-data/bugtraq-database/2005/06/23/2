Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in sudo may allow local users to elevate privileges.

Background
==========

sudo allows a system administrator to give users the ability to run
commands as other users.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/sudo     < 1.6.8_p9                         >= 1.6.8_p9

Description
===========

The sudoers file is used to define the actions sudo users are permitted
to perform. Charles Morris discovered that a specific layout of the
sudoers file could cause the results of an internal check to be
clobbered, leaving sudo vulnerable to a race condition.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would permit a local sudo user to execute
arbitrary commands as another user.

Workaround
==========

Reorder the sudoers file using the visudo utility to ensure the 'ALL'
pseudo-command precedes other command definitions.

Resolution
==========

All sudo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/sudo-1.6.8_p9"
