Subject: Still segfaults in man -k


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This was discussed earlier but in a different context: man -k tries to
execute a program called /unsafe/ when invoked with an argument
containing spaces.

Example: man -k 'a b'
sh: /unsafe/: No such file or directory
Error executing formatting or display command.
System command /unsafe/ exited with status 32512.

Execute attempt of /unsafe/ and segfault confirmed on Fedora Core 2
and Fedora Core 3.

No issues on Debian Sarge.

No issues on RH 7.3 and RHES3.

The earlier reports about /unsafe/ used a different vector as far as I
can see.  Apologies if it's the same bug.

Regards,
