How about anyone who ever hired a pen tester? It's quite impossible to 
have a comprehensive suite of tools without some collaboration, and just 
noting that the vulnerability may exist is not enough in many cases.

Blackhats may get along with only a handful of exploits, if they're 
willing to try to find targets to match their collection, but a 
pentester should have the collection to match the target.

This is doubly true if we're not talking about a dedicated pentester, 
but about a sysadmin with a networking/security background who likes to 
verify that the patches did, indeed, work.

Lastly, I know *I* subscribe to a mailinglist that announces new 
exploits - it gives me a good indication of how long a typical hacker 
takes to code an exploit once the vulnerability is released, plus it 
indicates when patching is past due.

I'm afraid we're not quite impressive enough, but finding some who are 
should not be too difficult.

Also, exploits will be distributed, publicly or otherwise - doing it in 
the open means we know what happens when.
