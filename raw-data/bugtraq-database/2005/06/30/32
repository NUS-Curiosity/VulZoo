Well, I'm not an end-user organization, but as an end user[%], the
major benefit I see to full disclosure is that it appears to be close
to the only thing that has any real success at getting vendors to fix
bugs.  (In general.  There certainly are vendors that stay on top of
things without needing the prod of public exploit disclosure.  But they
are notable by their rarity.)

[%] "End user" is not the only hat I wear.  It's just the one I'm
    wearing here.
