To that I say let the people producing the patches deliver the exploit code
as a POC that the patches did, indeed, work.  Releasing exploit code before
the patch is released helps nobody except the blackhats.

You should, as an admin, assume that once a vulnerability is released, the 
exploit has been too, whether you see it attached to the vuln announcement 
or not.
