Subject: RE: Publishing exploit code - what is it good for


I remember using a published exploit to show proof positive something 
malicious could be done to an email gateway. This so frightened the
higher ups they instituted a rigorous security policy and encouraged
me to keep abreast of constant developments. I have free reign to use
any code be it malicious or trustworthy to secure the systems I am
responsible for now.
