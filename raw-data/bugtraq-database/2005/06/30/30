I sysadmin a small number of machines, mainly Debian based. When an
exploit comes out, it's usually released as "version X is vulnerable". 
Debian's version numbers don't always directly match releases of the 
vulnerable software, so having exploit code available helps to verify 
whether or not the software is vulnerable, without having to wait for 
Debians advisory, which are usually released later than the vulnerability 
release. It's also very useful to decide whether you need to use a 
workaround (which may cause disruption or change to the service) or not.
