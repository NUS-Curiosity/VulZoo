Heh...very close-minded to begin with. Good luck trying any
argument with this "analyst".

You may wish to point out to your "analyst" that end-user benefits
are indirect  How many times have we seen organizations attempt
to sweep problems under the cover. This is an old, well understood
reason for full disclosure.  Now, how many times have their been
arguments about "this is not a code injection exploit, only a DoS,
so the customer impact is not severe, so we're delaying fixing this
until release X.Y in 3 months time", only to find someone
actually coded an exploit to prove that a vulnerability is fully
exploitable.

The end result:  Exploit code, responsibly handled, serves the exact
same purpose that vulnerability information disclosure serves: an
accountability mechanism to ensure that Vendors do not attempt to
bury information that they perceive to negatively impact their products
and services.  Thus, exploit code serves the customer by ensuring
that vendors handle vulnerabilities promptly because the vendor is
aware that exploits will likely be developed, and that the negative
publicity of exploits running wild against their products outweigh
the negative publicity of admitting (and fixing) a vulnerability.

But, somehow, giving the attitude your analyst is conveying, I'd say
more effort has been expended than is worthwhile.
