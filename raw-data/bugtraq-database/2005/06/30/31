I think its a question of what the role of the 'security administrator' is within
the enterprise.  If their job is primarily threat evaluation and appropriate
patching/updating in response, then I agree that the publication of an exploit
is not very helpful.  If, however, the job is firewall/IDS management or
incident investigation, then having access to actual exploit code is
extremely valuable to have.
