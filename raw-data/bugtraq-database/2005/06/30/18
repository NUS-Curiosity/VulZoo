Getting a serious bug fixed before full-disclosure was much harder.  Any
and all potential isssues were just denied by vendors.  Denial no longer
worked after everyone could just google for a working exploit.  Then
vendors got a bit of religion and started admitting and fixing a few
things.

Same thing for customer networks.  "It ain't broke so we won't fix fix
it" was the ruile of the day.  Now when a pen test, using a public
exploit, pokes a hole in a customer system there is a chance they may
fix it.  They can no longer claim that just because you found it does
not mean the bad guys can.

Going back to the old ways is just burying our collective heads in the
sand again.  Nothing got fixed because no-one could "prove" there was
a problem.

Now that some things get fixed, the net is safer for all on the net.
