Subject: Re: Publishing exploit code - what is it good for


The discussion is only theoretical and of no business importance.

Exploits are disclosed, that's a fact that I as security manager have to 
live and work with.

If this disclosure is good or bad is totally irrelevant.

Anyone who discovers an exploitable weakness, informs the supplier and 
then shuts up for months and months is fooled by his/her own ego.

There's nothing that says the he/she/it is the only one who has 
discovered this flaw, actually, there's good reason to believe that it's 
already known by black hats.

Give developers a chance to react? Yes.
If they don't react? Publish.
