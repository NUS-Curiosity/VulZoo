This is not really a vulnerablity but more a lack of detection on this
malware, because try to do the same with hackdefender, sophos and
kaspersky are much advanced than the others AV to detect it, believe
me, I got it undetected with your method on almost all av , instead of
sophos and kaspersky using some signature that if you mod, you break
the program , nor yu should understand some asm.
