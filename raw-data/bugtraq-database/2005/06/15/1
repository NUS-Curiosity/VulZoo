Subject: Re: Bluetooth SIG Denial of Service vulnerability



  I should let it be known that I've tried to post a program I've creted
on bugtraq for some time now,.  My program (TBEAR), includes a DoS tool
that does this same thing.  It is located at http://www.transient-iss.com.
My requests to post this have been ignored multiple times, so I ended up
just throwing it up on freshmeat.
