Synopsis
========

cpio contains a flaw which may allow a specially crafted cpio archive
to extract files to an arbitrary directory.

Background
==========

cpio is a file archival tool which can also read and write tar files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/cpio      < 2.6-r3                             >= 2.6-r3

Description
===========

A vulnerability has been found in cpio that can potentially allow a
cpio archive to extract its files to an arbitrary directory of the
creator's choice.

Impact
======

An attacker could create a malicious cpio archive which would create
files in arbitrary locations on the victim's system. This issue could
also be used in conjunction with a previous race condition
vulnerability (CAN-2005-1111) to change permissions on files owned by
the victim.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All cpio users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/cpio-2.6-r3"
