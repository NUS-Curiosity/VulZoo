Subject: Security Contact for Lyris


I am trying to reach the security contact at Lyris (www.lyris.com).  I 
sent an email to every address listed on the web site and keep getting 
blown off by the operator when I call[1]. The OSVDB Vendor Dictionary has 
no contact information listed for Lyris. There are a number of serious, 
remotely-exploitable issues in the ListManager product...

1. On the first call, I asked for product development or someone in the 
security department. The operator asked me why I was calling, I explained 
that I was trying to report a security vulnerability. Shes asks if I want 
sales, I try to explain again why I am calling. I was transferred in 
mid-sentence to a voicemail box with no name. I called back again, this 
time using their voice menu to transfer to sales. The same operator picks 
up the call and I try to explain the situation again. I ask for sales, 
she won't forward me because I "don't want to purchase the product". I 
ask for customer support, she won't forward me because I am not a current 
customer. I explain again that I am trying to do them a favor and that I 
really need to contact someone in the product development or security 
departments. The call ends.
