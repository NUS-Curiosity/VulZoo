Synopsis
========

Gld contains several serious vulnerabilities, potentially resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code as the root user.

Background
==========

Gld is a standalone greylisting server for Postfix.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-filter/gld       <= 1.4                               >= 1.5

Description
===========

dong-hun discovered several buffer overflows in server.c, as well as
several format string vulnerabilities in cnf.c.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code
with the permissions of the user running Gld, the default user being
root.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Gld users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-filter/gld-1.5"
