Subject: Placing Backdoors Through Firewalls


---[ Placing Backdoors Through Firewalls ]---
v1.5


Author: van Hauser / THC



----[ Introduction

This article describes possible backdoors through different firewall
architectures. However, the material can also be applied to other
environments to describe how hackers (you?) cover their access to a
system.

Hackers often want to retain access to systems they have penetrated
even in the face of obstacles such as new firewalls and patched
vulnerabilities. To accomplish this the attackers must install a
backdoor which a) does it's job and b) is not easily detectable. The
kind of backdoor needed depends on the firewall architecture used.

As a gimmick and proof-of-concept, a nice backdoor for any kind of
intrusion is included, so have fun.
