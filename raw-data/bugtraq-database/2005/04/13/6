Subject: QuickTime for Windows malformed GIF DoS




QuickTime for Windows has problems with malformed GIF images. Open test.gif with PictureViewer and it will crash. DrWatson is reporting access violation. Main reason for crash is malformed value of "depth start", in test.gif this value is set to 255 (0xff hexadecimal). I've tested about twenty different values in range 0x00-0xfe, and PictureViewer in all cases reports that file is corrupted. It leads to assumption that there is some kind of integer overflow in processing GIF files.

Also, this could be done with almost any GIF file. Simply change "depth start" byte to 0xff. If it doesn't crash PictureViewer try to change width and height of logical screen in GIF header.

I dont know if this could be used for code execution.

This is tested on freshly updated QuickTime, version 6.5.2.

And here is test.gif:

00000000 :47 49 46 38 39 61 0F 01 - 0F 01 00 00 00 21 F9 04
00000010 :00 00 00 00 00 2C 00 00 - 00 00 00 01 00 01 00 FF
