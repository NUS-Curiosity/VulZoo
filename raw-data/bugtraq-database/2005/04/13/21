Subject: Windows kernel overflow fixed


John Heasman of NGSSoftware has discovered a high risk vulnerability in the 
Microsoft Windows kernel.  The vulnerability (CAN-2005-0060) permits a 
logged-on user to escalate privileges to take full control of the system 
when Windows processes certain types of font.

Microsoft has developed a patch to fix the problem. More information can be 
found here:

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about this flaw for three months. 
Full details will be published on the Tuesday, 12th of July 2005. This three 
month window will allow Microsoft customers the time needed to test and 
apply the patch before the details are released to the general public. This 
reflects NGSSoftware's new approach to responsible disclosure.

Typhon III, NGSSoftware's advanced vulnerability assessment scanner, has 
been updated to check for and positively identify this flaw. More
