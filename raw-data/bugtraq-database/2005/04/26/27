Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities have been found in xine-lib which could lead to the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

xine-lib is a multimedia library which can be utilized to create
multimedia frontends.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xine-lib      < 1.0-r2                       >= 1.0-r2
                                                          *>= 1_rc6-r2

Description
===========

Heap overflows have been found in the code handling RealMedia RTSP and
Microsoft Media Services streams over TCP (MMST).

Impact
======

By setting up a malicious server and enticing a user to use its
streaming data, a remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code
on the client computer with the permissions of the user running any
multimedia frontend making use of the xine-lib library.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose media-libs/xine-lib
