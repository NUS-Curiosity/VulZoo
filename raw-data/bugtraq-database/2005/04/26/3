I don't think anyone here is arguing the concept of "full disclosure".  By 
all means go for it.  I've done so in the past myself.  Point I'm making 
here is, why issue a disclosure without suggesting any kind of patch 
coupled with the fact that the vendor wasn't even notified.

What's the point of humanity?  To me its helping each other out.  Without 
vendor notification and/or a suggested patch, what's the point of having a 
disclosure that actually helps sysadmins protect their systems?

Granted this disclosure calls itself a low risk.  But what if it were a 
high risk that could sweep itself across the net bringing websites down, 
causing people to lose time and sleep trying to figure out what a decent 
patch is?

Moral fiber.

Its not about requirements.  Its about doing the right thing.  Lets 
analyze what the OP released.  If it contained a suggested patch then I 
would not have replied nor had an issue with the release.  We wouldn't 
even be having this discussion.

Last I checked slavery was abolished.  The pros play nicely, and if 
someone wants to get into the game, then be mature about it and place nice 
too.

As above, I would have been fine if the OP posted a suggested patch.  One 
wasn't offered.  If not, then contact the vendor.  What was the reason to 
release the disclosure so quickly?  Was it about "losing credit"?  phpbb 
and other vendors I've worked with honor full credits.

I see the point I'm trying to deliver is being missed.

That is perfectly fine in my book too.  But the OP didn't state that in 
his release now did he?  Some vendors can't be bothered about disclosures.  
So state that, and still offer a suggested patch.  If you are incapable of 
producing one, find someone who will.

Seems the whole MVP thing turns out to be a sticking point?  I've replied 
many times in these seclists and have never generated such a discussion 
before.

What is the status quo?  Russ Cooper of NTBugtraq wrote today about the 
NGS Software disclosure on Sybase and how Sybase was threatening them with 
legal action if it were released (to be in 3 months after vendor 
notification):

"NGS, a very responsible security company, informed Sybase of the 
vulnerabilities and stated they would publish details in three months. 
This is perfectly normal and acceptable practice in the security arena."



> No offense meant, but can't we all just get along on this little playground?

I thought that was the whole idea?  Getting along and helping each other 
out.  Ergo why I replied in the first place to the OP.
