Renaming the files would indeed be a maintenance nightmare, but I don't
see a reason why the webserver hosting the image can't do a referrer
check, and only serve the real images if they are being loaded from the
real domain. In all other cases they could return a "THIS IS A FAKE
PAGE" image, or perhaps even some shock site[1]
