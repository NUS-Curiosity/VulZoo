Synopsis
========

Gaim contains multiple vulnerabilities that can lead to a Denial of
Service.

Background
==========

Gaim is a full featured instant messaging client which handles a
variety of instant messaging protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/gaim       < 1.2.1                                >= 1.2.1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been addressed in the latest release of
Gaim:

* A buffer overread in the gaim_markup_strip_html() function, which
  is used when logging conversations (CAN-2005-0965).

* Markup tags are improperly escaped using Gaim's IRC plugin
  (CAN-2005-0966).

* Sending a specially crafted file transfer request to a Gaim Jabber
  user can trigger a crash (CAN-2005-0967).

Impact
======

An attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service by exploiting any
of these vulnerabilities.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Gaim users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/gaim-1.2.1"
