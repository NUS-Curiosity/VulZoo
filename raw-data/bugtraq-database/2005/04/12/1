Subject: [WHITEPAPER] Bugger The Debugger


Bugger The Debugger
 - Pre Interaction Debugger Code Execution

The use of debuggers to analyse malicious or otherwise unknown binaries
has become a requirement for reverse engineering executables to help
determine their purpose.

While researchers in places such as anti-virus laboratories have always
done this, with the availability of free and easy to use debuggers it has
also become popular with corporate security officers and home users.
One of the main purposes of a debugger is to allow the user to control
the execution of a binary in such a way as to determine what instructions
or commands the binary is executing. During malware analysis the user
can modify what the binary is trying to execute, or prevent it all together.

This paper will demonstrate methods that may be used by malware to
execute code, simply by being loaded into a debugging session.

The paper can be downloaded from the whitepapers section of our website.
