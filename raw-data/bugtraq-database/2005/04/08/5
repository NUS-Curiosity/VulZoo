    * Synopsis: MacOSX Java Runtime Environment Remote Denial-of-Service
(DoS) Vulnerability
    * Category: Security
    * Product: Java SDK and JRE
    * State: Open
    * Vendor Informed: 03-Apr-2005, 06-Apr-2005
    * Found by: Marc Schoenefeld, www.illegalaccess.org
Impact:

A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) involving object
deserialization could be exploited remotely to cause the Java Virtual
Machine to become unresponsive, which is a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS).
This issue can affect
the JRE if an application that runs on it accepts serialized data from an
untrusted source.
This affects applets, RMI/JRMP, RMI/IIOP and other remoting protocols that
rely on
ObjectInputStream listeners.

The Vulnerability is related to the readObject vulnerability in Sun JDK
1.4.2_05 and earlier
(http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-57707-1).
Although Sun fixed the bug in JDK 1.4.2_06 for the Intel platforms the
Security Update from Apple did not include this fix in their
java version.

Relief/Workaround

There is no workaround. And the vendor does not react to bug reports
(informed twice to product-security@...le.com).
