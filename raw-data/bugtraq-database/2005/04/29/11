Subject: NY sues Spyware Intermix, funded by Tiaa-Cref


In a very revealing article:  
http://castlecops.com/article-5943-nested-0-0.html the company Intermix
currently being sued by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer for being a "major
spyware distributor" has a wide and reaching/tangled web of funding and
history.  Tiaa-Cref is one such funding institution that claims
"integrity".  Just what kind of moral fiber is this?
