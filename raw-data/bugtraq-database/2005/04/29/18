Summary:

   Impact:                  Local/remote password cracking

   Rating/Severity:         Medium
   Recommendation:          Update to latest version
                            Enforce network ACLs
                            Enforce password policies

   Vendor:                  Kerio Technologies Inc.

   Affected software:

              o Kerio WinRoute Firewall up to and including 6.0.10

              o Kerio Personal Firewall up to and including 4.1.2

              o Kerio MailServer up to and including 6.0.8

   Updates/Patches:         Yes (see below)

General Information:

   1. Executive summary:
      ------------------

      Kerio WinRoute Firewall, Kerio Personal Firewall and Kerio
      MailServer drive a local/remote administration protocol in order
      to manage the service.

      This protocol can be abused in order to remotely retrieve user
      credentials through a brute forcing technique. Passwords 1-5
      characters long could be obtained quickly. As such, Kerio considers
      them insecure and recommends enforcing password policies. The
      attack is not practically usable for passwords longer than 5
      characters. User logins must be previously known for this attack to
      be successful.

      The logging component of the software can loose up to 40% of the
      events when the attack is in place.

      In order solve this problem, system administrators should enforce
      network ACL security settings and user password policies. It is
      also highly recommended to verify this settings as part of the
      planning, installation, hardening and auditing processes.

      New versions of the software solve this and other minor problems
      so an upgrade is highly recommended.

   2. Technical details:
      ------------------

      Technical details and proof of concept code were provided to
      vendor.


   3. Risk Assessment factors:
      ------------------------

      The attacker should have access to the administration ports:

        o TCP/UDP 44333 - Kerio WinRoute Firewall Administration

        o TCP/UDP 44334 - Kerio Personal Firewall Administration

        o TCP/UDP 44337 - Kerio MailServer Administration

      Network effective bandwidth between the system and the attacker is
      also an important speed and success factor.

      User logins must be previously known or previously brute forced
      for this attack to be successful.

      Special attention should be taken on environments on which NT,
      Active Directory or Open Directory integration is in place.
      GINA.DLL re-login delay features are bypassed and therefore the
      brute forcing procedure is considerably quicker.

      Local/Domain User Lock-out policies can help on contenting this
      attack. Despite that, an user login denial of service can emerge
      as a side effect.

      The most risky scenarios are the ones in which the server machine
      is shared among two or more interactive users/administrators or
      those situations where Kerio service management have been
      delegated to a third party.

      The weakeness on the logging facility can be a target on its own
      in order to hide any other attack that is being performed
      simultaneously.

      Special care should be taken on such environments and every step
      of the project: design, planning, deployment and management
      should consider this security issues.

      Privilege escalation, system and software tampering and the
      ability to alter service configuration are all real issues and
      all of them can be used as a second stage attack vector.


   4. Solutions and recommendations:
      ------------------------------

      Upgrade to the latest versions:

         o Kerio Winroute Firewall 6.0.11 and above

         o Kerio Personal Firewall 4.1.3 and above

         o Kerio MailServer 6.0.9 and above

      As in any other case, follow, as much as possible, the Industry
      'Best Practices' on Planning, Deployment and Operation on this
      kind of services.


   5. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project:
      ---------------------------------------------------

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has
      assigned the name CAN-2005-1062 to this issue. This is a
      candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org),
      which standardizes names for security problems.
