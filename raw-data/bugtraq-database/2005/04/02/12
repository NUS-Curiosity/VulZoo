The user is opening a data file, like he would open a JPEG image or a 
MP3 audio file. Since the rule of thumb is that data does not harm, only 
code does, it is a security vulnerability.

Newer Access versions throw a security warning if the VBA code is not 
signed and let the user disable VBA execution. The issue highlighted by 
hexview is able to circumvent this security-related feature.
