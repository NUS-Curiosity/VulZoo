Subject: [Artice] Click Fraud FAQ


What Is Click Fraud?

Click fraud, or click spamming, occurs when a person or program
accesses a URL with no intention of browsing the site, purchasing a
product or performing any other type of conversion action. That
definition may be hard to understand so we have put together some
examples of the types of click fraud that is occurring every day (and
may be occurring to you!) and how these fraudulent activities occur.

How Is Click Fraud Committed?
Paid to Click Jobs
"A growing number of housewives, college graduates, and even working
professionals across metropolitan cities are rushing to click paid
Internet ads to make $100 to $200 (up to Rs 9,000) per month," the
Times of India claims. This article was published in May of 2004 and
serves as a wakeup call to all online advertisers. These companies are
popping up all over and have many different ways to defraud PPC
advertisers. They pay people to search for certain keywords, click on
certain ads and even tell them to stay on each site a certain amount
of time so it doesn't look suspicious. They also even email ads to
employees to have them click. Why does this happen? For the reasons
above, competitors and affiliates hire these companies because they
are able to increase the cost to their competitors or increase their
own revenue through their advertising affiliate programs which ever
they choose.
