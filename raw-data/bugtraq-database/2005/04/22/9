1. Systems affected:

        kdelibs as shipped with KDE 3.2 up to including KDE 3.4.


2. Overview:

        kimgio contains a PCX image file format reader that does
        not properly perform input validation. A source code audit
        performed by the KDE security team discovered several
        vulnerabilities in the PCX and other image file format
        readers, some of them exploitable to execute arbitrary
        code.


3. Impact:

        Remotly supplied, specially crafted image files can be used
        to execute arbitrary code.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.


5. Patch:

        A patch for KDE 3.4.0 is available from 
        ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches :
