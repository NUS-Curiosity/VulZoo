It is irrelevant here, if I am reading this correctly:

"collision search attacks"
Basically, multiple input data that have the same output hash, which is
of no use when what you are trying to find is the input.
Finding collisions quicker for a known input is one thing, but that is
not going to reduce the search space, not even your storage space (it is
unlikely that the colliding results would all be valid input).

Is adding the non-guessable salt that hard anyway?
