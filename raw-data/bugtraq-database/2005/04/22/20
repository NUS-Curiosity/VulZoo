Synopsis
========

Kommander executes remote scripts without confirmation, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems. Kommander is a visual dialog editor and
interpreter for KDE applications, part of the kdewebdev package.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  kde-base/kdewebdev     < 3.3.2-r1                     >= 3.3.2-r1

Description
===========

Kommander executes data files from possibly untrusted locations without
user confirmation.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running Kommander.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All kdewebdev users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdewebdev-3.3.2-r1"
