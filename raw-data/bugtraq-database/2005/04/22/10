Update
======

The initial version did not fix several DoS vulnerabilities and one instance 
of arbitrary code execution. The arbitrary code execution was only possible 
under very specific circumstances.

The updated sections appear below.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-util/cvs      < 1.11.20                            >= 1.11.20

Description
===========

Alen Zukich has discovered several serious security issues in CVS,
including at least one buffer overflow (CAN-2005-0753), memory leaks
and a NULL pointer dereferencing error. Furthermore when launching
trigger scripts CVS includes a user controlled directory.

Resolution
==========

All CVS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/cvs-1.11.20"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
