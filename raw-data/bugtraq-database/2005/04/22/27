Subject: [PLSN-0001] - Multiple vulnerabilities in Gaim

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peachtree Linux Security Notice PLSN-0001
April 19, 2005

Remote code execution and remote DoS vulnerability in PHP
CAN-2005-0524, CAN-2005-0525, CAN-2005-1042, CAN-2005-1043
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following Peachtree Linux releases are affected:

   Peachtree Linux release 1 ("Atlanta")

Description:

   CAN-2005-0524:  The php_handle_iff function in image.c for PHP 4.2.2,
   4.3.9, 4.3.10 and 5.0.3, as reachable by the getimagesize PHP function,
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop)
   via a -8 size value.

   CAN-2005-0525:  The php_next_marker function in image.c for PHP 4.2.2,
   4.3.9, 4.3.10 and 5.0.3, as reachable by the getimagesize PHP function,
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop)
   via a JPEG image with an invalid marker value, which causes a negative
   length value to be passed to php_stream_seek.

   CAN-2005-1042:  Integer overflow in the exif_process_IFD_TAG function
   in exif.c in PHP before 4.3.11 may allow remote attackers to execute
   arbitrary code via an IFD tag that leads to a negative byte count.

   CAN-2005-1043:  exif.c in PHP before 4.3.11 allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (memory consumption and crash) via an EXIF
   header with a large IFD nesting level, which causes significant stack
   recursion.
