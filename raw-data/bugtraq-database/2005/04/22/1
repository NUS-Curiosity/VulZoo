Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0013

Package name:      cvs
Summary:           buffer overflow
Date:              2005-04-20
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  CVS (Concurrent Version System) is a version control system that can
  record the history of your files (usually, but not always, source
  code). CVS only stores the differences between versions, instead of
  every version of every file you have ever created. CVS also keeps a log
  of who, when, and why changes occurred.


Problem description:
  From the NEWS file:
  - Thanks to a report from Alen Zukich <alen.zukich@...cwork.com>, several
    minor security issues have been addressed.  One was a buffer overflow
    that is potentially serious but which may not be exploitable, assigned
    CAN-2005-0753 by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project
    <http://www.cve.mitre.org>.  Other fixes resulting from Alen's report
    include repair of an arbitrary free with no known exploit and several
    plugged memory leaks and potentially freed NULL pointers which may have
    been exploitable for a denial of service attack.

  - Thanks to a report from Craig Monson <craig@...achiarts.com>, minor
    potential vulnerabilities in the contributed Perl scripts have been
    fixed.  The confirmed vulnerability could allow the execution of
    arbitrary code on the CVS server, but only if a user already had
    commit access and if one of the contrib scripts was installed
    improperly, a condition which should have been quickly visible to
    any administrator.  The complete description of the problem is here:
    <https://ccvs.cvshome.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=224>.  If you were
    making use of any of the contributed trigger scripts on a CVS server,
    you should probably still replace them with the new versions, to be
    on the safe side.


Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
