Subject: iDEFENSE Labs Releases OllyDbg Breakpoint Manager


An internal iDEFENSE Labs tool, OllyDbg Breakpoint Manager, has been
released as open source and is available for download from:

http://labs.idefense.com

Authored by Pedram Amini, iDEFENSE Labs is releasing OllyDbg Breakpoint
Manager, an OllyDbg plug-in developed to address some shortcomings of
the built-in breakpoint management functionality. The plug-in provides
three main functions - breakpoint exporting, breakpoint importing and
automatic breakpoint loading. Offsets are used in place of absolute
addresses to support setting and restoring breakpoints on modules that
move around in memory. More information, examples and source code are
available in the bundled archive.

Additionally, past releases including IDA Sync, IDA pGRAPH and IDA
Function Analyzer have all been ported for compatibility with the IDA
4.8 SDK. Packaged binaries for 4.7 have been replaced with binaries for
4.8.
