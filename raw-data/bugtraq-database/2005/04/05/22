Subject: Smartcard-Logon and NTLM-Backward Compatability


Hi!

Lets have following szenario:

1) We have a Windows 2000 AD and Windows XP Clients. All users have a
smartcard and logon to their windows client with the smartcard. This
means that authentication with the AD happens via Kerberos and client
certificate.

2) In the Intranet we have a web server (Tomcat with JCIFS) which uses
NTLMv2 to authenticate the users against the AD. The web server does not
support Kerberos. As far as I now NTLM does only work with
username/passwords and not with smartcards. (Please correct me if I am
wrong)

Question:
1) Is it possible that a user with smartcard logon can login to the web
server with NTLM?
2) When 1) is possible then how does the client machine know the
password to be used for NTLM authentication?
3) If a password is used then I would like to know which password it is
and who generated it?
4) Does the parallel use of NTLM "with smartcard" weaken the
Smartcard-Logon with Kerberos. As far as I know client certificates with
Kerberos is very secure.
5) If no password is used for NTLM with the web server is a Kerberos
ticket passed through the NTLM mechanisms?

I know that it would be best to migrate everything to Kerberos, but I
have to know answers exactly to the above szenario.

Thank you very much for your help!

Kind regards
Jan
