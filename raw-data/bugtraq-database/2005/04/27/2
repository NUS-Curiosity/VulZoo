Even if you don't get your web host to do it themselves if you use PHP you
can easily make simple scripts that perform the same function.  I'd imagine
you could do the same with ASP. net if you use that instead.

Renaming the files would indeed be a maintenance nightmare, but I don't
see a reason why the webserver hosting the image can't do a referrer
check, and only serve the real images if they are being loaded from the
real domain. In all other cases they could return a "THIS IS A FAKE
PAGE" image, or perhaps even some shock site[1]
