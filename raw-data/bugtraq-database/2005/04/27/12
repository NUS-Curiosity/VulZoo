Subject: iDEFENSE Labs Releases dltrace


iDEFENSE Labs is pleased to announce the release of dltrace, a portable
dynamic library call tracer. dltrace attempts to remain portable to all
x86 platforms which support the execution of ELF binaries and expose a
debugging interface via procfs or the ptrace() system call. The shared
library call tracing is done at a level which allows all calls to all
exported symbols in loaded libraries to be traced. In addition, dltrace
does not rely on specific rtld exports to retrieve library and symbol
information and is capable of determing function arguments dynamically
via run-time disassembly.

dltrace has been released as open source and is available for download
from:
