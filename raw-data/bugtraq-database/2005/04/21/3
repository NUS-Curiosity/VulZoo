That's what I told him.  I think his concern about pre-computed hashes
is the only real issue, and give 'postgres' is usually the super-user, I
can see someone pre-computing md5 postgres hashes and doing quick
comparisons, perhaps as a root kit so you don't have to do the hashing
yourself.   I personally don't find that very compelling either.
