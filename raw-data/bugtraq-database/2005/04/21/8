Synopsis
========

openMosixview and the openMosixcollector daemon are vulnerable to
symlink attacks, potentially allowing a local user to overwrite
arbitrary files.

Background
==========

The openMosixview package contains several tools used to manage
openMosix clusters, including openMosixview (the main monitoring and
administration application) and openMosixcollector (a daemon collecting
cluster and node information).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                    /  Vulnerable  /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-cluster/openmosixview      < 1.5-r1                 >= 1.5-r1

Description
===========

Gangstuck and Psirac from Rexotec discovered that openMosixview
insecurely creates several temporary files with predictable filenames.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
openMosixView or the openMosixcollector daemon runs, this would result
in the file being overwritten with the rights of the user running the
utility, which could be the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All openMosixview users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-cluster/openmosixview-1.5-r1"
