Synopsis
========

The unshar utility is vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially
allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

sharutils is a collection of tools to deal with shar archives.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/sharutils      < 4.2.1-r11                  >= 4.2.1-r11

Description
===========

Joey Hess has discovered that the program unshar, which is a part of
sharutils, creates temporary files in a world-writable directory with
predictable names.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
unshar is executed, this would result in the file being overwritten
with the rights of the user running the utility, which could be the
root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All sharutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/sharutils-4.2.1-r11"
