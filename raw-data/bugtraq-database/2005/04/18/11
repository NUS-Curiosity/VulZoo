I can confirm that the POC works on 1.0.2 and does not work on 1.0.3.

Subject: Firelinking [Firefox 1.0.2]

__Notice

I really wonder why the Mozilla Foundation decided to release a serious 
security update on a friday night and to disclose the link to my 
proof-of-concept code so quickly. It wasn't intendet from my side to
release 
this as a 0day exploit. Please complain to security@...illa.org if you 
disagree with their release policy.

__Summary

The link tag allows to load a custom image as the icon for a website, 
displayed in the location bar and in the tab title.

By setting the href attribute of this tag to a javascript url, it is 
possible to call chrome functions and run arbitrary code without user 
interaction.

__Proof-of-Concept

http://www.mikx.de/firelinking/

__Status

The bug is fixed in Firefox 1.0.3. Disable Javascript as a workaround.

2005-04-12 Vendor informed (bugzilla.mozilla.org #290036)
