Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities in DBMS_CDC_SUBSCRIBE and
DBMS_CDC_ISUBSCRIBE packages

AppSecInc Team SHATTER Security Advisory
http://www.appsecinc.com/resources/alerts/oracle/2005-02.html
April 18, 2005

Affected Versions: Oracle Database Server version 10g

Risk level: High

Credits: This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban
Martínez Fayó of Argeniss for Application Security Inc.

Details:
The SUBSCRIPTION_NAME parameter -- used in various procedures of
SYS.DBMS_CDC_SUBSCRIBE and SYS.DBMS_CDC_ISUBSCRIBE packages -- is
vulnerable to SQL injection. These packages execute with privileges of
the SYS user; by default, PUBLIC has EXECUTE privilege.

Impact:
Any low privileged database user can execute functions with DBA
privileges. Users with privilges to create or modify a function can
inject a user-defined function in the vulnerable procedure and thus
execute SQL statements with DBA privileges.

Workaround:
Revoke Execute privilege on the vulnerable packages.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update April 2005 available at
http://metalink.oracle.com
