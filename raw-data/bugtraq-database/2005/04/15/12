Perusing the code seems to reveal that gzip is written this way for no
good reason...  It may have been to support operating systems which
don't allow the third argument of open(), but looking at the code, the
only supported OS which doesn't support the modes argument seems to be
MacOS (presumably not MacOS X).  However MacOS also seems not to
support chmod(), so there seems to be little point in separating the
two operations...  The code already defines the OPEN macro which
either uses or ignores the third (modes)  argument to open() as
needed.

Therefore the attached patch should apply  to gzip 1.2.4 (and quite
probably to 1.3.x as well) and fix the problem.

N.B.: I didn't actually test the patch, but it looks right to me.
Yeah, I'm that lazy... =8^)
