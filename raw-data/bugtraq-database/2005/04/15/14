Synopsis
========

Format string and Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been
discovered in the monkeyd HTTP server, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

monkeyd is a fast, efficient, small and easy to configure web server
for Linux.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/monkeyd       < 0.9.1                        >= 0.9.1

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered a
double expansion error in monkeyd, resulting in a format string
vulnerability. Ciaran McCreesh of Gentoo Linux discovered a Denial of
Service vulnerability, a syntax error caused monkeyd to zero out
unallocated memory should a zero byte file be requested.

Impact
======

The format string vulnerability could allow an attacker to send a
specially crafted request to the monkeyd server, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
monkeyd. The DoS vulnerability could allow an attacker to disrupt the
operation of the web server, should a zero byte file be accessible.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All monkeyd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/monkeyd-0.9.1"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
