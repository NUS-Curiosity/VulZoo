Synopsis
========

Pound is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could lead to the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Pound is a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTPS front-end.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/pound       < 1.8.3                          >= 1.8.3

Description
===========

Steven Van Acker has discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
"add_port()" function in Pound.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a request for an overly long hostname
parameter, which could lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the rights of the Pound daemon process (by default, Gentoo uses
the "nobody" user to run the Pound daemon).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Pound users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/pound-1.8.3"
