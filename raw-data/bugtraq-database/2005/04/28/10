Subject: High risk flaw in HP OpenView Radia Management Agent


David Morgan and Dominic Beecher of NGSSoftware Ltd have discovered a
high risk vulnerability in HP's OpenView Radia Management Portal (RMP)
Radia Management Agent (RMA). The vulnerability permits unauthenticated
remote execution of arbitrary commands, generally in the context of a
high-privileged account (Local System on Windows operating systems), on
affected hosts.

HP has developed a patch to fix the problem. More information can be
found in their security bulletin HPSBMA01138:

http://itrc.hp.com/service/cki/docDisplay.do?docId=HPSBMA01138

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about this flaw for three
months; full details will be published on 28 July 2005. This three month
window will allow HP customers the time needed to test and apply the
patch before the details are released to the general public. This
reflects NGSSoftware's approach to responsible disclosure.
