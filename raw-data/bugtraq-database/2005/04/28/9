Subject: OT: Two Factor Authentication on Linux / Mac /

Apologies for being off-topic.

Public Service: http://public.paynacea.com

If anyone is interested, I am currently testing my new two-factor
authentication system and am offering the service for free. It does
not use keys, tags or other special hardware since it authenticates a
user by calling them on their land / cell phone and requesting a PIN
code.

The software has a comprehensive easy-to-use API (complete with
documentation), and is designed to be highly-available.

The client tools are open-sourced and distributed under the GPL. The
tools include PAM modules (w/ binaries for Solaris, Linux and OS X),
administration software and samples.

If you have your own web sites, servers, VPNs etc. that you maintain;
you might find this service very useful. Integrating the system with
existing software, sites or services etc. is almost trivial.

If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me off-list.

Mohit.
