Synopsis
========

eGroupWare is affected by several SQL injection and cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

eGroupWare is a suite of web-based group applications including
calendar, address book, messenger and email.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/egroupware      < 1.0.0.007                 >= 1.0.0.007

Description
===========

Multiple SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have
been found in several eGroupWare modules.

Impact
======

An attacker could possibly use the SQL injection vulnerabilites to gain
information from the database. Furthermore the cross-site scripting
issues give an attacker the ability to inject and execute malicious
script code or to steal cookie based authentication credentials,
potentially compromising the victim's browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All eGroupWare users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/egroupware-1.0.0.007"
