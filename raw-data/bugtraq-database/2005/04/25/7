Subject: Sql Injection in Confixx 3.06 & 3.08 & 3.?? ?


Sql injection is possbile with reseller rights:
i.e. it is possible to enter '# in the "change user" field. 
as result you get a list of all added users on the server. With 
a special malformed string it is possible
to execute any sql command as confixx mysql user 
to the confixx database.

Vendor was informed about over a month ago, while 3.06 was
up to date. 3.08 was released, bug still exists.
