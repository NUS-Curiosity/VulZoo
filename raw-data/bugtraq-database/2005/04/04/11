Has anyone here been able to contact this company and gotten
any reasonable response (i.e. some real and competent person,
not automated replies or replies that clearly tell you the
person responding did not even read your request)?

I have not - and that pertains to all 3 times I tried
to contact them up to now.

Maybe some paypal-person reading here?


Regards,
Michael
