It has been my experience that contacting paypal regarding anything is
an exercise in futility: they really don't read much... just send a canned
letter.

They will eventually respond ( months -> years ) if you copy the State
Attorney General for the state which they are incorporated in -- seems like
it was California -- but even then, the person is just trying to close out
a ticket.

Good luck.
