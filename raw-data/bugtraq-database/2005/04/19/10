Subject: Re: cpio TOCTOU file-permissions vulnerability

Hello,

Since no fix has been posted, I've taken a stab at patching this. I think this
patch solves all issues with chmod & chown. I would recommend people review this
patch and apply since cpio can create suid files, devices, and directories with
special permissions. I have a patch for coreutils mostly done and will post that
soon.
