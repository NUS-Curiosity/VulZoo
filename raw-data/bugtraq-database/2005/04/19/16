                     hcraft - HTTP Vuln Request Crafter

     hcraft is a HTTP systems penetration testing tool designed to make
exploitation of known vulnerabilities in HTTP systems a dynamic, simple
process.  hcraft is intended to help take the details out of executing
HTTP- based attacks that require you to specially craft an HTTP request.
By defining a modeline for a given vulnerability in the modes file you
can instruct hcraft in how the HTTP request should be constructed, then
use the tool to select the appropriate mode and include the dynamic
parts of the attack such as target host, port, and the filename to
retrieve or the command to execute.

     hcraft was originally designed to be primarily used for arbitrary
file disclosure or command execution vulnerabilities, however it can
also be used for cross-site-scripting and sql-injection attacks if the
modeline for the vulnerability is carefully designed.

     You can find the debut version of hcraft at the following URL:
