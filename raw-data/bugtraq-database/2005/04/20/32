Actually, it's not as silly as you think. You can download rainbow
tables for Windows/LanMan passwords up to 14 or 15 characters in length.
Given the password hash and some code, you can determine the user's
password in a matter of minutes.

Simply put, MD5 is no longer strong enough for protecting secrets. It's
just too easy to brute-force. SHA1 is ok for now, but it's days are
numbered as well. I think it would be good to alter SHA1 (or something
stronger) as an alternative to MD5, and I see no reason not to use a
random salt instead of username.
