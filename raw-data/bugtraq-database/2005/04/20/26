I have some hopes that pointing out the rather large problem with the
md5 authentication mechanism in pg_hba.conf will lead them to discourage
it's use and thus reduce the occourances of the salt being made
available to the user giving more weight to the usefullness of having it
be a random salt.  Additionally, it's been a few years, perhaps
viewpoints have changed.
