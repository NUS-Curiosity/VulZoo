> Description: 
> Cisco Clean Access is an easily deployed software solution 
> that can automatically detect, isolate, and clean infected or 
> vulnerable devices that attempt to access your network. It 
> identifies whether networked devices such as laptops, 
> personal digital assistants, even game consoles are compliant 
> with your network's security policies and repairs any 
> vulnerabilities before permitting access to the network.

> Vendor site:

> 
> Affected versions: 
> This works in at least 3.5.3.1 and 3.5.4.

> Severity:

> Vulnerability: 
> End users can bypass the "mandatory" installation of the 
> Clean Access Agent by changing the User-Agent string of their 
> browser. This allows them to connect to the network without 
> the host-based checks being run. If configured, remote checks 
> are still run.
