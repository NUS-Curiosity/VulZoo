on Debian sid I see a slightly different problem.

Platform:
Debian GNU/Linux unstable as of 2005-08-10
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050730 
Firefox/1.0.6 (Debian package 1.0.6-2)

Inserting manually a long URL in the address bar (or in the search shortcut, 
for the matter) resulted in damaged text. It looks like the long line wraps 
and the bar contains the superposition of pieces of the URL with a shift of a 
few pixels. The damaged text is perfectly visible and pretty allarming, too.

Cheers,
Alessandro
