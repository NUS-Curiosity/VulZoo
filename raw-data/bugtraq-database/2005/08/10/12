KDE Security Advisory: kpdf temp file writing DoS vulnerability
Original Release Date: 2005-08-09
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20050809-1.txt

0. References

1. Systems affected:

        KDE 3.3.1 up to including KDE 3.4.1.


2. Overview:

        kpdf, the KDE pdf viewer, shares code with xpdf. xpdf contains
        a vulnerability that causes it to write a file in $TMPDIR with
        almost infinite size, which can severly impact system performance.


3. Impact:

        Remotely supplied pdf files can be used to fill up all available
        disk space when opened with kpdf.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.


5. Patch:

        Patch for KDE 3.3.1 is available from 
        ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches :
