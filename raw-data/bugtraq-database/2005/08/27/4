You can use the Nessus plugin 11026 (find_ap.nasl) to scan your network
for open HTTP, SNMP and FTP servers.  Using Nmap fingerprinting and
banner grabbing, this plugin does a decent job at finding rogue AP's
that don't mind being found (e.g. they haven't been specifically
configured to hide from administrators).

Alternatively, wireless-side analysis is the way to go to locate rogue
AP's!  Kismet (www.kismetwireless.net), or a commercial tool will be
helpful there.

Today I stumbled across the world's largest hotspot.  The SSID is "linksys".
