Good grief. Are DOS and Win9x concepts really so burned into people's 
brains that they can't recognize the proper solution for storing data 
where other users on a system can't get to it?

These aren't the days of single-user desktop operating systems anymore, 
people. You don't need inherently insecure obfuscation techniques to 
hide data, you just have to store it where it friggin' belongs -- IN THE 
USER'S HOME DIRECTORY.
