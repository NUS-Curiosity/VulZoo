Thomas, I've taken a look at the signature that you used to sign your message, and it says that one of the people it's registered to is thomas@...solutions.com. Now, if I'm not mistaken, this is a spyware company. If this is so, and you know developers that are writing adware/spyware programs, please do me a favor and burn their house down.

Thanks

The right way to fix that is to implement switch-level recurity. Limit the
number of mac and IP address on each ports. No workstation should ever have
more that one MAC and IP address...

If you don't have the budget for that kind of switch, I'd first try to
identify open ports and try to recognize services on a linksys router. Nmap
and telnet will be your best friends.
