Subject: AWstats Path Disclosure Vulnerability


Good morning all.

"AWStats is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web, streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log contains, in few graphical web pages."

Once you have setup this tool, you can get statistics of a website with this URL :

http://www.server.com/awstats/awstats.pl?config=xxx

You replace xxx by the name you gave to the configuration file of your website (You have one file per website)

But if xxx is not an existing name, the path will be disclosed to the user in the resulting error message.

I have seen this vulnerability with 6.4 version of AWstats and i think all version < 6.4 are also vulnerable.

AWstats is a great tool anyway.

Sorry for my english it is not my primary language.

Have a nice day. Unix will win.

Best regards.
