If it's a session cookie then it'll die automatically when the browser
closes down. No need to clear it.

There are many useful features of browsers (and other software - remember
when it used to be a kindness to leave an MTA as an open relay and
considered rude not to?) that have had to be deactivated because of abuse by
scum such as spammers. Firing up the onUnload event on window/browser
shutdown is one that should be added to that list IMO.
