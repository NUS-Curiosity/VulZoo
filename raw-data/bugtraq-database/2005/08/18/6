  Can you reproduce this if you recompile libiconv/gettext/mutt?
  
  I reported that bug on Jul 12, but in fact it only happened with
libiconv/gettext compiled against an OpenBSD libc before the mb*() changes,
but then running libc 38.2.

  An easier way to trigger this is ftp://ftp.00f.net/misc/mutt-crash-poc.mbox
  
  But the mutt's code doesn't actually look wrong.

  Best regards,
  
     -Frank.
