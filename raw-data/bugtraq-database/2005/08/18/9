	in Kinetics Kiosk Product

Jason,

Not that I disagree with you here, but I am not sure I understand why you 
think that connecting to a host outside the private address ranges is 
irresponsible by the company?

The connectivity from this Kiosk to the destination displayed could be one 
of:

The destination host only allows point to point connectivity, controlled by 
a firewall or that the connectivity from this Kiosk is through a VPN 
connection.

I also don't see the difference of using Internet Explorer versus any other 
browser. Script errors are script errors and will be displayed regardless 
which browser they use unless specifically disabled (as you mentioned).
