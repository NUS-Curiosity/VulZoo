Subject: Bypassing the new /GS protection in VC++ 7.1


Hi,

I have been trying to research how it is possible to defeat the /GS
compiler option in vc++ 7.1.

I read the article by Litchfield, however, i also read the article
here http://www.developer.com/net/cplus/article.php/3417861.

This article seems to be more recent and i was wondering if the claim
in this article that stack overflows would technically be impossible
to use SEH to write stack overflow exploits.

Could you guys comment on it?

Thanks
