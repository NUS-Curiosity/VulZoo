Synopsis
========

AWStats fails to validate certain log input, which could lead to the
execution of arbitrary Perl code during the generation of the
statistics.

Background
==========

AWStats is an advanced log file analyzer and statistics generator. In
HTTP reports it parses Referrer information in order to display the
most common Referrer values that caused users to visit the website.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/awstats        < 6.5                               >= 6.5

Description
===========

When using a URLPlugin, AWStats fails to sanitize Referrer URL data
before using them in a Perl eval() routine.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can include arbitrary Referrer information in a HTTP
request to a web server, therefore injecting tainted data in the log
files. When AWStats is run on this log file, this can result in the
execution of arbitrary Perl code with the rights of the user running
AWStats.

Workaround
==========

Disable all URLPlugins in the AWStats configuration.

Resolution
==========

All AWStats users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/awstats-6.5"

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.
