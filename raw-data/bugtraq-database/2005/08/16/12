Subject: SQL injection in Persianblog


 This is the KAPDA.ir 's advisory 
  (Powered by PersianHacker.NET)


Discussion:

PersianBlog.com is the Weblog service for Persian
users.
Over 75 per cent of Persian-language content on the
Internet belonged to Persianblog with 63,000 number of
 blogs. 
Website: http://www.persianblog.com
----------------------------------------------------------------
vulnerability:
Several scripts do not properly validate user-supplied
input. A remote user can create specially crafted
parameter values that will execute SQL commands on the
underlying database.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Description:

http://www.xxxxxxxblog.com/userslist.asp?page=2'&catid=16
Error :

Microsoft VBScript runtime error '800a000d' 
Type mismatch: 'Cint' 
/userslist.asp, line 213
http://www.xxxxxxxblog.com/userslist.asp?page=255555&catid=5
Error :

Microsoft VBScript runtime error '800a0006' 
Overflow: 'Cint' 
/userslist.asp, line 213 

CInt is a Visual Basic function, There is no programs
or modules or anything failing. Just that single ASP
script, that someone specifically passes wrong
arguments to, fails.
and the next one is not a buffer overflow or anything
of that nature,When the multiple numbers go through
the CInt conversion the conversion fails because the
number sent is bigger than Long can store. Once again,
there is no exploit or vulnerability here.
but playing with catid parameter gives us something
new.

Error :

ADODB.Field error '800a0bcd' 
Either BOF or EOF is True, or the current record has
been deleted. Requested operation requires a current
record. 
/userslist.asp, line 221

Error :

detaills anymore, because
There is not any vendor-supplied solution at the time
of this entry.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Impact:
 A remote user can execute SQL commands on the
underlying database.
solution:

patches for this issue
