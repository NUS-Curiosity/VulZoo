Synopsis
========

Xpdf, Kpdf and GPdf may crash as a result of a Denial of Service
vulnerability.

Background
==========

Xpdf, Kpdf and GPdf are PDF file viewers that run under the X Window
System. Kpdf and GPdf both contain Xpdf code. Kpdf is also part of
kdegraphics.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /   Vulnerable   /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/xpdf             < 3.00-r10                  >= 3.00-r10
  2  kde-base/kdegraphics      < 3.3.2-r3                  >= 3.3.2-r3
  3  kde-base/kpdf             < 3.4.1-r1                  >= 3.4.1-r1
  4  app-text/gpdf             < 2.10.0-r1                >= 2.10.0-r1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     4 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Xpdf, Kpdf and GPdf do not handle a broken table of embedded TrueType
fonts correctly. After detecting such a table, Xpdf, Kpdf and GPdf
attempt to reconstruct the information in it by decoding the PDF file,
which causes the generation of a huge temporary file.

Impact
======

A remote attacker may cause a Denial of Service by creating a specially
crafted PDF file, sending it to a CUPS printing system (which uses
Xpdf), or by enticing a user to open it in Xpdf, Kpdf, or GPdf.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Xpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/xpdf-3.00-r10"

All GPdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/gpdf-2.10.0-r1"

All Kpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdegraphics-3.3.2-r3"

All KDE Split Ebuild Kpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kpdf-3.4.1-r1"
