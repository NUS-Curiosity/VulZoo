Abstract:

Exploiting well known flaws in DNS services and the way in which 
hostnames are resolved to IP addresses, Phishers have upped the ante in 
the cyberwar for control of a customer’s online identity for financial gain.

A grouping of attack vectors now referred to as “Pharming”, affects the 
fundamental way in which a customer’s computer locates and connects to 
an organisations online offering.

Enabling the Pharmer to reach wider audiences with less probability of 
detection than their Phishing counterparts, pharming attacks are capable 
of defeating many of the latest defensive strategies used by customer 
and online retailer alike.

This paper, extending the original material of “The Phishing Guide”, 
examines in depth the workings of the name services of which Internet- 
based customers are dependant upon, and how they can be exploited by 
Pharmers to conduct identity theft and financial fraud on a massive scale.
