====================================================================== 
1) Affected Software 

SqWebMail 5.0.4

Other versions may also be affected.

====================================================================== 
2) Severity 

Rating: Moderately Critical
Impact: Script Insertion
Where:  From Remote

====================================================================== 
3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in SqWebMail, which
can be exploited by malicious people to conduct script insertion
attacks.

The vulnerability is caused due to SqWebMail allowing attached files
to be viewed in context of the SqWebMail server. This can be
exploited to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session
in context of the SqWebMail server when a user clicks "Display" on an
attached file.


Example Attack Scenario:

1) The user receives an email with an attachment called e.g.
"image.jpg".
2) The user uses the SqWebMail "Display" feature to view the attached
file.
3) This causes SqWebMail to output the contents of the attachment in
context of the SqWebMail server.

However, when SqWebMail outputs the file, the user-controlled
"Content-Type" from the email is used, which causes the browser to
e.g. treat the content as "text/html" thereby executing any included
script code in context of the SqWebMail server.

Successful exploitation allows a malicious person to perform the same
actions as the user of the web mail account (e.g. sending or viewing
emails).


Example Email Attachment:

--_----------=_1123228313217851
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="image.jpg"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
Content-Type: text/html


<html>
<body>

<script>alert(document.domain);</script>

</body>
</html>

--_----------=_1123228313217851--


====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Don't "Display" or "Download" attached files.

NOTE: The vendor does not acknowledge this as a vulnerability.
However, the vendor has changed some functionality for all upcoming
versions based on this report.

SqWebMail version 5.0.4, snapshot builds from 23/08/2005 and later
will include the user-controlled "Content-Type" field when showing
attached files in emails. However, this does not prevent exploitation
of the vulnerability.

====================================================================== 
5) Time Table 

23/08/2005 - Initial vendor notification.
24/08/2005 - Vendor responds that he doesn't consider this a
             vulnerability.
24/08/2005 - Public disclosure.
