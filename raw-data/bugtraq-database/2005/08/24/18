I don't mean to be a party pooper, but wouldn't it be just as easy to
navigate to the program's install path and double freaking click
pref.txt?

In my opinion, since this isn't a privilege escalation (local OR
remote), and it's certainly within the abilities of most of the people
reading this list to just open pref.txt in their favorite editor,
"proof of concept" code is next to worthless... nice try, but it makes
this report really seem like a joke.

On yet another note, I haven't seen many programs making use of
proxies where the username/password pairs were obfuscated in any
way... generally if a proxy is required in the first place, it's a
proxy the whole machine knows about anyway, so there's really not much
use in attempting to keep said proxy secret.
