Subject: Cross-site scripting vulnerability in BEA WebLogic administration console



I. DESCRIPTION

  A cross-site scripting issue affects the display of error events in the
  'View Error Log' feature of BEA WebLogic Administration console.

II. AFFECTED PRODUCTS

  BEA WebLogic 8.1 SP4 and previous.

III. HOW TO VERIFY

  1. Make a HTTP request containing XSS code to a target Web server

  $ printf \
  "GET /<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>GomoR HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" \
  | nc www.example.com 80

  2. Login into the Administration console
  3. Go to the menu 'Network configurations/servers/myserser/'
  4. Click on 'View server log'
  5. Search for the string GomoR and click on the BEA-id event.

  A JavaScript dialog box should appear.

IV. SEVERITY

  I let each customer evaluate that within their own context.
