Synopsis
========

TikiWiki and eGroupWare both include PHP XML-RPC code vulnerable to
arbitrary command execution.

Background
==========

TikiWiki is a full featured Free Software Wiki, CMS and Groupware
written in PHP. eGroupWare is a web-based collaboration software suite.
Both TikiWiki and eGroupWare include a PHP library to handle XML-RPC
requests.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/tikiwiki        < 1.8.5-r2                   >= 1.8.5-r2
  2  www-apps/egroupware      < 1.0.0.009                 >= 1.0.0.009
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

The XML-RPC library shipped in TikiWiki and eGroupWare improperly
handles XML-RPC requests and responses with malformed nested tags.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary
PHP script code into eval() statements by sending a specially crafted
XML document to TikiWiki or eGroupWare.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All TikiWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/tikiwiki-1.8.5-r2"

All eGroupWare users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/egroupware-1.0.0.009"
