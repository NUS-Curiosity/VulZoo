Hi!

I'm sorry, but you were not the first one who noticed this kind of problem. :-)

I've discovered the same type of problems much earlier and reported it to the vendor several times. However, Hauri *never* responded to our inqueries. When I was calling them, they at least acknowledged that they got my mails, but nothing has happened later. You can find more details about the issue the in the following article:

"Durchleuchter - 16 Virenscanner f√ºr Windows", Andreas Marx & Axel Vahldiek, c't 01/2005, page 128pp. (10 pages)

The tests for this article were performed in November and December 2004. There are a lot more vulnerabilities in this product, e.g. everyone can get Administrator rights on a "protected" PC very easily. A good number of the problems are described in the above article for the German c't magazine, too.

BTW: It's interesting to see that you have tested *exactly* the same kind of archive files we've used in the c't review...

cheers,
