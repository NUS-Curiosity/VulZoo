SSRT5998 Rev.0 HP System Management Homepage (v2.0.x) Denial of
               Service (DoS) & XSS

NOTICE:
There are no restrictions for distribution of this Security
Bulletin provided that it remains complete and intact.

The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon
as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:
31 July 2005

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:
Remote unauthorized user may create a Denial of Service (DOS),
cause a buffer overflow, or allow cross-site scripting attacks

SOURCE:
Hewlett-Packard Company
HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
    Potential security vulnerabilities associated with web
    applications using PHP (prior to 4.3.11) have been identified
    by the candidates for common vulnerabilities (CAN) and
    exposures shown in the background section.

REFERENCES:
CAN-2004-1065, CAN-2004-1064, CAN-2004-1063, CAN-2004-1020,
CAN-2004-1019

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
    System Management Homepage Version 2.0.0 through Version 2.0.2
    for Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows 2003, and Linux.
    System Management Homepage is a component of HP ProLiant
    Support (PSP).



BACKGROUND:

    CAN-2004-1018 - Multiple integer handling errors in PHP may
    allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions, causing a
    denial of service.

    CAN-2004-1019 - The deserialization code in PHP may allow
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service.

    CAN-2004-1020 - The addslashes function in PHP does not
    properly escape a NULL (/0) character, which may allow remote
    attackers to read arbitrary files in PHP applications that
    contain a directory traversal vulnerability in require or
    include statements.

    CAN-2004-1063 - When running in safe mode on a multithreaded
    Linux webserver, may allow local users to bypass
    safe_mode_exec_dir restrictions and execute commands outside
    of the intended safe_mode_exec_dir via shell metacharacters in
    the current directory name.

    CAN-2004-1064 - The safe mode checks in PHP truncate the file
    path before passing the data to the realpath function, which
    could allow attackers to bypass safe mode.

    CAN-2004-1065 - Buffer overflow in the exif_read_data function
    in PHP may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
    via a long section name in an image file.

    Namazu versions prior to v2.0.14 contain a vulnerability that
    can allow remote attackers to launch cross-site scripting
    attacks.  The vulnerability is due to improper filtering of
    queries that start with a tab (%09) character in namazu.cgi.

RESOLUTION:

    HP recommends that customers upgrade to System Management
    Homepage (Version 2.1.0 and higher) which includes PHP v4.3.11
    and Namazu v2.0.14 addressing the vulnerabilities listed
    above.

    System Management Homepage  is available for download from
    the following URLs:

Windows:

 download/23065.html>

Linux:

 download/23019.html>

    Note: The System Management Homepage version 2.1.0 (or later)
          for Windows and Linux exists in SmartStart version 7.40
          (when available) and later can also be used for
          resolution.
