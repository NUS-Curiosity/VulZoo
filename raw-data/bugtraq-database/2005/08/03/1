CA BrightStor ARCserve Backup Agent for MS SQL Server Buffer Overflow

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 08.02.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=287&type=vulnerabilities
August 2, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

BrightStor ARCserve Backup for Windows delivers backup and restore
protection for all Windows server systems as well as Windows, Linux,
Mac OS X and UNIX client environments.

http://www3.ca.com/Solutions/ProductFamily.asp?ID=115

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow in the Backup Agent for
Microsoft SQL Server within Computer Associates' BrightStor ARCserve 
Backup Agent for SQL allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with
SYSTEM privileges.

BrightStor ARCserve Backup Agent for Microsoft SQL Server is a component
of the BrightStor ARCserve Backup system for handling backups of 
Microsoft SQL server data. When a string with a length over 3168 bytes,
is sent to the listening port, 6070 by default, a stack based buffer 
overflow occurs.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code with SYSTEM level privileges. This allows for complete system
compromise including the installation or removal of software and access
to any file on the system.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Computer
Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup Agent for Microsoft SQL Server
version 11.0. It is suspected that all versions are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Restrict remote access at the network boundary, unless remote parties
require service. Access to the affected host should be filtered at the 
network boundary if global accessibility is not required. Restricting 
access to only trusted hosts and networks may reduce the likelihood of 
exploitation.
