Subject: Re: [DCC SPAM] Defeating Citi-Bank Virtual Keyboard Protection


Well -

This Virtual Keyboard Protection doesn't protect against formlogging, 
which tends to be a very signficant and popular method for malware to 
"phish" the information.

Most people actually trying to sell software against "key logging" 
should look more into the evolution of phishing malware and they will 
see that this will be defeated by the majority of phishing malware 
already out there (berbew, haxdoor, PW Steal, etc).
