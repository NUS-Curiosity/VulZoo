And can someone tell me what value this is or is the compromise of
border routers not important ?

I'm just puzzled at how you get McAfree's product between your Cisco
router, that gets frame/dsl/isdn/whatever from your telco, and the
wallpoint where the attacks are going to come in from.

Admitedly they can protect you internally and against attacks launched
across your LAN, but how does that help an ISPs core routers that have
dozens of inbound lines that aren't ethernet ?
