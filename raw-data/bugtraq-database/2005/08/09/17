So what? When using tar to make backups this is what you need. 

The default behavior of GNU tar (and others) not to change the ownership 
of extracted files to self when running as root is well documented.

The only attack I see in your case is when the attacker is a local user
who gives root a tar with a setuid root program in it and root untars it 
in a place where the attacker can run it. While I'm sure such situations 
exist, I think they are rare, entirely the fault of the admin, and not 
worth changing the default behavior of tar over.
