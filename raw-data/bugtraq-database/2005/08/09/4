How can this even be marked as low risk? If you're loading a library into 
mysql's address space then you're already executing "arbitrary code". It's 
important that we, as security researchers, don't desensitize the readership 
with pointless "vulnerability" posts otherwise people begin to turn off. 
Sure - you've found some sloppy code in mysql - get it looked at by all 
means but please don't try to create a risk, whether low or not, where there 
really is none.

Cheers,
