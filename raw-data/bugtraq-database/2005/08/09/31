Subject: Bugtraq ID: 14460 : Coldfusion Fusebox V4.1.0 Vulnerability


The following vulnerability is inaccurate. Fusebox is a framework
popular with ColdFusion developers. The cross-site scripting
vulnerability is not specific to the framework, and is clearly an
implementation issue.

Fusebox, as a framework, does not output any URL parameters to HTML.
The output is controled by the application developer. FuseBox does not
even have to generate HTML for that matter.

Within the fusebox framework, a layout configuration file is used to
generate output. The layout file is completely coded by the
application developer. The official FuseBox v4.1.0 core files do not
contain _any_ layout configuration files.
