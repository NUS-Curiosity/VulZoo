Subject: Call for new mailing lists @ SecurityFocus




All,

As most of you know, some of the strongest value the SecurityFocus 
community has to offer is that of our mailing lists. These lists 
contribute a vast amount of information and dialogue to the community at 
large but they are generally held within a finite amount of lists, which 
changes little (in terms of # of lists) over time. Given this is the case 
we, every few years, make a call for new mailing lists from the community.

I would like to invite you to send me your thoughts (direct off-list) on 
which new mailing lists we should start here. Based off the feedback we 
receive I believe we will launch a number of new lists in the late 
September timeframe.  I also urge you to consider becoming a moderator for 
the list(s) you suggest because as a community we are only viable if we 
all make an effort to participate..

Regards,
Alfred
