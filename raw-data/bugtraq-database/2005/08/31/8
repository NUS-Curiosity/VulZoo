Hi s2b,

sorry, but I can't confirm that. I can't get any access following your 
instructions.

The given site uses Basic HTTP Authentication. Requests with this 
authentication do not depend on the other. There is just the 
Authentication header added.
Even manual alteration of the request did not give any result:

Is it possible the effect is caused by your local or server setup (e.g. 
browser cache, webserver authentication setup...)?
