Synopsis
========

lm_sensors is vulnerable to linking attacks, potentially allowing a
local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

lm_sensors is a software package that provides drivers for monitoring
the temperatures, voltages, and fans of Linux systems with hardware
monitoring devices.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-apps/lm_sensors     < 2.9.1-r1                    >= 2.9.1-r1

Description
===========

Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pena has discovered that lm_sensors
insecurely creates temporary files with predictable filenames when
saving configurations.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary file
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
the pwmconfig script of lm_sensors is executed, this would result in
the file being overwritten with the rights of the user running the
script, which typically is the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All lm_sensors users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/lm_sensors-2.9.1-r1"
