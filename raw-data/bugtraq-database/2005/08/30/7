Synopsis
========

phpGroupWare is vulnerable to multiple issues ranging from information
disclosure to a potential execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

phpGroupWare is a multi-user groupware suite written in PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /   Vulnerable   /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/phpgroupware     < 0.9.16.008              >= 0.9.16.008

Description
===========

phpGroupWare improperly validates the "mid" parameter retrieved via a
forum post. The current version of phpGroupWare also adds several
safeguards to prevent XSS issues, and disables the use of a potentially
vulnerable XML-RPC library.

Impact
======

A remote attacker may leverage the XML-RPC vulnerability to execute
arbitrary PHP script code. He could also create a specially crafted
request that will reveal private posts.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpGroupWare users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/phpgroupware-0.9.16.008"
