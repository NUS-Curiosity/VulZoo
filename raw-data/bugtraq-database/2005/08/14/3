Subject: (TOOL ANNOUNCEMENT) Efilter - automatic exception
	reporting utility


Hi,

"...

   Info
   ----

   Efilter is an automatic exception reporting utility. It is very useful
   and handy while doing vulnerability research on any software designed
   to work under Windows NT platforms. Due to that it hooks
   KiUserExceptionDispatcher function, it acts BEFORE any of program's
   active SEH frames take over the exception. In short words it reports
   programs exceptions even if they are handled by original program.

   Here is some sample screenshot:

   Since it uses debug messages it requires DebugView utility to show
   output messages. (download from: http://www.sysinternals.com)


   Usage
   -----

   Just attach efilter.dll library to target process.
   You can obtain binary version of the library here:
