Jason, you just posted a quote that contradicts your stance.  You are
now officially fighting yourself.
This quote says exactly what Thierry has been telling you: 
"In practice, Trojan Horses in the wild do contain [[the stuff Jason
said they do]].  Because Trojan horses often [[do the things Jason
said they do]], there often arises the misunderstanding that [[Jason's
definition]] define[s] a Trojan Horse."

This last sentence is saying that people often think that since a
trojan is often a backdoor that all trojans are backdoors, when in
fact the definition of a trojan is much broader.
