Synopsis:          Updated spamassassin package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:129284
Issue date:        2005-08-10
Product:           Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0796
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated spamassassin package that fixes a denial of service bug when
parsing malformed messages is now available.

SpamAssassin provides a way to reduce unsolicited commercial email
(SPAM) from incoming email.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

A denial of service bug has been found in SpamAssassin versions below
2.64. A malicious attacker could construct a message in such a way that
would cause spamassassin to stop responding, potentially preventing the
delivery or filtering of email. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0796 to this
issue.

Users of SpamAssassin should update to these updated packages which
contain an updated version and is not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
