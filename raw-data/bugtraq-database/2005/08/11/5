1. Topic:

Updated mc packages that fix several security issues are now available.

Midnight Commander is a visual shell much like a file manager.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

Several buffer overflows, several temporary file creation
vulnerabilities, and one format string vulnerability have been
discovered in Midnight Commander. These vulnerabilities were discovered
mostly by Andrew V. Samoilov and Pavel Roskin. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
names CAN-2004-0226, CAN-2004-0231, and CAN-2004-0232 to these issues.

Shell escape bugs have been discovered in several of the mc vfs backend
scripts. An attacker who is able to influence a victim to open a
specially-crafted URI using mc could execute arbitrary commands as the
victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0494 to this issue.

Several format string bugs were found in Midnight Commander. If a user
is tricked by an attacker into opening a specially crafted path with mc,
it may be possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running
Midnight Commander. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1004 to this issue.

Several buffer overflow bugs were found in Midnight Commander. If a user
is tricked by an attacker into opening a specially crafted file or path
with mc, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code as the user
running Midnight Commander. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1005 to this
issue.

Several denial of service bugs were found in Midnight Commander. These
bugs could cause Midnight Commander to hang or crash if a victim opens a
carefully crafted file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-1009, CAN-2004-1090,
CAN-2004-1091, CAN-2004-1092, CAN-2004-1093 and CAN-2004-1174 to these
issues.

A filename quoting bug was found in Midnight Commander's FISH protocol
handler. If a victim connects via embedded SSH support to a host
containing a carefully crafted filename, arbitrary code may be executed
as the user running Midnight Commander. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1175 to
this issue.

A buffer underflow bug was found in Midnight Commander. If a malicious
local user is able to modify the extfs.ini file, it could be possible to
execute arbitrary code as a user running Midnight Commander. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-1176 to this issue.

A buffer overflow bug was found in the way Midnight Commander handles
directory completion. If a victim uses completion on a maliciously
crafted directory path, it is possible for arbitrary code to be executed
as the user running Midnight Commander. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0763 to
this issue.

Users of mc are advised to upgrade to these packages, which contain
backported security patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
