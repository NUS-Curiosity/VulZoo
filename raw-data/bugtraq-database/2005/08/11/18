a quote from the above URL:

The Wyse Blazer OS has a closed source and limited distribution (of the 
source code). Attempts to expose vulnerabilities have been non-existent. 
In addition, the products image design and stateless nature make this 
product the most secure Winterm product available.

...

Proprietary OS  The Wyse Blazer product operates on a non-published, 
proprietary OS. This closed architecture makes the product far more 
secure than open source devices.
