Subject: [USN-167-1] AWStats vulnerability

===========================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-167-1	    August 11, 2005
awstats vulnerability
CAN-2005-1527
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 5.04 (Hoary Hedgehog)

The following packages are affected:

awstats

The problem can be corrected by upgrading the affected package to
version 6.3-1ubuntu0.1.  In general, a standard system upgrade is
sufficient to effect the necessary changes.

Details follow:

Peter Vreugdenhil discovered a command injection vulnerability in
AWStats. As part of the statistics reporting function, AWStats
displays information about the most common referrer values that caused
users to visit the website. Referer URLs could be crafted in a way
that they contained arbitrary Perl code which would have been executed
with the privileges of the web server as soon as some user visited the
referrer statistics page.
