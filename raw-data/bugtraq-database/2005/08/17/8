Subject: Re: SQL injection in Persianblog


I fail to see how this is a SQL injection of any kind, unless of
course you only intend to inject numbers into the database records..

The CInt calls force typecasting, preventing non-integers from being
processed further.

The next error you post indicates no records are being returned, I
assume the same would happen with a negative number.

Are any of these actually injectable against? Or is it really just an
application that doesn't fail gracefully?
