And for those who doesn't want to send out their details just to
download the files can go to
http://proxy.11a.nu/2005/08/16/binaries-and-source-code-for-cenzics-windows-nt-port-of-nessus-uploaded/
and download them from there, without any need for registration and
stuff like that...

For the integrity of the binaries you just have to trust my word that
I have not modified the archives in any way, although the Cenzic guys
never posted any checksums or GPG signatures to verify the integrity
of the archives.
