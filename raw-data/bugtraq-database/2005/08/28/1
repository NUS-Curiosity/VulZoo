Subject: Re: Sophos Antivirus Library Remote Heap Overflow


You are partially correct. Prior to this advisory, Sophos & rem0te agreed to w/hold details until all fixes were available (August 26th). The Sophos link you provided below does not disclose any details of the vulnerability - only the patch - which leaves a lot of people guessing about the actual vulnerability details.

It's also important to note there are many large 3rd party vendors that sublicense this library who should apply patches to their customer installations. It will be interesting to see how many of these 3rd parties issue advisories to their users.
