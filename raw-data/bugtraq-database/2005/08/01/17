Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0038

Package name:      mysql, fetchmail, zlib, perl, apache
 		   netpbm, vim, nss_ldap
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2005-07-29
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package Decription:
  apache
  Apache is a full featured web server that is freely available, and also
  happens to be the most widely used.
  
  fetchmail
  Fetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended
  for use over on-demand TCP/IP links, like SLIP or PPP connections.
  Fetchmail supports every remote-mail protocol currently in use on the
  Internet (POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, all IMAPs, ESMTP ETRN, IPv6,
  and IPSEC) for retrieval. Then Fetchmail forwards the mail through
  SMTP so you can read it through your favorite mail client.
  
  mysql
  MySQL is a true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL (Structured Query
  Language) database server. MySQL is a client/server implementation
  that consists of a server daemon (mysqld) and many different client
  programs/libraries.
  
  netpbm
  The netpbm package contains a library of functions which support
  programs for handling various graphics file formats, including .pbm
  (portable bitmaps), .pgm (portable graymaps), .pnm (portable anymaps),
  .ppm (portable pixmaps) and others.
  
  nss_ldap
  This package includes a LDAP access client: nss_ldap.
  Nss_ldap is a set of C library extensions which allows X.500 and LDAP
  directory servers to be used as a primary source of aliases, ethers,
  groups, hosts, networks, protocol, users, RPCs, services and shadow
  passwords (instead of or in addition to using flat files or NIS).
  
  perl
  Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk
  and shell scripting.  Perl is good at handling processes and files,
  and is especially good at handling text.  Perl's hallmarks are
  practicality and efficiency.  While it is used to do a lot of
  different things, Perl's most common applications (and what it excels
  at) are probably system administration utilities and web programming.
  A large proportion of the CGI scripts on the web are written in Perl.
  You need the perl package installed on your system so that your
  system can handle Perl scripts.
  
  vim
  VIM (VIsual editor iMproved) is an updated and improved version of the vi
  editor.  Vi was the first real screen-based editor for UNIX, and is still
  very popular.  VIM improves on vi by adding new features: multiple windows,
  multi-level undo, block highlighting and more.
  
  zlib
  The zlib compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
  (deflation), but other algorithms may be added later, which will have
  the same stream interface.  The zlib library is used by many different
  system programs.
  
  
Problem Description:
  apache
  - Security Fix:
  - Watchfire reported a flaw that occured when using the Apache server as an
    HTTP proxy.  A remote attacker could send an HTTP request with both a
    "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header and a "Content-Length" header.  This
    caused Apache to incorrectly handle and forward the body of the request in
    a way that the receiving server processes it as a separate HTTP request.
    This could allow the bypass of Web application firewall protection or
    lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  
  - Marc Stern reported an off-by-one overflow in the mod_ssl CRL verification
    callback.  In order to exploit this issue the Apache server would need to
    be configured to use a malicious certificate revocation list (CRL).
  
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned
    the name CAN-2005-2088 and CAN-2005-1268 to this issue.
  
  
  fetchmail
  - New Upstream
  - Security Fix: Remote code injection vulnerability in fetchmail
  - The POP3 code that deals with UIDs (from the UIDL) reads the responses
    returned by the POP3 server into fixed-size buffers allocated on the
    stack, without limiting the input length to the buffer size. A
    compromised or malicious POP3 server can thus overrun fetchmail's
    stack.  This affects POP3 and all of its variants, for instance but
    not limited to APOP.
  
  mysql
  - New Upstream
  - Security Fix: MySQL uses a vulnerable version of the zlib library which
    can be exploited by malicious users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service),
    or potentially by malicious people to execute arbitrary code.
    It is possible for malicious users to crash the server in various ways.
  
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CAN-2005-2096.
  
  netpbm
  - Security Fix: Max Vozeler has reported a vulnerability in netpbm, which
    can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
  
    The vulnerability is caused due to pstopnm not using the "-dSAFER" option
    when calling GhostScript to convert a PostScript file into a PBM, PGM, or
    PNM file. This allows a malicious PostScript file to execute arbitrary
    commands on a vulnerable system.
  
  nss_ldap
  - Security Fix: Plain text authentication leak.
  - nss_ldap when used with OpenLDAP and connecting to a slave using TLS,
    does not use TLS for the subsequent connection if the client is referred
    to a master, which may cause a password to be sent in cleartext and allows
    remote attackers to sniff the password.
  
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CAN-2005-2069 to this issue.
  
  perl
  - Security Fix: Race condition in the rmtree function in Perl
  - Race condition in the rmtree function in the File::Path module sets
    read/write permissions for the world, which allows local users to
    delete arbitrary files and directories, and possibly read files and
    directories, via a symlink attack.
  
  - Race condition in the rmtree function in File::Path.pm allows local
    users to create arbitrary setuid binaries in the tree being deleted.
  
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CAN-2004-0452 and CAN-2005-0448 to this issue.
  
  vim
  - Fix vulnerability in vim, which can be exploited by malicious people
    to compromise a vulnerable system. The vulnerability is caused due to
    an error that allows the "glob()" command to be exploited to execute
    shell commands when the user opens a specially crafted file. Credits
    to Georgi Guninski.
  - Added patches from 048-085
  
  zlib
  - Vendor fixes for previous security fixes
  - Security Fix: Eliminates potential vulnerability when decoding
    invalid compressed data
  - Security Fix: Eliminates potential vulnerability when decoding
    specially crafted compressed data
  - Bug Fix: Fixes a bug when decompressing dynamic blocks with no
    distance codes.
  - Fixes crc check in gzread() after gzungetc()
  - Does not return an error when using gzread() on an empty file
