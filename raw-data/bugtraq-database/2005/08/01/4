Synopsis
========

Compress::Zlib is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which could
potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The Compress::Zlib is a Perl module which provides an interface to the
zlib compression library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-perl/Compress-Zlib       < 1.35                       >= 1.35

Description
===========

Compress::Zlib 1.34 contains a local vulnerable version of zlib, which
may lead to a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

By creating a specially crafted compressed data stream, attackers can
overwrite data structures for applications that use Compress::Zlib,
resulting in a Denial of Service and potentially arbitrary code
execution.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Compress::Zlib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-perl/Compress-Zlib-1.35"
