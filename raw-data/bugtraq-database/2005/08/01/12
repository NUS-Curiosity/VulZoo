Subject: HACK IN THE BOX SECURITY CONFERENCE 2005


Hack In The Box is pleased to inform you that *HACK IN
THE BOX SECURITY CONFERENCE* is back for the 5th time
in our series! After our first ever security
conference in the Middle East we cordially invite you
to sign up for the biggest conference in our series
yet! *HITBSecConf2005 - Malaysia* will feature *over
30 of the world's greatest minds* in the network and
computer security arena. With a *4-day industry
exhibition,* this years conference will also feature
*6 tracks of hands-on technical training* sessions.

The main aim of the HITBSecConf series of security
conferences is to create a platform for the
dissemination, discussion and sharing of
deep-knowledge network security information. Presented
by respected members of both the mainstream network
security arena as well as the underground or black hat
community, this year\u2019s conference promises once
again to deliver a look at several new attack methods
and exploits that have not been seen or discussed in
public before. Alongside our conference we will also
be conducting our team based Capture The Flag "Live
Hacking" Competition and a Running Man wireless game.
Our partners from Zone-H will also be down to conduct
their Zone-H Hacking Challenge!
