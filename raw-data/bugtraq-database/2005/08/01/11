This doesn't matter because in the PORT command sent to the FTP-like
server, the applet can reference a port which is not controlled by the
applet.  No checks take place, and it's perfectly possible to specify
an already bound port.  The firewall has no way to know that the port
actually belongs to some other process on the host (not the applet/FTP
client), and the sendbox does not examine the contents of TCP data
transfers at all.

Some NAT devices restrict access to 445/TCP, 139/TCP and a few more
ports, but by its nature, this list is incomplete and does not cover
all problematic TCP ports.
