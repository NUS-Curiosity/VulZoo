Subject: Mozilla Firefox InstallVersion->compareTo()
	vulnerability lowered severity status

Hi,

After more than 2 weeks of no response from the Mozilla Foundation (
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=295854), I've decided to 
disclose the following information:
Version 1.0.5 of Firefox has fixed a vulnerability in the 
InstallVersion->compareTo() function that could potentially allow remote 
code execution.
The Mozilla team have decided to set the severity status of the 
vulnerability to 'Moderate', instead of a higher severity status, claiming 
an exploitation of this vulnerability requires a predictable address, which 
means it's almost impossible to exploit.
This is partly true. A script can be easily built to significantly increase 
the possibility of a successful exploitation.
An attacker can use Skylined's Heap spraying method (used in "Internet 
Exploiter" - 
http://www.edup.tudelft.nl/~bjwever/advisory_msie_R6025.html.php), to fill 
the heap with fake data and vtbl structures that will point to the exploit 
code.
This can be done by spraying 3 heap blocks - "data" block, "vtbl" block and 
"exploit" block - instead of one, as was presented by Skylined. The "data" 
block will point to a "vtbl" location which will be exactly the eax address 
+ the heap block size. The data in the "vtbl" block will point to the 
"exploit" block which will be exactly the pointed "vtbl" address + the heap 
block size. The "exploit" block, of-course, will have the exploit code, 
padded with nops.
This will boost the possibility that the eax address, specified by the 
attacker, will fall into the faked "data" block. Other methods can be 
applied to increase the risk even more.
Therefore, my suggestion to the Mozilla Foundation is to raise the severity 
status of the vulnerability to 'High' or 'Critical'.

Best regards,
Aviv Raff.
