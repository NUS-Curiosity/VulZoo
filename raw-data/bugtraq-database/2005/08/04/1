Subject: Zone Alarm Security Contact


I have discovered something I think is a vulnerability in Zone Alarm but
their web site has no information on how to speak to a security contact or
anyone other than a tech support person.

Does anyone have a technical or security contact at zone alarm?

Thanks,
