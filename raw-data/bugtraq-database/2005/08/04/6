 	I prefer something just as simple, but maybe more flexible:
1.	Interaction level
 	i)	Automatic (no victim action required)
 	ii)	Semi-Automatic (victim performs some normally safe action,
 		ie. opening e-mail, or a cron job runs)
 	iii)	Manual (victim is socially engineered into performing
 		su -c 'rm -rf /' or some such stupid thing)
2.	Target
 	i)	Access
 	ii)	Elevation (Privilege elevation)

 	For all attacks, select one item from section 1, and one from 
section 2.

 	Traditional remote attacks are Automatic Access attacks. 
Traditional local attacks are Automatic Elevation attacks.  E-mail trojans 
are Semi-Automatic or Manual Access attacks.

 	Hmm.  Methinks I need to use more hyphens; Semi-Automatic-Access 
attack :).

 	HTH,
