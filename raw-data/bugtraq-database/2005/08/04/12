Did you use the "Check Yahoo! Mail..." function?

I'm running v3.1 Basic, Build 121, running on Windows XP Pro SP2.  When
I started Trillian, there were just image files in the cache directory
as you describe.  When I used the "Check Yahoo! Mail" function as
described by the OP, an HTML file was created in the cache folder.  The
contents of the file is a form containing, among other information,
these lines:

username='<my Yahoo! username in plaintext>';
password='<my Yahoo! password in plaintext>';

The filename used is insufficiently random to provide any real benefit.
The file names used (in order used) were:

sfd27.html
sfd67.html
sfd96.html
sfd82.html
sfd36.html
sfd3.html

I also checked this behavior with MSN and AIM:

With the "Check Hotmail..." function, a temporary HTML form file is also
created but the Passport login uses a hash-based authentication
mechanism.  The temp file is similarly long-lived, but the hash is
different each time a new temp file is created.

AIM's "Check AOL Mail" function didn't result in the creation of a temp
file like those used for Yahoo! and MSN.  I don't have an AOL mail
account and that may have been a factor.

I do agree that the temp files are poor implementation.  There's no
reason to store such single-use information on disk.  But then I suppose
this is fairly moot, since all of the passwords are stored as a
reversible hash in static files in the user's directory.
