Hi Bond,
  Thanks for confirming this on your end. The login does work, but if 
you are already logged in to your yahoo account when you try to use the 
html file to login it doesn't work. I guess it has something to do with 
the recent change in yahoo's authentication check as it used to work 
earlier.

  I am scared to even look at how it stores other passwords. Personally 
I prefer using gaim. Atleast that is a lot more secure and its 
developers seem to take security a lot more seriously.

Thanks,
  Suramya
