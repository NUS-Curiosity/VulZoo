TOORCON 7 LINEUP FINALIZED & PRE-REGISTRATION ENDING

ToorCon 7 has finalized its speaker lineup with over 30 talks spanned
across 2 days. ToorCon will be taking place this year at the San Diego
Convention Center on September 16th-18th.


ABOUT TOORCON
ToorCon is just around the corner again this year. In its 7th running
year, it is still San Diego's exclusive hacker convention, bringing
together Southern California's hacker community year after year to
attend the high quality presentations and participate in the annual
festivities. This year we are still aiming to provide the same highly
technical lectures you've come to know and love, but also set the theme
as "Smoke & Mirrors" which will highlight the voodoo magic behind
computer security and have a focus on Anonymity, Spoofing Techniques,
Phishing, and other kung foo exploitation methods. We will also be
offering an intensive full-day Deep Knowledge Seminar on Friday the 16th
focused towards providing solutions to IT/IS managers and professionals.
