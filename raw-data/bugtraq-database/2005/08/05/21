Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0040

Package names:     bzip2, perl-compress-zlib, proftpd
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2005-08-05
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

Package description:
  bzip2
  Bzip2 is a freely available, patent-free, high quality data compressor.
  Bzip2 compresses files to within 10 to 15 percent of the capabilities
  of the best techniques available.  However, bzip2 has the added benefit
  of being approximately two times faster at compression and six times
  faster at decompression than those techniques.  Bzip2 is not the
  fastest compression utility, but it does strike a balance between speed
  and compression capability.

  perl-compress-zlib
  Compress-Zlib module from CPAN for perl

  proftpd
  ProFTPd is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity,
  security, and ease of configuration.  It features a very Apache-like
  configuration syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure,
  including support for multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and
  permission-based directory visibility.


Problem description:
  bzip2
  - SECURITY Fix: Command injection vulnerability in the "bzgrep"
  - bzgrep did not handle shell metacharacters like '|' and '&' properly
    when they occurred in input file names. This could be exploited to
    execute arbitrary commands with user privileges if bzgrep was run in
    an untrusted directory with specially crafted file names.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CAN-2005-0758 to this issue.

  perl-compress-zlib
  - New upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Previous version of Compress::Zlib contains a local
    vulnerable version of zlib, which may lead to a buffer overflow.
    (CAN-2005-1849).

  proftpd
  - SECURITY Fix: Format string vulnerabilities
  - Two vulnerabilities have been reported in ProFTPD, which can be
    exploited by malicious users to disclose certain sensitive
    information, cause a DoS (Denial of Service), or potentially
    compromise a vulnerable system.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CAN-2005-2390 to this issue.
