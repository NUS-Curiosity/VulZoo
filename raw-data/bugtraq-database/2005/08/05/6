Subject: Cisco IOS Shellcode - McAfee IPS Protection


Hi,

McAfee claims to have "Zero-day" protection against the recent
vulnerability disclosed against Cisco particularly on Shellcodes.
Their press release says, McAfee IntruShield's existing infrastructure
protection proactively covers new exploit techniques against Cisco
IOS, such as those demonstrated at last week's Black Hat conference.

 Someone using Intrushield can validate this statement..?

 Planz
