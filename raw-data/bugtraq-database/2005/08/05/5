The advisory on rem0te.com is correct. On the same note, the release notes by clamav are not completely wrong. They fixed the same mistake in two different processors for the same format. So clamav is probably counting the two instances of the same mistake as one mistake.

Specifically, one of the formats (TNEF) contained two processors with the same mistake: tnef_message() & tnef_attachment(). Both were fixed by the clamav team in 0.86.2.
