 Disclosure & Possible SQL Injection


Yes, it is vulnerable. The user inputs as cat_id is not quoted when retrieving the category text. You can test the vulerability by:

cat_id=2%20and%201=1
cat_id=2%20and%201=2

If it's strictly based on the error messages, this is more of a PHP thing than one with the shopping cart, and the information disclosure would be fixed by properly configuring PHP not to display those errors.
