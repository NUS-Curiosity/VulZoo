Synopsis
========

A bug in Apache may allow a remote attacker to perform a Denial of
Service attack.

Background
==========

The Apache HTTP Server Project is a featureful, freely-available HTTP
(Web) server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/apache      < 2.0.54-r9                      >= 2.0.54-r9
                                                                 < 2.0

Description
===========

Filip Sneppe discovered that Apache improperly handles byterange
requests to CGI scripts.

Impact
======

A remote attacker may access vulnerable scripts in a malicious way,
exhausting all RAM and swap space on the server, resulting in a Denial
of Service of the Apache server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/apache-2.0.54-r9"
