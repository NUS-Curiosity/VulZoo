HP SECURITY BULLETIN

HPSBUX01218     REVISION: 0

SSRT4702 rev.0 - HP-UX running Veritas 3.3/3.5 unauthorized
                 data access

NOTICE:
The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon
as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:
24 August 2005

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:
 Local unauthorized access to data by an authorized user.

SOURCE:
Hewlett-Packard Company
HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
A potential vulnerability has been identified in HP-UX running the
Veritas File System (VxFS) that may allow a local authorized user
access to unauthorized data.

REFERENCES:
None

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.00 running  VxFS 3.3
HP-UX B.11.11 running  VxFS 3.3
HP-UX B.11.11 running  VxFS 3.5
HP-UX B.11.23 running  VxFS 3.5

BACKGROUND:

Note: If an upgrade from HP-UX 11.11 VxFS 3.3 to VxFS 3.5 is
planned please be aware of the following:
Upgrading HP-UX B.11.11 from VxFS 3.3 to VxFS 3.5 will leave
VxFS 3.3 on the system but inactive. Since VxFS 3.3 could be
reactivated it is important to patch VxFS 3.3 before upgrading
to VxFs 3.5. Otherwise reactivating VxFS 3.3 would reintroduce
the potential vulnerability.

  AFFECTED VERSIONS

    Note: To determine if a system has an affected version,
             search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset" 
             for an affected fileset.  Then determine if the
             recommended patch or update is installed.
