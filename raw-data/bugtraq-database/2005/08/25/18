Subject: An Illustrated Guide to IPSec


Hello listmates,

One of the most widespread security protocols is IPSec, but many of
us have found that the number of knobs and settings and switches gets
really overwhelming. I was in that boat as well, so I dove in and wrote
a paper that covers IPSec at the protocol level.

It doesn't cover things like Key Exchange yet (that's the *next* paper),
but it's got a lot of detail that should be comforting to any TCP/IP
geeks.

It's amazing how much one learns by writing about it...

Steve
