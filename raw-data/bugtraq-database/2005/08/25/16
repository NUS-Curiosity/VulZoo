Subject: Tool for Identifying Rogue Linksys Routers


Dear Group Members

We are migrating from Lucent QIP to MetaIP for DHCP services and so
far we have had two issues when MetaIP has been implemented for  VLAN
that has an unauthorized Linksys router giving out IP addresses.

Is there a scanning tool out there that can determine if there are
unauthorized Linksys (type) routers in a specific VLAN?

Your input is appreciated 

Thank You
