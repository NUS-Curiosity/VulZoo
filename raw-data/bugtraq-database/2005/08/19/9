Subject: anti-phishing implementation


Hi everyone,

I just started to develop an anti-phishing tool for my thesis.

The tool should have two tasks. First one is to detect and prevent
known attacks from web-based and POP3 emails. Second is to analyze
emails' content to identify unknown phishing email and spoofed link.

To make the first task work, I need a full database of known phishing
emails, links. Anybody know where I can get this database?

I really appreciate any suggestion about how to make this tool work, sources,...

Many thanks,
