Subject: Cisco Clean Access Agent (Perfigo) bypass


Description: 
Cisco Clean Access is an easily deployed software solution that can automatically detect, isolate, and clean infected or vulnerable devices that attempt to access your network. It identifies whether networked devices such as laptops, personal digital assistants, even game consoles are compliant with your network's security policies and repairs any vulnerabilities before permitting access to the network. 

Vendor site:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6128/

Affected versions: 
This works in at least 3.5.3.1 and 3.5.4.

Discovery Date: 
2005-08-12

Report Date: 
2005-08-19

Severity:
Medium

Vulnerability: 
End users can bypass the "mandatory" installation of the Clean Access Agent by changing the User-Agent string of their browser. This allows them to connect to the network without the host-based checks being run. If configured, remote checks are still run.
