Synopsis
========

xine-lib contains a format string error in CDDB response handling that
may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

xine-lib is a multimedia library which can be utilized to create
multimedia frontends. It includes functions to retrieve information
about audio CD contents from public CDDB servers.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xine-lib     < 1.1.0-r5                    >= 1.1.0-r5
                                                          *>= 1.0.1-r4
                                                          *>= 1_rc8-r2

Description
===========

Ulf Harnhammar discovered a format string bug in the routines handling
CDDB server response contents.

Impact
======

An attacker could submit malicious information about an audio CD to a
public CDDB server (or impersonate a public CDDB server). When the
victim plays this CD on a multimedia frontend relying on xine-lib, it
could end up executing arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose media-libs/xine-lib
