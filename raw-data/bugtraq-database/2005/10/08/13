Synopsis
========

Weex contains a format string error that may be exploited by malicious
servers to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Weex is a non-interactive FTP client typically used to update web
pages.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /   Vulnerable   /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-ftp/weex     < 2.6.1.5-r1                       >= 2.6.1.5-r1

Description
===========

Ulf Harnhammar discovered a format string bug in Weex that can be
triggered when it is first run (or when its cache files are rebuilt,
using the -r option).

Impact
======

An attacker could setup a malicious FTP server which, when accessed
using Weex, could trigger the format string bug and end up executing
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running Weex.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Weex users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/weex-2.6.1.5-r1"
