Having worked closely with the security teams of most large commercial 
vendors (IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, Apple, HP, Adobe, Real) I can quite 
honestly say that, of all of them, Oracle is the only company to still treat 
security in this way. Most other organizations "got it" years ago and while 
there could be improvements made in various areas the most improvement could 
be made at Oracle.

Firstly, it's due to the facts that I posted as I did. It is fact that the 
patch for Alert 68 fails to properly fix a large number of holes it was 
touted to fix. It is fact that a large number of companies that spent a 
great deal of money installing the patch have wasted their time. It is fact 
that Oracle database servers are still vulnerable to security holes that 
were reported to Oracle years ago.

Oh, this wasn't out of the blue; and there have been a great number of 
public statements about Oracle's failings. Not just from myself, I'll add, 
but others as well.

Because enough is enough.

Because they seem to be the only ones that don't get it.

I tried my local newspaper but they weren't interested. Bugtraq was my 
second choice ;)
Seriously though, where else would you post this? Wasn't this one of the 
main reasons for bugtraq being created in the first place?

Yes. Based upon the facts the Oracle security response has been a failure. 
How else can you describe it?

If you gave me a patch and said it fixed a security flaw and it turns out it 
didn't I'd call that a failure. Multiply that by a factor of tens and you've 
got yourself a complete failure. If I did this to my customers I'd sack 
myself for neglect. Really, I would.
