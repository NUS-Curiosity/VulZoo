Subject: Re: Re: Opinion: Complete failure of Oracle security response and
 utter neglect of their responsibility to their customers


Hello 

I agree with David's and Cesar's opinion. 
 
Here are 3 examples how Oracle is dealing with security:
+++
 
Last week (28-sep-2005) I've got an email from Oracle secalert (secalert_us@...cle.com, signed with the Oracle PGP key). They asked me to remove my already published Oracle security advisories from my webpage (http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/published_alerts.html ) to "protect Oracle's confidential information". 

I declined their request.

Removing already published content from the internet is (nearly) impossible and a waste of time. It's better to use this time to make the products more secure or the patches more stable.

+++

786 days ago I reported a remote exploitable bug (via a simple URL) in Oracle Reports server. An attacker could abuse this bug to destroy an entire Oracle Application Server by overwriting files. This bug is still unfixed (786 days later). 

I hope Oracle will fix this bug in the next CPU in october. In the meantime you could use a workaround developed by Dirk Nachbar (http://www.trivadis.com/Images/OASSecurityHoleE_11092005_tcm17-14060.pdf)

According to Oracle "its policy is to fix vulnerabilities in order of severity, starting with high-priority issues" (see article from 20-july-2005 http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/holes/story/0,10801,103350,00.html). If a remote exploitable bug can wait more then 2 years what other bugs have a higher priority? 


I know that fixing a security bug costs time and money. Large organisation, multiple platforms, different versions, backports, ... 
I don't expect a patch within a few (30) days. But 786 days? 
As recommended by David all customers should talk with Oracle sales, Oracle support, ...

There are still some other open security bugs from 2003. See
http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/upcoming_alerts.html


+++
It seems that the Q/A of the Oracle security patches is non existing:

The latest July CPU 2005 for the Oracle database was modified several times. Oracle is still using the same patch number. No additional version information/sub-version was provided:

Re-Upload Dates:
 14-july-05, 18-jul-05, 20-jul-05, 27-jul-05, 01-aug-05, 09-aug-05, 26-aug-06, 29-aug-05

Some of the reasons for re-upload the patches are: 
CDC.jar was missing, a wrong version of modplsql.so was included, catpatch.sql did not update the registry entry, the fix for a non security-bug was missing (Mixing security and non-security bugs is a strange behaviour), ...

All this information is available on Oracle Metalink:

Betreff: Re: Opinion: Complete failure of Oracle security response and utter neglect of their responsibility to their customers

I support David 100% and I would like to add a few comments (I can't avoid doing this :)):

I remember reading an article where Larry Ellison said that Oracle database server were used by FBI, CIA, USSR goverment, etc. he referenced that as saying our software is the most secure, top goverment agencies from the most powerful nations use it. If you hear or read that it sounds great and if you were looking for a database server at that moment maybe you would run to buy Oracle software, the same when you hear and read Oracle Unbreakable everywhere. What Larry Ellison says it is very easy to say but it is also very difficult to prove. It seems that this kind of statements have been useful for Oracle since the company continues doing the same, "just talking".
I can say that we at Argeniss break Oracle database server all the time, we are tired of breaking Oracle, it's so easy, Oracle software is full of security vulnerabilities and this is nothing new, most security researchers know about this and also the bad guys who are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities. But I can say this and I can also prove it, we have found more than a hundred vulnerabilities and we can show them to people. I wonder if Larry Ellison can prove all the statements he says or Oracle people say.

What I  have seen is Oracle doesn't care much about security, it's just a PR issue for Oracle. When you report a vulnerability to Oracle you get an answer saying we will take a look at this, then months or sometimes years after the initial vulnerability report they release (or not) a patch , that sometimes doesn't work, but what is amazing is that they just fix the bugs you reported they don't audit similar bugs to fix all at once, I can't understand this, we are working for free for them and they are not doing any effort.
Basically when Oracle security problems arise, Mary Ann Davison and Oracle PR team try to deviate attention and blame anyone without focusing on the real problem: "Oracle insecurity". Oracle security has not improved over the last years, everytime there are more and more holes, also security patches are having holes, QA seems that it is not being done at all!. But everytime you hear Oracle people, they will say "Oracle Unbreakable",  "An oracle d/b has not been broken into in 15 years...", "We have 14 security certifications", "Security researchers are evil", "some people complain it's too secure - literally cannot break into it..."
etc. but you never will
hear and also see something like: "We are working hard on improving security because we are doing this and this", "We are fixing all the bugs",  "We want to work with security resarchers", "We stopped development to fix the security bugs"...  etc.
I think that Oracle will start to suffer more and more because security problems, Oracle reminds me Microsoft some years ago, when MS had a lot of security issues that were reflected on sales, until Oracle doesn't see side effect on sales or customers start to pressure, everything will be the same.

I'm seriously thinking to release some Oracle remote 0day next time I hear Larry o Mary saying bullshit to shut their mouths.
