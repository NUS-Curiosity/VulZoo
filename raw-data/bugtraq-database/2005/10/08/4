This is not my experience. Certainly for all the bugs I have found the 
patches released by all vendors save Oracle have fixed the problem. You call 
me out on "where's my evidence?" I ask the same of you - where's your 
evidence that this is not the case and that there are other big vendors that 
are worse?

What are you looking for stats on? Failed fixes? Time of bug report to time 
of patch? It might actually make an interesting read. I'll put something 
like this together over the coming few days and post my findings. In the 
meantime, please accept my assurances that Oracle is on the bottom.

Whilst you are of course right that for most people Oracle is a business 
concern what we also have to remember is that business is _all_ about risk 
and managing that risk. Do I risk investing in a new product line? What's 
the cost; what's the potential gain? What if it goes wrong? Adding more 
risk, due to insecure software, is best avoided; especially with software 
that's responsible for protecting the organization's crown jewels.

In my experience, yes. If you've got something to the contrary then please 
share.

I'll definitely put together the stats.

Sorry - but wasn't this one of the main reasons there was such a thing as 
disclosure? As a means to get the vendors to treat security properly? Btw, 
Oracle don't and never had trusted the "community"  in the first place.

On some levels it was a rant. Does that devalue the information? Not in my 
opinion.

I stand by my comments. They are based on fact. And, if it ever comes to it, 
I would never want the "community" to help foot any legal bill.
