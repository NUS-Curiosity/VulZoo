Not many of them "got it". Some are simply worse.

Amazing statistics. Where are statistics on others?

I'll Google. Thanks.

For security people maybe.. using Oracle for most business is a Business 
concern.

This is the place where you lost me, I am sorry. The only ones?

That is your choice.. although I personally believe you are being very 
extreme in your take on how alone Oracle is.

It's not that I disagree with their behavior being questionable, I 
honestly believe a survey of how all vendors do where the s**t floats to 
the top without singling out the Bad but rather the Good, would work better.

This kind of attack may be "called for" but definitely will make Oracle 
less than willing to ever work with *you* or trust the community, plus 
it will immediately become a PR issue where they may chose to go on 
lawyer-PR strategies rather than "how do we make sure this never happens 
again by getting off that list".
It simply looks like a rant, which is a shame.

Regardless, like I said, you better have a good plan on protecting 
yourself from liability. Right now, right or wrong, it appears like a 
personal attack from you. So, even if the entire community is behind 
you, most of the community won't help foot the legal bill.

Good luck,
