Thanks for the notice.  

Have you considered in your analysis that malicious servers might
return HTTP redirects which contain suitable URLs?  This requires that
the offsiteok member is set to true, though, because in the version I
looked at, only http:// URLs are considered site-local.

(Note: I haven't tried to exploit this, I just browsed the code.)
