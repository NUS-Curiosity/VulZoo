1. Background
=============

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP2, POP3,
IMAP, ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents.

fetchmail ships with a graphical, Python/Tkinter based configuration
utility named "fetchmailconf" to help the user create configuration (run
control) files for fetchmail.

2. Problem description and Impact
=================================

The fetchmailconf program before and excluding version 1.49 opened the
run control file, wrote the configuration to it, and only then changed
the mode to 0600 (rw-------). Writing the file, which usually contains
passwords, before making it unreadable to other users, can expose
sensitive password information.

3. Workaround
=============

Run "umask 077", then run "fetchmailconf" from the same shell. After
fetchmailconf has finished, you can restore your old umask.

4. Solution
===========

For users of fetchmail-6.2.5.2:
-------------------------------
Download fetchmailconf-1.43.2.gz from fetchmail's project site
<http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824&release_id=6617>,
gunzip it, then replace your existing fetchmailconf with it.

For users of fetchmail-6.2.6* or 6.2.9* before 6.2.9-rc6:
---------------------------------------------------------
update to the latest fetchmail-devel package, 6.2.9-rc6 on 2005-10-21.
