Vulnerabilities in Oracle E-Business Suite 11i
Oracle Critical Patch Update - October 2005
October 18, 2005
______________________________________________________________________
 
Summary:

Oracle today released its fourth Critical Patch Update (October 2005).   The
patches contained in the Critical Patch Update will correct numerous
security bugs in the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server, and Oracle
E-Business Suite.  Some of the vulnerabilities in the Critical Patch Update
are high risk and a few can be exploited remotely using a web browser.

Almost all the security bugs fixed in this Critical Patch Update are
exploitable in Oracle E-Business Suite environments and the appropriate
patches should be applied as soon as possible.  Patches for the Oracle
Database, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Developer 6i, and Oracle
E-Business Suite 11i must be applied -- almost all implementations will have
to apply at least 12 patches.  Customers with Internet-facing
implementations of the Oracle E-Business Suite are at most risk and should
consider applying these patches quickly.

The Oracle E-Business Suite patches involved with this Critical Patch Update
are much more complex as compared to the previous CPUs and will require
additional functional testing in our opinion.  In addition, the Oracle
E-Business Suite security patches are not cumulative, therefore, all the
patches specified in this CPU and previous CPUs must be applied. 

Integrigy has released additional guidance to help our clients in
determining the relevance and priority of these patches for their Oracle
E-Business Suite implementations.  The Integrigy analysis for the this
Critical Patch Update is available at --
