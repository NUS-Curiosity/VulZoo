Subject: Oracle Workflow CSS Vulnerability wf_monitor


Dear Bugtraq-Reader,

The Oracle Critical Patch Update October 2005 provides fixes for 2 Cross-Site-
Scripting vulnerabilities in Oracle Workflow found by Red-Database-Security GmbH. 

I know that the severity and impact of CSS bugs is low. My critical security bugs
in Oracle (e.g. become DBA via the import utility or security problems in 
Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)) are still unfixed.

The following (remote exploitable) bug for example is now unfixed since 800 (!) 
days ( = 19.200 hours).
http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/oracle_reports_overwrite_any_file.html

If you think that 800 days are a little bit too long you should contact 
Oracle and ask for the reason. If you are lucky you will get patches from Oracle
with the next critical patch update january 2006 (= 889 days later) or april
2006 (=980 days later).

A list of (my) upcoming Oracle security issues is available here:
