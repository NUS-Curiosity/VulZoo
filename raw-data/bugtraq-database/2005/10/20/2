Synopsis
========

AbiWord is vulnerable to an additional set of buffer overflows during
RTF import, making it vulnerable to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

AbiWord is a free and cross-platform word processing program. It allows
to import RTF files into AbiWord documents.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/abiword      < 2.2.11                        >= 2.2.11

Description
===========

Chris Evans discovered a different set of buffer overflows than the one
described in GLSA 200509-20 in the RTF import function in AbiWord.

Impact
======

An attacker could design a malicious RTF file and entice a user to
import it in AbiWord, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running AbiWord.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All AbiWord users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/abiword-2.2.11"
