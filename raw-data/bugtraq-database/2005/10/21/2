Subject:		OpenServer 5.0.7 : authsh and backupsh buffer overflow
Advisory number: 	SCOSA-2005.40
Issue date: 		2005 October 20

1. Problem Description

	iDEFENSE has identified a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in
	SCO Openserver backupsh. The backupsh utility is a standard
	binary distributed with Openserver 5.0.7 and earlier. 

	Local attackers could supply a specially crafted string to 
	overflow a stack buffer and execute arbitrary code with group 
	backup privileges. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability
	will result in execution of arbitrary code with permissions
	of the running process. The binary is setgid backup by
	default and can be used by attackers with a local account
	to gain backup privileges. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2005-2926 to this issue.


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Binaries
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
