Dear m123303@...hmond.ac.uk,

Again  and  again.  HKEY_CURENT_USER is accessible for user only. If one
can  access user's account he can recover _any_ stored password, because
he can do everything user can.

The only additional reason, storing password in registry is not good, is
password can be easily recovered by someone with physical access to hard
drive.  It's only attack vector comparing with different password store,
for example protected storage.
