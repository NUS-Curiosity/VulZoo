Synopsis
========

Texinfo is vulnerable to symlink attacks, potentially allowing a local
user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

Texinfo is the official documentation system created by the GNU
project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-apps/texinfo      < 4.8-r1                          >= 4.8-r1

Description
===========

Frank Lichtenheld has discovered that the "sort_offline()" function in
texindex insecurely creates temporary files with predictable filenames.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
texindex is executed, this would result in the file being overwritten
with the rights of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Texinfo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/texinfo-4.8-r1"
