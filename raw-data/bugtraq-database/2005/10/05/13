Subject: Security Contact at Skype

Hi All,

I have submitted a request to Skype through the online support form for someone to contact me regarding a remote vulnerability I have discovered.  To date, I have received no correspondence back from them.  Does anyone have a contact email address ?

Thanks in advance

Mark
