Subject: Some new whitepapers ...


Hey all,

I've written two papers available from here 
http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers.htm

The first deals with buffer _underruns_ , DEP and Address Space Layout 
Randomization on Windows. During the paper's review process I was pointed to 
http://www.phrack.org/show.php?p=58 which deals with the same conceptual 
issues to defeat PaX on Linux but, as my paper was completed, I thought I 
may as well still go ahead and release it. Besides mine discusses buffer 
underruns, too :)

The second paper talks about using inference as a means of drilling for data 
with SQL injection and it is based upon a talk I presented at Blackhat 
Europe earlier on in the year. I divide SQL injection data theft attacks 
into three classes - inband, out-of-band and inference. The first, in-band, 
uses the existing connection to get data out; the second, out-of-band, uses 
another channel, e.g. smtp by using builtin database mail functions; and 
lastly inference. With inference there is no actual transfer of data - 
rather it can be inferred what the data is by making observations about 
differences in the way an application behaves.
