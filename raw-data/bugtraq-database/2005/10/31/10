For the record, Matthew's bug is CVE-2002-1954, and it appears to be
unfixed.  An URL which works with Internet Explorer against PHP 5.0.5
is:

  http://localhost/test.php/"</img><script>alert();</script>

This causes the passed JavaScript to be embedded into the PHP logo
reference.

Matthew's original exploit does not work anymore due to changes in the
way requests are handled by Apache or PHP.  However, it exposes an
issue further down in the phpinfo output, which is triggered by
Matthew's original URL:

  http://localhost/test.php?"><SCRIPT>alert(document.URL)</SCRIPT>=x

There is not sufficent public information to tell which bug of the two
is Stefan's.  I'm not sure if the second URL qualifies as "stacked
array assignment", so maybe Stefan discovered yet another problem.

PS: Firefox %-encodes the URLs before sending them to the server, so
these URLs do not work with that browser.
