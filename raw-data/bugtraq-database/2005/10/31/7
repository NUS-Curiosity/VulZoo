Nice try, Stefan.

I reported this vulnerability more than three years ago (against 4.2.x)
on October 12, 2002 via the PHP bug database.  I was told to implement
an .ini setting and the bug was marked "Bogus".

For information, please see PHP Bug #19881:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=19881

That's a hell of a turnaround for you, Esser.  It's the first security
bug I've reported in your software that's actually been fixed.  And it
only took you *THREE YEARS*.  We're finally making some progress here.

Next time, you could try giving me credit for my research as well.  Thanks.

Your work here represents an inexcusable degree of sloppiness and a
complete conflict of interest.  Instead of fixing the bug when I as a
third-party researcher report it, you blow it off.  Then, you
conveniently rediscover it three years later, omitting all mention of
the fact that *your own* project team refused to fix it the first time
around.

Your project has just surpassed both Microsoft and Cisco as *the worst*
security response in the business.  Open source or commercial.  At least
I didn't have to worry about either of them stealing credit for my work,
even if the legal goons at Cisco would prefer to sue me into oblivion.
I will never be working with you again, and I hope nobody else is
foolish enough to, either.

Regards,
Matt Murphy
