I don't have PHP-Fusion, but I do have a question for you. Have you tried
URL=javascript:alert(document.cookie)? If that works, then you have a cross
site scripting vulnerability.

There is a Bug in The News-System:
Post something like:
<me<meta>ta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "1; URL =
http://www.google.com">
and you'll be redirected to google.

Possible Solution: use a recursive function to filter metatags.
