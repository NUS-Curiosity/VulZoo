Subject: SparkleBlog Journal.php HTML Injection Vulnerability =>v2.1 (all
 versions vulnerable)


SparkleBlog is prone to HTMl injection attacks. It is possible for a malicious SparkleBlog user to inject hostile HTML script code into the commentary via form fields. This code may be rendered in the browser of a web user who views the commentary of SparkleBlog.
SparkleBlog does not adequately filter HTMl tags from various fields. This may enable an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into pages that are generated by SparkleBlog 
example:
put <script>alert('test')</script> in the "name:" tag in http://localhost/journal.php?id=1
