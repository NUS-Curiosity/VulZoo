Comment about A4.

Thunderbird explicitly allows you "TLS, if available" - which appears to 
be what you refer to. However, there is a "TLS" - which means only do 
TLS - and alert if the TLS certificate presented doesn't match a known 
one (which would happen in a MITM).

Are you referring to a bug in their "TLS" mode - or implying that "TLS, 
if available" is somehow not... what it says it is...???

Doesn't sound like a hole to me.
