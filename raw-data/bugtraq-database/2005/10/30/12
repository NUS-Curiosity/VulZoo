Subject: Vulnerability in MG2 php based Image Gallery - bypass security,
 view password protected images


The MG2 Image Gallery system has the ability to make create online galleries. Even password protected once.

By manipulating url from a gallery, you are able to list out all pictures in every gallery. Even though they are inside a password protected folder.

Sample manipulation could be:
www.yoursite.com/mg2/index.php?list=*&page=all

The "*" replaces the album number, showing every album.
The "all" command is an option programmed in the system to view all pictures within a SINGLE gallery.

Those two combined, will expose any password protected images.

The system can be downloaded from:
