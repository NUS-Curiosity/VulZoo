Network Appliance sent out Field Alert Notice #260 to customers today 
about this upgrade.  From their email:

Important Fixes
    ---------------
    175888 - Filer stops serving NFS after a bad thread synchronization
             event

    176788 - FAS3020/FAS3050 may respond slowly to requests, exhibit poor
             performance

That's it.  NOT ONE WORD ABOUT A VULNERABILITY OR A FIX.  From reading 
that synopsis, if I weren't using NFS or a FAS3020/FAS3050, I probably 
wouldn't be very interested in applying the update, and my systems would 
remain vulnerable.

You're releasing security fixes for an infrastructure product without 
telling your customers!  Who do you think you are, Cisco?

Almost as annoying: I went to view the NetApp pages linked above, and 
the site made me register.  After registration, I'm told I'm not 
authorized to view the pages.  (So why'd you want me to register?)
