Interesting

Have you considered the possibility that some vendors at least may 
include with each virus signature a set of file formats for which the 
signature is valid, or just a flag to signify "all formats"?

If so, then the vendors will consider themselves not vulnerable, they 
can simply update their virus definitions when and if variants with 
different headers appear.

Even with 1:1 file format signatures, a vendor could presumable include 
multiple virus definitions for one virus, one per file format, as 
required
