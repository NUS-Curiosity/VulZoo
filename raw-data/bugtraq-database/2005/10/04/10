I know of at least one similar case in Italy.

I would add that in some cases even "sharing" these files on
peer-to-peer networks can be an innocent act, for instance if you
bulk-download them from a user, and before inspecting their content
someone downloads them from your shared folder.

In Italy, "trading" this type of material is a distinct charge from
"owning" it.

I have asked the same question to law enforcement personnel, but with no
satisfactory answers for now.

I agree, from my own experience as a forensics consultant.
