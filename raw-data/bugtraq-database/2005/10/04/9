I have known hundreds, that law enforcement seized and examined a computer
and after the examination returned the system due to lack of evidence. None
of those people attempted suicide. As a matter of fact the LEA's never file
charges until after the examination.

The key here is every one being investigated and thousands being arrested.
Do you happen to know the number of CC's in the operations, was it not close
to 1,000,000

After an investigation proved, through other means, that a person was the
one using the card and arrest would be facilitated.

I have asked you this before, can you please cite these "numerous cases in
which the computer forensic evidence proves that a third party intruder was
in control of the suspect's computer".  I have several LEA's who will gladly
help re-review the cases and help get them overturned.

I have NEVER seen a case that some was convicted, or even gotten as far as
filing charges based merely on presence and items in unallocated space
without other circumstances.

The LEA's are trained to be responsible, they look for file structure, and
most of the time they find external copies, (Carom's, DVD's etc) of the
contraband.

They absolutely do.  As an ex-LEA an and someone who reviews cases before
they go to court, I can tell you a hundreds occasions where charges were
dropped.

Most LEA's will not even look at Temp Inet file or Unallocated cluster until
after they find more substantial items.

The DA's a LEA's are compelled to turn over evidence to exonerate the
accused.

Funny it the Defense attorneys are the one I cannot get to buy off on my
ethics.  That is my rule that both parties get a copy of my report no matter
if they like the results or not.

They go through much greater training than that, and it takes much more than
just data on a H/D to get them to effect and arrest. Most go through FLETC
and receive at a minimum DEASTP and SCERS.  Many additionally have their
CFCE, that is one of the better examinations for certification I have seen.

Hard drive evidence is not circumstantial, there must be many factors that
go along with it.
Sorry I cannot speak for how they handle cases in the UK.

And as for your subject line "Careless Law Enforcement Computer Forensics
Lacking InfoSec Expertise Causes Suicides" people who commit suicide tend to
have underlying problems to strart with.
