Overview: 

Taken from gfi.com:

GFI MailSecurity for SMTP is a Content filtering, anti-virus and 
Email Intrusion prevention product from GFI.

GFI MailSecurity is available as an SMTP gateway version and for 
VS API. The gateway version should be deployed at the perimeter 
of the network as a mail relay server and scans inbound and 
outbound mail. The VS API version integrates seamlessly with 
Exchange Server 2000/2003 and scans the Exchange information stores.
Both versions can be deployed simultaneously to achieve optimum 
protection.


Vulnerability Details: 

Sec-1 has identified an exploitable Buffer Overflow within the HTTP
management interface. By sending large strings within several areas
of the HTTP request (such as a large 'Host' or 'Accept' header)
critical portions of memory are overwritten. Verification of this
vulnerability can be achieved through the use of a HTTP fuzzer, such 
as @stake webproxy. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker
to gain administrative control of the targeted host.
