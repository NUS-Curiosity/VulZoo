Subject: PullThePlug Contest: Call For Papers


Hi,

The PullThePlug Contest is a unique opportunity for individuals in the
information security community to share their knowledge in the form of
interesting and innovative papers and win a prize in the process. 

All the papers will be reviewed by our Contest Voting Panel and the best
entries will be rewarded with a prize (sponsored to us by Learn Security
Online http://www.learnsecurityonline.com/) 

All entries will also be received by the staff of the upcoming e-zine
"Uninformed" (http://www.uninformed.org/), where some of the entries may
be published in the next release. 

The contest starts on October 10th 2005 and will end on February 10th
2006. Winners are announced by March 1st 2006.
