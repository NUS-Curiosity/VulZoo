Subject: Revised draft on ICMP attacks


Folks,

I have published a revision of my draft on ICMP attacks against TCP. Some 
new stuff you may find interesting is a corner case for the attack against 
the PMTUD mechanism, that could allow an attacker to freeze TCP 
connections, even those secured by means of IPSec. You can find that stuff 
in Section 7.1 of the draft. This revision also addresses some recent 
discussions at the TCPM WG mailing-list.

The draft is available at 
http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/draft-gont-tcpm-icmp-attacks-05.txt 
(http://www.gont.com.ar/draft/icmp-attacks-against-tcp.html)

Feedback is welcome, noise should go to /dev/null.
