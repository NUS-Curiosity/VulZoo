========================================================================

== Overview ==

During an audit of a client, Security-Assessment.com discovered multiple 
critical vulnerabilities within the RockLiffe MailSite Express WebMail 
software. 

The vulnerabilities include the retrieval of arbitrary files from the
web server, and bypassing attachment validation routines allowing for  
remote code execution.

== Exploitation ==

Exploit 1: Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recipients who save their login information locally are vulnerable to 
account theft when viewing HTML encoded messages with embedded JavaScript.

When the option to save login information is selected the users password
is stored as plaintext within the cookie.

Crafting an email with scripting in the body will cause the execution of
the scripting in the context of the site, allowing for the theft of the
stored credentials.

A basic test for this is to include the following in the body of a message;
    <script> alert(document.cookie) </script>

Exploit 2: Multiple Script Attachment Validation Flaws
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The WebMail software attempts to verify the validity of an attachment within
a received message. It automatically modifies the extension of any files
ending in .asp, by changing them to .asp.txt. This is an attempt to avoid
remote code execution through an attached file.

However, these validity checks can be defeated and script files saved to
the server.

By default, only files ending in .asp are identified and rejected as script
files.  If a malicious user were to attach an .asa file instead, Web Mail
would accept the script attachment, saving the file locally with the
.asa extension.

When the .asa file is requested the script contents are executed in the same
manner as a .asp file. This flaw could also be affected by other extensions
such as .htr and .aspx.

A similar flaw exists when an attachment is sent with the filename
unknown.unk.

In this instance the message subject is used as the file name, and .asa
script files can be saved locally.

Exploit 3: Retrieve Arbitrary System Files via Web Mail
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The location of file attachments for a mail message currently been composed,
are stored as a physical file path included in the HTML as a hidden field.

An example of this is shown below;

<input type="hidden" name="AttachPath" 
value="H:\Express3Webmail6.1.20\cache\5116FC5113B47C0B1CDD5\440820634>

This value points to the location where the attachments for the message are
stored, by default all files within this directory are considered
attachments for the message currently being composed.

This value can be manipulated and a message can be sent with arbitrary
'attachments'. 

For example, posting the variable AttachPath = H:\Express3Webmail6.1.20\
would send the recipient a copy of the docroot.

== Solutions ==

Security-Assessment.com has been in contact with RockLiffe software and a 
new version of the software has been released to address the discovered
vulnerabilities.

Security-Assessment.com urges RockLiffe users to upgrade to v6.1.22 
by downloading the new version at
