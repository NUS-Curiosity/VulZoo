yap, maybe* but i consider this issue equv. to the 'classic issue' of
adding NOP to the shell-code to bypass IDS/IPS You ain't gonna add
every possible combinations as signatures!

Is, CA eTrust Antivirus, run in Reviewer mode by default?
(sorry, i haven't tryed ant Av lately)

Variant huh?

	My defination of variant are bit straight forward. And sure isn't a
'universal trick' that can be used to modified any malicious
executable (which has known Av signature)  by a 8 year old with 0
programming knowledge or by using any special tools to make it
un-detectable, later. Admit it... Av vendors aren't going to
doyuble/tripple their Av defination to detect all of such possible
varient.
Common, is the execution point of ANY instruction code or program flow
is being changed?

Lastly, yap I also feel there are 2 type of ppl. in the world. One who
gives answers to a question and the other who askz another another
question AS the answer of the previous question.
