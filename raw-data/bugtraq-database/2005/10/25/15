	Execution Vulnerability


SEC-CONSULT Security Advisory 20051025-0
======================================================================
                  title: Snoopy Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
                program: Snoopy PHP Webclient
     vulnerable version: 1.2 and earlier
               homepage: http://snoopy.sourceforge.net
                  found: 2005-10-10

vendor description:
---------------

Snoopy is a PHP class that simulates a web browser. It automates the
task of retrieving web page content and posting forms, for example.

Snoopy is used by various RSS parser, which are in turn used in a
whole bunch of applications like weblogs, content management systems,
and many more.


vulnerabilty overview:
---------------

Whenever an SSL protected webpage is requested with one of the many
Snoopy API calls, it calls the function _httpsrequest which takes
the URL as argument. This function in turn calls the PHP-function
exec with unchecked user-input. Using a specially crafted URL, an
attacker can supply arbitrary commands that are executed on the web
server with priviledges of the web user.

While the vulnerability can not be exploited using the Snoopy class
file itself, there may exist implementations which hand unchecked
URLs from users to snoopy.


proof of concept:
---------------

Consider the following code on a webserver:
--- code ---
<?
include "Snoopy.class.php";
$snoopy = new Snoopy;

$snoopy->fetch($_GET['url']);
echo "<PRE>\n";
print $snoopy->results;
echo "</PRE>\n";
?>
--- /code ---

Requesting this code with a manipulated URL results in execution
of arbitrary code (in this case "echo 'hello' > test.txt"). Please
consider the following url one line:

http://server/fetch.php?url=https://www.%22;+echo+'hello'+%3E+
test.txt


vulnerable versions:
---------------

It seems that version 1.2 as well as some prior versions are vulnerable
to the attack described above.

recommended fix:
---------------

Update to Snoopy version 1.2.1.
