Again, the ZAP report by the vendor indicates and I quote:

^^^
ZoneAlarm Pro, ZoneAlarm AntiVirus, ZoneAlarm Wireless Security, and 
ZoneAlarm Security Suite version 6.0 or later automatically protect 
against this attack in the default configuration. 

ZoneAlarm Pro, ZoneAlarm AntiVirus, ZoneAlarm Wireless Security, and 
ZoneAlarm Security Suite version 5.5 are protected against this attack by 
enabling the .Advanced Program Control. feature. 

Check Point Integrity client versions 6.0 and 5.1 are protected against 
this attack by enabling the .Advanced Program Control. feature. 
^^^

This does not include the version 3.7.159 you are testing.  In my 
interpretation of the report the vendor is not stating that said version 
is "unaffected".   Ergo... time to upgrade!
