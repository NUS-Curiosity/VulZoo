Subject: Revision: Multiple Critical and High Vulnerabilities in Oracle Database Server


Having downloaded and given the Oracle October patch a cursory examination, 
some of the flaws Oracle told me were being fixed, remain exploitable. Once 
again the patch is not sufficient. I will conduct a full investigation of 
the patch over the coming few days and post some recommendations once 
complete. Incidently, it's good to see that the NGS Disclosure policy of not 
publicly releasing details of the flaws "fixed" seems to work as a useful 
fail safe mechanism.

More to follow...
Cheers,
