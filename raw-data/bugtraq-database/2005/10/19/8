Subject: Metasploit Framework v2.5


The Metasploit Framework is an advanced open-source exploit
development platform. The 2.5 release includes three user interfaces,
105 exploits and 75 payloads.

The Framework will run on any modern operating system that has a working
Perl interpreter. The Windows installer includes a slimmed-down version
of the Cygwin environment.

This is a maintenance release - all updates to 2.4 have been rolled into
2.5, along with some new exploits and minor features.
  
This release is available from the Metasploit.com web site:
  - Unix:  http://metasploit.com/tools/framework-2.5.tar.gz
  - Win32: http://metasploit.com/tools/framework-2.5.exe

A demonstration of the msfweb interface is running live from:
  - http://metasploit.com:55555/
 
Information about version 3.0 has been posted online:
  - http://metasploit.com/projects/Framework/msf3/
  
Exploit modules designed for the 2.2 through 2.4 releases should maintain
compatibility with 2.5. If you run into any problems using older
modules with this release, please let us know.

The Framework development team consists of a few active members and
over a dozen contributors. Check out the donations web page for a complete
list of contributors:
