Synopsis
========

The Berkeley MPEG Tools use temporary files in various insecure ways,
potentially allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

The Berkeley MPEG Tools are a collection of utilities for manipulating
MPEG video technology, including an encoder (mpeg_encode) and various
conversion utilities.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/mpeg-tools      < 1.5b-r2                  >= 1.5b-r2

Description
===========

Mike Frysinger of the Gentoo Security Team discovered that mpeg_encode
and the conversion utilities were creating temporary files with
predictable or fixed filenames. The 'test' make target of the MPEG
Tools also relied on several temporary files created insecurely.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
the utilities are executed (or 'make test' is run), this would result
in the file being overwritten with the rights of the user running the
command.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Berkeley MPEG Tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mpeg-tools-1.5b-r2"
