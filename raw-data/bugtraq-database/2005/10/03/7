Funny Paul!! You are simple exaggerating upon the same point again and again
in a new style each time. Well, They don't even say that ZAP versions prior
to v5 are vulnerable in their advisory. 

Can you say Product X Pro is un-affected to a particular vulnerability while
Product X (ver 4x / 5x ..) are vulnerable.. NO ! The statement is not
specific and will keep the customers/users clueless whether or not their
firewall version is weak.. The vendor needs to be specific here saying which
versions of Product X Pro is un-affected and which are not.

You many also like to read the ZA user's comments on this issue posted at
Zone Labs's user forum -

Its really funny to see that the vendor wants to keep their EGO up-2-date by
covering up this issue with their latest version 6.0 =))



Gud Luck !!

What I'm saying is that the vendor never claimed ZAP versions prior to 5 are
not vulnerable in the report.  So you're comment is redundant.  Simply
upgrade your version.  Ciao.
