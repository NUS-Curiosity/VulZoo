Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 10.13.05: Multiple
	Vendor wget/curl NTLM Username Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


Multiple Vendor wget/curl NTLM Username Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 10.13.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=322&type=vulnerabilities
October 13, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP,
HTTPS and FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols. It is a
non-interactive commandline tool, so it may easily be called from
scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc. More
information on Wget is available from the vendor website:

	http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html

curl is a command line tool for transferring files with URL syntax,
supporting FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, GOPHER, TELNET, DICT, FILE and LDAP.
Curl supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading,
HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password authentication
(Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, kerberos...), file transfer resume,
proxy tunneling and a busload of other useful tricks. More information
on curl is available from the vendor website:

	http://curl.haxx.se/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in multiple 
vendor's implementations of curl and wget allows attackers to execute 
arbitrary code. 

The vulnerability specifically exists due to insufficient bounds 
checking on user-supplied data supplied to a memory copy operation. The 
memcpy() of the supplied ntlm username to ntlmbuf shown below results 
in a stack overflow:

http-ntlm.c in ntlm_output() on line 532:

    /* size is now 64 */
    size=64;
    ntlmbuf[62]=ntlmbuf[63]=0;

    memcpy(&amp;ntlmbuf[size], domain, domlen);
    size += domlen;

    memcpy(&amp;ntlmbuf[size], usr, userlen);
    size += userlen;

The resulting stack overflow can be leveraged to gain arbitrary code 
execution with user privileges.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attackers to 
execute arbitrary code with permissions of the http client process. 
User interaction is required. Exploitation requires a user to use one 
of the affected clients to connect to a malicious website.

This vulnerability affects both wget and curl clients similarly because 
wget 1.10 adopted the curl ntlm authentication source code into its own 
code base. The described vulnerability requires that ntlm authentication

is enabled in the affected client versions. A factor that somewhat 
increases the risk of this vulnerability is that a client can be forced 
to reconnect using ntlm authentication by issuing a HTTP 302 REDIRECT 
command to the connecting client.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE Labs has confirmed the following software versions are 
vulnerable:

    *   wget 1.10
    *   curl 7.13.2
    *   libcurl 7.13.2 

V. WORKAROUND

As a workaround solution, disable NTLM support in wget and curl 
installations.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

wget 1.10.2 has been released to address this issue and is available for
download at:

   http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/wget/

curl has released the following patch to address this issue:

   http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-ntlmbuf.patch

curl has also released the following security advisory:

   http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2005-10/0061.html
   
Additionally, the maintainers of curl-web have provided the following
details on affected versions:

Affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.10.6 to and including 7.14.1

Not affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.10.5 and earlier,
  7.15.0 and later

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CAN-2005-3185 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for
security problems.
