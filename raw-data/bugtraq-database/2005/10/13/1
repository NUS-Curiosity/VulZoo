VERITAS NetBackup: Java User-Interface, format string vulnerability

Revision History
None 

Severity
HIGH

Remote Access			Yes
Local Access			Yes
Authentication Required		No
Exploit publicly Available	No

Overview
The remote exploitation of a format string overflow vulnerability in the
Java user-interface authentication service, bpjava-msvc, running on VERITAS
NetBackup servers and agents, could potentially allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code on a targeted system with elevated privileges.

Affected Product(s)
Product	Version	Build	Platform	Solution
VERITAS NetBackup Data and Business Center	4.5FP	All	All	NB_45_9S1443_F
VERITAS NetBackup Data  and Business Center	4.5MP	All	All	NB_45_9S1729_M
VERITAS NetBackup Enterprise/Server/Client	5.0	All	All	NB_50_5S1320_M
VERITAS NetBackup Enterprise/Server/Client	5.1	All	All	NB_51_3AS0949_M
VERITAS NetBackup Enterprise/Server/Client	6.0	All	All	NB_60_3S0007_M


Details
TippingPoint, a division of 3Com, notified Symantec of a format string
overflow vulnerability in VERITAS NetBackup that could potentially allow a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability exists in the
authentication service, bpjava-msvc daemon, in the Java user-interface.  If
a remote attacker were able to access the service and successfully exploit
this vulnerability, they could potentially execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the bpjava-msvc daemon, normally root or SYSTEM, on the
targeted system.  


Symantec Response

Symantec Engineers have verified this issue and made security updates
available for the supported VERITAS NetBackup products. Symantec strongly
recommends all customers immediately apply the latest updates for their
supported product versions to protect against these types of threats.

The patches listed above for NetBackup DataCenter and NetBackup
BusinessServer  4.5 and for NetBackup Enterprise Server and NetBackup
Server 5.0, 5.1, and 6.0 are available from the following location:
 http://support.veritas.com/docs/279085

NOTE:  In a recommended installation, VERITAS NetBackup should be
restricted to trusted access only. The VERITAS NetBackup Server or clients
should never be visible external to the network which greatly reduces
opportunities for unauthorized access.

Symantec is unaware of any exploit of or adverse customer impact from this
issue.

Symantec Security Response has released IPS/IDS signatures to detect and
prevent attempts to exploit this issue.

Symantec ManHunt 3.0 signatures are available for update from the Symantec
Security Response Update Center at: 
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/Product/Prod
uct_MH.html 

Symantec Network Security Appliance 7100 signatures are available for
update from the Symantec Security Response Update Center at: 
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/Product/Prod
uct_SNS.html 

Symantec Gateway Security 3.0 signatures are available for update from the
Symantec Security Response Update Center at: 
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/Product/Prod
uct_SGS.html 

Symantec Client Security 2.0 and 3.0 signatures are available for update
via LiveUpdate and from the Security Response Update Center at: 
http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/Product/Product_SCS.html 

Customers using Symantec Client Security 2.0 and 3.0 should have already
uploaded this signature if they run LiveUpdate regularly. If not, Symantec
recommends customers manually run Symantec LiveUpdate to ensure they have
the most current protection. 
As part of normal best practices, Symantec strongly recommends: 
� Restricting access to administration or management systems to privileged
users.
� Restricting remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems
only.
� Running under the principle of least privilege where possible to limit
the impact of exploit by threats such as this. 
� Keeping all operating systems and applications updated with the latest
vendor patches. 
� Following a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and
antivirus applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of
detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats. 
� Deploying network intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic
for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of
attacks or malicious activity related to exploitation of latent
vulnerabilities
