Subject: Re: VoIP-Phones: Weakness in proccessing SIP-Notify-Messages


List,

I just wanted to inform you that I wrote a tiny script, which enables 
you to test the discussed vulnerability with your equipment.

This script works perfect with Grandstream BT100, Cisco phones won't 
work on the fly. Please refer to the README for more information.

You can download the script here:

(german website, but you should be able to download it. If not, feel 
free to send me an eMail).


Cheers,

> Summary:

>     process spoofed status messages like "Messages-Waiting".
