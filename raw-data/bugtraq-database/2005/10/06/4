Synopsis
========

Ruby is vulnerable to a security bypass of the safe level mechanism.

Background
==========

Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming. Ruby supports the safe execution of
untrusted code using a safe level and taint flag mechanism.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/ruby       < 1.8.3                              >= 1.8.3

Description
===========

Dr. Yutaka Oiwa discovered that Ruby fails to properly enforce safe
level protections.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code
beyond the restrictions specified in each safe level.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.3"
