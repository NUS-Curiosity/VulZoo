Subject: WASC Threat Classification in 4 languages



The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) is announcing the  
availability of the Web Security Threat Classification in English,  
Japanese, Spanish, and Turkish. The material is open source and  
provided in TXT, PDF, and DOC formats.


The Web Security Threat Classification is a cooperative effort to  
clarify and organize the threats to the security of a web site. The  
members of the Web Application Security Consortium have created this  
project to develop and promote industry standard terminology for  
describing these issues. Application developers, security  
professionals, software vendors, and compliance auditors will have  
the ability to access a consistent language for web security related  
issues.
