3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in Webroot Desktop
Firewall, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain
escalated privileges or bypass certain security restrictions.

1) A boundary error in PWIWrapper.dll when deleting a program from the
list of "allowed" programs can cause a buffer overflow in
FirewallNTService.exe. This can be exploited by sending a specially
crafted application chain to the firewall driver via a
DeviceIoControl() command, and then removing an "allowed" program
from the firewall GUI.

Successful exploitation allows non-privileged users to execute
arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, but requires the the ability
to add and remove programs from the firewall's permitted application
list.

2) It is possible for non-privileged users to disable the firewall
even when password protection has been enabled, by sending specific
DeviceIoControl() commands to the firewall driver.

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Update to version 1.3.0 build 52.
