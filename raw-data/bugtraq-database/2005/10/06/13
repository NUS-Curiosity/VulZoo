======================================================================
4) Description of Vulnerabilities

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in PHP-Fusion, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct SQL injection 
attacks.

Input passed to the "activate" parameter in "register.php" and the 
"cat_id" parameter in "faq.php" isn't properly sanitised before being 
used in a SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries 
by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 6.00.109. Other 
versions may also be affected.

======================================================================
5) Solution

Update to version 6.00.110.
