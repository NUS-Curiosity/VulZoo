I'm sorry if it sounded that way - I'm also not jealous of Mr. Ellison's 
riches (I've not directly contributed to them, mind you).
I just wanted to make the proportions visible ;-)
 From my view, there is no doubt that you alone have done a great deal 
of work to secure Oracle products - I assume with little financial 
reward from Oracle itself.
This enforces the popular view that (most) big corporations don't 
"value" something until it costs money - and if it costs a lot of money, 
it must be of big value...
Sounds like a Dilbert-esque PHB'ism, but that's the impression I get.

Unless a whistleblower (image of Larry keelhauling him comes up...) 
comes forward, only Ms. Davidson can shade some light on how exactly the 
QA- and patch-creation process works and why it can take literally years 
to put out a security-update (that turns out to be little less than a 
placebo) to a currently shipped product.
