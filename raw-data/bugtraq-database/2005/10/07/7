Details
#######
Oracle HTML DB is a rapid web application development tool for the Oracle 
database. Using only a web browser and limited programming experience, it is 
possible to develop and deploy professional-looking applications that are both 
fast and secure. 

During the manuell installation of HTMLDB the SYS password is logged in plaintext 
into the file install.lst. The SYS password should never be stored in a text file 
in clear text.
