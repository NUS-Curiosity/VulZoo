Details
#######
Oracle HTML DB is a rapid web application development tool for the Oracle 
database. Using only a web browser and limited programming experience, it 
is possible to develop and deploy professional-looking applications that 
are both fast and secure. 

HTMLDB contains some Cross Site Scritpting vulnerabilities. An attacker 
could abuse these security bugs to execute own SQL statements in the 
database by sending specially crafted HTMLDB url to a HTMLDB user.
