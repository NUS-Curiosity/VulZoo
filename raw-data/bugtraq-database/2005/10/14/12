Subject: Gallery 2.x Remote File Access Vulnerability



Vendor information:

    Gallery is an open source web based photo album organizer.  The
    2.x is a newly released complete rewrite of the application.

    Url: http://gallery.menalto.com
    Contact: gallery@...alto.com

Vulnerability class:

    Input sanitization

Details:

    Michael Dipper has discovered an input sanitization issue that
    allows users to specially craft a url to access any file on the
    server that is accessible by the webserver.  The vulnerability
    may be used by any visitor to the Gallery, no user login is
    required.

Exploit:

    The vulnerability may be exploited by accessing a URL like this:

      http://example.com/gallery2/main.php
         ?g2_itemId=/../../../../../../../etc/aliases%00

    Internally the Gallery caching code uses this variable to
    construct a relative filename to a cache file.  Using ../..
    elements in the path allow you to escape the Gallery directory
    and view files that are not regularly available via the webserver.

Solution:

    The Gallery team has released Gallery 2.0.1 which resolves this
    security issue by validating the input variable, modifying the
    caching code to prevent it from generating paths with '..' in
    them, and modifying the choke point on included files to prevent
    it from loading files that contain '..' in them.

    Download 2.0.1 (including patch files from 2.0) from here:
