Synopsis
========

KOffice and KWord are vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the RTF
importer, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

KOffice is an integrated office suite for KDE. KWord is the KOffice
word processor.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/koffice     < 1.4.1-r1                     >= 1.4.1-r1
  2  app-office/kword       < 1.4.1-r1                     >= 1.4.1-r1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Chris Evans discovered that the KWord RTF importer was vulnerable to a
heap-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially-crafted RTF file,
potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running the affected application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All KOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/koffice-1.4.1-r1"

All KWord users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/kword-1.4.1-r1"
