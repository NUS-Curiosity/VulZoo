Overview:
The MultiVOIP voice over IP gateway provides toll-free voice and fax

execution.

Details:
The buffer overflow occurs in the SIP packet INVITE field with a
string greater than 60 characters. Testing was performed on an
embedded device with limited debug environment. Source code was not
avaible for further analysys.
