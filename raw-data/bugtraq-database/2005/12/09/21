Subject: Motorola SB5100E Cable Modem DoS


Hello.

Sending "land" packet to motorola device, will cause it to crash.

"LanD" packet is simple TCP syn packet:
Source IP = 192.168.100.1
Destanation IP = 192.168.100.1
Source Port = 80
Destanation Port =80
SYN  Flag= 1

One packet can crash modem and all network on cable part will be 
unreacheble.
Only physical restart can help.

May be other models are vulnerable.

Alexey Sintsov.
