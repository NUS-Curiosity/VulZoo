Subject: New Project Started

 

 I'm just thinking aloud, I have started a new security list, and discussion
focused on Latin research and for people on Spanish, I don't know really if
it could work, but I want to try.

For some people is just a fail intended, but for me could be a new space for
discussion and research.

More than publicity of the list I want opinions, and suggestions. 

 

Also if you want to take a look around:

I will be glad about suggestions XD.
