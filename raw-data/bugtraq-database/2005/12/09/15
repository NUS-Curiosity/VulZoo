Subject: [KDE Security Advisory] multiple buffer overflows in
	kpdf/koffice



KDE Security Advisory: kpdf/xpdf multiple integer overflows
Original Release Date: 2005-12-07
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20051207-1.txt

0. References
        CAN-2005-3191

        CAN-2005-3193


1. Systems affected:

        KDE 3.2.0 up to including KDE 3.5.0
	KOffice 1.3.0 up to including KOffice 1.4.2


2. Overview:

        kpdf, the KDE pdf viewer, shares code with xpdf. xpdf contains
        multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities that allow specially
	crafted pdf files, when opened, to overflow a heap allocated
	buffer and execute arbitrary code. 


3. Impact:

        Remotely supplied pdf files can be used to execute arbitrary
	code on the client machine.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
