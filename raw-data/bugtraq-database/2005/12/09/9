========= 
Overview:
========= 

  MyBB is a powerful, efficient and free forum package developed in 
  PHP and MySQL. 

  Version MyBB PR2 Rev.686 and prior contain multiple critical 
  vulnerabilities. It is possible to fully compromise a MyBB
  installation.

  Some of the vulnerabilities can be successfully exploited by every
  anonymous guest user of MyBB.

  I'm going to withhold details of these flaws for two weeks. Full 
  details will be published on the 23th December 2005. This two week
  window will allow users of MyBB the time needed to apply the 
  patches before the details are released to the general public.


========= 
Solution: 
=========

  Upgrade to MyBB 1.0 or newer.
