Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in Dropbear could allow authenticated users to
execute arbitrary code as the root user.

Background
==========

Dropbear is an SSH server and client with a small memory footprint.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/dropbear       < 0.47                            >= 0.47

Description
===========

Under certain conditions Dropbear could fail to allocate a sufficient
amount of memory, possibly resulting in a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

By sending specially crafted data to the server, authenticated users
could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the SSH server user, which is the root user by default.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Dropbear users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/dropbear-0.47"

==========
