Hi Reed,
   
  I'm unable to verify that. I'm sure someone else will.
   
  Regardless, as indicated by the previous Full-Disclosure posting by Pretty Vacant, the behavior you're speaking about has been known for years. Sorry you wasted your time. 
   
  It's clear you were unaware of the previous research. You must have thought it was pretty important, considering how many lists you cross posted to.
   
  Thanks for your efforts.

  Sir,

On Windows 2000 operating systems the default permissions for the root
of the OS drive is Everyone/Full Control. However, with Microsoft
operating systems newer than Windows 2000 administrative privileges
are necessary. Thank you for your comment.

Regards,
Reed
