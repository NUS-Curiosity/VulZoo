 Collaboration Suite SMTP Format String Vulnerability



Ipswitch Collaboration Suite SMTP Format String Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.06.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=346&type=vulnerabilities
December 6, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Ipswitch Collaboration Suite provides e-mail and real-time
collaboration, calendar and contact list sharing, and protection from
spam and viruses, all delivered in an easy to use suite.

     http://www.ipswitch.com/products/collaboration/index.asp

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a format string vulnerability in Ipswitch
IMail allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper use of functions
which allow format specifiers in the SMTP service included with ICS.
Remote attackers can supply format string values to certain string
functions to cause memory corruption leading to remote code execution.
The vulnerability may be exploited by supplying specially crafted
strings to any of the following SMTP commands: EXPN, MAIL, MAIL FROM,
RCPT TO. All of the commands are handled by the same function which
parses user-supplied input strings. The following debugger session
shows a backtrace with user-supplied strings as values. With properly
constructed input value, the strings would be interpreted as memory
addresses that would be executed upon returning from the current
function.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of the format string vulnerability allows
unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. Ipswitch
mail services are commonly configured to allow untrusted access. The
use of a firewall or other mitigating strategy is highly recommended
due to the nature of this vulnerability. The IMail SMTP server is
installed by default.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE Labs has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in
Ipswitch Collaboration Suite 8.20.

V. WORKAROUND

iDEFENSE is currently unaware of any effective workarounds for this
issue. Access to the affected host should be filtered at the network
boundary if global accessibility is not required. Restricting access to
only trusted hosts and networks may reduce the likelihood of
exploitation.
