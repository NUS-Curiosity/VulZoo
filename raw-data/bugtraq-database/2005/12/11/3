Synopsis
========

Multiple flaws in phpMyAdmin may lead to several XSS issues and local
and remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the
administration of MySQL over the web.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/phpmyadmin     < 2.7.0_p1                      >= 2.7.0_p1

Description
===========

Stefan Esser from Hardened-PHP reported about multiple vulnerabilties
found in phpMyAdmin. The $GLOBALS variable allows modifying the global
variable import_blacklist to open phpMyAdmin to local and remote file
inclusion, depending on your PHP version (CVE-2005-4079, PMASA-2005-9).
Furthermore, it is also possible to conduct an XSS attack via the
$HTTP_HOST variable and a local and remote file inclusion because the
contents of the variable are under total control of the attacker
(CVE-2005-3665, PMASA-2005-8).

Impact
======

A remote attacker may exploit these vulnerabilities by sending
malicious requests, causing the execution of arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running the web server. The cross-site scripting
issues allow a remote attacker to inject and execute malicious script
code or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, potentially
allowing unauthorized access to phpMyAdmin.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.7.0_p1"
