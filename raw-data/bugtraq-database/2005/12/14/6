Synopsis
========

The sendmail program in Xmail is vulnerable to a buffer overflow,
potentially resulting in local privilege escalation.

Background
==========

Xmail is an Internet and intranet mail server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-mta/xmail       < 1.22                               >= 1.22

Description
===========

iDEFENSE reported that the AddressFromAtPtr function in the sendmail
program fails to check bounds on arguments passed from other functions,
and as a result an exploitable stack overflow condition occurs when
specifying the "-t" command line option.

Impact
======

A local attacker can make a malicious call to sendmail, potentially
resulting in code execution with elevated privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Xmail users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-mta/xmail-1.22"
