These commands appear within a "<?php >" construct, so on a properly
configuredeb server, I would think that the code would be executed due
to the ".php' extension.  So there would not be any leak to a remote
attacker unless the attacker used some other vulnerability to obtain
the file.

Or is this a concern for multiple users on the same server?  (I don't
know PHP that well so apologies if this is a dumb question.)
