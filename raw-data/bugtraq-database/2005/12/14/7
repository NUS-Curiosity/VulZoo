Synopsis
========

Ethereal is missing bounds checking in the OSPF protocol dissector that
could lead to abnormal program termination or the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Ethereal is a feature-rich network protocol analyzer. It provides
protocol analyzers for various network flows, including one for Open
Shortest Path First (OSPF) Interior Gateway Protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /   Vulnerable   /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/ethereal     < 0.10.13-r2              >= 0.10.13-r2

Description
===========

iDEFENSE reported a possible overflow due to the lack of bounds
checking in the dissect_ospf_v3_address_prefix() function, part of the
OSPF protocol dissector.

Impact
======

An attacker might be able to craft a malicious network flow that would
crash Ethereal. It may be possible, though unlikely, to exploit this
flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
Ethereal, which could be the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ethereal users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.13-r2"
