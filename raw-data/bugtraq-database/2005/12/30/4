3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in TUGZip, which can
be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system. 

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when handling an
ARJ archive containing a file with an overly long filename. This can
be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow.

Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution when a
malicious ARJ file is opened.

The vulnerability has been confirmed in version 3.4.0.0. Other
versions may also be affected.
