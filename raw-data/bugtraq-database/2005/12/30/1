Synopsis
========

XnView may search for shared libraries in an untrusted location,
potentially allowing local users to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of another user.

Background
==========

XnView is an efficient multimedia viewer, browser and converter,
distributed free for non-commercial use.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-misc/xnview      < 1.70-r1                         >= 1.70-r1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Package 1 only applies to x86 users.

Description
===========

Krzysiek Pawlik of Gentoo Linux discovered that the XnView package for
IA32 used the DT_RPATH field insecurely, causing the dynamic loader to
search for shared libraries in potentially untrusted directories.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create a malicious shared object that would be
loaded and executed when a user attempted to use an XnView utility.
This would allow a malicious user to effectively hijack XnView and
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
program.

Workaround
==========

The system administrator may use the chrpath utility to remove the
DT_RPATH field from the XnView utilities:

    # emerge app-admin/chrpath
    # chrpath --delete /opt/bin/nconvert /opt/bin/nview /opt/bin/xnview

Resolution
==========

All XnView users on the x86 platform should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-misc/xnview-1.70-r1"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
