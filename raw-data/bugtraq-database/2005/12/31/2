Subject: MyBB XSS cross-site scripting


Hey
this is a security bug in printthread.PHP script of MyBB(all version also fully patched) that allows XSS crosssite scripting hacking and can be exploit without limitation.
post this message on a thread and go to print view of thread to view execution of exploit.

<script language=javascript>document.write("<script language=javascript>a"+"lert('Security bug allows XSS Cross-site scripting hacking found by imei')</"+"script>");</script>


this bug is in result of poor checking htmlspecialchars in printthread view of a topic and can exploit without any limitation against cookies.
