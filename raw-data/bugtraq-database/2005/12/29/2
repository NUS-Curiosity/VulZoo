Synopsis
========

Local users can exploit an scponly flaw to gain root privileges, and
scponly restricted users can use another vulnerability to evade shell
restrictions.

Background
==========

scponly is a restricted shell, allowing only a few predefined commands.
It is often used as a complement to OpenSSH to provide access to remote
users without providing any remote execution privileges.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/scponly        < 4.2                              >= 4.2

Description
===========

Max Vozeler discovered that the scponlyc command allows users to chroot
into arbitrary directories. Furthermore, Pekka Pessi reported that
scponly insufficiently validates command-line parameters to a scp or
rsync command.

Impact
======

A local attacker could gain root privileges by chrooting into arbitrary
directories containing hardlinks to setuid programs. A remote scponly
user could also send malicious parameters to a scp or rsync command
that would allow to escape the shell restrictions and execute arbitrary
programs.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All scponly users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/scponly-4.2"
