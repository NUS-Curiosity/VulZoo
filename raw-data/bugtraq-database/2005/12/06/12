                           Stuttgart, Germany

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information technology has become crucial to almost every part of society.
IT infrastructures have become critical in the world-wide economy, the
financial sector, the health sector, the government's administration, the
military, and the educational sector.

Due to its importance the disruption or loss of IT capabilities results in
a massive reduction of operability.  Hence, IT security is continously
gaining importace.

Although security usually gets integrated into the design process of IT
systems nowadays, the process of maintaining security in the operation of IT
infrastructures still lacks the appropriate attendance in most cases.
Especially the capability to manage and respond to IT security incidents and
their forensic analysis is established in the rarest cases. The quickly
rising number of security incidents worldwide makes the implementation of
incident management capabilities essential.

In order to advance the fields of IT-Incident Management and Forensics the
special interest-group Security - Intrusion Detection and Response (SIDAR)
of the German Informatics Society (GI) organises an annual conference,
bringing together experts from throughout the world, to discuss state of the
art in the areas of Incident Management and  IT-Forensics (IMF). IMF
promotes collaboration and exchange of ideas between industry, academia,
law-enforcement and other government bodies.

IMF invites to submit:

 - Full papers of up to 20 pages, presenting novel and mature research
   results. Full papers will be reviewed, and papers accepted for
   presentation at the conference will be included in the proceedings.

 - Practice papers of up to 12 pages, describing best practices, case
   studies, lessons learned, or latest product developments. Practice papers
   will be reviewed.

The papers will be reviewed, and papers accepted for presentation at the
conference will be included in the proceedings, which are planned to appear
in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (approval
pending)

The scope of IMF 2006 is broad and includes, but is not restricted to the
following areas:

IT-Incident Management:

  Purposes of IT-Incident Management
  Trends, Processes and Methods within IT-Incident Management
  Formats and Standardisation in the IT-Incident Management
