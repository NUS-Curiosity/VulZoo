	ofService


dunno, but i know this has been an issue since the rt314 product (
1999-2000? )
a simple nmap -sS target trigers it external, and no supprise internal as
well.
( not fun running pentests behind one of these babys )
i dont know if you noticed that existing connections dont appear to be
affected
( IM and streaming traffic ) but dns generally gets hosed.
