-------------------------------------

Remote Hard Reset Data Wipe and DoS of Pocket Controller v5.0 (#AS05080401)


Date of discovery: August 4, 2005

Product:
Pocket Controller-Professional V5 (latest edition)

Platform:

Severity:
Medium to High since any PDA running the application can be &#8220;hard reset&#8221; (up to complete loss of all data and installed applications) using a remote connection. This vulnerability can also be exploited over a wireless connection.

Summary:
Pocket Controller Professional is a popular, powerful remote control and management program that allows a user to remotely control a PDA from their PC computer. See http://www.soti.net/ for more information. Several feature of this program is that it can remotely turn off, reboot, and reset the PDA. We discovered that these commands can be performed without the client program sending only three packets to the target PDA.

Details:
Connect to port 5492 on PDA that is running the target client program. First send an initialization packet to the PDA. Next send a packet containing the desired command (turn off, reboot, hard reset) to the PDA. Finally, create a new socket and reset the intitialization packet. Upon receipt, the PDA will perform the selected function. PoC is available for MARA members.

Workaround:
No work around available.

Initial Vendor Notification: August 4, 2005

Initial Vendor Response: Awaiting response.
