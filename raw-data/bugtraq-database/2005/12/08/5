-Exploiting Freelist[0] On Windows XP Service Pack 2-

Windows XP Service pack 2 introduced some new security measures in an
attempt to prevent the use of overwritten heap headers to do arbitrary
byte writing. This method of exploiting heap overflows, and the protection
offered by service pack 2, is widely known and has been well documented
in the past.

What this paper will attempt to explain is how other functionality of the
heap management code can be used to gain execution control after a chunk
header has been overwritten.

In particular this paper takes a look at exploiting freelist[0] overwrites.
