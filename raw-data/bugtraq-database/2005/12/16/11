Synopsis
========

cURL is vulnerable to local arbitrary code execution via buffer
overflow due to the insecure parsing of URLs.

Background
==========

cURL is a command line tool for transferring files with URL syntax,
supporting numerous protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/curl      < 7.15.1                             >= 7.15.1

Description
===========

Stefan Esser from the Hardened-PHP Project has reported a vulnerability
in cURL that allows for a local buffer overflow when cURL attempts to
parse specially crafted URLs. The URL can be specially crafted in one
of two ways: the URL could be malformed in a way that prevents a
terminating null byte from being added to either a hostname or path
buffer; or the URL could contain a "?" separator in the hostname
portion, which causes a "/" to be prepended to the resulting string.

Impact
======

An attacker capable of getting cURL to parse a maliciously crafted URL
could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user making the call to cURL. An attacker could also
escape open_basedir or safe_mode pseudo-restrictions when exploiting
this problem from within a PHP program when PHP is compiled with
libcurl.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All cURL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/curl-7.15.1"
