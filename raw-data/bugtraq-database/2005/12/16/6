Subject: AIX Heap Overflow paper


I've just published a paper on AIX heap overflows. I wrote it back in August
but wanted to wait until a couple of flaws I discovered whilst researching
the topic were fixed by IBM. IBM released the patches today. You can get the
paper at http://www.databasesecurity.com/dbsec/aix-heap.pdf
Cheers,
