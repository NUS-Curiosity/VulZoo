Nope.

First, Ezhi seems not to match any Polish name even
in  terms of phonetic transcription. Brozkevitsh
in turn looks like Bro≈ºkiewicz in Polish.

Second, as far as I know our international phone number
always starts with +48...

Third, (for those of you who don't know, since
1989 something has changed in Poland and street
name as Al. Armii Ludowej seems veeeery unlikely.
However, to tell you the truth, it concerns to Warsaw
which is a strange city itself (I personally live
in Poznan) and nearly everything is plausible there
(no offense, Warsaw).
