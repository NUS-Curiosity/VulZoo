               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated redhat-config-nfs package fixes security
                   issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152787
Issue date:        2005-12-17

Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2004-0750
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated redhat-config-nfs package that fixes a security issue is now
available.

redhat-config-nfs is a graphical user interface for creating,
modifying, and deleting nfs shares.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

John Buswell discovered a flaw in redhat-config-nfs that could lead to
incorrect permissions on exported shares when exporting to multiple
hosts. This could cause an option such as "all_squash" to not be
applied to all of the listed hosts. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2004-0750 to
this issue.

Additionally, a bug was found that prevented redhat-config-nfs from
being run if hosts didn't have options set in /etc/exports.

All users of redhat-config-nfs should upgrade to this updated package,
which includes a patch to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
