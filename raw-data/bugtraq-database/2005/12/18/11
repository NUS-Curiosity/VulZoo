Synopsis
========

Lack of URL validation in Opera command-line wrapper could be abused to
execute arbitrary commands.

Background
==========

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/opera       < 8.51                             >= 8.51

Description
===========

Peter Zelezny discovered that the shell script used to launch Opera
parses shell commands that are enclosed within backticks in the URL
provided via the command line.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user
to follow a specially crafted URL from a tool that uses Opera to open
URLs, resulting in the execution of arbitrary commands on the targeted
machine.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-8.51"
