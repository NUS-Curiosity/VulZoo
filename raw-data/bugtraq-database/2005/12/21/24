Subject: VMware vulnerability in NAT networking


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A vulnerability has been discovered in vmnat.exe on Windows hosts and
vmnet-natd on Linux systems. 
The vulnerability makes it possible for a malicious guest using a NAT networking
configuration to execute unwanted code on the host machine. 

AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
VMware Workstation, VMware GSX Server, VMware ACE, and VMware Player.

RESOLUTION:
VMware believes that the vulnerability is very serious, and recommends that
affected users update their products to the new releases or change the configuration of 
the virtual machine so it does not use NAT networking. 

The new releases are now available for download at www.vmware.com/download

If you choose not to update your product but want to ensure that the NAT service
is not available, you can disable it completely on VMware Workstation or VMware
GSX Server by following the instructions in the Knowledge Base article (Answer ID 2002) at
http://www.vmware.com/support/kb.

VMware thanks Tim Shelton of ACS Security Assessment Engineering, Affiliated
Computer Services, Inc., for reporting this vulnerability.
