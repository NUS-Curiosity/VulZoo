Subject: DEFCON London group - DC4420 - inaugural meeting and Christmas Drinks!


calling all London based hackers, security professionals, feds, geeks, 
nerds, groupies and scene whores...

on behalf of DC4420, i'm pleased to announce the inaugural meeting of 
the London DC group, and invite you to come and drink, talk and set the 
agenda for the year to come... the venue will be our regular future 
meeting place, and we are lucky enough to have found one with good beer, 
a private room (with it's own bar), meeting facilities and plenty of 
room for growth... should we overwhelm the pub, there's always Olympia 
over the road... :P

there will be a projector for those that want to give presentations, but 
the main aganda for this meeting, apart from emptying the cellar, will 
be, errr... to set the agenda... see 
http://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=6722 for discussion on meeting 
format...

event location:

   (upstairs function room)
   The Hand & Flower
   1 Hammersmith Road
