Subject: Re: [DCG] DEFCON London group - DC4420 -
 inaugural meeting and Christmas Drinks!


Hello all,

I've built in my website especific area (International Group) for people 
who doesn't have website and would like to discuss with your groups. 
Also for those who already have a website i put the correspondent link 
according to your country. The idea is to make people closer to share 
ideas, technical issues, vulnerabilities, technical themes, etc. Please, 
any question you have, i left a space in my web called feedback, feel 
free to write there your comments.

Thank you for all the groups,

racerx
