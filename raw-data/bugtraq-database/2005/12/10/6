Subject: Torrential 1.2 Directory Traversal


I was poking around my own server because I had an installation of
torrential and found this vuln. The problem lies in getdox.php. It
works by taking an argument after a "/". This specifies a file. The
DOX folder that it grabs the files from is located int /dox such that
/ is the directory that the main index is in. Now, you can give it the
parameter of /(any file) and it will fetch that file.

EXAMPLES:
http://www.example.com/torrential/dox/getdox.php/../forums.php (goes
to the forums page)
http://www.example.com/torrential/dox/getdox.php/../../index.html
(goes to http://www.example.com/index.html in this case)

The vulnerability lies in the fact that getdox.php directly reads the
file with fopen/fread.
