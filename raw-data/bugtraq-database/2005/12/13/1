 Server Firewall FWDRV driver Local Denial of Service


As per the Dec 5th Sunbelt newsletter (Vol. 10, #49 � Dec 5, 2005 � Issue #554) it appears Sunbelt software has acquired Kerio Personal Firewall and that they will further develop the software.  Hopefully Sunbelt will resolve this issue in a subsequent release.
