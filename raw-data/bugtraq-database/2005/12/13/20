3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Internet Explorer,
which can be exploited by malicious people to trick users into
downloading and executing arbitrary programs on a user's system.

A design error in the processing of mouse clicks in new browser
windows and the predictability of the position of the "File Download"
dialog box can be exploited to trick the user into clicking on the
"Run" button of the dialog box. This is exploited by first causing a
"File Download" dialog box to be displayed underneath a new browser
window, and then tricking the user into double-clicking within a
specific area in the new window. This will result in an unintended
click of the "Run" button in the hidden "File Download" dialog box.

======================================================================
4) Solution

Apply patches.
