Subject: about phpMyAdmin's server_privileges.php announced vulnerability


phpMyAdmin's team answer to vulnerability announcement

We don't think that this is a real threat. The server_privileges.php 
script checks at the beginning if the user is privileged. So, for this 
attack to work, the victim's phpMyAdmin installation would have to be 
set as to allow any user to auto-login as a privileged user! If this is 
the case, this phpMyAdmin installation is wide open and this situation 
has to be fixed by the person who configured phpMyAdmin.

Marc Delisle, for the team
