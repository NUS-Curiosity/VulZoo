 WorldMail IMAP Server
 String Literal Processing Overflow Vulnerability


Qualcomm WorldMail IMAP Server String Literal Processing Overflow 
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.20.05
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=359
December 20, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Qualcomm WorldMail is an email and messaging server designed for use
in small to large enterprises that supports IMAP, POP3, SMTP, and web
mail features.

More information can be found on the vendors site:

  http://www.eudora.com/worldmail/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Qualcomm
WorldMail IMAP Server allows unauthenticated attackers to execute
arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to
execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This leads to a total
compromise of the mail server.

In order to trigger this overflow, an attacker only needs to send a long
string ending with a '}' character. This will result in a stack overflow
and the attacker may use an SEH overwrite or a standard EBP or EIP
overwrite in order to gain control of the process trivially.

This is a pre-authentication vulnerability. To exploit this
vulnerability an attacker would need to be able connect to the e-mail
server and the IMAP module would have to be enabled (default). Only one
command is required to trigger this vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

This exploit was tested against Qualcomm Worldmail server version 3.0.
Other versions may be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

There is no workaround currently available except for disabling IMAP
services.
