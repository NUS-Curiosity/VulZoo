Subject: Re: Re: RLA ("Remote LanD Attack")


Andrew Simmons:

     I have had numerous successful attacks take place between
multiple services providers.  All of which are big names.  (Comcast
and Verizon).  Besides my own test, and the test my Friends assisted
with, I have received multiple reports of others trying the exploit
out themselves, and being successful.

     Although, I can understand what you are saying, the attacks are
still obviously working.  Have you tried executing an attack your
self?
