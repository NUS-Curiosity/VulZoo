Another response, this time Trend Micro says they have fixed (of sorts) the
magic byte bug in a pattern file... I guess their initial customer service
email was incorrect?

Best,

Dear Auri,

Thank you for contacting Trend Micro Technical Support.

We are aware of a potential vulnerability related to the "forged magic byte"
in certain file types. Based on our analysis, this vulnerability is limited
in our products to one specific type of potential virus file which is not
commonly allowed in most IT systems and needs to be executed manually. Trend
Micro customers are currently able to detect such files -- should they be
created -- through our latest virus pattern file, 2.915.00. Solution Bank
article 26763 provides the latest information on this vulnerability's
status.

Should you have further inquiries, please do not hesitate in sending us an
email, it is our pleasure assisting you. Other means of reaching our office

UPDATE, October 26, 2005 - Updated list of the vulnerable products.


Multiple Vendor Anti-Virus Software Detection Evasion Vulnerability through
forged magic byte.

AUTHOR: Andrey Bayora (www.securityelf.org)

For more details, screenshots and examples please read my article "The Magic
of magic byte" at www.securityelf.org . In addition, you will find a sample
"triple headed" program which has 3 different 'execution entry points',
depending on the extension of the file (exe, html or eml) - just change the
extension and the SAME file will be executed by (at least) THREE DIFFERENT
programs! (thanks to contributing author Wayne Langlois from
www.diamondcs.com.au).

11. Sophos 3.95 (engine 2.30.4)

SEVERITY: critical

DESCRIPTION:

The problem exists in the scanning engine - in the routine that determines
the file type. If some file types (file types tested are .BAT, .HTML and
.EML) changed to have the MAGIC BYTE of the EXE files (MZ) at the beginning,
then many antivirus programs will be unable to detect the malicious file. It
will break the normal flow of the antivirus scanning and many existent and
future viruses will be undetected.

NOTE: In my test, I used the EXE headers (MZ), but it is possible to use
other headers (magic byte) that will lead to the same effect.

ANALYSIS:

Some file types like .bat, .html and .eml can be properly executed even if
they have some "unrelated" beginning. For example, in the case of .BAT
files - it is possible to prepend some "junk" data at the beginning of the
file without altering correct execution of the batch file. In my tests, I
used the calc.exe headers (first 120 bytes - middle of the dosstub section)
to change 5 different files of existing viruses. In addition, the simplest
test of this vulnerability is to prepend only the magic byte (MZ) to the
existing malicious file and check if this file is detected by antivirus
program.

NOTE, that this is NOT the case where the change of existing virus file
resulted in the "broken" detection signature (see details and the test logic
in "The Magic of magic byte" article at www.securityelf.org).

WORKAROUND:
I did not found any effective one besides of patching the vulnerable engine.

CREDITS:
The idea for this vulnerability came during discussions from Wayne Langlois
at diamondcs.com.au, who hinted that JPEGs could probably be exploited in
this way.

TIME LINE:

July 13, 2005 - Initial vendor notification
July 16, 2005 - Second vendor notification
.....Waiting.....Waiting....
October 24, 2005 - Public disclosure (uncoordinated) (lack of coordination
from the vendors side)
October 26, 2005 - Updated list of the vulnerable products.
