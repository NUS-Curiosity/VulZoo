Dear Colleagues,

It is our pleasure to introduce seven exciting workshops to be held
in conjunction with the First International Conference on
Availability, Reliability and Security (AReS 2006). We would like to
encourage you to submit a contribution to ARES 2006 and/or its
workshops. Furthermore please motivate your staff members and
colleagues to submit their research results which fit to the goal of
the conference and its workshops of bridging the gap between theory
and practice in the various aspects of dependability - especially on
the crucial linkage between availability, reliability, and security.

We are very indebted for the effort of workshop's organizers and
workshop's PC members. Proceedings of the ARES 2006 workshops will be
published by IEEE Computer Society Press.
