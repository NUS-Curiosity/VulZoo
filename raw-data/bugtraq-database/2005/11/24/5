This is not exactly a problem with Yahoo!, but rather
a problem with the way browsers tend to render HTML
when forced to deal with broken tags. Your "<?
<table....> is not needed to accomplish the same
thing, since a browser will consider everything from <
to the next > as a tag. Since <? is not recognized the
whole thing is ignored.

The real problem is that you are injecting a TR
element into the middle of a TD, then closing the
table without first closing the TD. Any web developer
who would do such a thing is a moron, and your browser
does the best it can to make sense of it. You might
try asking Yahoo how to turn HTML off, or simply use
POP with a text only reader to work around this.
