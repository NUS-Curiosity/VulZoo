3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in various
SpeedProject products, which can be exploited by malicious people to
compromise a user's system.

1) A boundary error exists in CxZIP60.dll and CxZIP60u.dll due to the
unsafe use of the "lstrcat()" function when constructing the full
pathname of a file that is extracted from a ZIP archive. This can be
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow and allows arbitrary
code execution when a specially crafted archive is extracted.

The vulnerability has been confirmed in the following products.
* ZipStar 5.0 Build 4285
* Squeez 5.0 Build 4285
* SpeedCommander 11.0 Build 4430
* SpeedCommander 10.51 Build 4430

2) A boundary error exists in CxUux60.dll and CxUux60u.dll due to
the unsafe use of the "lstrcpy()" function when constructing the
full pathname of the file that is decoded from a UUE file. This can
be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow and allows
arbitrary code execution when a specially crafted UUE file is
decoded.

The vulnerability has been confirmed in the following products.
* Squeez 5.0 Build 4285
* SpeedCommander 11.0 Build 4430
* SpeedCommander 10.51 Build 4430
