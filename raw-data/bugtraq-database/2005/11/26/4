So it's a problem with Yahoo, as they allow the email, to write to places on 
the screen that is not part of the email.  I agree this is certainly down to 
the liberalness of the browsers parser, but that doesn't mean yahoo can 
ignore it, it's just a demonstration of how difficult a job it is for people 
who want to accept arbitrary HTML to be secure for their user

Of course there is a pretty simple solution, which is to just use an IFRAME, 
then there's no way the email to escape into the surrounding chrome.
