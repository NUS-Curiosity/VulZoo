It isn't necessary to close the table, you just need the <tr></tr> part (I
had not noticed this before your mail). You can also use other tags to get
different results.

Anyway, I think that to prevent injection of HTML code into Yahoo! Mail
interface something should be done, since it could be used to fool users.
