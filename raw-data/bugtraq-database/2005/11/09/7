Reference to Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: 
http://www.cybsec.com/vulnerability_policy.pdf

Product Overview:
=================

SAP Web Application Server is an open standard-based platform for
developing, and implementing Web applications. SAP Web Application
Server is a crucial component of mySAP® Technology platform as it serves
as the underlying infrastructure for many SAP solutions (for example,
SAP Portal).

SAP WAS provides a development infrastructure on which to develop,
distribute, and execute platform-independent Web services and business
applications. SAP Web Application Server supports ABAP, Java, and Web
services.

The vulnerability discovered only applies to the BSP runtime of SAP WAS.

Vulnerability Description:

SAP Web Application Server was found to be vulnerable to JavaScript
injection, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting attacks. Three different
vectors for script injection where discovered:
* Error Pages (in error messages displayed) (SAP WAS 6.20 and above not
Vulnerable)
* The syscmd parameter
* SYSTEM PUBLIC (Test Application)


Exploit (Poc):
==============

Following is a Proof of Concept for each script injection vector:
* Error Pages:
http://sap-was/sap/bc/BSp/sap/index.html%3Cscript%3Ealert('xss')%
3C/script%3E
* The syscmd parameter:
http://sap-was/sap/bc/BSp/sap/menu/fameset.htm?sap-sessioncmd=open&sap-syscmd=%3Cscript%3Ealert('xss')%3C/script%3E
* Test Application (SYSTEM PUBLIC): 
In BspApplication field it is possible to inject JavaScript code such
as: "<script>alert('xss')</script>.

Solutions:
==========

For solutions regarding Error Pages and the syscmd parameter as attack
vectors please see SAP Note 887323, which indicates Service Packs to
apply.

For solutions regarding SYSTEM PUBLIC Test Application please see SAP
Note 887164 which lists all test applications that shouldn't be
activated on production systems. Regarding XSS issues the BSP compiler
has been extended to have a new forceEncode="HTML" page directive, for
more information see SAP Note 887168. This new feature will be applied
to test applications in the next SP cycle. All test applications should
always be removed from production systems, customers can use transaction
SMICM to disable the test applications.
