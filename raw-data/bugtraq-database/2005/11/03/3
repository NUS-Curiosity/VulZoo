I agree that this class of vulnerabilities deserves its own name.

To some extent, it's a layering violation (or the lack thereof): For
some reason, you implement a security check at a different layer (or
in a different component) from where it is actually needed.

It can also happen within the same product.  For example, in a word
process with macro capabilities, you add code to check for macros when
an untrusted document is opened, but this code fails to detect the
presence of all macros (in contrast to the macro execution engine,
which is invoked later and happily executes all of them).

In the end, there is no real replacement for non-vulnerable software,
no matter how many proxies and filters you put in front of it.
