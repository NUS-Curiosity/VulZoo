Call For Papers
18th Annual FIRST Conference
Baltimore, MD

June 25-30, 2006

The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST, http://www.first.org/) 
is a global organization dedicated to bringing together computer security incident 
response teams (CSIRTs). The annual FIRST conference not only provides a setting 
for participants to attend tutorials and hear presentations by leading experts in 
the CSIRT community, it also creates opportunities for networking, collaboration,
and sharing of technical information. Equally important, this conference enables 
the attendees to meet with their peers and build trusted relationships. 

FIRST continues to enjoy a steady increase in membership internationally 
and is represented by teams from government, commercial and research/educational 
communities.

FIRST conference participants include not only CSIRT staff, but also IT managers,
network and system administrators, software and hardware vendors, security solutions
providers, telecommunications organizations, ISPs, and general computer and network
security personnel. FIRST conferences cover a number of different areas such as (but 
are not limited to):

    * advanced techniques in security incident prevention, detection and response.
    * latest advances in computer and network security tools.
    * shared views, experiences, and resolutions in the computer security incident response field.


The conference is a five-day event, comprised of two days of Tutorials, three days 
of Plenary sessions focused on either Business or Technical issues. These include 
paper presentations, keynote speeches and/or panel discussions.

The theme for the 2006 conference is �Sharing Intelligence in Global Response� 
working smarter and sharing knowledge in this environment, finding ways to further 
our initiatives on collaborative and cooperative approaches to find solutions to 
the problems we face in computer and network security incident response.

Conference presentations are generally 30-45 minutes in length, including any 
Q&A session.

The conference language is English.

The program committee welcomes original contributions on network security for 
refereed paper presentations, tutorials, invited talks and panel sessions, and
