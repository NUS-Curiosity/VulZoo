Subject: Oracle DBMS_ASSERT and the October 2005 CPU


Whilst there are problems with the Oracle October 2005 Critical Patch 
Update, it's not all bad news....

There is a great deal of evidence in this patch that Oracle are beginning to 
treat security properly. They've introduced a new package PL/SQL package 
DBMS_ASSERT into the RDBMS. Whilst DBMS_ASSERT was first released as part of 
the new10g Release 2 it has been packported. Oracle use this package to 
sanitize user input to help prevent SQL injection. As this package has not 
been documented NGSResearch have done so aqs we feel that third-party Oracle 
app developers could benefit by using the package. This, and other papers, 
can be found at http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers.htm .

Cheers,
