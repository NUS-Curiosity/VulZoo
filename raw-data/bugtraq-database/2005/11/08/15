Consider the following situation(I'm not sure if anyone actually does this):
1) You have a "spool" directory containing a large number of files, each
which represents a task to process.
2) You have a number of worker threads. Each worker thread reads a file
from the global DIR*, and then opens and reads the file for
processing(and then loops on 2).

Of course, you could always just put a mutex around every call to
readdir(), and copy the filename somewhere safe, or you could invent a
signalling system to ask one thread to do all the readdir()s. Whether
this makes sense depends on how much of readdir_r has to be spent inside
a global mutex/spinlock anyway, and how long the processing part takes
compared with the readdir() part.
