Subject: Re: Is Flash Player 5 not vulnerable or not
	supported?... Macromedia Flash Player ActionDefineFunction Memory
	Corruption


All well known security companies and CERTs not list Flash Player 5.x at 
all, it seems they don't see that version as supported.
Many advisories said today "Macromedia Flash Player 7.0.19.0 and prior" 
are affected.

>From Macromedia itself:
Affected Software Versions
Flash Player 7.0.19.0 and earlier
http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/security/security_zone/mpsb05-07.html

Secunia lists MSIE5.01 as affected http://secunia.com/advisories/17481/ 
"Macromedia Flash Player included in Microsoft Internet Explorer", 
default installation has version 5 mentioned.
