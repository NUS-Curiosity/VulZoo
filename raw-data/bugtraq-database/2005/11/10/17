Subject: [EEYEB-20050701] - RealPlayer Zipped Skin File
	Buffer Overflow II


RealPlayer Zipped Skin File Buffer Overflow II

Release Date:
November 10, 2005

Date Reported:
June 26, 2005

Severity:
High (Code Execution)

Vendor:
RealNetworks

Systems Affected:
Windows:
RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1040-1235)
RealPlayer 10
RealOne Player v2
RealOne Player v1
RealPlayer 8

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a vulnerability in RealPlayer that
allows a remote attacker to reliably overwrite the heap with arbitrary
data and execute arbitrary code in the context of the user under which
the player is running.

Technical Details:
A RealPlayer skin file (.rjs extension) can be downloaded and applied
automatically through a web browser without the user's permission. A
skin file is a bundle of graphics and a .ini file, stored together in
ZIP format. DUNZIP32.DLL, which is included with RealPlayer, is used to
extract the contents of the skin file. When RealPlayer processes a zip
file, it will allocate the field of the file but when it is copied it
will rely on real unzip content to copy. So an attacker can zip one file
that has hostile data and create a rjs file.  We can change the file
length field of rjs file so when it process this zip file it will cause
a heap overflow.

Protection:
Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.

Vendor Status:
RealNetworks has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available via the "Check for Update" menu item under Tools on the
RealPlayer menu bar or from http://service.real.com/realplayer/security/
