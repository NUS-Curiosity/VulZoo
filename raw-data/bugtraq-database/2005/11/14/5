Subject: Multiple Bugs in MyBB 1.0 PR2 Rev 686(Updated Nov 1, 2005)


Description: MyBB is a powerful, efficient and free forum package
developed in PHP and MySQL. MyBB has been designed with the end users
in mind, you and your subscribers. Full control over your discussion
system is presented right at the tip of your fingers, from multiple
styles and themes to the ultimate customisation of your forums using
the template system.

Bug 1: The Subject field for new threads doesn't sanitize user input before storing it in the database allowing for injection of HTML as well as JavaScript which could lead to the theft of cookies

Bug 2: The Repuration system allows for similar injection of HTML and JavaScript which renders on the UserCP

Bug 3: By editing the inbox form which has delete and move options for PMs its possible to specify any pm in any inbox just by knowing or guessing the id number.

Bug #1 was marked as fixed in the MyBB forums but as of the November 1st release on the website the bug has in fact not been fixed.  Information regarding the 3rd bug was sent via PM to the MyBB staff on the 27th of October but was also not pactched in the latest version.

I generally don't like to comment outside of the actual bugs but I feel that marking items as patched and then not fixing them is irresponsible and at this point I would advise anyone considering MyBB as a forum platform to honestly look elsewhere as they have some issues in resolving bugs.
