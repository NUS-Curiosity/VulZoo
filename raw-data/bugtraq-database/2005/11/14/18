Subject: MD4 and MD5 collision generators


I am releasing my collision generators for MD4 and MD5.  They have 
significant time improvements over the ones described in the papers by 
Wang, et al.

MD4 collisions can be generated almost instantly, MD5 can be generated in
approximately 45 minutes on my p4 1.6ghz (on average).
