RESOLUTION

Until patches are provided to resolve the issue avoid using the
potentially vulnerable versions of /usr/bin/X11/xterm.

One solution is to remove the patches listed in the Background

containing the potentially vulnerable xterm.

An alternative to removing the patches is to use
/usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm.

For example:

cp /usr/bin/X11/xterm /usr/bin/X11/xterm.nosuid
chmod 555 /usr/bin/X11/xterm.nosuid
cp /usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm /usr/bin/X11/xterm

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
Remove the patches listed in the Background section
or use /usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm.
