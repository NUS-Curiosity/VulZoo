Synopsis
========

GNUMP3d is vulnerable to directory traversal and cross-site scripting
attacks that may result in information disclosure or the compromise of
a browser.

Background
==========

GNUMP3d is a streaming server for MP3s, OGG vorbis files, movies and
other media formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/gnump3d       < 2.9.7                        >= 2.9.7

Description
===========

Steve Kemp reported about two cross-site scripting attacks that are
related to the handling of files (CVE-2005-3424, CVE-2005-3425). Also
reported is a directory traversal vulnerability which comes from the
attempt to sanitize input paths (CVE-2005-3123).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this to disclose sensitive information
or inject and execute malicious script code, potentially compromising
the victim's browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNUMP3d users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/gnump3d-2.9.7"
