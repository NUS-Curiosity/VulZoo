VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

We had a response from Craig Knudsen, the project leader, on 20051128
night. The same day the fast Craig resolved 3 of the 4 issues in the
REL_1_0_0 branch of CVS, so soon a new version (probably 1.0.2) will be
released to the public.

also on the sourceforge project site there are these posts related to
this advisory (thanks Craig for the links)
