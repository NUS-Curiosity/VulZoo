At the risk of this discussion running far afield, I think Jason and Paul
may be talking past each other. My understanding is that Jason has a point
-- corporations can't suffer the same punishment as individuals. They aren't
deprived of their freedom in prisons. The most common corporate punishment
is a fine.

Paul's point is SOX, GLBA, and HIPAA hold individuals accountable for their
acts at corporations.

Those two opinions are both correct, and do not contradict each other.
