Synopsis
========

phpSysInfo is vulnerable to multiple issues, including a local file
inclusion leading to information disclosure and the potential
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

phpSysInfo displays various system stats via PHP scripts.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/phpsysinfo       < 2.4.1                        >= 2.4.1

Description
===========

Christopher Kunz from the Hardened-PHP Project discovered that
phpSysInfo is vulnerable to local file inclusion, cross-site scripting
and a HTTP Response Splitting attacks.

Impact
======

A local attacker may exploit the file inclusion vulnerability by
sending malicious requests, causing the execution of arbitrary code
with the rights of the user running the web server. A remote attacker
could exploit the vulnerability to disclose local file content.
Furthermore, the cross-site scripting issues gives a remote attacker
the ability to inject and execute malicious script code in the user's
browser context or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
The HTTP response splitting issue give an attacker the ability to
perform site hijacking and cache poisoning.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpSysInfo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/phpsysinfo-2.4.1"
