Subject: Re: Your One-Stop Site For Sony Lawsuit Info


That's a great website but it needs to include information about how to 
contact the Department of Justice so that they will take Sony to court 
for CRIMINAL action.  We need hundreds of thousands of people 
mailing/emailing/calling the DOJ to get it through their thick skulls 
that we aren't going to put up with this kind of sh*t from Sony or any 
other company.
