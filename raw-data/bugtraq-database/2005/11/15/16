Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Scorched 3D allow a remote attacker to deny
service or execute arbitrary code on game servers.

Background
==========

Scorched 3D is a clone of the classic "Scorched Earth" DOS game, adding
features like a 3D island environment and Internet multiplayer
capabilities.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                    /  Vulnerable  /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-strategy/scorched3d       <= 39.1               Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple flaws in the Scorched 3D game
server, including a format string vulnerability and several buffer
overflows.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to crash a game
server or execute arbitrary code with the rights of the game server
user. Users not running a Scorched 3D game server are not affected by
these flaws.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

The Scorched 3D package has been hard-masked until a new version
correcting these flaws is released. In the meantime, current users are
advised to unmerge the package:

    # emerge --unmerge games-strategy/scorched3d
