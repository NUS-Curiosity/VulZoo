Subject: Malware Removal and Prevention Procedure


We would like to introduce visitors to an exciting and valuable new
resource available at CastleCops called the Malware Removal and Prevention
procedure. This procedure is designed to enable users to either partially,
or fully clean their systems without the direct aid of an expert. It
provides instructions on how to perform a series of antispyware, antivirus
and antitrojan scans, as well as, run a system cleaning utility. The
generalized scanners we recommend are intended to address a broad spectrum
of malware including adware, spyware, trojans, viruses, and browser
hijackers. Soon it will become standard practice for all HijackThis (HJT)  
posters to perform malware removal before posting a HJT log. The ideas and
suggestions of numerous staff members have contributed to the development
of the final product. We even took a staff poll to decide on a name but
such catchy monikers such as "Purging the Parasites" and "Zapping the
Crap' were rejected in favor of the humdrum but more descript Malware
Removal and Prevention (MRP).
