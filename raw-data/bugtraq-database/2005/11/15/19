rainer,
Here is a list of security conferences (most of them are international):
http://lufgi4.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/cfps/atom
Another list (call for papers mixed domestic and international):
http://www.cs.vu.nl/~crispo/security/conf_call.html#call
Please let me know what you are planning to submit so we can discuss.
Thanks,
Saeed
p.s. international and domestic relative to the US.
