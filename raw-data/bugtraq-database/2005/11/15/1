Google has investigated this report and verified the validity of this
bug.  It is fixed in the current version of Google Talk (1.0.0.76),
which is available at http://www.google.com/talk/.  Existing users are
being updated automatically.

We take the security of our services and users very seriously, and
work to rapidly resolve any reported vulnerabilities.  In the interest
of minimizing the impact that security vulnerabilities have on our end
users, we highly encourage anyone who discovers a vulnerability in a
Google product or service to follow responsible disclosure policies by
contacting us first at security@...gle.com.
