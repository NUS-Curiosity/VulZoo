Subject: Re: Authentication vulnerability in Belkin wireless devices

This is very odd, as we've reproduced this vulnerability on about 5
different F5D7230-4 with firmware 4.05.3 and 4.03.3, as well as on a few
of the F5D7232-4 routers with the same firmware.

This can't be a network specific setup issue, as we've tested this on
several unrelated networks from Linux and Windows operating systems
using Firefox and MS IE browsers.

Kind Regards,
