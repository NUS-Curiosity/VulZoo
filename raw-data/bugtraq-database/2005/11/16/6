No? Are you sure? For example can you see path. 
Good script have limits for inputs like vb.

phpbb don't have.

result:
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 1746401 byt
es) in /www/2018/phpBB2/includes/functions_search.php on line 27

it is path disclosure

or can you see sql errors

good php script isn't dependant of php env.

> Did you reported this to the PhpBB bugtracker?
