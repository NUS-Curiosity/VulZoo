I.   BACKGROUND

Apple QuickTime Player is one of the Apple QuickTime components
used by hundreds of millions of users.

II.  DESCRIPTION

Apple QuickTime Player is reported prone to remote denial of service
attack (exploitable via remotely originated content).

A missing movie attribute is interpreted as an extension, but the
absence of the extension is not flagged as an error, resulting in
a de-reference of a NULL pointer.

This will cause a denial of service against any application loading
remotely-originated content.


III. POC CODE

Due to severity of this bug i will not release any proof of concept
codes for this issue.

IV.  VENDOR RESPONSE

Vendor (Apple) has been noticed and released all necessary patches.
