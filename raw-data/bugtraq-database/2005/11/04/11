Subject: Re: Advisory 18/2005: PHP Cross Site Scripting
	(XSS)XVulnerability in phpinfo()

for php 4.4.0, phpinfo.php?test=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
*does* work but only in _SERVER["argv"]; using GLOBALS[test] for this php
version the xss is triggered 3 times (_GET["GLOBALS"], _REQUEST["GLOBALS"],
and _SERVER["argv"]). wonder if _SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"] is susceptible?
can't test right now.
