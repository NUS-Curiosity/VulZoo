Synopsis
========

giflib may dereference NULL or write out of bounds when processing
malformed images, potentially resulting in Denial of Service or
arbitrary code execution.

Background
==========

giflib is a library for reading and writing GIF images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/giflib       < 4.1.4                          >= 4.1.4

Description
===========

Chris Evans and Daniel Eisenbud independently discovered two
out-of-bounds memory write operations and a NULL pointer dereference in
giflib.

Impact
======

An attacker could craft a malicious GIF image and entice users to load
it using an application making use of the giflib library, resulting in
an application crash or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All giflib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/giflib-4.1.4"

==========
