APC Security Advisory - PowerChute Network Shutdown's Web Interface
Only Supports HTTP
 
Problem Summary:
PowerChute Network Shutdown's web interface is only accessible via
HTTP, which is not a cryptographically secure protocol.  User
authentication is performed using HTTP 1.1 authentication, therefore
passwords are transmitted as base-64 encoded plaintext from the
user's
browser to the server during login.  After successful login all data
transmitted between the user's browser and the server is also
plaintext.  PowerChute Network Shutdown does not have an option to
enable cryptographically secure web access.  Additionally, PowerChute
Network Shutdown allows an unlimited number of login attempts to its
web interface without any lockout period or notification.
 
Severity Level
Important
 
Affected Products:
All versions of PowerChute Network Shutdown.
 
Mitigating Factors:
1. Typically servers with PowerChute Network Shutdown are on a
protected corporate LAN and are therefore afforded a minimal level of
protection.
 
2. Many networks utilize Layer 2 and 3 switches that make it more
difficult to capture network traffic going between the browser and
the
server.
 
Recommendations and workarounds:
1. Only log into PowerChute Network Shutdown from
http://localhost:3052.
 
Use a browser on the same server that PowerChute Network Shutdown is
running to access the web interface.  This prevents any traffic from
being transmitted onto the network and eliminates the potential for
password snooping.
 
2. Enable a local server firewall rule to block any remote access to
TCP port 3052.
 
This can be used in conjunction with number one to prevent the
possibility of any remote user accessing PowerChute Network Shutdown.
 
3. Disable the web interface.
 
Disabling the Web Interface prevents any user from accessing the web
interface from anywhere.  However, since the web interface of
PowerChute Network Shutdown is the only way to view status and logs
and make configuration changes, APC does not recommend this option.
Search APC's Knowledge Base for this advisory to view instructions
on how to disable the PowerChute Network Shutdown web interface.
