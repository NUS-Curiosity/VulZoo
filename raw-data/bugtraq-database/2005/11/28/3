FreeWebStat Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities

  Name              Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities in FreeWebStat
  Systems Affected  FreeWebStat (verified on 1.0 rev37)
  Severity          Medium Risk
  Vendor            www.freewebstat.com
  Advisory          http://www.ush.it/2005/11/25/free-web-stat/
  Author            Francesco "aScii" Ongaro (ascii at katamail . com)

FreeWebStat 1.0 rev37 (the last version at the write time) is vulnerable
to multiple XSS. The impact is a little bigger since datas will be
stored in a flat file and the result of a single query will persist for
some time on the backend. A well-timed loop of requests will assure the
XSS to be permanent.

This can be used to inject arbitrary JS code into the page and make the
JS pseudo-permanent, so other users will execute the JS without the need
of any special url.
