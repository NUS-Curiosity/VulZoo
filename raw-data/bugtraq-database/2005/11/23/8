Subject: GeSWall Intrusion Prevention System 2.1 Released (Freeware)


Dear Bugtraq,

we are pleased to announce the immediate GeSWall freeware release.
GeSWall is an intrusion prevention system for Windows. It protects from
intrusions and damage from malicious software by isolating vulnerable
applications. Isolation applies an access restriction policy that
effectively prevents various kinds of attacks, known and unknown.

GeSWall focuses on attack objectives such as taking control of a PC,
stealing data, breaking system integrity etc. Instead of blocking
specific attack techniques, GeSWall prevents all threats that involve
damage, e.g. malicious software  (viruses, trojans, spyware), software
vulnerabilities and mis-configuration, social engineering etc. At the
same time, GeSWall is non-intrusive and does not disable important
application functionality.

Once installed, GeSWall dynamically isolates web browsers, e-mail,
chat, p2p, irc clients and other applications that may serve as entry
points for malicious software or intrusions. Viruses, trojans,
spyware, keyloggers and exploits cannot pass through an isolated
application and so cannot cause damage.

The technology used allows any application to be automatically
isolated without configuration by a user. To make it even smoother and
transparent, GeSWall applies specific access rules for most popular
internet applications. Those specific rules come in an open
Application Database. GentleSecurity team regularly adds new
applications to the database received through automatic update service.

An additional information and free version download are available on our
web site www.gentlesecurity.com.
