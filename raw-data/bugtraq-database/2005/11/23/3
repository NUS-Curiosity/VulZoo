3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Opera, which can
be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to the shell script used to launch
Opera parsing shell commands that are enclosed within backticks in
the URL provided via the command line. This can e.g. be exploited to
execute arbitrary shell commands by tricking a user into following a
malicious link in an external application which uses Opera as the
default browser (e.g. the mail client Evolution on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4).

This vulnerability can only be exploited on Unix / Linux based
environments.

This vulnerability is a variant of:
