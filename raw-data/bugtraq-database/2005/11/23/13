Subject: XSS on Yahoo Mail



  Hi,

I've noticed a strange behavior in "Yahoo! Mail" when dealing with html
attachments. It's possible to insert data into the "Yahoo! Mail" html
interface.

For example, with the following code in an html attachment it's possible
to insert "Your profile is out of date, please update clicking here" above
the button "Check Mail".

<?
<TABLE border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0">
<TR>Your profile is out of date, please update <a
href="www.blabla.com">clicking here.</a></TR>
</TABLE>

I think this could be used in phishing scam.

For a screenshot, see [1]. The circulated text was inserted into interface
of the "Yahoo!  Mail" through an email  with the above code  as an html
attachment.

I tried to contact "Yahoo!" several times, without success.
