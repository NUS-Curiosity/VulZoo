Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been identified that allows unauthorized access to
the contents of /etc/sudoers and /etc/super.tab files.

Background
==========

Smb4K is a SMB/CIFS share browser for KDE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/smb4k       < 0.6.4                             >= 0.6.4

Description
===========

A vulnerability leading to unauthorized file access has been found. A
pre-existing symlink from /tmp/sudoers and /tmp/super.tab to a textfile
will cause Smb4k to write the contents of these files to the target of
the symlink, as Smb4k does not check for the existence of these files
before writing to them.

Impact
======

An attacker could acquire local privilege escalation by adding
username(s) to the list of sudoers.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All smb4k users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/smb4k-0.6.4"
