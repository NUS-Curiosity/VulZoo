Subject: Snagging Security Tokens to Elevate Privileges


I've just put up a Database Security Brief; the first of many to come.

http://www.databasesecurity.com/dbsec-briefs.htm

It's called a brief because there's enough meat to make it interesting but
not enough to make it a paper ;)

This brief, Snagging Security Tokens to Elevate Privileges, details how a
database server running as a low privileged user on Windows can still
provide an attacker with the ability to gain elevated privileges on the
network and suggests a change it security policy to mitigate the risk. As a
side note, this affects all network servers that offer OS based
authentication - not just database servers.

Cheers,
David
