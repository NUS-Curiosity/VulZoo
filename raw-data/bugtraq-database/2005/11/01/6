Subject: Snort Back Orifice Preprocessor Exploit (Win32
	targets)

Dear All

I wrote Snort Back Orifice Preprocessor Exploit for Win32 targets. It's for
educational purpose only.
This exploit was tested on

- Snort 2.4.2 Binary + Windows XP Professional SP1
- Snort 2.4.2 Binary + Windows XP Professional SP2
- Snort 2.4.2 Binary + Windows Server 2003 SP1
- Snort 2.4.2 Binary + Windows Server 2000 SP0
- Snort 2.4.2 Bianry + Windows 2000 Professional SP0

Note 01: This exploit was written in form of MetaSploit module, so you need
metasploit to launch it.
Note 02: The exploit's quite reliable, but if it doesn't work on your
machine, try to find address of 'jmp esp' instruction and replace it to the
old return address.

Regards,

Kira
