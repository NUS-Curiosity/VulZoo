APPLE-SA-2005-10-31 Mac OS X v10.4.3

Mac OS X v10.4.3 and Mac OS X Server v10.4.3 are now available and
deliver the following security enhancements:

Finder
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-2749
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.4.2, Mac OS X Server v10.4.2
Impact:  File ownership information may be misleading
Description:  Under certain situations, the file and group ownership
information displayed in the Finder Get Info window may not be
correct. This update addresses the issue by synchronizing the
displayed ownership with the actual ownership in all situations.
This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.4.

Software Update
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-2750
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.4.2, Mac OS X Server v10.4.2
Impact:  Important Software Updates may not install
Description:  Software Update can be instructed by the user to
ignore specific updates. If all applicable updates have been marked
in this way, Software Update will exit without providing an an
opportunity to reset the status of these updates so that they may
be installed. This update addresses the issue by asking whether the
ignored updates list should be reset when this situation is
encountered. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X
v10.4.

memberd
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-2751
Available for:  Mac OS X Server v10.4.2
Impact:  Changes to group membership are delayed for hours
Description:  In certain situations, changes to a group's membership
may not be immediately reflected in access control checks. This may
result in an authenticated user being able to access files or other
resources even after they have been removed from a group. This
update addresses the issue by invalidating the group membership
cache at appropriate times. This issue does not affect systems
prior to Mac OS X v10.4.

Keychain
CVE-ID:  CVE-2005-2739
Available for:  Mac OS X v10.4.2, Mac OS X Server v10.4.2
Impact:  Keychain Access will continue displaying plaintext
passwords after lock timeout
Description:  Keychain Access is a utility distributed with Mac OS X
that is used to view keychain items and change keychain settings.
If a keychain automatically locks due to a timeout while viewing a
password stored inside it, that password will remain visible. This
update patches Keychain Access so that passwords are hidden when
keychains lock. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS
X v10.4. Credit to Eric Hall of DarkArt Consulting Services for
