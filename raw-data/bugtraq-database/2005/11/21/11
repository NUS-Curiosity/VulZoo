Debian Security Advisory DSA 811-2                     security@...ian.org

Package        : common-lisp-controller
Vulnerability  : design error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-2657

The bugfix for the problem mentioned below contained an error that
caused third party programs to fail.  The problem is corrected by this
update.  For completeness we're including the original advisory text:

   François-René Rideau discovered a bug in common-lisp-controller, a
   Common Lisp source and compiler manager, that allows a local user
   to compile malicious code into a cache directory which is executed
   by another user if that user has not used Common Lisp before.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.15sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.18.

We recommend that you upgrade your common-lisp-controller package.


Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
