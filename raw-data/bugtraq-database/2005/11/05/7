   I've just tried this on one of my "vulnerable" Mambo installations 
and got nothing, but the blank screen. I wonder why this happened?.. 
Could it be because of displaying php errors turned off as it should be 
done in any production environment?

   Isn't this "solution" somewhat overcomplicated? If someone wants to 
workaround this bug, it's not necessary to upgrade. It would be enough 
just to follow basic security principles.
