But the operator, in his professional capacity, is acting as an agent
of the corporation, and has a legal and professional obligation to
make decisions based on what the company has outlined in its policy.
That is, insomuch as he may decide what can or can't be run, he's
acting with the authority of the company, and on behalf of the
company.  In other words, for purposes of deciding what is being run
on the computer, he IS the company.

Many operators are not in a position to make such decisions.  Their
job is only to see that the company's assets are being used in
accordance with company policy.  Failure to do so CAN result in
termination (even if it usually doesn't)...
