Subject: Re: Details of Sybase ASE bugs withheld



I think Simple Nomad wrote an excellent analysis of the problem of a COTS 
vendor (in this case, Sybase) "requesting" (make legal threats) against a 
security research firm to not disclose the details of a discovered 
vulnerability.

Looking at this from my point of view as an employee of a Fortune 200 
company with a massively complex IT infrastructure, in the microcosm of 
this specific Sybase vulnerability, it is a two edged sword: one edge may 
be good for us in that only the more dedicated of crackers will find and 
build an exploit for the vulnerability in the absence of the full details; 
the other edge is that we still do not know the precise details and so we 
are less certain what and how much to do to protect ourselves against it.

It would be foolish to assume that an effective exploit for the 
vulnerability will not be created and published (or for that matter than 
an effective exploit for the vulnerability is not already quietly 
circulating). Therefore, on the whole, even in the microcosm of our large 
company and this one specific incident, I do not think that it is good for 
us that a commercial software product vendor has been able to even 
temporarily silence a security research firm.

In the broader context, I believe that Simple Nomad is exactly right: it
will be bad for us and for everyone who uses such commercial products if
security research firms are effectively gagged by legal threats, because
we will less and less know what vulnerabilities exist in the products we
use, until such time as we suffer an actual exploit against them.

To that end, I have encouraged my employer to perform some commercial 
activism by contacting the commercial product vendor, as a concerned 
customer, and suggesting that we disapprove of their policy of using legal 
threats to keep the vulnerability details quiet. I have further suggested 
that we should copy such notice to our lobbyists / elected 
representatives.
