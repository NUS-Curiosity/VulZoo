I second your conclusion to Simple Nomad's analysis. I unfortunately have
had and continue to have the same experience with vendors. Some that are
vendors of security products and I honestly expected to be positive. </naÃ¯ve>

Excellent. If everyone on these lists that is a licensed/paying user of Sybase
products contacted Sybase to express their concern and displeasure, their
stance would quickly change. Let them know you'll vote with your dollars.

Anyone remember when someone published Carly the HP CEO's email address
to a certain list and the 1,000's of emails she got over the Snosoft lawsuit?
(I think it was Snosoft, wasn't it?)

HP changed their tune really fast and claimed "it was all a misunderstanding".

How about a little noise from the community. NGS should drop a name or an
email address if they find they cannot make progress on this.

Also, where are the clueless media articles about this? Where are the media
folks for that matter? I know you guys are reading BT.

Stop writing about Microsoft-funded studies analyzing Linux security
and write about some real information.
