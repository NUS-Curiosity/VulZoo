Subject: Re: [ISN] How To Save The Internet


The truth is most people are not "skilled" enough to operate their PC's at a level that 
isn't "dangerous" to the rest of the network/internet. Nor should they have to be. With 
better operating system and software design we can mitigate those risks, but never 
eliminate them. There is no one simple solution to a security problem - it always a 
process. The problem often lies that the default configuration for software and OS's are 
inherently insecure, allowing problems to propagate. No normal computer user should be 
expected to become a system administrator for their computer. Design is what has let us 
down - the fact I have be active to protect my computer is the problem.
