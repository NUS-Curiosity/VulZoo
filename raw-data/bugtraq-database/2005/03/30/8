Hello.

Back in the mid 90th, it has become a fact that Israel was one of the 
main focal points of Internet abuse in the world, and reaching abuse 
contacts was very difficult.

Today, we no longer hold that title. Also, some of the ISP's in Israel 
are now very responsive to abuse, it is not true with most others.
Still, a lot of abuse originates from Israeli net space and finding 
working abuse contacts in meat space remains difficult.

We at CERT.gov.il are responsible for the Government's net space [AS8867 
/ gov.il] and are available to help with any problems originating from 
our networks if such exist.
We are also aiming to help clue up Israeli ISP's in general to Internet 
abuse, but for now, if anyone has abuse and security issues that need 
resolving, and yet find it difficult to find who to contact and/or get 
response/action, feel free to ping me personally here at CERT.gov.il. We 
will do our best to connect you with the right people, and follow up.

Aside to that, I am pleased to announce IL-ops. An active Israeli 
network operators group that discusses mainly security and spam issues 
between Israeli ISP's.

We here in Israel are making an effort - let us help you.

Yours,

--
