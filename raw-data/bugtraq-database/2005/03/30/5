Subject: Hacked: Who Else Is Using Your Computer?

A friend called me one day and asked if I would stop by to look at his 
computer. He said it was running abnormally slow and he had found 
something on his hard-drive he could not explain. I could almost guess 
what it was he found.

Have I been hacked?
You see, his computer had been hacked. Actually, in his case, his computer 
had been tagged. Similar to the image you see here:
