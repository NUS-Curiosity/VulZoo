Description:
phpCoin is a free software package originally designed for 
web-hosting resellers to handle clients, orders, invoices, 
notes and helpdesk. phpCoin versions 1.2.1b and earlier are
prone to multiple vulnerabilities such as File Inclusion and 
SQL Injection.



SQL Injection:
There are three SQL Injection vulnerabilities in
phpCoin v1.2.1b and earlier. Two of the issues are not very
easy to exploit, but one (in the search engine) is very useful.
The SQL Injection issue in the search engine is pretty straight
forward, as entering the query of your choice after breaking out
of single quotes in the search term/keywords field. The other
two SQL Injection issues take place when ordering a product, and
when requesting a forgotten password. When requesting a forgotten
password, neither the username or email fields are safe from SQL 
Injection. Also, when ordering a new package you can put an allowed
domain name such as test.ca followed by sql as long as you break
out of the single quotes. It should be noted that these issues 
probably will not present themselves if magic_quotes_gpc is on.



File Include Vulnerability:
There is a local file include vulnerability in auxpage.php when
calling the 'page' parameter

http://phpcoin/auxpage.php?page=../../../some/other/file

Using a similar example as above an attacker could traverse out
of the directory and include arbitrary files to be read or executed.



Solution:
The guys at phpCoin worked very quickly to get a fix out, and a fix 
has been available for a while now. Upgrade your vulnerable version.
