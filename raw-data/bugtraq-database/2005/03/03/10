Subject: TYPO3 SQL Injection vunerabilitie




Hello Bugtraq :)
Two week ago I found a SQL Inejetion vulnerabilitie in Typo3 (in the links-section/module/whatever you call it).
I didn't really try to develope an exploit because I thought typo3 would directly react. 
But unfortunately that didn't happen :/

So here is the url that "exploits" the vulnerabilitie in a friendly way ;)

http://[UrlToLinksSection]?&no_cache=1&action=getviewcategory&category_uid=1%20or%201=1

Maybe someone will find a way to exploit this one in a maliceous way so get typo3 to update it's software!

C ya
