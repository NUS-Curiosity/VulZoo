IMPORTANT:

THIS IS NOT A FAKE ADVISORY, NOR IS IT A SPOOF. WE ARE NOT ROCKY

OpenSSL <= 0.9.6m GetHostByName vulnerability

tal0n Security Advisory 02.03.05
cyber_talon@...hmail.com

March 2, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of the Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) protocol. A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists 
in OpenSSL servers that could lead to the execution of arbitrary 
code on the server.
OpenSSL has been penetrated more times than theo de raadt's ass.

II. DESCRIPTION

I would like to retract the statement from my "Code Auditing in C" 
article, that strncpy is safe, I now believe this to be false. 
Remote exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability 
in the GetHostByName function of OpenSSL could allow remote 
attackers to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability specifically exists due inproper use of then 
strncpy function.
The vulnerable code is shown below:

-- snip --
char name[128];
-- snip --
if (ghbn_cache[i].order > 0)
{
	if (strncmp(name,ghbn_cache[i].name,128) == 0)
        break;
}

Due to a routine security audit of the strncpy man file, we at 
tal0n security now know that the result of strncpy will not be null 
terminated !!!!!!

This leads to exploitation of adjacent memory spaces, uH oH!

III. DETECTION

tal0n Security discovered this problem 01.05.04 and has been owning 
kernel.org ever since.

We at tal0n Security do not believe in notifying vendors, therefore 
this vulnerability still exists in the wild.


IV. WORKAROUND

There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. You MUST rm 
your system
