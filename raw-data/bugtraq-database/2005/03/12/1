Synopsis
========

A new vulnerability has been discovered in libXpm, which is included in
X.org, that can potentially lead to remote code execution.

Background
==========

libXpm is a pixmap manipulation library for the X Window System,
included in X.org.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-base/xorg-x11     < 6.8.2-r1                     *>= 6.8.0-r5
                                                           >= 6.8.2-r1

Description
===========

Chris Gilbert has discovered potentially exploitable buffer overflow
cases in libXpm that weren't fixed in previous libXpm versions.

Impact
======

A carefully-crafted XPM file could crash X.org, potentially allowing
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All X.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose x11-base/xorg-x11
