OOPS! again my fault!!!
TRY: http://www.geocities.com/visitbipin/Antigen.zip

my intension was to show, if the archive has
compressed size and uncompressed size set to greater
than the actual file size or less than the actual file
size there are many AV that can't scan the file
properly.

send  http://www.geocities.com/visitbipin/Antigen.zip
 to virustotal.com and see for yourself!!!

Download Accelerator successfully repairs this archive
with some garbage data \x00 at the end "255 bytes"
Though, i was able to successfully execute eicar.com
