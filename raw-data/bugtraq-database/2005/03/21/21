Yes - you understand correctly. Needless to say I hope all of this can be 
resolved amicably; and the details will be published.

To be honest, I don't know, but if the patch is freely downloadable, let's 
face it, the "details" are there to anyone with a disassembler, anyway. This 
kind of legal threat achieves nothing other than to make legit researchers 
fearful about being sued if they find and publish security issues - even if 
they do so in a responsible manner. In such a climate security research will 
be driven underground - which is where the "good guys" really don't want it 
to be.
