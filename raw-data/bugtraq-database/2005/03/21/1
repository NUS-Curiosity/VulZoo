Synopsis
========

Sylpheed and Sylpheed-claws contain a vulnerability that can be
triggered when replying to specially crafted messages.

Background
==========

Sylpheed is a lightweight email client and newsreader. Sylpheed-claws
is a 'bleeding edge' version of Sylpheed.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                     /  Vulnerable  /           Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-client/sylpheed             < 1.0.3                 >= 1.0.3
  2  mail-client/sylpheed-claws       < 1.0.3                 >= 1.0.3
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Sylpheed and Sylpheed-claws fail to properly handle non-ASCII
characters in email headers when composing reply messages.

Impact
======

An attacker can send an email containing a malicious non-ASCII header
which, when replied to, would cause the program to crash, potentially
allowing the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the software.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Sylpheed users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/sylpheed-1.0.3"

All Sylpheed-claws users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/sylpheed-claws-1.0.3"
