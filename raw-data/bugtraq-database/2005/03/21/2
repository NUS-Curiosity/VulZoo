Synopsis
========

Xzabite's dyndnsupdate software suffers from multiple vulnerabilities,
potentially resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

dyndnsupdate is a dyndns.org data updater written by Fredrik "xzabite"
Haglund.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/dyndnsupdate      <= 0.6.15                  Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Toby Dickenson discovered that dyndnsupdate suffers from multiple
overflows.

Impact
======

A remote attacker, posing as a dyndns.org server, could execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running dyndnsupdate.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Currently, there is no released version of dyndnsupdate that contains a
fix for these issues. The original xzabite.org distribution site is
dead, the code contains several other problems and more secure
alternatives exist, such as the net-dns/ddclient package. Therefore,
the dyndnsupdate package has been hard-masked prior to complete removal
from Portage, and current users are advised to unmerge the package:

    # emerge --unmerge net-misc/dyndnsupdate

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
