It is certainly possible to discover security flaws without reverse
engineering. You don't need to get to the point where you know how the
internals of a program are built. Injecting crafted data into a program's
inputs and observing whether or not it crashes or misbehaves is simply
using the program.

If it is decided by the courts that all security analysis is covered by a
blanket EULA no reverse engineering provision, a potential solution for
security researchers is to require that the vendor indemnify them from
reverse engineering civil suits before disclosing information them.
