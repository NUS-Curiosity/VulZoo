  Just one of the myriad of security issues that we're grappling with 
are the various rights of the owner of the CPU, the *operator* of the
CPU, and the owner of the *data*, each of whom may have a more or less
legitimate say in what code actually gets executed.  Far too many folks 
have already "solved" this problem incorrectly for me to believe that 
the "just a few months" solution you envisage will actually be correct.
