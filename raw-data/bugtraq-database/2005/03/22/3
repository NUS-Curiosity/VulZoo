Subject: Re: [ISN] How To Save The Internet


I didn't take the time to read every single response to the article (though 
did take the time to pen my own), but I read at least half of them and 
didn't see a one that seemed to support the article.  Several even seemed 
to think they were reading a Dilbert comic.  The ironic part (and the point 
I tried to make in my post) is that the actual readership of CIO are, for 
the most part, clewless pointy hairs and probably didn't even finish 
reading the article (if they even started it) and certainly would never 
take the time to read the responses to it, let alone discuss them with 
their technical people.  These are the decision makers who pay us to make 
the things that are complained about in the article.  As long as they 
refuse to pay us to write secure products nothing will change.
