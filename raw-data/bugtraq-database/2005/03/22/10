Subject: Re: CISSP Test


Wow, thanks a lot. I'll pick the book back up, I have read about a lot 
of "clueless" CISSPs, this one gentlemen I spoke with (Who is a CISSP) 
said that OpenBSD is easily remotely exploitable, it made me question 
the integrity of this gentleman and the process in which one becomes a 
CISSP (Assuming it has to do with through understanding of secure 
networks, platforms, etc)

What are some of the other Computer/Network security exams that are good 
for showing a through understanding of the concepts?
