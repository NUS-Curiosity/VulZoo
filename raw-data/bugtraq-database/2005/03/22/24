Subject: RE: CISSP Test


Rob, if I need to make myself more clear I will.

Directly from the ISC2 website:
The CISSP credential is ideal for mid- and senior-level managers who are working toward or have already attained positions as CISOs, CSOs or Senior Security Engineers.

There are three concentrations within the CISSP
ISSAP - Concentration in Architecture
ISSEP - Concentration in Engineering
ISSMP - Concentration in Management

The SSCP - The SSCP credential is ideal for those working toward or who have already attained positions as Senior Network Security Engineers, Senior Security Systems Analysts or Senior Security Administrators. (Concentrations coming soon!)

The CBK is a comprehensive working knowledge of security as pertains to physical, data, and operational needs of a business. I have had my CISSP for about 3 years now and must say it has opened doors for me that otherwise would not have if it weren't for the certification and the training that comes along with it. I am growing and learning new things daily and it is because of the opportunities that the CISSP credential has provided!!

Very Respectfully,
David Chastain
