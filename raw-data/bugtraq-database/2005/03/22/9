Subject: RE: CISSP Test


Agreed with Robert on this one. It's pretty much a sure-fire way to get
your foot in the door...esp. if you're dealing with Gov. contractors or
the Gov. itself. Once you have the job, if you don't have the skills, you
won't last long. I figure 90% of the job battle is actually getting
through the HR folks who look over resumes checking off boxes in a
checklist to see if you qualify - certs/education and of course experience
will fill all those check lists.
