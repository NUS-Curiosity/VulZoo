Subject: RE: CISSP Test


Many companies that know little or nothing about security, which means a
lot of them, use the CISSP as the "benchmark" for determining if they
will even interview you for a position so from that standpoint it is
good to have. The test is good for showing you have a good overall grasp
from the security concepts that you would want a security professional
to have but as always I wouldn't rely on the fact that someone was
certified to decide if I was going to hire them.

I have heard conflicting views of the CISSP exam, is it worth it?
