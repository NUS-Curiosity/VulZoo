Description: this exploit modify the user id that is in your cookies.txt (Firefox and Mozilla) file. 
You have to log in the forum, with the autologin option unchecked, then you close the navigator and 
execute the exploit.
If you have any problem with the exploit, remove all cookies and do all again.

Note: you have to put the exploit in the same directory of cookies.txt.
This exploit overwrite all phpbb cookies that have the user id specified.

I HAVE NOT DISCOVERED THIS VULNERABILITY, I DON'T KNOW WHO HAS DISCOVERED IT.
