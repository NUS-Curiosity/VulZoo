Someone from Mozilla Org has stated that the automated updates will not be 
enabled for sometime since they do not have the infrastructure to support it 
yet. Try to remember, Firefox went from <1 million to >10 million installs 
in a few months. The amount of infrastructure needed to support even a 
fraction of those users updating automatically is significant. You can 
upgrade manually (i.e. download and install it from www.getfirefox.com which 
directs to the appropriate URL on the mozilla.org website). Or you can wait 
for them to enable the 1.0.1 automated update.

"We're still working on some with the application update infrastructure and 
the installer so for the first few days, we'll only be offering the release 
via full download at the website and then turning on the automatic update 
system hopefully sometime next week."

In future it sounds like they will have automatic updates enabled as they 
come out, which isn't to bad. Try to remember folks, this is FREE (as in 
beer and speech) software supported by.. well... not the majority of end 
users (i.e. Microsoft gets paid for each copy of IE, through Windows sales, 
Firefox does not).

As for bugs in bugzilla, it's OpenSource, you can take a look and fix them, 
or pay a developer so they have more time to code fixes for a piece of 
software you depend upon (but are not willing to support in any manner).
