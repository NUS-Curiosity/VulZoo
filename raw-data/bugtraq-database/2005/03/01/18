 Vulnerable: PBLang 4.63 (and earlier?)  
  
  
 ---  
  
 General information:  
  
 PBLang is an international BBS-software based on 
PHP. It does not require any database but bases on a 
flatfile system. Many professional features. More 
info on the project website.

 Description:  
  
 Anyone can delete anyone elses PM's as long as their 
logged in (as any user, really, doesn't need to be 
privileged). This could allow users to harass others 
and other stuff... Well, wreck havoc!
