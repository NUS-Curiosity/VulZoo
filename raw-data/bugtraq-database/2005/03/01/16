"We're still working on some with the application update
infrastructure and the installer so for the first few days, we'll only
be offering the release via full download at the website and then
turning on the automatic update system hopefully sometime next week."

Quoted from Asa's blog at:

Of course, that was posted on the 23rd, so I have no idea when they'll
