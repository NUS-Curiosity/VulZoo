Subject:		OpenServer 5.0.6 OpenServer 5.0.7 : A vulnerability in TCP 
Advisory number: 	SCOSA-2005.3
Issue date: 		2005 February 28
Cross reference:	sr890248 fz529385 erg712599 CAN-2004-0230
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	TCP, when using a large Window Size, makes it easier for
	remote attackers to guess sequence numbers and cause a
	denial of service (connection loss) to persistent TCP
	connections by repeatedly injecting a TCP RST packet,
	especially in protocols that use long-lived connections,
	such as BGP. 

	Paul Watson performed a statistical analysis of this attack 
	when the ISN is not known and has pointed out that such an 
	attack could be viable when specifically taking into account 
	the TCP Window size. He has also created a proof-of-concept 
	tool demonstrating the practicality of the attack. 

	The National Infrastructure Security Co-Ordination Center (NISCC) 
	has published an advisory summarizing Paul Watson's analysis in 
	"NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 236929." 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-0230 to this issue.
