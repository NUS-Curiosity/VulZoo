This is wohfully innacurate:

Tools -> Options -> Advanced [under Software Update]-> Check Updates

Updates all extentions and Forefox itself when updates are available.

Firefox releases appear to be held back at the moment, probably because
the updates site is being revamped.  As far as I can tell it all 
actually works as designed.

This works fine for me.  What version of Firefox are you using... this 
worked for me in 1.0 and still works in 1.0.1  When I press teh update 
button in extension manager or right click on one of them a window opens 
telling if it found any updates or not...
