This is confusing readable with executable.

If a directory is readable, anyone can find out the names of the things
in it.  If it's executable, anyone who knows a thing's name there can
get to the thing.

Read and execute access usually go together on directories, but they
don't have to.  (A +r-x directory is of doubtful use.  But -r+x is
comparatively useful.)
