This vulnerability was first discovered by me, on 01/Mar/2005. The vendor was
immediatelly contacted, as you can see below:

This vulnerability wouldn't made public until the next Ethereal's version
comes out (hopefully 10 or 11 this month), as I dealed with the vendor.

A proof-of-concept remote root exploit was made by me, but will only be
publicized on schedule.
