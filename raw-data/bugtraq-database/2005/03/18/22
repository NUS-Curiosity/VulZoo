This seems off-topic even by full-disclosure standards, so...

We've obviously received it in error.  Consider this your notification. I'd
however like to see what citation you have for prohibiting other use (for
instance, as source material for a satire or parody or social commentary).
Also, do you have plans to indemnify us for the costs of making sure that the
copy that resided on our central mail server is in fact deleted (as opposed to
merely unlinked from the file system)?  Peter Guttman had quite a bit to say
about the secure deletion of data from disks.  You however seem to be in luck,
as there wasn't a backup running on the mail server at the time.  You wouldn't
want to end up like Col Oliver North, would you?

By the way, mention to your legal eagles that your site is unable to tell if
postings to public mailing lists contain privileged information.  An opposing
attorney could use that against you by using it as proof that your site doesn't
have a *clue* which information needs to be protected.

I'd recommend the use of PGP, GnuPG, or S/Mime if you actually have sensitive
information to send via e-mail.  Don't trust the disclaimer to do the work you
should be doing.
