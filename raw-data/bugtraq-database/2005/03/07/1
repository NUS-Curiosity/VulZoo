Synopsis:          Updated subversion packages fix security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1748

Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix

---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated subversion packages that fix several security issues are now
available.

Subversion is a concurrent version control system.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Subversion versions up to 1.0.2 are vulnerable to a date parsing
vulnerability which can be abused to allow remote code execution on
Subversion servers and therefore could lead to a repository compromise.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0397 to this issue.

Subversion versions up to and including 1.0.4 have a potential Denial of
Service and Heap Overflow issue related to the parsing of strings in the
'svn://' family of access protocols. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0413 to
this issue.

Users of subversion are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,
which contain backported patches correcting these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

     rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

     sha1sum <filename>
