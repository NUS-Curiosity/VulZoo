Subject: LLSSRV Clarifications <Immunity>


Immunity is happy to announce the release from VSC of a new paper to our 
public website regarding the technical details of the llssrv 
vulnerability Microsoft released on February 8th, 2005. Along with this 
paper, we've released a reliable, language-independant exploit to the 
CANVAS distribution.

As stated in MS05-010, LLSSRV is not remotely exploitable on Windows 
2000 Server SP3 and 4 without authentication. However, it is remotely 
exploitable in Windows 2000 Advanced Server SP 3 and 4 without 
authentication. This information, missing from MS05-010, is a perfect 
example as to why fully independant third party security information and 
exploit code provide a key link in an organization's ability to 
understand and evaluate the risk posted by vulnerabilities.

Further details, vulnerability release scheduling, and other information 
are available here:
