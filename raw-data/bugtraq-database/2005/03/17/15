Subject: LLSSRV Redux



With regards to the LLSSRV advisory Immunity published yesterday, we 
would like to issue a clarification. There are two ways to get SP4 onto 
a Windows 2000 Advanced Server machine, as follows:
1. Download SP4 from microsoft.com via networked or express install
2. Obtain and install a Windows 2000 Advanced Server CD or CD image that 
includes SP4. This is available from the MSDN CD packages or online 
download site. You may also have obtained such a CD from a vendor or 
retailer.

The second way is vulnerable; the first way is not.

I.E. This advisory does not apply to Windows 2000 Advanced Server cases 
where Service Pack 4 was installed separately.

We apologize for any confusion and thank those who pointed out that 
installing SP4 manually will remove the registry key that allows for 
anonymous remote access.
