I can understand how full path disclosure can be an issue, however, in a 
production environment the PHP settings to display errors ought to be 
disabled.  As such, full path disclosure goes away.

That is true if the default table names are used.  However it would be 
worth noting that with any web presence that uses a backend database, the 
prefix ought to be changed to something random and non-default.

Does this completely solve the issue, of course not, but it can stop the 
script kiddy attacks.  For more on this:

Thanks for the disclosure.
