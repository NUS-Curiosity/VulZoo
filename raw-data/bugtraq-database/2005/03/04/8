Hiya

The same applies to all script blocking AV's like KAV & Norton etc unless 
they are set to prompt on running any script. To turn this on/off, do this:

click on realtime protection

manage agents/application agents/ script blocking/tun off or mange 
allowed/blocked events

This is a feature, not a bug.

Regards

Alex
