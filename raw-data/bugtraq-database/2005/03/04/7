As far as I know, this information should not go to a 
public mailing list 
until the developers got some time to fix that 
problem. 
 
Just think about the panic this will cause if you 
announce how to exploit 
that bug when there was no patch available since the 
maintainers of TYPO3 
had not been warned before...! 
 
Anyway, in this specific case it's not such a big 
problem because the bug 
must have been caused by a 3rd party plugin 
(=extension) to TYPO3. 
 
Since there are more than 1000 extensions in our 
repository you are kindly 
invited to contact me off this list to find out where 
it is caused and fix 
that problem. 
 
With kind regards 
- michael
