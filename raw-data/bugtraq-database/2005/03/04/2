Subject: Re: TYPO3 SQL Injection vunerabilitie

Hi Dennis,

I am pretty sure Fabian (Neonomicus) meant *every link* (or site) generated by 
Typo3, didn't he? For instance if you search google for 
"inurl:action=getviewcategory" I am pretty sure you will understand what he 
meant (or am I wrong here)?

@Fabian (Neonomicus): Could you please provide more details about the 
vulnerability you've discoveredl? By the way did you give the Typo3 guys 
*enough* time to respond???

All the best,
Sebastian
