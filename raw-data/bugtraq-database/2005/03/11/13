Symantec is aware of an issue posted to various security mailing
lists, in which the poster reported being able to bypass the initial
scan of multiple vendor antivirus products including Symantec
AntiVirus Corporate Edition version 8.0.  

The researcher included a link to the proof-of-concept code that he
used to validate his tests.  According to the posting, by creating a
malicious zip archive with an invalid CRC32 checksum, some antivirus
vendor's  products will not detect the malicious file, providing a
method to bypass the antivirus scan at the gateway and potentially
compromise targeted systems.

Symantec Response
Symantec engineers reviewed and tested the poster's proof-of-concept
code.  In all instances, Symantec was able to successfully decompress
the target file and scan the content.  However, the eicar test file
that the poster used in his proof-of-concept was an invalid test
file.  While Symantec products did successfully unzip the archive and
scan the enclosed file, we were not getting a valid detection on the
original enclosed eicar test file.  Once we recognized the problem
with the poster's version of the eicar test file, we recreated the
poster's proof-of-concept test with a valid eicar test file and
verified our products successfully detected the valid file.

Symantec engineers have determined that this issue does not impact
Symantec's antivirus scanning products.
