Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.14.05: MySQL MaxDB Web Agent Multiple Denial of Service Vulnerabilities


MySQL MaxDB Web Agent Multiple Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.14.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=218&type=vulnerabilities
March 14, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

MaxDB by MySQL is a re-branded and enhanced version of SAP DB, SAP AG's
open source database. MaxDB is a heavy-duty, SAP-certified open source
database that offers high availability, salability and a comprehensive
feature set. MaxDB complements the MySQL database server, targeted for
large mySAP ERP environments and other applications that require maximum
enterprise-level database functionality.

II. DESCRIPTION

A number of remotely exploitable input validation errors have been found
to exist in MySQL MaxDB and SAP DB Web Agent products.

The vulnerabilities specifically exist due to insufficient validation of
user input data. The input validation error results in a null pointer
dereference in the following functions which can lead to a denial of
service condition:

	DBMCli_String::ReallocString             
	DBMCli_String::operator
	DBMCli_Buffer::ForceResize        
	DBMCli_Wizard::InstallDatabase
	DBMCli_Devspaces::Complete
	DBMWeb_TemplateWizard::askForWriteCountStep5
	DBMWeb_DBMWeb::wizardDB

A remote attacker can request the function with invalid parameters to
cause a null pointer dereference resulting in a crash of MySQL MaxDB Web
Agent.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
condition. The attacks are trivially exploited, as a remote attacker
can send simple HTTP requests to cause MaxDB Web Agent to crash.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed that MySQL MaxDB 7.5.00 for Windows is
vulnerable. It is suspected that earlier versions and versions on other
platforms are vulnerable as well.

V. WORKAROUND

Use a firewall to only allow trusted hosts to connect to the MySQL MaxDB
Web Agent HTTP Service.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
