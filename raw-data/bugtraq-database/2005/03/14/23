In Local file header if you modify "general purpose bit flag" 7th & 8'th
byte of a zip archive with \x2f ie: "\" F-port, Kaspersky, Mcafee,
Norman, Sybari, Symantec seem to skip the file marking it as clean!!!
This was discovered during the analysis of "Multiple AV Vendor Incorrect
CRC32 Bypass Vulnerability."
Quick/rough conclusion were drawn using www.virustotal.com

Well, tested with F-prot, DrWeb, *Symantec 8.0 long ago... lately
verified it using virustotal.com If you have a long archive coment... in
a zip archive these AV can't detect virus embedded in it. I came to know
Symantec 8.1 is immune to the bug?
