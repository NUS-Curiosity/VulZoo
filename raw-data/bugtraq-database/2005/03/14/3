Package        : squirrelmail
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2005-0104 CAN-2005-0152
Debian Bug     : 292714 295836

Andrew Archibald discovered that the last update to squirrelmail which
was intended to fix several problems caused a regression which got
exposed when the user hits a session timeout.  For completeness below
is the original advisory text:

  Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squirrelmail, a
  commonly used webmail system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project identifies the following problems:

  CAN-2005-0104

      Upstream developers noticed that an unsanitised variable could
      lead to cross site scripting.

  CAN-2005-0152

      Grant Hollingworth discovered that under certain circumstances URL
      manipulation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with
      the privileges of www-data.  This problem only exists in version
      1.2.6 of Squirrelmail.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-3.

The correction in the unstable distribution (sid) is not affected by
this regression.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.
