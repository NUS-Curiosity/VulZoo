Synopsis
========

Mozilla Firefox 1.0.2 fixes new security vulnerabilities, including the
remote execution of arbitrary code through malicious GIF images or
sidebars.

Background
==========

Mozilla Firefox is the popular next-generation browser from the Mozilla
project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                         /  Vulnerable  /       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla-firefox           < 1.0.2             >= 1.0.2
  2  www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin       < 1.0.2             >= 1.0.2
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla Firefox:

* Mark Dowd from ISS X-Force reported an exploitable heap overrun in
  the GIF processing of obsolete Netscape extension 2 (CAN-2005-0399)

* Kohei Yoshino discovered that a page bookmarked as a sidebar could
  bypass privileges control (CAN-2005-0402)

* Michael Krax reported a new way to bypass XUL security restrictions
  through drag-and-drop of items like scrollbars (CAN-2005-0401)

Impact
======

* The GIF heap overflow could be triggered by a malicious GIF image
  that would end up executing arbitrary code with the rights of the
  user running Firefox

* By tricking the user into bookmarking a malicious page as a
  Sidebar, a remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code
  with the rights of the user running the browser

* By setting up a malicious website and convincing users to obey very
  specific drag-and-drop instructions, attackers may leverage
  drag-and-drop features to bypass XUL security restrictions, which
  could be used as a stepping stone to exploit other vulnerabilities

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.2"

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.2"
