Subject: Secure Science issues preview of their upcoming block cipher


Secure Science is offering a preview of one of the 3 ciphers they will 
be publishing througout the year. The CS2-128 cipher is a 128-bit block 
cipher with a 128 bit key. This cipher is proposed as an alternative 
hardware-based cipher to AES, being that it is more efficient in 
hardware, simpler to implement, and provably just as secure as AES-128.
