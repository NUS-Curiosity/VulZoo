Subject: Re: [lists] Which anti-spyware cleaner is the
	best?

I suppose its interesting to see which anti-spyware solution is 
preferred in the market, but which one is the best is a matter of 
objective record, not opinion.  If you survey the literature, you'll 
find plenty of quantitative reviews of antispyware products, as some 
have pointed out in the comments of your survey.

I ran some tests 
<http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2005/01/17/microsoft-anti-spyware-torn-apart/>myself 
(http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2005/01/17/microsoft-anti-spyware-torn-apart/) 
in a VMWare installation, and found that Microsoft/Giant product did the 
best job: perhaps others' results differ.  Can anyone suggest a good, 
comprehensive review of popular products?

Thanks,
Elliott C. Bäck
