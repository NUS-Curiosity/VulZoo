Subject: Re: [lists] Which anti-spyware cleaner is the
	best?


Hi Elliot, the survey is very much querying the community to gather
individual thoughts on which product is "best".  I am sure for folks the
choice can be driven subjectively or objectively.

As to answer some of your questions, here are some comparison and testing 
links that I know of:

Anti-Spyware Programs, a Feature Comparison:

Anti-Spyware Testing:
http://spywarewarrior.com/asw-test-guide.htm

Of course in the poll itself is a comment that contains the PCWorld link:

Spyware Stoppers
http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,119572,00.asp

This article has its page 2 titled:

"CounterSpy and Spy Sweeper Lead the Field (chart) "

Larry Seltzer has just written an article on "Big Security Guns Should Aim 
Carefully at Adware, Spyware":

Giant's/Microsoft's AntiSpyware does extremely well in tests.

We ran a similar survey in 2004 on anti-virus products:

Nearly 20,000 voters and the top pick at the time was Symantec (NAV).  
Objective and personal preference aside, 40% is a pretty interesting 
figure.
