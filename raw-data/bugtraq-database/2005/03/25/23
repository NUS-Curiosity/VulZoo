Subject: Netcomm 1300NB DSL Modem Denial of Service




There is an issue with the Netcomm 1300NB DSL Modem in regards to a Denial of Service attack. By sending off the following ping command in four seperate shells or windows the WAN interface on the Netcomm DSL Modem locks up and the device must be rebooted to get Internet Activity. The Netcomm ADSL Modem is given away commonly with new ADSL Connections.

ping -l 65500 -w 0 -t <IP of DSL Modem>

Open 3 new shells/cmd and paste it in again. Kill the shells and send a normal ping to the device and it is gone, until reboot.

The Netcomm 1300NM Modem series has no ICMP/Ping blocking from the external interface. There is no Netcomm solution.
