True, but this is not foolproof. If you work hard enough, you can get a
program to recognize text in an image, even if some lines are crossed
in-between. Other 'Turing tests' have similar practical problems,
requiring either a human to check the response (which in practice means
a human adds a decidedly finite amount of possibilities into the
application) or being solvable by a good coder with nothing better to
do (which is a pretty accurate description of a hacker, come to think of
it... ;-) )

Of course, one might use these two together - the above might cost
enough computing power to qualify as 'electronic payment'...
