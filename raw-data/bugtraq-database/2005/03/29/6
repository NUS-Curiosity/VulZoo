Subject: phishing sites report - March/2005


Below is a periodic public report from the Malicious Websites and 
Phishing research and mitigation mailing list (a sub-group of the drone 
armies / botnets research and mitigation mailing list).
For this report it should be noted that we base our analysis on the data
we have accumulated from various sources.

According to our incomplete analysis of information we have thus far, we
now publish the following report.

Notes on the report:
* The report is in descending order.
* In the listing are also included suspected child pornography sites,
   however, their numbers are not large enough to effect the statistics.


Number of phishing sites found: 276.
