Subject: Re: Bypass of 22 Antivirus software with GDI+ bug
 exploit Mutations - part 2


Symantec found something that other editor didn't ? Whoaw, impressive 
for a software which let go throw 700 malwares on PC ;p

About Panda Software version, you've used on old version of Internet 
Security 2004 which is actually : 8.05.02 (don't found anything too)
Internet security 2005 is : 9.01.02
