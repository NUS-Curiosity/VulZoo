Subject: Which anti-spyware cleaner is the best?


Our new survey is now up and ready for polling: click here to vote

http://castlecops.com/modules.php?name=Surveys&pollID=30

19 of the most popular and known anti-spyware cleaners can be selected.
Like all our previous surveys, this one too takes in unique votes, so
choose wisely! This survey looks at both free and pay-for anti-spyware
cleaners.

Also, take a moment to view what our readers had to say in their reviews 
on many anti-spyware products here.

You'll see what is hot and what is not in ratings from "Overall feeling",
"Customer Support", "Value for Money", "Ease of Use", "Install", "Company
Website", and "Reliability". Both Spy Sweeper and Pest Patrol have the
most reviews completed to date.
