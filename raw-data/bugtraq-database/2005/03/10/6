Security Advisory: Apple XCode and distcc
March 10, 2005

Outline:

Vendor:       Apple, Samba
Programs:     XCode and distcc
Type:         Remote
Severity:     High
Version:      XCode 1.5, distcc 2.x

Overview:

Apple ships XCode 1.5 with a feature for distributed compiling.  This 
feature actually uses the Samba distcc module (http://
distcc.samba.org). There are known exploits for distccd which will 
enable a remote person full user level access to the target machine.

XCode ships with version 2.0.1 of distcc. We also tried updating to 
2.18.3 and had similar issues with that version as well.
Apple was not contacted prior to this release because the exploit for 
distccd is already known and in the wild.  Users of the distributed 
compiling system in XCode should disable this feature until both Apple 
and Samba can take proper action to protect its users.

Exploit:

There are a few known exploits for distcc. By using a common method 
provided by metasploit (http://metasploit.com/projects/Framework/
exploits.html#distcc_exec), I was given full access to the remote users 
home folder via telnet.

Proposed Solution:

Samba needs to work on proper directory jailing and remote code 
execution with their distcc product.  Apple needs to at least ship with 
the latest version of distcc, which supports an Allow List of people that 
are allowed to connect to the distcc daemon. This would minimize the 
damage caused by running this service on a machine.
