Introduction:
OllyDbg is a 32-bit assembler level analysing debugger for Microsoft� Windows�.
Emphasis on binary code analysis makes it particularly useful in cases where source is unavailable.

Affected Versions:
1.10 (final version) and prior versions.

Overview:
In OllyDbg, if a target process loads modules that contains long name 
(greater than around 200 bytes), OllyDbg will be crashed.

This hole can be used for an anti-debug method for OllyDbg.
