Synopsis
========

A flaw in the processing of ID3 tags in mpg321 could potentially lead
to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

mpg321 is a GPL replacement for mpg123, a command line audio player
with support for ID3. ID3 is a tagging system that allows metadata to
be embedded within media files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/mpg321      < 0.2.10-r2                  >= 0.2.10-r2

Description
===========

A routine security audit of the mpg321 package revealed a known
security issue remained unpatched. The vulnerability is a result of
mpg321 printing embedded ID3 data to the console in an unsafe manner.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would require a victim to play a specially
crafted audio file using mpg321, potentially resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All mpg321 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/mpg321-0.2.10-r2"
