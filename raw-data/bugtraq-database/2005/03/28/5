Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.28.05: Multiple Telnet Client env_opt_add() Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


Multiple Telnet Client env_opt_add() Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.28.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=221&type=vulnerabilities
March 28, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

The TELNET protocol allows virtual network terminals to be connected to 
over the internet. The initial description of the telnet protocol was 
given in RFC854 in May 1983. Since then there have been many extra 
features added including encryption. 

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in multiple
telnet clients could allow the execution of arbitrary code.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the env_opt_add() function of
telnet.c. A buffer of a fixed size (256 bytes) is allocated to store the
result of the processing this function performs on network input. If
this buffer is not large enough to contain the string, the buffer is 
expanded by a further 256 bytes. This size is sufficient for most well 
formed input, as the buffer passed as input to the affected function is 
limited to the same size. However, due to the way the telnet protocol 
escapes certain characters, it is possible to increase the length of the
output by including a large run of characters which need escaping. This 
can allow the 256 byte input buffer to expand to a maximum of 512 bytes 
in the allocated storage buffer. If, after expanding the buffer by 256 
bytes, the buffer is still not large enough to contain the input, a heap
based buffer overflow occurs, which is exploitable on at least some 
affected platforms.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary commands in the context of the user who launched the 
telnet client.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to 
convince the user to connect to their malicious server. It may be 
possible to automatically launch the telnet command from a webpage, for 
example:

<html><body>
<iframe src='telnet://malicious.server/'>
</body>

On opening this page the telnet client may be launched and attempt to 
connect to the host 'malicious.server'.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existance of the vulnerability in the telnet 
client included in the Kerberos V5 Release 1.3.6 package and the client 
included in the SUNWtnetc package of Solaris 5.9. It is suspected that 
most BSD based telnet clients are affected by this vulnerability.

V. WORKAROUND

iDEFENSE is currently unaware of any effective workarounds for this 
vulnerability.
