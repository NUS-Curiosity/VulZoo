Subject:		UnixWare 7.1.4 : Samba multiple security issues
Advisory number: 	SCOSA-2005.17
Issue date: 		2005 February 11
Cross reference:	sr892475 fz530644 erg712754 sr892165 fz530486 erg712735 CAN-2004-0930 CAN-2004-0882 CAN-2004-1154
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	Samba provides file and print services to windows clients.
	Several security issues are fixed by this patch. 

	The ms_fnmatch function in Samba 3.0.4 and 3.0.7 and possibly
	other versions allows remote authenticated users to cause
	a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a SAMBA request
	that contains multiple SCOSA-2005.17.in SCOSA-2005.17.txt
	samba.pkg (wildcard) characters. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-0930 to this issue. 

	Buffer overflow in the QFILEPATHINFO request handler in Samba 
	3.0.x through 3.0.7 may allow remote attackers to execute 
	arbitrary code via a TRANSACT2_QFILEPATHINFO request with 
	a small "maximum data bytes" value. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-0882 to this issue. 

	Integer overflow in the Samba daemon (smbd) in Samba 2.x and 
	3.0.x through 3.0.9 allows remote authenticated users to cause 
	a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute 
	arbitrary code via a Samba request with a large number of 
	security descriptors that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2004-1154 to this issue.
