Subject: Re: Windows Server 2003 and XP SP2 LAND attack vulnerability


The attack seems to cause 100% cpu usage on my xp sp2 machines for about
20seconds.After this period of time they are instantly usable again. Note
that both my xp PCs are fully updated with the latest patches from
(bliah) microsoft.
