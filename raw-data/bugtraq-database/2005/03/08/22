Avaya is aware and currently investigating this issue.  Once our
investigation is complete we will release an Avaya Security Advisory to
address the outlined concerns.  In the interim, we've asked Mitre to
assign a Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) candidate number for
this issue.  They have assigned CAN-2005-0506:

Congruent with generally acceptable security practices, Avaya recommends
that customers restrict remote and local access to their systems to
reduce risks.  Alternatively, customers may choose not to utilize the
"Remember save password" feature in order to prevent a user's password
from being stored in the Windows registry.  

Please note the Avaya Product Security Support Team (PSST) takes the
security of Avaya products seriously.  We would like to develop a
relationship with our customers and the public to encourage them to
forward vulnerabilities to us.  Please send information regarding any
discovered security problems with Avaya products to
securityalerts[at]avaya.com.  I, or someone on the PSST, will work
directly to validate the problem and coordinate a response; including an
acknowledgement for working with us to help protect customers.
