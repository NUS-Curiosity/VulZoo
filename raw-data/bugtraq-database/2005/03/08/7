Hosting Controller is a complete array of Web hosting automation tools for
the Windows Server family platform.


(1)
the product have a feature which logs site updates and check this
periodically. this log is saved in a .CSv format and storage path
is in web-root of server. to name some of saved information in this CSV
file , bandwith report and disk usage report are written in "comment" filed.
as this is a general ( not domain specific ) log , reports of EVERY
HOSTED DOMAIN
on the server are logged here . so by reviewing this file , you can enumerate
all domain names that are hosted on this server .

There is a password recovery feature in Admin login page of Hosting Controller ,
which send back your password to registred e-mail address saved in system.
if you know the site domain name , and remove the .com/.net/.* part 
and submit it as the asked "login ID" , Hosting Controller will disclose the
hosting owners e-mail , which is not usually the one , mentioned in
site itself ;)
mix this bug with (1) and have fun :)
