OK,

 I run Microsoft Windows [Version 5.2.3790] aka Windows Server 2003.
 All service packs have been installed. I went to Windows Update, and
 nothing installed. Windows Firewall is off. 

 My linux box is a sarge installation of Debian, which is up to date.

Interesting ports on 192.168.0.100:
(The 1600 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
Port       State       Service
135/tcp    open        loc-srv
139/tcp    open        netbios-ssn


 The code I used is from here:
http://www.k-otik.com/exploits/20050307.windos.c.php

eight@...set-bitch:~/code$ sudo ./land-new 192.168.0.100 139
Packet sent. Remote machine should be down.

 The original land.c code didn't want to compile on my linux box.. so I saw this on a slashdot post, tested it, and it locks the machine up to 100% CPU for about 8-10 secs, then goes back to normal.

 I hope this helps.
