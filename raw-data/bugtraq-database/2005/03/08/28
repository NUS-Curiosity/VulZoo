I can replicate this using hping2 on a Linux 2.2.19 box targeting a Windows 
XP SP2 box (fully patched) with no firewall active on the same subnet. The 
packet sent has the SYN flag set (-S) and a spoofed source address (-a). The 
source and destination ports must be the same and open on the target 
machine. I tried ports 135, 139, 445, and 3389, and all of them raised the 
CPU usage of the System process to 100% for the duration of the attack and 
for about 10 seconds afterwards. The effect is quite dramatic, but the 
system isn't frozen per se. You can still interact with it, albeit very 
slowly. Task Manager responds updates its window appropriately, for 
instance, and you can send events to other applications.

One version of the command I used was (from a machine at 192.168.1.5):

hping2 192.168.1.1 -s 135 -p 135 -S -a 192.168.1.1

That should have the desired effect.
