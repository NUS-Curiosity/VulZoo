                Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated less package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:2404
Issue date:        2005-03-07
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=2404
CVE Names:         CAN-2005-0086
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated less package that fixes segmentation fault when viewing
binary files is now available.

The less utility is a text file browser that resembles more, but has
extended capabilities.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Victor Ashik discovered a heap based buffer overflow in less, caused by
a patch added to the less package in Red Hat Linux 9. An attacker could
construct a carefully crafted file that could cause less to crash or
possibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2005-0086 to this issue.

All users of the less package should upgrade to this updated package,
which resolves this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

You can verify each package with the following command:

     rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

     sha1sum <filename>
