Synopsis
========

rxvt-unicode is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

rxvt-unicode is a clone of the well known terminal emulator rxvt.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-terms/rxvt-unicode        < 5.3                        >= 5.3
                                                                 < 4.8

Description
===========

Rob Holland of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered that
rxvt-unicode fails to properly check input length.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running rxvt-unicode.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All rxvt-unicode users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-5.3"
