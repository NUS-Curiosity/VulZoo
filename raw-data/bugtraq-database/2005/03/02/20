Subject: iDEFENSE Labs Releases IDA Sync


An internal iDEFENSE Labs tool, IDA Sync, has been released as open
source and is available for download from:

	http://labs.idefense.com

IDA Sync was written to allow multiple analysts to synchronize their
reverse engineering efforts with IDA Pro in real time. Users connect to
a central server through the ida_sync plugin. Once connected, all
comments and name changes made with the registered hot keys are
immediately transmitted to all other users working on the same project.
The central server stores a copy of all changes as well, allowing new
analysts to jump on the project and immediately receive up to date
information.

Included in the source release is a C++ class providing IDA Pro plugin
developers with an abstracted asynchronous I/O interface.

Director, iDEFENSE Labs
