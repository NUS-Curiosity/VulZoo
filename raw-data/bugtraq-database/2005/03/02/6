Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.02.05: Computer Associates License Client/Server GCR Network Buffer Overflow


Computer Associates License Client/Server GCR Network Buffer Overflow 

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.02.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=214&type=vulnerabilities
March 2, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

The Computer Associates License Client/Server applications provide a 
method for CA products to register their licenses on the network. The 
License Client and Server are distributed with almost all CA software 
distributions. More information about Computer Associates software 
products is available from:

   http://www3.ca.com/Products/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Computer 
Associates License Server and License Client can allow attackers to 
execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to insufficient bounds 
checking on user-supplied values in GCR requests. The GCR request 
packet format is shown below:

A0 GCR HOSTNAME<DEVBOX>HARDWARE<001122334455>LOCALE<English> 
IDENT1<unknown>IDENT2<unknown>IDENT3<unknown>IDENT4<unknown> 
OS<Windows_NT 5.0>OLFFILE<0 0 0>SERVER<RMT>VERSION<3 1.54.0> 
NETWORK<127.0.0.1 HOSTNAME 255.255.255.0>MACHINE<PC_1586_1_3201> 
CHECKSUMS<1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12>RMTV<1.00><EOM>

If the IP address, hostname, or netmask contain large values, the stack 
overflow can be triggered.

Ollydbg output after SEH overwrite in CA License Server:

EAX 00630210 
ECX 7C91056D ntdll.7C91056D 
EDX 003B0608 
EBX 00E4E053 ASCII "GCR" 
ESP 00E2FC7C ASCII "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
EBP 00E4E050 ASCII "A0" 
ESI 00E2FD28 ASCII "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
EDI 00E4E057 ASCII "HOSTNAME<DEVBOX>HARDWARE<0011 
EIP DEADC0DE

SEH chain of thread 00000DA4, item 0 
Address=00E2FFA4 
SE handler=58585858

Log data, item 0 
Address=DEADC0DE 
Message=Access violation when executing [DEADC0DE]

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under 
the privileges of Local System. A GETCONFIG packet exchange which 
discloses the remote operating system version usually proceeds the GCR 
request and increases the likelihood of successful exploitation. The CA 
License Server does not run by default, but is packaged with most 
Computer Associates software distributions. The CA License Client does 
run by default and is packaged with almost all Computer Associates 
software.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed that CA License Server 0.1.0.15 and CA License 
Client 0.1.0.15 are vulnerable. 

V. WORKAROUND

Use a firewall to only allow trusted hosts to connect to the Computer 
Associates License Server and Client ports.
