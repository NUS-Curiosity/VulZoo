Subject: Re: Firefox Software Update


The update process have been activated this day. A reminder went to my
computer, saying that the mozilla firefox 1.0.1 is availiable and that
my version has to be updated.

It downloaded the entire installation file with the correct language
subset (fr_FR) and executed it.

sincerely.
