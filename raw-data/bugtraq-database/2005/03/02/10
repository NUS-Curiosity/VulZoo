Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.02.05: Computer Associates License Client and Server Invalid Command Buffer Overflow


Computer Associates License Client and Server Invalid Command Buffer
Overflow

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.02.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=210&type=vulnerabilities
March 2, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

The Computer Associates License Client/Server applications provide a 
method for CA products to register their licenses on the network. The 
License Client and Server are distributed with almost all CA software 
distributions. More information about Computer Associates software 
products is available from:

   http://www3.ca.com/Products/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Computer 
Associates International Inc. License Server and License Client can 
allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability specifically exists because of insufficient bounds 
checking on user-supplied values in requests with an invalid format. 
When a packet containing an overly long string which is not a valid 
command is received, the server uses that string to generate a log 
message without checking if the buffer that the message is being stored
in is large  enough. By sending a string over 2100 bytes long, it is
possible to  overwrite the saved instruction pointer, allowing execution
of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the
privileges of Local System (on Windows platforms) or root (on Linux 
platforms). The CA License Server does not run by default, but is 
packaged with most Computer Associates software distributions. The CA 
License Client does run by default and is packaged with almost all CA 
software.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed that CA License Server 0.1.0.15 and CA License 
Client 0.1.0.15 are vulnerable. It is suspected that most CA products 
are running vulnerable versions of the client and/or server.

V. WORKAROUND

Use a firewall to only allow trusted hosts to connect to the Computer 
Associates License Server and Client ports.
