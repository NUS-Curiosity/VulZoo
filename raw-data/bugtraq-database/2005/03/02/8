Computer Associates License Client PUTOLF Directory Traversal

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.02.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=212&type=vulnerabilities
March 2, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

The Computer Associates License Client/Server applications provide a 
method for CA products to register their licenses on the network. The 
License Client and Server are distributed with almost all CA software 
distributions. More information about Computer Associates software 
products is available from:

   http://www3.ca.com/Products/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a directory traversal vulnerability in Computer 
Associates International Inc. License Client can allow attackers create 
files in arbitrary locations.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the handling of the filename 
used in PUTOLF requests. A PUTOLF request looks something like this:

A0 PUTOLF 1 H A 10 name 2700 Test Data Goes Here<EOM>

By sending a name containing "../../../../" as a prefix, the file is 
created 4 directories below where it ordinarily would. The file created 
has ".olf" added on the end, and has the contents "Test Data Goes Here".

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the
privileges of Local System (on Windows platforms) or root (on Linux 
platforms). The CA License Client runs by default and is packaged with 
almost all CA software.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed that CA License Client 0.1.0.15 is vulnerable. It
is suspected that most CA products are running vulnerable versions of 
the client and/or server.

V. WORKAROUND

Use a firewall to only allow trusted hosts to connect to the Computer 
Associates License Server and Client ports.
