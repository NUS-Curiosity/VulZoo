Subject: Wide-scale industrial espionage using Trojan horses in Israel


Apparently, a Trojan horse was developed for three major private
investigators companies in Israel, and later used for industrial
espionage with some of the biggest corporations in Israel.

Aside to the technical side of this attack and the extreme wide-scale of
it, another interesting aspect is the use of social engineering.

>From one description I heard a woman called a certain individual at one
of the companies with a business offer, and later on sent him a
presentation via email. When that presentation did not work she
proceeded to send him a CD, which did not work either.

You can find an article in English detailing some of the events here:

This is not the first time this happens, and not the first time we've
seen industrial espionage in IL, or private investigator companies
developing their technological and operational capabilities. I've
personally been approached about such a job twice in the past 2 years.

Thanks,
