Package description:

  Binutils is a collection of utilities necessary for compiling programs. It
  includes the assembler and linker, as well as a number of other
  miscellaneous programs for dealing with executable formats.
  
  
Problem description:

  Tavis Ormandy found an integer overflow in the Binary File Descriptor
  (BFD) parser in the GNU debugger. The same vulnerable code is also
  present in binutils. By tricking an user into processing a specially
  crafted executable with the binutils tools (strings, objdump, nm,
  readelf, etc.), an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running the affected
  program.
  
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2005-1704 to this issue.
