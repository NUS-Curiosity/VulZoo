Synopsis
========

The Oops! proxy server contains a remotely exploitable format string
vulnerability, which could potentially lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Oops! is an advanced, multithreaded caching web proxy.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /       Vulnerable       /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-proxy/oops     < 1.5.24_pre20050503     >= 1.5.24_pre20050503

Description
===========

A format string flaw has been detected in the my_xlog() function of the
Oops! proxy, which is called by the passwd_mysql and passwd_pgsql
module's auth() functions.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request to the
Oops! proxy, potentially triggering this vulnerability and leading to
the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Oops! users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/oops-1.5.24_pre20050503"
