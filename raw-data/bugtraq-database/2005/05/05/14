Description

Every user with CREATE JOB privilege can switch the SESSION_USER to SYS by executing a database job via dbms_scheduler. This could cause problems with VPD (virtual private database) or OLS (Oracle label security) and could allow privilege escalation.

This issue is not related to the Oracle Critical Patch Update 2005.
