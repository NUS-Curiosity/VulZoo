Synopsis
========

gzip contains multiple vulnerabilities potentially allowing an attacker
to execute arbitrary commands.

Background
==========

gzip (GNU zip) is a popular compression program. The included zgrep
utility allows you to grep gzipped files in place.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/gzip     < 1.3.5-r6                          >= 1.3.5-r6

Description
===========

The gzip and gunzip programs are vulnerable to a race condition when
setting file permissions (CAN-2005-0988), as well as improper handling
of filename restoration (CAN-2005-1228). The zgrep utility improperly
sanitizes arguments, which may come from an untrusted source
(CAN-2005-0758).

Impact
======

These vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary command execution, changing
the permissions of arbitrary files, and installation of files to an
aribitrary location in the filesystem.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All gzip users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/gzip-1.3.5-r6"
