On April 13, 2005, Diabolic Crab reported several vulnerabilities in phpBB 
Plus and other modules. From the post:

: Photo Album v2.0.53
:
: http://localhost/album_search.php?mode='SQL_INJECTION&search=dcrab
: SQL INJECTION

Looking at the vendor site [1], you can download the 2.0.53 version of 
this module (album_v2053.zip) and browse the files included. There is no 
"album_search.php" in it. This was confirmed by Smartor (the vendor) on 
May 22, 2005.
