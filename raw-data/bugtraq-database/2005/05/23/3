Subject: Computer Associates Vet Antivirus Library Remote
	Heap Overflow


Date
May 23, 2005

Vulnerability
Computer Associates Vet library provides antivirus scan engine capabilities. Vet scan engines allow products to analyze various streams for malware. Vet is vulnerable to an integer wrap during the analysis of an OLE stream. The integer wrap causes an arbitrary heap overflow with no character restrictions allowing remote attackers control of the system(s) Vet is protecting. 

Specifically, within decompressed VBA directories project name records have a 32 bit length value which is incremented for a null byte. It is then used as an allocation length. Given a project name length of -1 Vet increments it and calls new(0), which allocates a small chunk. The small chunk is used for the destination of a copy with a negative length. The negative length is discarded for an attacker controlled length below 4096 before the copy.

Impact
Successful exploitation of protected systems allows attackers unauthorized control of data and privileges. It also provides leverage for further network compromise. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely through common protocols, such as SMTP, FTP, SMB, etc. It can be triggered without authentication or user interaction and allows multiple exploitation attempts. Vet implementations are likely vulnerable in their default configuration.
