Subject: [FLSA-2005:152856] Updated sudo packages fix security issue

---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated sudo packages fix security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152856
Issue date:        2005-05-12
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-1051
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated sudo packages that fix a security issue are now available.

Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain
users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands
as root while logging all commands and arguments.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

A flaw in exists in sudo's environment sanitizing prior to sudo version
1.6.8p2 that could allow a malicious user with permission to run a shell
script that utilized the bash shell to run arbitrary commands. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-1051 to this issue.

Users of sudo are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which
contain a patch correcting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
