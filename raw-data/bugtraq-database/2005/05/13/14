I failed to crash any of my test machines too. my laptop, a test server and 
two other workstations core dumped but no crashes.

pax+gesecurity boxes also report "[+] phase 2, <RET> to crash Killed", but 
also no log entries show up about segmentation violations.

I assume that, if the tool doesn't generate the core dump, it isn't calling 
the bugged kernel function, is that right?
