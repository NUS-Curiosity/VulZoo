               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated libtiff packages fix security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152815
Issue date:        2005-05-18
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0803 CAN-2004-0804 CAN-2004-0886

1. Topic:

Updated libtiff packages that fix various buffer and integer overflows
are now available.

The libtiff package contains a library of functions for manipulating
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

During a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered a number of integer
overflow bugs that affect libtiff. An attacker who has the ability to
trick a user into opening a malicious TIFF file could cause the
application linked to libtiff to crash or possibly execute arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CAN-2004-0886 and CAN-2004-0804 to these issues.

Additionally, a number of buffer overflow bugs that affect libtiff have
been found. An attacker who has the ability to trick a user into opening
a malicious TIFF file could cause the application linked to libtiff to
crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0803 to
this issue.

iDEFENSE has reported an integer overflow bug that affects libtiff. An
attacker who has the ability to trick a user into opening a malicious
TIFF file could cause the application linked to libtiff to crash or
possibly execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1308 to
this issue.

Dmitry V. Levin reported another integer overflow in the tiffdump
utility. An atacker who has the ability to trick a user into opening a
malicious TIFF file with tiffdump could possibly execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-1183 to this issue.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported fixes for these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
