Synopsis
========

Cheetah contains a vulnerability in the module importing code that can
allow a local user to gain escalated privileges.

Background
==========

Cheetah is a Python powered template engine and code generator.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-python/cheetah     < 0.9.17-rc1                 >= 0.9.17-rc1

Description
===========

Brian Bird discovered that Cheetah searches for modules in the
world-writable /tmp directory.

Impact
======

A malicious local user could place a module containing arbitrary code
in /tmp, which when imported would run with escalated privileges.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cheetah users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-python/cheetah-0.9.17-rc1"
