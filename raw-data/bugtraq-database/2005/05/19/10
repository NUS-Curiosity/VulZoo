Subject: RE: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook


Microsoft Outlook uses HTML to display its messages, this is just a feature 
of that. No different than setting up link redirection and hiding the 
ultimate destination on a webpage. Additionally it is simliar to having the 
alternate text, address and extra info about a link modified in the status 
bar of a browser.

I see no security problem here, and if you feel like avoiding this problem 
completely just disable theh display of HTML code in the messages you 
recieve with Microsoft Outlook.
