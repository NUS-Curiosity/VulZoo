Subject: RE: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook


Outlook does that when composing an email in HTML format, where you can have
any name associated to a link with a <a href> tag.

The example you give is something like <a href="http://www.cybertrion.com">
http://www.foo-labs.info</a>

Subject: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook

An issue has been discovered in MS Outlook (All
Versions) where anyone can fake a URL & send it
across.

How does it work:

Lets compose an email in MS Outlook, lets type


http://www.cybertrion.com & put a space after it to
make it a link. Now put your cursor just before
cybertrion & type any URL for eg: 
http://www.foo-labs.info now send it to anyone. The
receiver will see the URL as http://www.foo-labs.info
but when he clicks on it it will directly take him to
http://www.cybertrion.com

I am not sure how critical this is but it can fool
alot of people & result in download of a virus.
