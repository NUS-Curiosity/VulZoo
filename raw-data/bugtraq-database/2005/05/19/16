I must be missing something here.  When I create an email with outlook with
http://www.cybertrion.com<sp> and then arrow back to in front of cybertrion and enter
http://www.foo-labs.info my url ends up looking like
http://www.http://www.foo-labs.infocybertrion.com and that is what get's sent and received by the
recipient.  I'm apparently not doing this correctly or maybe it's in the way you have your Outlook
editing set up.

| How does it work:
|
| Lets compose an email in MS Outlook, lets type
|
|
| http://www.cybertrion.com & put a space after it to
| make it a link. Now put your cursor just before
| cybertrion & type any URL for eg:
| http://www.foo-labs.info now send it to anyone. The
| receiver will see the URL as http://www.foo-labs.info
| but when he clicks on it it will directly take him to
| http://www.cybertrion.com
|
| I am not sure how critical this is but it can fool
| alot of people & result in download of a virus.
