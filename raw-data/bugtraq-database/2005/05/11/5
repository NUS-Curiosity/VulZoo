Subject: BakBone NetVault last warning


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
 
As a recall, there is now two months, the Hat-Squad has published 2
high security risks still UNPATCHED for BakBone NetVault 6.x/7.x all
versions. In an Open Letter:

http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=67723&p=irol-newsArticle&t=Regular&id=704547&

Bakbone announce a new NetVault Q4 2005, and a new MACOSX version. My
suggestion to BakBone is to review their whole code because Im aware
that another Heap overflow has been found by a friend without to be
published.

We won't republish this warning as soon as BakBone choosed to wake up,
but we recommand to assest BakBone products if you are seeking for
security bugs, this is a nice peace of cheese.
