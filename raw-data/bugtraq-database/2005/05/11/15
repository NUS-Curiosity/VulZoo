Subject: Which is the best anti-spyware cleaner?


That is just what I was wondering -- from a community perspective.  We've 
been running a survey and after 5,414 unique votes, the tally is in:

Source:

http://castlecops.com/modules.php?name=Surveys&op=results&pollID=30

1) Lavasoft Ad-Aware SE Personal 25.36%
2) Spybot Search & Destroy 22.42%
3) Microsoft AntiSpyware 14.79%

This is from a list of 19 choices:

 Adware Away 
 Aluria Spyware Eliminator 
 Intermute SpySubtract 
 Lavasoft Ad-Aware SE Personal 
 McAfee AntiSpyware 
 Microsoft AntiSpyware 
 NoAdware 
 OmniQuad AntiSpy 
 PC Tools Spyware Doctor 
 Pest Patrol 
 Spybot Search & Destroy 
 Spycop 
 Spyware COP 
 Sunbelt CounterSpy 
 Tenebril SpyCatcher 
 Webroot Spy Sweeper 
 Xblock X-Cleaner 
 XoftSpy 
 ZeroSpyware

This is very interesting for Lavasoft.  Our previous poll with 2,605 
unique votes on:

"Do you trust Lavasoft's Ad-Aware after they delisted WhenU as Spyware?"

Shows 60.31% said "No".

The WhenU/Lavasoft survey ran right after WhenU was removed from their 
dictionaries.  But we all know what happened afterwards.  Since then, 
folks still trust Lavasoft as their number one choice.

What is not surprising are the results from the Aluria survey we also ran, 
with 1,777 unique votes:

"Do you trust Aluria's Spyware Eliminator after the WhenU Deal?"

http://castlecops.com/modules.php?name=Surveys&op=results&pollID=28

86.04% said "No".  In our head-to-head survey above, 1.07% of voters 
picked Aluria as "the best".  

Internet users still opt for Lavasoft's free spyware cleaner.
