This can fool people but it's not a bug in my opinion.  It's the same as

<html>
<body>
<a href=http://google.com>http://yahoo.com</a>
</body>
</html>

You can also achieve this by typing a url and right clicking it then by
clicking edit hyperlink, then you can change the values to mask it.  So
this is not a bug just a feature that can be used to trick users.

Subject: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook

An issue has been discovered in MS Outlook (All
Versions) where anyone can fake a URL & send it
across.

How does it work:

Lets compose an email in MS Outlook, lets type


http://www.cybertrion.com & put a space after it to
make it a link. Now put your cursor just before
cybertrion & type any URL for eg: 
http://www.foo-labs.info now send it to anyone. The
receiver will see the URL as http://www.foo-labs.info
but when he clicks on it it will directly take him to
http://www.cybertrion.com

I am not sure how critical this is but it can fool
alot of people & result in download of a virus.
