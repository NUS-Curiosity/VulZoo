Subject: RE: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook


This is very unclear. Which version of Outlook? Plain text, HTML, or Rich text? Fully patched? I've tried it using Outlook 2002 with plain text and with HTML and I always end up getting emails that look like:

http://www.http://www.foo-labs.infocybertrion.com

Subject: Security issue in Microsoft Outlook

An issue has been discovered in MS Outlook (AllVersions) where anyone can fake a URL & send it across.

How does it work:

Lets compose an email in MS Outlook, lets type

http://www.cybertrion.com & put a space after it to make it a link. Now put your cursor just before cybertrion & type any URL for eg: http://www.foo-labs.info now send it to anyone. The receiver will see the URL as http://www.foo-labs.info but when he clicks on it it will directly take him to http://www.cybertrion.com

I am not sure how critical this is but it can fool alot of people & result in download of a virus.  For more details and Discovered by:
