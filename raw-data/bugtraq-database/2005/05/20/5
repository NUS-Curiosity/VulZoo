Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU debugger,
potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

gdb is the GNU project's debugger, facilitating the analysis and
debugging of applications. The BFD library provides a uniform method of
accessing a variety of object file formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-devel/gdb      < 6.3-r3                             >= 6.3-r3

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered an
integer overflow in the BFD library, resulting in a heap overflow. A
review also showed that by default, gdb insecurely sources
initialisation files from the working directory.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation would result in the execution of arbitrary code
on loading a specially crafted object file or the execution of
arbitrary commands.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All gdb users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/gdb-6.3-r3"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
