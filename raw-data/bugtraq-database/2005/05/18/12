The newly-made available Yahoo! Messenger 7.0 beta build 224 also stores the same information in clear-text as 5.x - 6.0 versions do when the Logfile is enabled (tested on Windows only). Yahoo! Messenger 7.0 was just made available several hours ago in a beta form. Hopefully later builds won't have this 'feature' altogether.
