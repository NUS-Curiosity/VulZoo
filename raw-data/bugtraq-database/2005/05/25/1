Zone Labs Security Alert
Zone Labs Anti-virus Engine OLE Processing Issue

Date Published          May 24, 2005
Date Last Revised       May 24, 2005

Severity                High


Overview
========

A security vulnerability existed in the anti-virus engine of specific
versions of ZoneAlarm Anti-Virus and ZoneAlarm Security Suite 
(ZoneAlarm and ZoneAlarm Pro are not affected.)

The vulnerability was caused due to an integer overflow in the Vet 
anti-virus engine (VetE.dll) when analyzing OLE streams. This can be 
exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially 
crafted Microsoft Office document.

Zone Labs has released an updated anti-virus engine for affected 
products which is automatically applied during the next anti-virus 
update, which typically occurs daily.  Customers may also manually 
update their anti-virus service for immediate protection.

Zone Labs remains committed to providing our customers with advanced 
Internet security technologies for PC protection.


Impact
======

If successfully exploited, a skilled attacker could cause the 
firewall to stop processing traffic, execute arbitrary code, or 
elevate malicious code's privileges.

Zone Labs recommends affected users update their anti-virus engine 
and definitions to the current versions which address the issue.
 
Affected Products
    * ZoneAlarm Anti-virus and ZoneAlarm Security Suite

Unaffected Products
    * ZoneAlarm and ZoneAlarm Pro
    * Check Point Integrity clients and Integrity Server 
    * Integrity Clientless Security products


Description
===========

ZoneAlarm Anti-Virus and ZoneAlarm Security Suite use the Vet engine 
from Computer Associates for anti-virus detection.  Due to an 
integer wrap issue in the code associated with OLE processing, a 
heap overflow may occur which could potentially allow a skilled
attacker 
to cause the firewall to stop processing traffic or execute arbitrary
code. 


Recommended Actions
===================

ZoneAlarm Anti-virus and ZoneAlarm Security Suite users should 
upgrade the anti-virus engine to version 11.9.1 or later.

To update your ZoneAlarm Anti-virus or Security Suite product:

    1. Select Antivirus

    2. In the Status area, choose the Update Now option

    3. Select Overview | Product Info and verify that the Antivirus
       Vet engine version is 11.9.1 or higher
