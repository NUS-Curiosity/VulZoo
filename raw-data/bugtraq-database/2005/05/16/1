Subject: Postnuke 0.750 - 0.760rc4 local file inclusion


Product : Postnuke 0.750 (http://www.postnuke.com)
Description: Postnuke 0.750 - 0.760rc4 local file inclusion
Severity: High

Description
===========
Postnuke is Web Content Management System written in PHP and using mysql
as database backend.

Detail
======

Directory traversal in function pnModFunc
-----------------------------------------

We have found serious vulnerability which allow any user to view/include  
local file in function pnModFunc. This is due to lack of error checking in  
function pnModFunc when user supply func through index.php. func variable  
will sanitize using pnVarCleanFromInput which will remove any slashes  
before pass to pnModFunc in index.php. This make nullbyte poisoning  
possible. With the help from pnlang directory in Blocks module this  
vulnerability is very easy to exploit. Remote code execution also possible  
with help of 3rd party module which allow image upload or through  
accesible apache log file.

--pnMod.php--
     } else {
     if(file_exists("modules/$modname/pn$type/$func.php"))
	{

		require_once("modules/$modname/pn$type/$func.php");<-- THE PROBLEM

         return $modfunc($args);
	}
