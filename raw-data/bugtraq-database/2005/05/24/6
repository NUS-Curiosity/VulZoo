ASPR #2005-05-24-1: HTML Injection in BEA WebLogic Server Console (1)
=========================================================================

Document ID:     ASPR #2005-05-24-1-PUB
Vendor:          BEA Systems (http://www.bea.com)
Target:          WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express, Service Pack 4
Impact:          An HTML injection vulnerability exists in WebLogic
                 Server Console, enabling attackers to hijack
                 administrative sessions using cross site scripting
Severity:        High
Status:          Official patch available, workarounds available
Discovered by:   Mitja Kolsek of ACROS Security

Summary
=======

There is an HTML Injection vulnerability in WebLogic Server and WebLogic 
Express Server Console that allows the attacker to assume administrator's 
identity and thus gain administrative access to Server Console. It is 
possible to craft such URL that will, when requested from WebLogic server, 
return a document with arbitrarily chosen HTML injected. An obvious 
(mis)use for this type of vulnerability is cross-site scripting that can 
be used, among other things, for obtaining administrative session cookies 
from WebLogic administrators. These cookies, when stolen, provide the 
attacker with administrative access to WebLogic Server Console, 
compromising the security of entire web server.


Product Coverage
================

- WebLogic Server 8.1, Service Pack 4 - affected
- WebLogic Express 7.0, Service Pack 6 - affected

Older versions are likely to be affected as well.


Analysis
========

Cross site scripting is a very common problem with web-based applications.
Basically it is present whenever the server is willing to include user's
input data, which contains some client-side script (e.g. JavaScript), back
to the browser unsanitized, somewhere within the generated web page. This
script, when executed, has access to all information within and about the
received web page, including the cookies. 

WebLogic Server Console employs an ADMINCONSOLESESSION session cookie for 
administrative session maintenance. After administrator's initial 
connection to the Server Console, WebLogic server generates a unique 
session identifier (session ID) and sends it to administrator's browser as 
a cookie named ADMINCONSOLESESSION. This session ID effectively becomes a 
static password for the session, meaning that until the session times out 
or is closed by the logged in administrator (by logging off), any browser 
with access to port 7001/7002 of WebLogic server and knowledge of the 
session ID will have access to this session, and thereby access to 
administration of WebLogic application server.


Mitigating Factors
==================

1) Attacker must lure the WebLogic administrator into visiting a hostile
   web site while he (admin) has an authenticated session with the
   WebLogic Server Console.


Solution
========

BEA Systems has issued a security bulletin [1] and published a patch
which fixes this issue.


Workaround
==========

- Don't browse around or read HTML e-mail while administering WebLogic
  server. 
- Always close all browser instances/windows before logging in to
  WebLogic Server Console.
