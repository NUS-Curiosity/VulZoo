Ipswitch IMail IMAP LOGIN Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 05.24.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=243&type=vulnerabilities
May 24, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

Ipswitch Collaboration Suite (ICS) is a comprehensive communication and 
collaboration solution for Microsoft Windows with a customer base of 
over 53 million users. More information is available on the vendor's 
website:

     http://www.ipswitch.com/products/IMail_Server/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of several buffer overflow vulnerabilities in 
Ipswitch Inc.'s Imail IMAP server allows attackers to execute arbitrary 
code with System privileges. 

The first vulnerability specifically exists in the handling of a long 
username to the LOGIN command. A long username argument of approximately

2,000 bytes will cause a stack based unicode string buffer overflow 
providing the attacker with partial control over EIP. As this 
vulnerability is in the LOGIN command itself, valid credentials are not 
required. 

The second vulnerability also exists in the handling of the LOGIN 
command username argument, however it lends itself to easier 
exploitation. If a large username starting with one of several special 
characters is specified, a stack overflow occurs, allowing an attacker 
to overwrite the saved instruction pointer and control execution flow. 
Included in the list of special characters are the following: % : * @ & 

Both of these vulnerabilities can lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary 
code with System privileges. Valid credentials are not required to for 
exploitation, which heightens the impact of this vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the latest

version of Ipswitch IMAIL, version 8.13. Version 8.12 is also confirmed 
as vulnerable. It is suspected that earlier versions are also 
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

As this vulnerability is exploited before authentication occurs, the 
only effective workaround is to limit access to the IMAP server by 
filtering TCP port 143. If possible, consider disabling IMAP and forcing

users to use POP3.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor has released the following patch to fix this vulnerability:
