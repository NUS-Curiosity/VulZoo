ASPR #2005-05-24-2: HTML Injection in BEA WebLogic Server Console (2)
=========================================================================

Document ID:     ASPR #2005-05-24-2-PUB
Vendor:          BEA Systems (http://www.bea.com)
Target:          WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express, Service Pack 4
Impact:          An HTML injection vulnerability exists in WebLogic
                 Server Console, enabling attackers to hijack
                 administrative sessions using cross site scripting
Severity:        High
Status:          Official patch available, workarounds available
Discovered by:   Mitja Kolsek of ACROS Security

Current version 
   http://www.acrossecurity.com/aspr/ASPR-2005-05-24-2-PUB.txt


Summary
=======

There is a vulnerability in WebLogic Server Console login page that 
allows the attacker to assume administrator's identity and thus gain 
administrative access to Server Console. It is possible to inject 
malicious JavaScript in the login page so that when administrator logs in,
his username and password are silently transmitted to attacker's web 
server.


Product Coverage
================

- WebLogic Server 8.1, Service Pack 4 - affected
- WebLogic Server 7.0, Service Pack 2 - not affected
- WebLogic Express 7.0, Service Pack 6 - affected

Older versions are likely to be affected as well.


Analysis
========

Cross site scripting is a very common problem with web-based applications.
Basically it is present whenever the server is willing to include user's
input data, which contains some client-side script (e.g. JavaScript), back
to the browser unsanitized, somewhere within the generated web page. This
script, when executed, has access to all information within and about the
received web page, including the cookies. 

The main differentiator of this particular vulnerability is that the 
attacker need not trick the administrator into visiting a malicious web 
site while being in an administrative session. Furthermore, in contrast to 
other cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, this vulnerability allows the 
attacker to also obtain administrator's username and password - and not 
"only" his session identifier (ADMINCONSOLESESSION).


Solution
========

BEA Systems has issued a security bulletin [1] and published a patch
which fixes this issue.


Workaround
==========

- Always close all browser instances/windows and delete all cookies before
  logging in to WebLogic Server Console.
