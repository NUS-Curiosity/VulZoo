An attacker needs to either trick the admin to visit some web page, or
modify the response of any web server the admin ever connects to (e.g.,
Google). What's important is that he can do this any time _before_ the admin
logs in to WebLogic console, not during an already active administration
session. This makes the attack very easy, at least from my pen-testing
perspective.

Sorry for the delay in replying.
