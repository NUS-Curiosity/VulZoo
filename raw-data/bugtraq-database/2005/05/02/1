1. Description:

Vendor's Description:

"Video Cam Server (VCS) is a server for publishing the image taken from
a Video Camera (especially Web Cam) connected to it. It will be very
useful for remote monitoring your home, office or other environment."

2. The bugs:
-------------

The bugs are located into the built-in webserver.
By default no HTTP Authentication is set so a malicious user can:

i.
     (path disclosure) know the remote current path, by sending an
     http request for an unavailable page.

ii.
     (directory traversal) go out the document root assigned to the
     webserver by using common malicious patterns like: ".." into
     http requests, and see/download all the files available on the
     remote system.

iii.
     (denial of service) shutdown http-server and/or camera, by using
     admin's control page that it's not properly managed.


NOTE:

Reported vulnerabilities are also valid if the HTTP Authentication is
set, but in this case the malicious user must obtain login information.

-------------
3. The code:
-------------

To test the vulnerabilities:

i.
    http://[host]/%20


ii.
    http://[host]/..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\windows\system.ini

    or connect to the webserver and send a raw request like:

    GET /../../../../../../../../../../../windows/system.ini HTTP/1.1


iii.
    http://[host]/admin.html

4. The fix:
------------

Vendor has been notified.
Bugs will be probably fixed in the next release.
