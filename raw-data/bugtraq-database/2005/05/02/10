Subject: Regions bank phishing scam


Forgive me if this is not the best place to foward this report.
   Today, April 29, I received a Regions online banking ("RegionsNET") 
e-mail phishing scam  attempt.  The "scam site" was still active prior 
to this mailing.  I have included the e-mail I received and removed my 
e-mail addresses and session IDs from the header.  This e-mail was sent 
to phishing@...ions.com and bugtraq@...urityfocus.com .

Regards,

Ryan
