Synopsis
========

phpBB is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack that could allow
arbitrary scripting code execution.

Background
==========

phpBB is an Open Source bulletin board package.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/phpBB      < 2.0.15                            >= 2.0.15

Description
===========

phpBB is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability due to
improper sanitization of user supplied input. Coupled with poor
validation of BBCode URLs which may be included in a forum post, an
unsuspecting user may follow a posted link triggering the
vulnerability.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could cause arbitrary
scripting code to be executed in the browser of a user.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpBB users should upgrade to the latest version:

    emerge --sync
    emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/phpbb-2.0.15"
