Subject: CAIF 1.2 released


Dear all,

for your information:

The Common Announcement Interchange Format (CAIF) specification version

DTD:

Besides some normalization work in the design of the elements some new
general features have been introduced.  

Overview:

The draft describes an XML-based format for security announcements.  It
defines a basic but comprehensive set of elements that is designed to
describe the main aspects of issues related to security.  Besides
addressing more than one issue or problem within a single document the
format allows to provide information for more than one target group of
readers as well as multi-lingual textual descriptions.  It can be used
to selectively produce different renderings of an announcement for the
intended target groups, addressing one, a sub-set, or all problems in
one or multiple languages.  The set of pre-defined elements can be
extended to reflect either temporary, exotic or new requirements on a
per-document basis.  A special markup element allows to include
information for specific constituencies that can be removed before a
document is distributed.  Distriburion can be limited to one or a set of
defined constituencies.  CAIF documents may contain data that allow
the manual or automatic determination of the affectedness of systems by
a specific problem, e.g. OVAL definitions.  References within the CAIF
document can be used to interlink this data with other information thus
allow for the selective production of renderings adressing affected
systems.
