Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2005-0021

Package name:      squid
Summary:           ACL bypass
Date:              2005-05-10
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

Package description:
  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
  supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
  caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
  non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
  hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
  DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.


Problem description:
  Squid 2.5.STABLE9 and earlier does not trigger a fatal error when it
  identifies missing or invalid ACLs in the http_access configuration,
  which could lead to less restrictive ACLs than intended by the
  administrator.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2005-1345 to this issue.
