Subject: TCP/IP implementations do not adequately validate ICMP error messages


Hi,

I was playing around with the ICMP error messages DOS attack (I found an 
exploit on securityfocus.org bid 13214), and I noticed the following 
work around:

when I add the following rule to iptables, the linux server (Kernel 
2.4.29-grsec) is no longer vulnerable to the DOS:
iptables -I INPUT 1 -p icmp -j DROP

I am interested in knowing if this work around makes any sense. Please 
keep me informed about this vulnerability.

Thank you,
Alok.
