Product Description:

RaidenFTPD is an easy-to-use ftp server software for
Windowsï¿½. With this handy tool you can share your
files with friends, provide file download services to
customers or even setup your own private network file
server. Not only are all the basic FTP server features
built-in; it also features various advanced features

Problem: 

Directory Traversal - Failure to validate input for
the site command 'urlget'. 

Using urlget it's possible for a normal user to escape
ftproot and download known files from restricted
directories.

The JohnLong Team acted promptly to resolve the issue.
