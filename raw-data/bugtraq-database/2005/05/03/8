Subject: tHorK FrameWork Beta v0.1::: another exploit framework




tHork FrameWork is an exploit framework that allows you to put all the exploits you want/have in a repertory in order to access them (with a search engine) whenever and wherever you want.

tHork is under GPL license and was programed in python. tHork FrameWork is a whole of "small" CGI script needing a server. For the server, i advise you to use karrigell (a python server) with which i develop tHorK FrameWork. Karrigell can be found here: http://karrigell.sourceforge.net/en/front.htm. 

After downloading and installing Karrigell, put the /cgi-bin/ and /exploits/ (of tHorK archive) directories in the root directory (of Karrigell). Now you can take your favorite browser to use tHorK FrameWork by going to http;//127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/.

tHorK FrameWork looks like a web site (that's why it can be easily  used like a service on a web site  if you wanna share your exploits, with apache+mod_python for exemple).

To see how tHorK FrameWork work, go there : http://nzeka-labs.com/Projects/thork.htm. 

With the first beta version, only 130 exploits are available. I hope more 500/600 exploits will be available for the next tHorK FrameWork's version. For the first version, tHorK is only a exploits database, the next version will be more powerfull and usefull.  

I hope tHorK FrameWork will be helpfull to people (like me) who own an important exploits collection and who want to have a tool which manages the classification of their exploits and provide an easy search into the exploits repertory.
