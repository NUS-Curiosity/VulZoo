Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor published a patch for ServiceDesk Plus with service pack 11010.

It is recommended to install the patch with the included patcher. An in-depth
security analysis performed by security professionals is highly advised, as the
software may be affected from further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2020-6843)
A parameter of the module called "geti18nkey" reflects unfiltered user input if
it is changed. The corresponding request is frequently sent in the background
if a pre-configured network scan was started.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2020-6843)
To reproduce the issue visit this URL authenticated as administrator:
http://$IP:8080/CustomReportHandler.do?module=geti18nkey&key=<img%20src%20onerror%3dalert(1)>

How the parameter was found:
1) Authenticate as administrator and add an IP range in Admin -> Networkscan.
2) Click the "play" button next to the created IP range to start the scan.
3) To check the status of a started network scan frequent requests like
   "http://$IP:8080/CustomReportHandler.do?module=geti18nkey&key=sdp.admin.network.listview.discoverystatus.scanned&sdpcsrfparam=<%someUUID%>"
   are sent to the server.
4) The value of the "key" parameter will be reflected if you change a single character.
   The "sdpcsrfparam" isn't needed in order to trigger the XSS.
5) XSS can thus be exploited by calling
   "http://$IP:8080/CustomReportHandler.do?module=geti18nkey&key=<img%20src%20onerror%3dalert(1)>"


Vulnerable / tested versions:
