Package        : evince
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-1000159 CVE-2019-11459 CVE-2019-1010006
Debian Bug     : 927820

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in evince, a simple multi-page
document viewer.

CVE-2017-1000159

    Tobias Mueller reported that the DVI exporter in evince is
    susceptible to a command injection vulnerability via specially
    crafted filenames.

CVE-2019-11459

    Andy Nguyen reported that the tiff_document_render() and
    tiff_document_get_thumbnail() functions in the TIFF document backend
    did not handle errors from TIFFReadRGBAImageOriented(), leading to
    disclosure of uninitialized memory when processing TIFF image files.

CVE-2019-1010006

    A buffer overflow vulnerability in the tiff backend could lead to
    denial of service, or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if
    a specially crafted PDF file is opened.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.22.1-3+deb9u2.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.30.2-3+deb10u1. The stable distribution is only affected by
CVE-2019-11459.

We recommend that you upgrade your evince packages.
