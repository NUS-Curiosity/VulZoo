** What is No cON Name **

This congress is aimed at system and network administrators, programmers,
experts and/or security auditors, and also independent self-taught computer
security experts.

All of them with the same objective: to share and understand new and
different systems that currently shape the global networks.

Their common motivation is curiosity and the need to read again the
information already seen about the field of computer security. After the
improvements and modifications of a quest for perfection in a promising
field, we think it's very important to understand all the new information
that accumulates day by day.

In a society that depends mora and more on computer networks, information
security becomes of great importance for thousands of companies and people.
If we analyze the complexity of a computer system, wether it is a help
resort or a work tool for these professionals, we easily get to the
conclusion that, when the market requirement increases, these professionals
work tools get affected, what turns into a basic need, improve before the
competitors.
