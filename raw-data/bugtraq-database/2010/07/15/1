-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Secure Backup. User interaction is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the parsing of commands sent to the
obscheduled.exe service listening by default on TCP port 1026, or 1027.
Due to a lack of bounds checking on a specific command sequence the
program stack can be overwritten with user controlled data. Successful
exploitation can lead to remote system compromise under the SYSTEM
credentials.

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
