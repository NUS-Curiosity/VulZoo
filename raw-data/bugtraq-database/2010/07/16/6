http://www.majorsecurity.net/conpresso_cms_xss.php

Affected Products:
=============
Conpresso CMS v4.1
Prior versions may also be vulnerable

Description
=============
"Conpresso CMS v4.1 is a web based content management system."

More Details
=============

We at MajorSecurity have discovered some vulnerabilities in Conpresso CMS v4.1.1, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks. Input passed via the "rubric" and "q" parameters to mod_search/index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
Successful exploitation requires that "mod_search" is enabled in the application.
Solution
=============
The vendor released a patch which fixes the issues. Download version 4.1.2 to make sure your conpresso cms installation is secured. We would like to thank Thomas Walter of the Conpresso CMS development team for the professional communication.
