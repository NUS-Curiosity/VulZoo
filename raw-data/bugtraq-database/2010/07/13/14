I. BACKGROUND
---------------------

"Winamp is a proprietary media player for Windows-based PCs, written by
Nullsoft, now a subsidiary of AOL. It is freeware/shareware, multi-format,
extensible with plug-ins and skins, and is noted for its graphical
sound visualization, playlist, and media library features." Wikipedia

VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team discovered multiple vulnerabilities in
Winamp.

These issues are caused by integer and buffer overflow errors within the
"vp6.w5s" component when parsing malformed Flash Video data, which could
allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into opening
a specially crafted FLV file.


III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Winamp version 5.572 and prior


IV. Binary Analysis & Proof-of-concept
