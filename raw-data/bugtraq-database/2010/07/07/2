Subject: DeepSec 2010 - Call for Papers - REMINDER


== REMINDER: Call for Papers and Experts
=== DeepSec In-Depth Security Conference 2010 - Quad Core, the fourth DeepSec

The is a reminder for the Call for Papers sent out in April. The next DeepSec
conference will be in Vienna from November 23rd to 26th 2010 and we invite
you to send your submission for conference talks and workshops. Additionally
we call for submisison from young security researchers of 21 years and
younger for exhibits of their own research during the conference. The
deadline for submissions is July 31 2010.

== Topics ==

The DeepSec 2010 focuses heavily on mobile security. Any gadget that you
carry with you or that is used by roadwarriors comes under scrutiny.
This includes networked resources intended for the mobile audience and
modern nomads as well. On top of that we like to hear about the security
of next generation infrastructure - IPv6, cloud computing and services,
virtualization technologies, in short everything that should keep us
online and connected for the next decades. We want to get a glimpse into
the future based on the problems of today. 

Please do not submit specific single exploits (which might be fixed by
the time of the conference) and "yet-another-XYZ-hack", script kiddy
content or similar "breakthroughs". Save your effort for the Nobel
prize. Exploit frameworks, general approaches, "defective by design" or
"defective by implementation" and high impact exploits have a much
higher chance to get accepted. ;-)
