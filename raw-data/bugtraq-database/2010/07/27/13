[MajorSecurity SA-079]PHPKIT WCMS - Multiple stored Cross Site Scripting Issues

Details
=============
Product: PHPKIT WCMS
Security-Risk: low
Remote-Exploit: yes
Vendor-URL: http://www.phpkit.com/
Advisory-Status: published

Credits
=============
Discovered by: David Vieira-Kurz of MajorSecurity

Original Advisory
=============
http://www.majorsecurity.net/phpkit-wcms-xss-stored.php

Affected Products:
=============
PHPKIT WCMS 1.6.5
Prior versions may also be vulnerable

Description
=============
"PHPKIT WCMS is an Content Management System."

More Details
=============
We at MajorSecurity have discovered some vulnerabilities in PHPKIT WCMS 1.6.5, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct persistent cross-site scripting attacks. Input passed directly to the "gbook_welcome" parameter in "/de/pk/include.php?path=config&mode=guestbook" and to the "rss_page_text" parameter in "/de/pk/include.php?path=config&mode=rssfeed" is not properly sanitised before being stored and returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Solution
=============
Web applications should never trust on user generated input and therefore sanatize all input. Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
