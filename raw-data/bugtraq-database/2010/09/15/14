Description

Multiple persistent and reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were identified in Security Console (Admin Console), Message Center Classic and Message Center II services of Google Message Security (powered by Postini).

When exploited, the identified vulnerabilities could lead to Session Hijack, Information Disclosure, force installation of malicious file or Trojan on users' PCs, etc.


Security Console (Admin Console)
--------------------------------

    * Persistent XSS: parameter setconf-neworg of /exec/admin_orgs resource allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code which is persistently stored as part of a sub-organization name (ORGS and USERS>Orgs>Add Sub-Org). 
      Additionally, an effective DoS attack can be mounted against the organization's administrators by injecting malicious code which prevents the Web user interface to render properly.
    * Reflected XSS: multiple parameters of /exec/admin_list resource
    * Reflected XSS: multiple parameters of /exec/admin_auth resource.


Message Center Classic
----------------------

    *  Reflected XSS: parameters add-good_address and add-bad_address of /exec/MsgSet resource. 

/exec/MsgSet?action=change_MsgSettings?add-good_addresses=a%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&submit=Save+to+List&submit=Save+to+List

/exec/MsgSet?action=change_MsgSettings?add-bad_addresses=a%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&submit=Save+to+List&submit=Save+to+List

    * Reflected XSS: parameters msgid and disp parameters of /exec/MsgCtr resource.

/exec/MsgCtr?action=display_Message&msgid=" style%3d"display: block; width: 500px; height: 500px; border: 5px solid black" onmouseover%3d"javascript:alert(1)" yyy&disp=M

When Firefox 3.0.x is used (tested with FF 3.0.1), the attack above allows rendering visible the hidden INPUT element. Thus, the injected JavaScript code is successfully executed using onmouseover event.

/exec/MsgCtr?action=display_Message&msgid=yyy&disp=M" onmouseover%3d"javascript: alert(1)"

 
Message Center II
-----------------

    *  Reflected XSS: parameters id and source_uri of /msgctr/message_display resource. 

/msgctr/message_display?id='%3balert(1)%3b//&source_uri=/app/msgctr/junk_quarantine

/msgctr/message_display?id=yyy&trash=trash&source_uri=%2Fapp%2Fmsgctr%2Ftrash%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E
