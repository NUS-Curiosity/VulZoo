Subject: [oCERT-2010-004] FFmpeg/libavcodec arbitrary offset dereference


#2010-004 FFmpeg/libavcodec arbitrary offset dereference

Description:

The libavcodec library, an open source video encoding/decoding library part of
the FFmpeg project, suffers from an arbitrary offset dereference vulnerability.

The vulnerability affects the flic file format parser, insufficient
restrictions on a writable buffer can be exploited to execute arbitrary code
via the heap memory. A specific flic file can be crafted to trigger the
vulnerability.

The MPlayer multimedia player is also affected as it statically includes
libavcodec, the flic codec can be disabled in codecs.conf configuration file in
order to workaround the issue.

Affected version:

libavcodec <= 0.6

MPlayer <= 1.0_rc3, snapshot 2010-09-27

Fixed version:

libavcodec >= r25223 (see References)

MPlayer >= snapshot 2010-09-28
