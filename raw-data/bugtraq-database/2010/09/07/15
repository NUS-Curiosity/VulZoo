Subject: The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) version 1.0.0

Hello,

I'd like to announce the first release of the Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) -
https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/ - a penetration test tool designed
to be used to make web applications more secure.

Why has it been released?

There are many excellent pen test tools, but few of them are really
suitable for people with little pen test experience.
ZAP is really intended for developers and functional testers who are
new to pen testing. However experienced pen testers may find it useful
as well.
While ZAP can detect some security issues automatically, it is
primarily designed to help you find security vulnerabilities manually.
In order to make ZAP as easy to use as possible a user guide is
available both as context sensitive help within ZAP and online.

ZAP is a fork of the well regarded Paros Proxy and is open source and
cross platform.
Note that there will NOT be a 'Pro' version of ZAP, so there will be
no incentive to restrict the features available in the 'free' version
:)
Involvement in the development of ZAP is actively encouraged.

Regards,

Psiinon
