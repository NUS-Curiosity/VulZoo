Subject: Microsoft Internet explorer 8 DLL Hijacking (IESHIMS.DLL)

I found this Microsoft Internet explorer 8 DLL Hijacking  at Inject0r db

http://inj3ct0r.com/exploits/13898

This one is a similar variant of IE 7

http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/2929/

It can be triggered only if attackers can put a IESHIMS.DLL file in
user's desktop.

However, there are some supporting factors that trigger this exploit successful
such as when  user's default download location is Desktop
