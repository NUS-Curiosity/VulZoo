Subject: Exploit Next Generation(R) Example Codes

As all of you already know the Exploit Next GenerationÂ® Compliance
Methodology is the only methodology able to apply the "Z-Day Attacks"
concepts.

Some examples demonstrated during its very first appearance are now
available at:
 - http://code.google.com/p/exploit-ng/

To celebrate one year of its very first appearance, I will release two
example modules, applying ENG++ Methodology, late this year -
including the one used to subvert and bypass the SNORT detection. To
be more exactly, during the H2HC 7th Edition (November 27th - 28th).

Meet you @ H2HC Seventh Edition!!!

Best regards.
