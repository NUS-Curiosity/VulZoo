covered in this Security Advisory:

  * Cisco 2000 Series WLCs
  * Cisco 2100 Series WLCs
  * Cisco 4100 Series WLCs
  * Cisco 4400 Series WLCs
  * Cisco 5500 Series WLCs
  * Cisco Wireless Services Modules (WiSMs)
  * Cisco WLC Modules for Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)
  * Cisco Catalyst 3750G Integrated WLCs
   
DoS Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Cisco WLC product family is affected by two DoS vulnerabilities:

  * Internet Key Exchange (IKE) DoS Vulnerability
  * HTTP DoS Vulnerability

The IKE DoS vulnerability affects Cisco WLC software versions 3.2 and
later. The HTTP DoS vulnerability affects Cisco WLC software versions
4.2 and later.

Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The privilege escalation vulnerabilities affect Cisco WLC software
versions 4.2 and later.

CPU ACL Bypass Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the two ACL bypass vulnerabilities affects Cisco WLC software
versions 4.1 and later. The second ACL bypass vulnerability affects
Cisco WLC software versions 6.0.x.

Determination of Software Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Administrators can use these instructions to determine the software
version that is running on the Cisco WLCs (using the web or
command-line interface) or on the Cisco WiSM (using commands on the
Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch and Cisco 7600 Series Router).

Cisco Wireless Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To determine the WLC version that is running in a given environment,
use one of these methods:

  * In the web interface, choose the "Monitor" tab, click "Summary" in
    the left pane, and note the "Software" Version field.

Note: Customers who use a Cisco WLC Module in an ISR will need to
issue the "service-module wlan-controller <slot/port> session" command
prior to performing the next step on the command line. Customers who
use a Cisco Catalyst 3750G Switch with an integrated WLC Module will
need to issue the "session <Stack-Member-Number> processor 1 session"
command prior to performing the next step on the command line.

  * From the command-line interface, type "show sysinfo" and note the 
    "Product Version" field, as shown in this example:
   
        (Cisco Controller)> show sysinfo
        
        Manufacturer's Name.. Cisco Systems Inc.
        Product Name......... Cisco Controller
        Product Version...... 5.1.151.0
        RTOS Version......... Linux-2.6.10_mvl401
        Bootloader Version... 4.0.207.0
        Build Type........... DATA + WPS
        <output suppressed>
   
Cisco WiSMs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the "show wism module <module number> controller 1 status" command
on a Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch and Cisco 7600 Series Router
if they are using a WiSM. Note the software version as demonstrated
in this example, which shows version 5.1.151.0:

    Router# show wism module 3 controller 1 status
    
    WiSM Controller 1 in Slot 3
    Operational Status of the Controller    
       : Oper-Up
    Service VLAN                            
       : 192

       : 10    
    Service Port Mac Address                
       : 0011.92ff.8742
    Service IP Address                      
       : 192.168.10.1

Details
=======

Cisco WLCs and Cisco WiSMs are responsible for system-wide wireless
LAN functions, such as security policies, intrusion prevention, RF
management, quality of service (QoS), and mobility.

These devices communicate with controller-based access points over
any Layer 2 (Ethernet) or Layer 3 (IP) infrastructure using the
Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) and the Control and
Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol.

The Cisco WLC family of devices is affected by 2 denial of service
vulnerabilities, 3 privilege escalation vulnerabilities, and 2 access
control list bypass vulnerabilities. The following are the details
about these vulnerabilities.

IKE Denial of Service Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An attacker with the ability to send a malicious IKE packet to an
affected Cisco WLC could cause the device to crash and reload. This
vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.

Note: IKE is enabled by default in the WLC and cannot be disabled.
Only traffic destined to the Cisco WLC could trigger this
vulnerability. Transient traffic will not trigger this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCta56653 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
CVE-2010-0574.

HTTP Denial of Service Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An authenticated attacker with the ability to send a series of
malicious HTTP packets to an affected Cisco WLC could cause the
device to reload. This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired
and wireless segments. A TCP three-way handshake is needed in order
to exploit this vulnerability.

Note: Only traffic destined to the Cisco WLC could trigger this
vulnerability. Transient traffic will not trigger this vulnerability.
WebAuth or guest access is not affected by this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtd16938
and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2010-2841.

Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three privilege escalation vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WLCs
that could allow an authenticated attacker with read-only privileges
to modify the device configuration.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco Bug IDs CSCtc91431,
CSCsz66726, and CSCtc93837; and have been assigned
CVE IDs CVE-2010-2842, CVE-2010-2843, and CVE-2010-3033.

Access Control List Bypass Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ACLs can be configured in the Cisco WLCs and applied to data traffic
to and from wireless clients or to all traffic that is destined for
the controller CPU. After ACLs are defined, they can be applied to
the management interface, the access point manager (AP-manager)
interface, or any of the dynamic interfaces for client data traffic
or to the Network Processing Unit (NPU) interface for traffic to the
controller CPU. Two vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WLCs that
could allow an unauthenticated attacker to bypass policies that
should be enforced by CPU-based ACLs. No other ACL types are affected
by these vulnerabilities.

Note: CPU-based ACLs are configured and applied by navigating to 
Security > Access Control Lists > CPU Access Control Lists in the
Cisco WLC web management interface. When CPU-based ACLs are enabled,
they are applicable to both wireless and wired traffic.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco Bug IDs CSCta66931,
and CSCtf36051; and have been assigned CVE IDs CVE-2010-0575 and
CVE-2010-3034.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

affected device to reload. Repeated exploitation could result in a
sustained DoS condition.

Successful exploitation of the privilege escalation vulnerabilities
could allow an authenticated attacker with read-only privileges to
modify the device configuration.

Successful exploitation of the ACL bypass vulnerabilities could allow
an attacker to bypass policies that should be enforced by CPU-based
ACLs.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult:

http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt

and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete
upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

If a given release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible
releases that contain the fix (along with the anticipated date of
availability for each, if applicable) are listed in the "First Fixed
Release" column of the table. A device running a release in the given
train that is earlier than the release in a specific column (less
than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable.
