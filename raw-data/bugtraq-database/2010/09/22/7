su2, 7.1(5) and 8.0(1). The corresponding IOS defect is CSCta20040.

The second SIP DoS vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID
CSCtf14987 ( registered customers only) and has been assigned the CVE
identifier CVE-2010-2834. The second vulnerability is fixed in Cisco
Unified Communications Manager versions 6.1(5)SU1, 7.1(5) and 8.0(2).
The corresponding IOS defect is CSCtf72678.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities that are described in
this advisory could result in the interruption of voice services.
Cisco Unified Communications Manager will restart the affected
processes, but repeated attacks may result in a sustained DoS
Condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

For customers who do not use SIP in their environment, there is a
workaround for these vulnerabilities. Cisco Unified Communication
Manager versions 6.1(4), 7.1(2) and 8.0(1) introduced the ability to
disable SIP processing. SIP processing is enabled by default. Use the
following instructions to disable SIP processing:

Step 1: Log into the Cisco Unified CM Administration web interface.

Step 2: Navigate to System > Service Parameters and select the
appropriate Cisco Unified Communications Manager server and the
"Cisco CallManager" service.

Step 3: Change the "SIP Interoperability Enabled" parameter to False,
and click Save.

Note: For a SIP processing change to take effect, the Cisco
CallManager Service must be restarted. For information on how to
restart the service, refer to the "Restarting the Cisco CallManager
Service" section of the document at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/admin/7_1_2/ccmcfg/b03dpi.html#wp1075124

It is possible to mitigate these vulnerabilities by implementing
filtering on screening devices and permitting access to TCP ports
5060 and 5061 and UDP ports 5060 and 5061 only from networks that
require SIP access to Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in the
network are available in the companion document "Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the
Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Voice Products", which is available
at the following location:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100922-voice.shtml
