Subject: Web challenges from RootedCON'2010 CTF - Contest

Hello,

Next Friday I will be running a web-based challenges contest. Winner will
be awarded with the new iPod touch from Apple. Thanks to Hispasec Sistemas
(you probably know them as the makers of VirusTotal service) from
sponsoring the prize.

Full info (registration currently open):

PS: Contest is a *personal initiative*. The current RootedCON organization
is NOT involved at all. Chosen name is merely anecdotal.

Saludos,
