4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's
system.

The vulnerability is caused by an integer underflow error when parsing
certain content and can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer 
overflow via e.g. a specially crafted e-mail message.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but 
requires that Outlook is connected to an Exchange server with Online 
Mode (not default setting for Outlook 2003 and 2007).

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Apply patches provided by MS10-064.
