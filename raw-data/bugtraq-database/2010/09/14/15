Subject: New writeup by Amit Klein (Trusteer): "Cross-domain information
 leakage in Firefox 3.6.4-3.6.8, Firefox 3.5.10-3.5.11 and Firefox 4.0 Beta1"

Hi list

I would like to announce a new writeup, titled "Cross-domain 
information leakage in Firefox 3.6.4-3.6.8, Firefox 3.5.10-3.5.11 
and Firefox 4.0 Beta1".

The writeup is available in the following URL:

http://www.trusteer.com/sites/default/files/Cross_domain_Math_Random_leakage_in_FF_3.6.4-3.6.8.pdf

Abstract:
While Mozilla attempted to address the issues of cross domain 
information leakage (through Math.random) in Firefox 3.6.4, Firefox 
3.5.10 and Firefox 4.0 Beta-1, there is still a security 
vulnerability in the way the isolation is implemented, which enables 
cross domain leakage. In fact, it may make it easier to attack 
Firefox in some cases, compared to previous versions.
Additionally, a concerned is raised on the entropy provided in the 
seed to the Math.random PRNG, which may enable more powerful attacks.

This isolation issue was fixed in Firefox 3.6.9, 3.5.12 and 4.0 Beta2.

This issue has been assigned a CVE code CVE-2010-3171.

Thanks,
-Amit
