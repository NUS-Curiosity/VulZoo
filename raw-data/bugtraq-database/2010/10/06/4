[http://www.coresecurity.com/content/adobe-acrobat-acrord23-reader-use-after-free]
Date published: 2010-10-05
Date of last update: 2010-10-05
Vendors contacted: Adobe
Release mode: Coordinated release



2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Use after free [CWE-416]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes (client-side)
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2010-3627
Bugtraq ID: N/A



3. *Vulnerability Description*

Adobe Acrobat Reader is prone to a use-after-free vulnerability due to
an invalid usage of a released memory chunk. This vulnerability could be
used by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, by enticing the
user of Adobe Acrobat Reader to open a specially crafted file and click
on PAGES thumbnails.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Adobe Acrobat Reader 9.x


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.x


6. *Solutions and Workarounds*

7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Ricardo Narvaja,
from Core Security Technologies. This publication was coordinated by
Fernando Russ.


8. *Technical Description*

Adobe Acrobat Reader is prone to a use-after-free vulnerability due to
an invalid usage of a released memory chunk. A specially crafted '.pdf'
file containing special flash code triggers an 'ACCESS_VIOLATION'
reading at address 0x00000030.

A more careful analysis of that code indicates that ESI points to a
released chunk of memory. Exploitation is feasible forcing the
allocation process of Adobe Acrobat Reader to reuse the chunk pointed by
ESI with specially controlled data.

/-----
00EE10F8    MOV ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+1C]  <-- ESI points to a
previously released memory chunk.
00EE10FB    MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+78],EAX
00EE10FE    MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+18]
00EE1101    PUSH EAX
00EE1102    CALL DWORD PTR DS:[ECX+30]     <-- The execution flow
depends on the content of ECX. (ECX dependes on ESI)

- -----/
 The content of the CPU register while an 'ACCESS_VIOLATION' reading was
triggered at 0x00EE1102,

EAX 00000000
ECX 00000000
EDX 014D0A40
EBX 00000000
ESP 0013F1BC
EBP 0013F24C
ESI 02D5782C
EDI 10A7C3D0
EIP 00EE1102

- -----/
 This vulnerability could result in arbitrary code execution, although
it was not verified.
