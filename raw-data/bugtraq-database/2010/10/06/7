ZDI-10-191: Adobe Reader ICC Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-191
October 6, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3621

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Reader

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required
in that a target must be coerced into opening a file or visiting a web
page.

The specific flaw exists within the ACE.dll module responsible for
parsing ICC streams. When processing an ICC stream, the process performs
math on two DWORD values from the input file. If these values wrap over
the maximum integer value of 0xFFFFFFFF a mis-allocation can occur.
Later, the process uses one of the original DWORD values as a size to a
copy function. This can be abused by an attacker to overflow a stack
buffer and subsequently execute code under the context of the user
running the process.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
