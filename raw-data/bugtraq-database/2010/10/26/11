Subject: RE: How Visual Studio Makes Your Applications Vulnerable to Binary Planting

Unless I misread the description, this is an error in MFC, not in Visual
Studio.

Applications built using MFC and command-line tools would be equally
vulnerable; non-MFC applications built using Visual Studio would not be
(via this vector - obviously they could be vulnerable to binary planting
through other vectors).

Plenty of developers use Visual Studio to create non-MFC applications.
And at least a few of us use Microsoft toolchains and libraries without
the enormous pile of VS overhead. (Whether there's anyone in the latter
group who uses MFC is another question.)
