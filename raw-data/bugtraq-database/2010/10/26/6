Subject: Re: Web challenges from RootedCON'2010 CTF - Contest -> Solutions
 and Write-ups

Contest is over. PPP (Plaid Parliament of Pwning) won the prize.

Write-ups (3 in English and 1 in Spanish) were packed in this .rar file:
http://www.rs-labs.com/noticias/rootedctf-results/rooted-online-ctf-writeups-september-2010.rar
(see "readme" file with complete info and press-release).

Thanks to all who played with us :)

PD: Again, this has nothing to do with current RootedCON congress/organization.

Cheers,
-Roman
