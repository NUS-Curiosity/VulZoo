Hi Michael,

Indeed, MFC is the culprit. We were aware of Visual Studio as a typical environment
for building MFC apps, and MFC is an integral part of it. Presumably other ways of
building MFC apps will result in vulnerable builds too, but we noticed that older
some versions of MFC libraries were not vulnerable.

Thanks for broadening the view.
