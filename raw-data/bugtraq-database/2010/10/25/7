Subject: Aardvark Topsite XSS vulnerability

Hi,

I found XSS on Aardvark Topsites PHP system.
Dork: "Powered by Aardvark Topsites" "SQL Queries"
XSS PoC: site_path/index.php?a=search&q=%22%20onmouseover%3dalert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))%20par%3d%22
Can use POST to effect the "email", "title", "u" and "url" parameters
either on the same way.
Tested versions: 5.2.0 & 5.2.1 (might work on other versions also).

Haven't found a way to contact the admins/security department directly.
If more details are needed, please contact me.

Thank you,
