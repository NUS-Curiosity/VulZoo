Subject: How Visual Studio Makes Your Applications Vulnerable to Binary Planting

Microsoft Visual Studio can automatically make an application binary
planting-positive (i.e., vulnerable) even when the developer makes no programming
errors. Every MFC application seems to be automatically made vulnerable, with those
statically linking MFC libraries actually having the vulnerable code integrated in
their executables, making it harder to deploy patches to users.
