Subject: Re: Secunia PSI Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability

Secunia PSI is not associated with any file types and does not support
opening of HTML files nor any other files. Furthermore, the application
does not load Schannel.dll.

Secunia PSI is therefore not vulnerable to the "Insecure Library
Loading" vulnerability.

Stay Secure,
