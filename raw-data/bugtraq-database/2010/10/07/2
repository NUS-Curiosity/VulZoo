Details.
Adobe Reader is a popular freeware PDF viewer. Version 9.3.4 of
the application is vulnerable to multiple memory corruption 
vulnerabilities. By sending specially crafted PDF files it is
possible to cause memory corruption in the 3difr and
AcroRd32.dll modules. Both issues trigger a null pointer
condition which results in an access violation. The issue in
AcroRd32.dll is triggered when Adobe Reader is closed.

Function sub_60AF56 in AcroRd32.dll access violates when
attempting to read data pointed to by the ESI register. Part
disassembly of the function is shown below:

push    ebp
mov     ebp, esp
sub     esp, 1Ch
and     [ebp+var_4], 0 
push    ebx
push    esi
mov     esi, ecx
mov     ebx, [esi+23Ch] <-- crash

Function sub_1000EEE0 in 3difr also access violates when
attempting to read data pointed to by the ECX register. Part 
disassembly of the function is shown below:

mov     ecx, [eax+4]
mov     eax, [edx+4]
mov     dx, [eax]
cmp     dx, [ecx] <-- crash
jnz     short loc_1000EF87

It may be possible to exploit these vulnerabilities to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the user running Adobe
Reader.

Proof of Concept.
Proof of concept PDF files are available to Sense of Security
customers upon request.

Solution.
A patch is available from Adobe and is included in the next
release (9.4).
