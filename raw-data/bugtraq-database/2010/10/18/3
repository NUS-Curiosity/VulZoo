Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] XSS in Oracle default fcgi-bin/echo

Hi Paul,

The mere mention of fcgi-bin/echo in your first mail is enough for
anybody to derive the PoC. Here's what I found in under a minute:
/fcgi-bin/echo/<script>aler('xss')</script>

Anybody with a days work in Web Application security would be able to
figure this out knowing the vulnerable script.

Just my two cents.

Regards,
Riyaz Walikar
