Details
=======

CiscoWorks Common Services is a set of management services that are
shared by network management applications in a CiscoWorks solution
set.

CiscoWorks Common Services provides the foundation for CiscoWorks
applications to share a common model for data storage, login, user
role definitions, access privileges, security protocols, and
navigation. It creates a standard user experience for all management
functions. It also provides the common framework for all basic system
level operations such as installation, data management (including
backup-restoration and importing-exporting), event and message
handling, job and process management, and software updates.

Exploitable buffer overflows exist in the Cisco developed
authentication code in the web server module of CiscoWorks Common
Services, which can be exploited remotely without authentication.

A successful exploit could cause the web server to crash or allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. Any code would
execute with system administrative privileges.

The vulnerability could be exploited over TCP port 443 or 1741.

Note: The default HTTP and HTTPS ports can be reconfigured on the
server.

The vulnerability affects both CiscoWorks Common Services for Oracle
Solaris and Microsoft Windows.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCti41352.

This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2010-3036.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Cisco Security Advisory is done in accordance with
CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

CSCti41352 - CiscoWorks Common Services Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability

CVSS Base Score - 10

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the CiscoWorks
server machine with the privileges of the system administrator.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software updates, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for
featureset compatibility and known issues specific to their
environment.

This vulnerability has been resolved in CiscoWorks Common Services
version 4.0 and in the following software patches:

cwcs33-sol-CSCti41352.tar - for Oracle Solaris versions

cwcs33-win-CSCti41352.zip - for Microsoft Windows versions

These CiscoWorks Common Services patches can be downloaded from: 

http://tools.cisco.com/support/downloads/pub/Redirect.x?mdfid=268439477

and navigating through the tree to "Routing and Switching
Management > CiscoWorks LAN Management Solution Products > CiscoWorks
Common Services Software > CiscoWorks Common Services Software 3.3"
and then the choice of Solaris or Windows, depending on your
operating system.

When considering software upgrades, also consult:

http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt

and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a
complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

Filters such as transit access control lists (tACLs) can be used to
allow access to the Administration Workstation only from trusted
hosts. This mitigation limits the attack surface of the
vulnerability.

Filters that deny HTTPS packets using TCP port 443 and TCP port 1741
should be deployed throughout the network as part of a tACL policy to
protect the network from traffic that enters at ingress access
points. This policy should be configured to protect the network
device where the filter is applied and other devices that are behind
it. Filters for HTTPS packets that use TCP port 443 and TCP port 1741
should also be deployed in front of vulnerable network devices so
that only traffic from a trusted client is allowed.

Note: Additional information about tACLs is available in "Transit
Access Control Lists: Filtering at Your Edge" at the following link: 

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion
document for this Advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20101027-cs.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
