4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in SonicWALL SSL-VPN
End-Point Interrogator/Installer ActiveX Control, which can be
exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by a boundary error in the
"Install3rdPartyComponent()" method in the "Aventail.EPInstaller"
ActiveX control when creating an absolute path name based on values
in the "CabURL" and "Location" arguments. This can be exploited to
cause a stack-based buffer overflow via overly long values.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 10.5.2 and apply hotfix 3 for version 10.0.5.
