4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Adobe Shockwave
Player, which may be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by a logic error in TextXtra.x32 when 
parsing "DEMX" chunks. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based 
buffer overflow via a specially crafted Director file as a function 
does not reallocate a buffer to contain a section of data as expected, 
but another function to still copy chunk data into the insufficiently 
sized buffer.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 11.5.9.615.
