Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] Joomla 1.5.21 | Potential SQL Injection Flaws

This public disclosure has achieved its aim.

Joomla! Team finally patched this hole.


http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/9-security/10-core-security/323-20101101-core-sqli-info-disclosurevulnerabilities.html

Upgrade to the latest Joomla! version (1.5.22 or later).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


1. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION


Potential SQL Injection Flaws were detected Joomla! CMS version
1.5.20. These flaws were reported along with our Cross Scripting Flaw
which was fixed in 1.5.21. Developers believed that our reported SQL
Injection flaws are not fully exploitable because of Joomla! built-in
string filters and were not fixed in 1.5.21 which is currently the
latest version.

As a result, we disclosed these flaws  in order for someone who can
exploit these flaws to the next maximum level.
