Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about Insufficient Anti-automation and Abuse of
Functionality vulnerabilities in Joomla. Vulnerabilities exist in component
com_contact, which is a core component of Joomla.

(Joomla! 1.5.22 and previous versions).

In details about such vulnerabilities, about sending of spam via web sites
and creating of spam-botnets it's possible to read in my article Sending
spam via sites and creating spam-botnets
(http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2010-07/msg00099.html).

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

http://site/contact/

There is no protection at contact page from automated requests (captcha).

Option "E-mail a copy of this message to your own address" at contact page
allows to send spam from the site to arbitrary e-mails. And with using of
Insufficient Anti-automation vulnerability it's possible to send spam from
the site in automated manner on a large scale.
