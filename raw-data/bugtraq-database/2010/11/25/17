Subject: [Suspected Spam]Vulnerabilities in Register Plus for WordPress

Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting, Insufficient Anti-automation
and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities in plugin Register Plus for
WordPress.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are versions of plugin Register Plus 3.5.1 and previous versions.
Also for Insufficient Anti-automation are vulnerable WordPress 3.0.1 and
previous versions.

----------
Details:
----------

XSS (WASC-08):

POST request at page http://site/wp-login.php?action=register

"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
In fields: First Name, Last Name, Website, AIM, Yahoo IM, Jabber / Google
Talk, Password, Confirm Password.

</textarea><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
In field: About Yourself.

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

http://site/wp-login.php?action=register

In registration form there is no protection from automated requests
(captcha). There is such vulnerability also in WordPress itself.

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/plugins/register-plus/dash_widget.php

http://site/wp-content/plugins/register-plus/register-plus.php

------------
Timeline:
------------

2010.09.17 - announced at my site.
2010.09.18 - informed developer.
2010.11.24 - disclosed at my site.

Taking into account, that this plugin is no more supported by developer,
then users of the plugin need to fix these holes by themselves.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4539/).

Best wishes & regards,
