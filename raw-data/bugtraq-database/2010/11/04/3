Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* There is a way to inject both headers and content to users, causing
  a serious Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

* It was possible to see graphs from Old Charts even if you did not
  have access to a particular product, and you could browse a
  particular URL to see all product names.

* YUI 2.8.1, which shipped with Bugzilla starting with 3.7.x,
  contained a security vulnerability. The version of YUI shipped
  with Bugzilla 4.0rc1 and above has been updated to 2.8.2.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       HTTP Response Splitting
Versions:    Every Version Before 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
Description: By inserting a certain string into a URL, it was possible
             to inject both headers and content to any browser that
             supported "Server Push" (mostly only Gecko-based browsers
             like Firefox). This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting
             vulnerabilities, and possibly other more dangerous
             security issues as well.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-3172

Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.12 to 3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3, 4.1
Fixed In:    3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
Description: The Old Charts system generated graphs with
             predictable names into the "graphs/" directory,
             which also could be browsed to see its contents.
             This allowed unauthorized users to see product names
             and charted information about those products over time.
