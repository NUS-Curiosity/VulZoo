Thanks for your replies ( especially linuxoid.rain at gmail dot com and
mfardiles ). Mentioned above users informed me that my vulerability also
affect DIR-600 and DIR-320 D-Link router models. I'm going to buy those
routers and test all available firmwares. Propably, I will send test
results to bugtraq in the next three weeks. If somebody has free time
and those routers, help is welcome.

Greetings, Karol Celiński.
