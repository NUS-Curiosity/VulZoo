Affected Products:

Subdreamer CMS 3.x.x
Prior versions may also be vulnerable

More Details
=============
We at MajorSecurity have discovered some vulnerabilities in Subdreamer CMS, which can be exploited to conduct sql injection attacks.
Input passed directly to the "categoryids[]" POST parameter in "/admin/pages.php?action=update_pages" is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Solution
=============
Web applications should never trust on user generated input and therefore sanatize all input.
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
