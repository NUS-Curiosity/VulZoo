Looks like this affected Windows only, and was fixed a while ago.

Changes with nginx 0.7.65                                        01 Feb 2010

    *) Security: now nginx/Windows ignores trailing spaces in URI.
       Thanks to Dan Crowley, Core Security Technologies.

what about the stable branch? Versions 0.7.65 and earlier?
