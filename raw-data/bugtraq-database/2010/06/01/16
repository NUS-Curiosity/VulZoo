Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflows in CamlImages might result in the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

CamlImages is an image processing library for Objective Caml.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-ml/camlimages       < 3.0.2                          >= 3.0.2

Description
===========

Tielei Wang reported multiple integer overflows, possibly leading to
heap-based buffer overflows in the (1) read_png_file() and
read_png_file_as_rgb24() functions, when processing a PNG image
(CVE-2009-2295) and (2) gifread.c and jpegread.c files when processing
GIF or JPEG images (CVE-2009-2660).

Other integer overflows were also found in tiffread.c (CVE-2009-3296).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted,
overly large PNG, GIF, TIFF, or JPEG image using an application that
uses the CamlImages library, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All CamlImages users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =dev-ml/camlimages-3.0.2
