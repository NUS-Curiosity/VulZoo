Synopsis
========

An integer overflow in ImageMagick might allow remote attackers to
cause the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ImageMagick is a collection of tools and libraries for manipulating
various image formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/imagemagick      < 6.5.2.9                   >= 6.5.2.9

Description
===========

Tielei Wang has discovered that the XMakeImage() function in
magick/xwindow.c is prone to an integer overflow, possibly leading to a
buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
image, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ImageMagick users should upgrade to an unaffected version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/imagemagick-6.5.2.9"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since June 4, 2009. It is likely that your system is already
no longer affected by this issue.
