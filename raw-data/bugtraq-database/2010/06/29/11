====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in TaskFreak, which
can be exploited by malicious people to conduct SQL injection attacks.

Input passed via the "password" parameter to login.php (when 
"username" is set to a valid user) is not properly sanitised before 
being used in a SQL query in include/classes/tzn_user.php. This can be 
exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Successful exploitation allows bypassing the authentication mechanism,
but requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 0.6.4.
