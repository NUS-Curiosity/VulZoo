$#####################SQL INJECTION#######################

[+] Affected: /olk/c_p/searchCart.asp

[+] Description : The forms Price From, Price To, Inventory
	      greater than, and some others in the "Advanced
	      Search" are vulnerable to SQL Injection allowing
	      an attacker to review or execute commands in the
	      local Database (according to the web server's 
	      configuration)

[+] PoC :     It's posible to check if the app is vulnerable
	      by trying something like: 100000000 or 1=2 on
	      the "Price From" form, as the second part of the
	      injection is never true, the app won't show any
	      results; although if the injection is crafted as
	      100000000 or 1=1, the app will show every product
	      on its database.
