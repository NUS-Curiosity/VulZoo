 Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.16.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 16, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

Samba is an open-source Unix server application used to implement
Windows file sharing and domain controlling functionality. For more
information, please visit: http://www.samba.org

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability within Samba
Project's Samba could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with
root privileges.
This vulnerability exists in a certain function within Samba, where an
attacker could trigger a memory corruption by sending specially crafted
SMB requests resulting in heap memory overwritten with attacker supplied
data, which can allow attackers to execute code remotely.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted
host with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker
would need to send a malicious SMB packet to a vulnerable Samba server.
It should be noted that this vulnerability works on samba default
configuration, no authentication is needed and no user action is
required. Unsuccessful exploitation attempts may cause the process
serving the request to crash and may leave evidence of an attack in
logs.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Samba
version 3.3.12. Previous versions are suspected to be affected.Samba
3.4.0 and newer versions rewrite the whole logic of the vulnerable
function and thus are not affected by this vulnerability.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.
Firewalls should be utilized to prevent unauthorized connections to
samba ports.
