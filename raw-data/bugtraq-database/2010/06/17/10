Details

Vendor-URL: http://www.redaks.com/
Advisory-Status: published

Credits
=============
Discovered by: David Vieira-Kurz of MajorSecurity

Original Advisory
=============
http://www.majorsecurity.net/redaks_CMS_xss.php

Affected Products:
=============
CMS RedAks 2.0
Prior versions may also be vulnerable

=============
"CMS RedAks 2.0 is a web based content management system." 

More Details
=============
We at MajorSecurity have discovered some vulnerabilities in CMS RedAks 2.0, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks. Input passed directly to the "search", "search_id" and "search_inall" POST parameters in "/search/" Controller is not properly sanitised before being stored and returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Solution
=============
Web applications should never trust on user generated input and therefore sanatize all input.

Workaround
================
Do not browse untrusted sites or follow untrusted links while being logged-in to the application.
