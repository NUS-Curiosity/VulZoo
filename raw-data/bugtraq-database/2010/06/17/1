-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node
Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the ovwebsnmpsrv.exe process which can
be reached remotely through the jovgraph.exe CGI program. By supplying
overly large values to variables passed through an HTTP request a strcpy
call within the main() function can be made to overflow a static buffer.
An attacker can leverage this to execute arbitrary code under the
context of the user running the webserver.
