ZDI-10-110: Adobe Flash Player Multiple Tag JPEG Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-110
June 16, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-2171

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Flash Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is
required in that a target must visit a malicious website.

The specific flaw exists within the code for parsing embedded image data
within SWF files. The DefineBits tag and several of its variations are
prone to a parsing issue while handling JPEG data. Specifically, the
vulnerability is due to decompression routines that do not validate
image dimensions sufficiently before performing operations on heap
memory. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
code under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
