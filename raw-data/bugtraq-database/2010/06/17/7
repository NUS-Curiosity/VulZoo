-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing
embedded MP4 files. When handling the STSC, STSZ, and STCO atoms the
player can be made to improperly calculate length values later used as
size parameters during memory copy operations. By providing a specially
crafted file an attacker can corrupt heap memory and execute arbitrary
code under the context of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
