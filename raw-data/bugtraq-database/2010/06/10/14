Original Advisory
=============
http://www.majorsecurity.net/phpFaber_CMS_xss.php

Affected Products:
=============
phpFaber CMS v. 2.0.5
Prior versions may also be vulnerable

=============
"phpFaber CMS is web based content management system." 

More Details
=============
We at MajorSecurity have discovered some vulnerabilities in phpFaber CMS, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
Input passed directly to the "ERR_MSG" GET Parameter and to the "COMPANY_NAME" and "SPOTLIGHT" POST Parameter in "index.php" is not properly sanitised before being stored and returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Solution
=============
Web applications should never trust on user generated input and therefore sanatize all input.
