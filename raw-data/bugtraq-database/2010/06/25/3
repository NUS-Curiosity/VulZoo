-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the AVM bytecode verifier. Specifically,
the newFrameState method performs arithmetic when calculating the size
of a stack frame. It implicitly trusts the max_scope and max_stack
variables as obtained from the bytecode. By crafting specific values,
the integer indicating the size of the frame can be made to overflow.
This value is later used during memory copy operations which an attacker
can influence to gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the
user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
