Introduction
============
Invision Power Board is a widely used forums script.

More Details
============
Input passed to the calendar app (which is one of the core modules inside invision power board) is not properly sanitised before being stored and returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
The calendar can be shown on every page of the invision board, so that in fact this is a serious security issue.

Solution
=============
Web applications should never trust on user generated input and therefore sanatize all input.
