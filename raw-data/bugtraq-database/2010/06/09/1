[Dlink Di-604 router authenticated user ping tool Xss and DoS]

[vendor product description]
The DI-604 combines the latest advancements in chip technology,
low-cost design and manufacturing with new, feature-rich firewall and
network management controls to give you quite possibly the most
advanced, yet affordable Ethernet router to date.


[Bug Description]
'Ping tools' web interface does not validate the ip textfield size
leading to a Denial Of Service flaw by changing its size and sending
more than 500 characters to it. This textfield is also prone to Cross
Site Scripting. An authenticated user is required to exploit these
security flaws.
