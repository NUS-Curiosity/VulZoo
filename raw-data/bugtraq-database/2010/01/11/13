 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2009:293-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : squidGuard
 Date    : January 11, 2010
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in squidGuard:
 
 Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application hang or loss of
 blocking functionality) via a long URL with many / (slash) characters,
 related to emergency mode. (CVE-2009-3700).
 
 Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote attackers
 to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL, related to (1)
 the relationship between a certain buffer size in squidGuard and a
 certain buffer size in Squid and (2) a redirect URL that contains
 information about the originally requested URL (CVE-2009-3826).
 
 squidGuard was upgraded to 1.2.1 for MNF2/CS3/CS4 with additional
 upstream security and bug fixes patches applied.
 
 This update fixes these vulnerabilities.

 Update:

 Packages for 2008.0 are provided for Corporate Desktop 2008.0
 customers.
