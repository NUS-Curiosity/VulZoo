With all the hubbub around China yet again, I would like to remind you of the utilities available at Hammer of God that allow one to completely block any or all traffic to or from China or any other country in the world via ISA/TMG.  

As many of you know, I’ve been totally blocking China for years, mostly because I’m a Porcelain kind of guy.  Oh, and the fact that the entire country’s network is a festering cesspool of scum and villainy. 

Here’s an article I wrote about a 1.5 years ago on the subject if it has any relevance to you.
