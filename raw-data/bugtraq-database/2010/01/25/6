Subject: London DEFCON January meet - DC4420 - Wed 27th Jan 2010

Hi All,

It's a new year, and we have a new venue and new rules of engagement!

First, the venue - we are back in a pub, in the heart of the west end, 
with a private room/bar and easy connection to mainline stations etc. 
Food is excellent and drinks are at *normal* pub prices (and, most 
importantly, they have Guinness)!!!!

Secondly, ROE: we still run on "Fight Club" rules, i.e. "you will talk", 
but we're going to make it a bit easier to get started... This year, we 
will be limiting the talks to a single full-length 
'tek/security/hacking' talk, followed by a single 'fun/other' talk, 
which can be any length (if it's really short, we may do two that 
month)... Some previous subjects for the 'fun' talks have been:

   Torches / Lasers
   Home built water cannon
   Interfacing live firearms to FPS games
   Brain engineering (smart drugs etc.)

... you get the idea...

Meeting will always be the last Wednesday of the month, and venue is 
booked for the whole year, so you can get these dates in your diary 
(they are also on the front page of the main site - http://www.dc4420.org/)
