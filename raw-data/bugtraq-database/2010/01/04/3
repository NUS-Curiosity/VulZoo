3) Vendor's Description of Software 

"Those wishing to view PDF files on their Windows PC's now have a 
choice when it comes to Viewing PDF files - the PDF-XChange Viewer is
smaller, faster and more feature rich than the Adobe Reader which has
until now been the Reader of choice for PDF files - we think that's 
about to change!".

4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in PDF-XChange Viewer,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's 
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to an input validation error in 
PDFXCview.exe when parsing certain content and can be exploited to 
corrupt memory via a specially crafted PDF file.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a user
views a malicious PDF document.

NOTE: The vulnerable code is e.g. also present in the bundled 
PDF-XChange shell extension (XCShInfo.dll), which is installed by 
default. This vector allows exploitation as soon as a user e.g. 
selects a malicious PDF file or hovers the mouse pointer over it.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 2.044.
