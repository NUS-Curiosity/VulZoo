Subject: WASC Announcement: WASC Threat Classification v2.0 Published

The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) is pleased to announce the long awaited release of the WASC 
Threat Classification v2.0. The Threat Classification is an effort to classify the weaknesses, and attacks 
that can lead to the compromise of a website, its data, or its users. This document's primarily purpose is 
to serve as a reference guide for common attacks and weaknesses.

Main goals
- Refine document scope, terminology, and purpose
- Update existing sections when applicable
- Add missing attacks and weaknesses
- Creation of a firm, scalable base foundation allowing for the introduction of data views allowing for various 
  forms of data representation
- Addition of attack and weakness reference identifiers (WASC-<xx>)
- Publication of two data views
