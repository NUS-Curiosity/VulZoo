-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell ZENworks Asset Management.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists due to insufficient sanity checks on the
documentID parameter to the docfiledownload component. A carefully
crafted parameter can result in direct SQL access to the underlying SQL
Server database which can be further leveraged by an attacker to
potentially execute arbitrary code.
