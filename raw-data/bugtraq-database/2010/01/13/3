3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Flash Player 
distributed with certain versions of Windows XP, which can be 
exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in the bundled
version of Flash Player when unloading Flash objects while these are 
still being accessed using script code. This can be exploited to 
corrupt memory via a specially crafted web page.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
