Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 01.12.10: Adobe Reader and Acrobat JpxDecode
 Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.12.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jan 12, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Reader and Acrobat are Portable Document Format (PDF) reader and
processors. For more information, please visit following pages:

http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in multiple
versions of Adobe Systems Inc.'s Reader and Acrobat PDF reader and
processor could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs when processing the Jp2c stream of a JpxDecode
encoded data stream within a PDF file. During the processing of a
JPC_MS_RGN marker, an integer sign extension may cause a bounds check
to be bypassed. This results in an exploitable memory corruption
vulnerability.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the file. The
attacker will have to create a malicious PDF file and convince the
victim to open it. This can be accomplished by embedding the PDF file
into an IFrame inside of a Web page, which will result in automatic
exploitation once the page is viewed. The file could also be e-mailed
as an attachment or placed on a file share. In these cases, a user
would have to manually open the file to trigger exploitation. If
preview is enabled in Windows Explorer, Acrobat will try to generate a
preview for PDF files when a folder containing PDF files is accessed,
thus triggering the exploitation.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in latest
version of Adobe Reader, at the time of testing, version 9.1.0.
Previous versions may also be affected.

Adobe has stated that all 9.2 and below versions, as well as all 8.1.7
and below versions are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

None of the following workarounds will prevent exploitation, but they
can reduce potential attack vectors and make exploitation more
difficult.

Prevent PDF documents from being opened automatically by the Web browser
Disable JavaScript
Disable PDFShell extension by removing or renaming the Acrord32info.exe file
