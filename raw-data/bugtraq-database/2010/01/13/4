-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-0072

-- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

-- Affected Products:
Oracle Secure Backup

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Secure Backup. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the Oracle Secure Backup Services daemon
observiced.exe listening on TCP port 10000 by default. Due to the lack
of bounds checking on the reverse lookup of connections to the port a
stack overflow can occur leading to a complete compromise of the
affected system under the credentials of the SYSTEM account.
