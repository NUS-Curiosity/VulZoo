Subject: RE: All China, All The Time

So, apparently my "witty" tag via Google Translate means something I didn't quite mean.  Surprise, surprise.  Luckily it wasn't something vulgar, (that's what I get for trusting Google Translate and trying to be funny) but what I meant it to say was "If you can read this, don't bother replying because my servers won't get it."  However, it seems to mean something like "don't reply because you are not welcome here" or similar.  That wasn't my intention, as it seems to infer I actually have something against the Chinese people and not their networks, which I take issue with.

Sorry for the poorly translated reference.
