Fun stuff...

 From here (Brazil) neither me nor anyone I asked, even through 
different carriers, are getting this kind of data while looking at 
http://e107.org/news.php.... I am not someone that talks here, but I 
believe that it should be looked with more care. I use Sophos here (up 
to date) and no warning was sent, so it gave me something to wander...

If someone wishes, I can pvt the content we got here from the site to 
compare...

Best Regards,

Fernando Augusto
