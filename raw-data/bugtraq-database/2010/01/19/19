Subject: Re: facebook 'routing flaw'?

There is a fairly in depth discussion of the issue here:

http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2010/01/facebook-att-play-fast-and-loose-with-user-authentication.ars

Not a routing issue, more of a proxy issue, and not uncommon in mobile carrier networks. Getting security right in a mobile application is tricky given how carriers manage Internet access. With the growth of smartphones these kinds of issues will become more prevalent until carriers refactor how they manage traffic via their proxy's. I'll also note that while the referenced article suggests the use of SSL, there are issues with support in the mobile environment for SSL in terms of which certificate authorities are pre-installed on phones, whether applications have access to the certificate store on the mobile device (or need an embedded certificate), how certificate chaining and wildcarding is supported, and so on.
