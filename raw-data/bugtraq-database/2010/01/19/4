Subject: facebook 'routing flaw'?

AP Report says it was a 'routing problem'? any idea what they are 
talking about, do THEY know what they are talking about?
Did AT&T mix up the destination ip addresses? did facebook NOT CHECK IP 
ADDRESS AND COOKIES and disable the session when the ip changed?

SAN FRANCISCO – A Georgia mother and her two daughters logged onto 
Facebook from mobile phones last weekend and wound up in a startling 
place: strangers' accounts with full access to troves of private 
information.

The glitch — the result of a routing problem at the family's wireless 
carrier, AT&T — revealed a little known security flaw with far reaching 
implications for everyone on the Internet, not just Facebook users.
