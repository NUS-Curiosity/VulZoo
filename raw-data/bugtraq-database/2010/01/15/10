Absolutely - If possible, please read the article at:
http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1900/1

It's dated, but the concepts hold true.  The entire implementation is based on research and analysis, and of course, business applicability.  To be sure, I receive significant US-based attack traffic, but I can't block that for business reasons.  Unfortunately, many people see "block China" and immediately say "oh, that's unrealistic and ineffective."  This is not an Internet based suggestion - it is a simply a toolset one may use to implement country-by-country, protocol-by-protocol based access policy.  It's the same thing we do now from a protocol standpoint, but this simply allows one to aggregate data by geographic location.  I have no business need for traffic to/from China and many other countries (which I also block) so even in the absence of hard attack traffic, "least privilege" dictates that it is valid to disallow traffic from sources that are not needed.

Of course.  You can apply the sets without blocking.  In fact, I recommend that FIRST in the article.  That way you can report on and analyze traffic from sources to make your own decisions on an ongoing basis.  When the time comes, you can change your policy as needed.  I currently block traffic from Russia, but I might start allowing in SMTP since this Anastasia chick I get emails from on my other address seems pretty hot.  :)

Totally agreed.  Sorry if I said something that inferred any scale above individual/corporate.

And, of course, there's nothing to say this will have any effect on attacks from "evil" people in the countries I block when they can easily source the attacks from networks I allow.  It just provides security-in-depth.

You and I seem perfectly aligned on that, as I state in the article. I would hope that other people would read it first without jumping to the conclusion that I'm making sweeping blocking suggestions (not saying you are).

Agreed, and noted above.
