-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of SAP Crystal Reports. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the ebus-3-3-2-6.dll module responsible
for parsing GIOP requests for multiple processes. While parsing the
first packet the function OBGIOPServerWorker::extractHeader trusts the
provided size of the next packet and attempts to re-allocate a buffer.
By providing a large enough value an integer overflow can occur and the
buffer can become undersized. A later memory copy using the original
value specified in the packet can copy controlled data to the heap
buffer. The affected services spawn multiple threads frequently enough
that an attacker can theoretically win a race condition by sending
multiple requests thus forcing the process to access the corrupted
memory while the overflow is occurring. Successful exploitation would
lead to remote code execution in the context of the SYSTEM user.
