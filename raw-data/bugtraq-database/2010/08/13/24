[MajorSecurity SA-080]WordPress 3.0.1 - Cross Site Scripting Issue

Details
=============
Product: WordPress 3.0.1
Security-Risk: low
Remote-Exploit: yes
Vendor-URL: http://www.wordpress.org/
Advisory-Status: published

Credits
=============
Discovered by: David Vieira-Kurz of MajorSecurity

Affected Products:
=============
WordPress 3.0.1
Prior versions may also be vulnerable

Description
=============
"WordPress is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog." - from wordpress.org

More Details
=============
I have discovered some vulnerabilities in WordPress 3.0.1, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct reflected cross-site scripting attacks. Input passed directly to the "checked[0]" parameter in "wp-admin/plugins.php" when the "action" parameter is set to "delete-selected" is not properly sanitised before being stored and returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Solution
=============
Web applications should never trust on user generated input and therefore sanatize all input. Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
