-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-1784

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Apple

-- Affected Products:
Apple WebKit

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Safari's Webkit. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within Webkit's support for generated content.
When utilizing generated content on a particular element, the library
will insert more than one reference of the generated element element.
During page destruction the application will navigate through the
reference to discover more elements to destroy. This can lead to code
execution under the context of the application.


-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
