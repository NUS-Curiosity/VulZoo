Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 August 04 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco Firewall Services Module
(FWSM) for the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600
Series Routers that may cause the Cisco FWSM to reload after
processing crafted SunRPC or certain TCP packets. Repeated
exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Workarounds are available for the vulnerabilities
disclosed in this advisory.

Note:  These vulnerabilities are independent of each other. A device
may be affected by one vulnerability and not affected by another.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100804-fwsm.shtml

Note:  The Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are
affected by the SunRPC inspection vulnerabilities described in this
advisory. A separate Cisco Security Advisory has been published to
disclose this and other vulnerabilities that affect the Cisco ASA
5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. The advisory is available
at:

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) for the Cisco Catalyst 6500
Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities. Affected versions of Cisco FWSM Software vary
depending on the specific vulnerability.

SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cisco FWSM Software version 3.x and 4.x are affected by these
vulnerabilities only if SunRPC inspection is enabled. SunRPC
inspection is enabled by default.

To check if SunRPC inspection is enabled, use the "show service-policy
| include sunrpc" command and confirm that the command returns output,
as shown in the following example:

    fwsm#show service-policy | include sunrpc
          Inspect: sunrpc , packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0

Alternatively, a device that has SunRPC inspection enabled has a
configuration similar to the following:

    class-map inspection_default
     match default-inspection-traffic
    !
    policy-map global_policy
     class inspection_default
      ...
      inspect sunrpc
      ...
    !
    service-policy global_policy global

Note:  The Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are
affected by the SunRPC inspection vulnerabilities described in this
advisory. A separate Cisco Security Advisory has been published to
disclose this and other vulnerabilities that affect the Cisco ASA
5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. The advisory is available
at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100804-asa.shtml

TCP Denial of Service Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cisco FWSM Software version 3.x and 4.x are affected by this
vulnerability when configured in multi-mode (with virtual firewalls)
and with any of the following features:

  * ASDM Administrative Access
  * Telnet
  * SSH

To verify if the FWSM is running in multiple mode, use the "show mode"
command, as shown in the following example:

    FWSM(config)#show mode
    Security context mode: multiple
    The flash mode is the SAME as the running mode.

The following commands are used to enable the HTTPS server and allow
only hosts on the inside interface with an address in the 192.168.1.0
/24 network to create ASDM, SSH or Telnet connections:

    asa(config)# http server enable
    asa(config)# http 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 inside
    asa(config)# telnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 inside
    asa(config)# ssh 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 inside

Determining Software Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To determine the version of Cisco FWSM Software that is running,
issue the "show module" command from Cisco IOS Software or Cisco
Catalyst Operating System Software to identify what modules and sub
modules are installed on the system.

The following example shows a system with a Cisco FWSM (WS-SVC-FWM-1)
installed in slot 2:

    switch>show module
    Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.

    Mod MAC addresses                       Hw    Fw           Sw           Status
    --- ---------------------------------- ------ ------------ ------------ -------
      1  0009.11e3.ade8 to 0009.11e3.adf7   5.1   6.3(1)       8.5(0.46)RFW Ok
      2  0018.ba41.5092 to 0018.ba41.5099   4.0   7.2(1)       3.2(2)10     Ok
      3  0014.a90c.9956 to 0014.a90c.995d   5.0   7.2(1)       5.1(6)E1     Ok
      4  0014.a90c.66e6 to 0014.a90c.66ed   1.7                4.2(3)       Ok

    [...]

After locating the correct slot, issue the "show module <slot number>"
command to identify the software version that is running, as shown in
the following example:

    switch>show module 2
    Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.
    --- ----- -------------------------------------- ------------------ -----------
      2    6  Firewall Module                        WS-SVC-FWM-1       SAD10360485
    
    Mod MAC addresses                       Hw    Fw           Sw           Status
    --- ---------------------------------- ------ ------------ ------------ -------
      2  0018.ba41.5092 to 0018.ba41.5099   4.0   7.2(1)       3.2(2)10     Ok
    
    [...]

The preceding example shows that the FWSM is running software version
3.2(2)10 as indicated by the column under "Sw."

Note:  Recent versions of Cisco IOS Software will show the software
version of each module in the output from the "show module" command;
therefore, executing the "show module <slot number>" command is not
necessary.

If a Virtual Switching System (VSS) is used to allow two physical
Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches to operate as a single logical
virtual switch, the "show module switch all" command can display the
software version of all FWSMs that belong to switch 1 and switch 2.
The output from this command will be similar to the output from the 
"show module <slot number>" but will include module information for the
modules in each switch in the VSS.

Alternatively, version information can be obtained directly from the
FWSM through the show version command, as shown in the following
example:

    FWSM> show version
    FWSM Firewall Version 3.2(2)10 
    [...]

Customers who use the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM)
to manage their devices can find the version of the software
displayed in the table in the login window or in the upper left
corner of the ASDM window. The version notation is similar to the
following example.

    FWSM Version: 3.2(2)10

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

With the exception of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security
Appliances, no other Cisco products are currently known to be
affected by these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco FWSM is a high-speed, integrated firewall module for Cisco
Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers. The FWSM
offers firewall services with stateful packet filtering and deep
packet inspection.

SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Cisco FWSM is affected by three vulnerabilities that may cause
the device to reload during the processing of different crafted
SunRPC messages when SunRPC inspection is enabled.

Note:  These vulnerabilities are only triggered by transit traffic;
traffic that is destined to the device does not trigger these
vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCte61710, 
CSCte61622, and CSCte61662; and have been assigned Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2010-2818, CVE-2010-2819,
and CVE-2010-2820, respectively.

TCP Denial of Service Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can partition a single FWSM into multiple virtual devices, known
as security contexts. Each context has its own security policy,
interfaces, and administrators. Multiple contexts are similar to
multiple standalone devices. Many features are supported in multiple
context mode, which includes routing tables, firewall features, and
management.

Cisco FWSM is affected by a denial of service vulnerability that
could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a reload when
sending a series of TCP packets. The Cisco FWSM is only affected by
this vulnerability when is configured in multi-mode (with virtual
firewalls) and configured to accept Telnet, SSH or ASDM connections.

Note:  A TCP three-way handshake is needed to exploit this
vulnerability. This vulnerability is only triggered by traffic that
is destined to the affected device; transit traffic does not trigger
this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtg68694 
and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
CVE-2010-2821.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

and navigating to:

Security > Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Firewall Services Module > Firewall Services Module (FWSM) Software

Workarounds
===========

The SunRPC inspection vulnerabilities can be mitigated by disabling
SunRPC inspection, if it is not required. Administrators can disable
SunRPC inspection by issuing the "no inspect sunrpc" command in class
configuration sub-mode within policy-map configuration.

The TCP DoS vulnerability can be mitigated by only allowing trusted
hosts to communicate with the FWSM via HTTPs, SSH, or Telnet. For
example, the following commands are used to enable the HTTPS server
and allow only hosts on the inside interface with an address in the
192.168.1.0/24 network to create ASDM, SSH or Telnet connections:

    asa(config)# http server enable
    asa(config)# http 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 inside
    asa(config)# telnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 inside
    asa(config)# ssh 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 inside

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:
