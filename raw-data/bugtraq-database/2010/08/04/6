Affected Products
=================

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are affected by
multiple vulnerabilities. Affected versions of Cisco ASA Software
will vary depending on the specific vulnerability.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

For specific version information, refer to the Software Versions and
Fixes section of this advisory.

SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities affect the SunRPC
inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security
Appliances. A successful attack may result in a sustained DoS
condition.

Versions 7.2.x, 8.0.x, 8.1.x, and 8.2.x are affected. SunRPC
inspection is enabled by default.

To check if SunRPC inspection is enabled, issue the "show
service-policy | include sunrpc" command and confirm that output, such
as what is displayed in the following example, is returned.

    ciscoasa# show service-policy | include sunrpc
          Inspect: sunrpc, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0

The following configuration commands are used to enable SunRPC
inspection in the Cisco ASA.

    class-map inspection_default
     match default-inspection-traffic
    !
    policy-map global_policy
     class inspection_default
      ...
      inspect sunrpc 
      ...
    !
    service-policy global_policy global

Transport Layer Security (TLS) Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three DoS vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco ASA security appliances
that can be triggered by a series of crafted TLS packets. A
successful attack may result in a sustained DoS condition. Versions
7.2.x, 8.0.x, 8.1.x, 8.2.x, and 8.3.x are affected by one or more of
these vulnerabilities. A Cisco ASA device configured for any of the
following features is affected:

  * Secure Socket Layer Virtual Private Network (SSL VPN)
  * When the affected device is configured to accept Cisco Adaptive
    Security Device Manager (ASDM) connections
  * TLS Proxy for Encrypted Voice Inspection
  * Cut-Through Proxy for Network Access when using HTTPS

SSL VPN (or WebVPN) is enabled with the "enable <interface name>"
command in "webvpn" configuration mode. SSL VPN is disabled by default.
The following configuration snippet provides an example of a SSL VPN
configuration.

    webvpn
     enable outside
    ...

ASDM access is affected by three of these vulnerabilities. To use
ASDM, the HTTPS server must be enabled to allow HTTPS connections to
the Cisco ASA. The server can be enabled using the "http server enable
[port]" command. The default port is 443. To specify hosts that can
access the HTTP server internal to the security appliance, use the 
"http" command in global configuration mode.

The TLS Proxy for Encrypted Voice Inspection feature is affected by
these vulnerabilities. This feature was introduced in Cisco ASA
version 8.0(2) and is disabled by default.

To determine if the TLS Proxy for Encrypted Voice Inspection feature
is enabled on the device, use the show tls-proxy command, as shown in
the following example:

    ciscoasa# show tls-proxy
    Maximum number of sessions: 1200
    
    TLS-Proxy 'sip_proxy': ref_cnt 1, seq# 3
    Server proxy:
    Trust-point: local_ccm
    Client proxy:
    Local dynamic certificate issuer: LOCAL-CA-SERVER
    Local dynamic certificate key-pair: phone_common
    Cipher suite:  aes128-sha1 aes256-sha1
    Run-time proxies:
        Proxy 0xcbae1538: Class-map: sip_ssl, Inspect: sip
        Active sess 1, most sess 3, byte 3456043
    ...
    <output truncated>

TLS proxy supports SIP and Skinny protocols. TLS proxy for Skinny
inspection can be enabled using the "inspect skinny <skinny_map>
tls-proxy <proxy_name>", as shown in the following example:

    asa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default
    asa(config-pmap-c)# inspect skinny my-inspect tls-proxy my-tls-proxy
    asa(config)# service-policy global_policy global

Note:  Secure SCCP uses TCP port 2443; however, it can be configured
to a different port.

TLS proxy for SIP inspection can be enabled using the "inspect sip
<map> tls-proxy <proxy_name>", as shown in the following example:

    asa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default
    asa(config-pmap-c)# inspect sip my-inspect tls-proxy my-tls-proxy
    asa(config)# service-policy global_policy global

The Cisco ASA is also vulnerable when the Cut-Through Proxy for
Network Access feature is used with HTTPS. This feature is enabled
for direct authentication using HTTPS with the "aaa authentication
listener https" command, as shown in the following example:

    ASA(config)# aaa authentication listener https inside port 443 

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A DoS vulnerability affects the SIP inspection feature of Cisco ASA
5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. Versions 7.0.x, 7.1.x,
7.2.x are not affected. Versions 8.0.x, 8.1.x, and 8.2.x are
affected. SIP inspection is enabled by default.

To check if SIP inspection is enabled, issue the "show service-policy
| include sip" command and confirm that output, such as what is
displayed in the following example, is returned.

    ciscoasa#show service-policy | include sip
          Inspect: sip , packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0

Alternatively, an appliance that has SIP inspection enabled has a
configuration similar to the following:

    class-map inspection_default
     match default-inspection-traffic
    !
    policy-map global_policy
     class inspection_default
      ...
      inspect sip
      ...
    !
    service-policy global_policy global

Note:  The service policy could also be applied to a specific
interface instead of a global configuration shown in the previous
example.

Crafted Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Message Denial of Service Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance versions 7.0.x,
7.1.x, 7.2.x, 8.0.x, 8.1.x, and 8.2.x are affected. IKE is not
enabled by default. If IKE is enabled, the "isakmp enable <interface
name>" command appears in the configuration.

Cisco PIX 500 Series Security Appliance Vulnerability Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cisco PIX 500 Series Security Appliances are affected by the SunRPC,
TLS, and IKE message DoS vulnerabilities.

Because the Cisco PIX 500 Series Security Appliances reached End of
Software Maintenance Releases on July 28, 2009, no further software
releases will be available for the Cisco PIX 500 Series Security
Appliances. Cisco PIX 500 Series Security Appliances customers are
encouraged to migrate to Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security
Appliances or to implement any applicable workarounds that are listed
in the Workarounds section of this advisory. Fixed software is
available for the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.
For more information, refer to the End of Life announcement at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/vpndevc/ps5708/ps5709/ps2030/end_of_life_notice_cisco_pix_525_sec_app.html

How to Determine the Running Software Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is
running on an appliance, administrators can issue the "show version"
command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive
Security Appliance that is running software version 8.3(1):

    ASA#show version | include Version
    Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.3(1) 
    Device Manager Version 6.3(1)

Customers who use Cisco ASDM to manage devices can locate the
software version in the table that is displayed in the login window
or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

With the exception of the Cisco FWSM, no other Cisco products are
currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance is a modular
platform that provides security and VPN services. It offers firewall,
intrusion prevention system (IPS), anti-X, and VPN services.

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are affected by
the following vulnerabilities:

SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Sun RPC inspection engine enables or disables application
inspection for the Sun RPC protocol. Sun RPC is used by Network File
System (NFS) and Network Information Service (NIS). Sun RPC services
can run on any port. When a client attempts to access a Sun RPC
service on a server, it must learn the port that service is running
on. The client does this by querying the port mapper process, usually
rpcbind, on the well-known port of 111. Three DoS vulnerabilities
affect the SunRPC inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series
Adaptive Security Appliances, in which an unauthenticated attacker
may cause the affected device to reload.

Note:  Only transit traffic can trigger these vulnerabilities;
traffic that is destined to the appliance will not trigger the
vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by using UDP
packets, not TCP.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCtc77567,
CSCtc79922, and CSCtc85753; and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2010-1578, CVE-2010-1579, and CVE-2010-1580,
respectively.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TLS and its predecessor, SSL, are cryptographic protocols that
provide security for communications over IP data networks such as the
Internet.

Three vulnerabilities exist on the Cisco ASA security appliances that
can be triggered by a series of crafted TLS packets. An
unauthenticated attacker may cause the affected device to reload. A
Cisco ASA device configured for SSL VPN, TLS Proxy for Encrypted
Voice Inspection, or configured to accept ASDM management connections
is vulnerable.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCtd32627,
CSCtf37506, and CSCtf55259; and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2010-1581, CVE-2010-2814, and CVE-2010-2815,
respectively.

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SIP, as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),
enables call handling sessions, particularly two-party audio
conferences, or "calls." SIP works with SDP for call signalling. SDP
specifies the ports for the media stream. Using SIP, the Cisco ASA
can support any SIP VoIP gateways and VoIP proxy servers. To support
SIP calls through the Cisco ASA, signaling messages for the media
connection addresses, media ports, and embryonic connections for the
media must be inspected, because while the signaling is sent over a
well-known destination port (UDP/TCP 5060), the media streams are
dynamically allocated. Also, SIP embeds IP addresses in the user-data
portion of the IP packet. SIP inspection applies NAT for these
embedded IP addresses.

A DoS vulnerability affects the SIP inspection feature of Cisco ASA
5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. SIP inspection is enabled
by default. During successful exploitation, an unauthenticated
attacker may cause the affected device to reload.

Note:  Only transit traffic can trigger these vulnerabilities;
traffic that is destined to the appliance will not trigger the
vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtd32106 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2010-2816.

Crafted Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Message Denial of Service Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IPsec is an IP security feature that provides robust authentication
and encryption of IP packets. IKE is a key management protocol
standard that is used in conjunction with the IPsec standard. A DoS
vulnerability exists in the IKE implementation of the Cisco ASA.
During successful exploitation, an unauthenticated attacker may cause
an affected device to reload.

Note:  Only traffic that is destined to the appliance may trigger
this vulnerability when the affected device is configured for IPsec
remote access or site-to-site VPNs.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCte46507 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2010-2817.

Workarounds
===========

This Security Advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities and their respective workarounds are
independent of each other. In addition to the recommendations
described below, mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100804-asa.shtml

SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

These vulnerabilities can be mitigated by disabling SunRPC inspection
if it is not required. Administrators can disable SunRPC inspection
by issuing the "no inspect sunrpc" command in class configuration
sub-mode within policy-map configuration.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If SSL VPN (clientless or client-based) is not needed, it can be
disabled by issuing the "clear configure webvpn" command.

Administrators should make sure that ASDM connections are only
allowed from trusted hosts.

To identify the IP addresses from which the security appliance
accepts HTTPS connections for ASDM, configure the http command for
each trusted host address or subnet. The following example, shows how
a trusted host with IP address 192.168.1.100 is added to the
configuration:

        hostname(config)# http 192.168.1.100 255.255.255.255

The TLS Proxy for Encrypted Voice Inspection feature is affected by
these vulnerabilities. This feature can be disabled if it is not
needed. Temporarily disabling the feature will mitigate these
vulnerabilities.

The Cut-Through Proxy for Network Access feature, when configured for
HTTPS, is affected by these vulnerabilities. The only workaround is
to disable the feature if not needed. To disable HTTPS Cut-Through
Proxy authentication use the "no aaa authentication listener https"
command, as shown in the following example:

    ASA(config)# no  aaa authentication listener https inside port 443 

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling SIP inspection if it
is not required. Administrators can disable SIP inspection by issuing
the "no inspect sip" command in class configuration sub-mode within
policy-map configuration.

Crafted Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Message Denial of Service Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability apart from disabling
IKE on the affected device. The "no crypto isakmp enable
<interface-name>" command can be used to disable IKE on a specific
interface.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
