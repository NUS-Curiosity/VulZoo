-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is
required in that a target must open a malicious media file or visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the codec responsible for parsing layer
3 MPEG audio streams. By providing invalid values within the stream,
heap memory can be easily corrupted. This could be leveraged by an
attacker to execute remote code under the context of the user running
the application.
