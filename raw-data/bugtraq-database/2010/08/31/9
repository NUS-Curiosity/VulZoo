-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the QTPlugin.ocx ActiveX control. The
plugin accepts a parameter named _Marshaled_pUnk that it uses as a valid
pointer. By specifying invalid values an attacker can force the
application to jump to a controlled location in memory. This can be
exploited to execute remote code under the context of the user running
the web browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple states:
This issue has been publicly disclosed by an independent researcher.
Update from Apple is still in progress.
