Subject: [Positive Technologies Research] Open Source WebEngine and Web
 Crawler v.0.2 is out!

==============================================================

============= Positive Technologies Research Lab =============

==============================================================

         Open Source WebEngine and Web Crawler (Beta)

==============================================================


---[   Introduction

	Web Crawler is a utility designed for testing and demonstration of the WebEngine open source library features. This program gathers information about the resources of a specified web server by analyzing references in the HTML markup, text, and JavaScript code. Additionally, a query is sent to the Web Of Trust knowledge base to obtain information about the analyzed site. This check demonstrates analysis of web application vulnerabilities.

The main features provided by the application are listed below:

	- JavaScript analysis aimed at receiving references with simulation of a DOM structure
	- Access to the contents of web servers via HTTP
	- Support of the Basic, Digest, and NTLM authorization schemes
	- Operation via proxy servers with various authorization schemes
	- A wide variety of options to describe the scan target (lists of scanned domains, restriction of scanning to a host, a domain, or a web server directory, etc.)
	- Modular structure, which allows one to implement plug-ins

---[ Package Structure ]

	The package consists of two main components: the crawler utility and a XUL-based GUI. To display the GUI, one can use the Firefox browser or a specialized application (e.g. xulrunner or prism).
	The application root directory contains the utility binary files and the XUL configuration file (application.ini). The nested-directories structure is defined by the rules of formation of applications based on XUL. A user may be interested in the chrome/skin directory, which contains files describing the application appearance. The package offers several pre-installed themes. To change the appearance, it is sufficiently to replace the contents of the chrome/skin/classic directory with the chosen theme. A new theme can be created on the basis of an existing one or by modifying themes from the site http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/. The themes downloaded from this site should be supplemented with some images and CSS descriptions by analogy with the existing ones.



---[ ToDo ]

The Crawler utility and WebEngine library:

	- Tests for web application vulnerabilities
	- Improve the operation stability and performance
	- Broaden the JavaScript support
	- And a number of others

GUI:
	- Broaden the settings on the Settings tab to avoid necessity of manual utility configuration
	- Implement the feature of viewing log files with filtering and highlighting of the message levels
