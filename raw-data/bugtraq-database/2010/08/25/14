-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing .dir
and .dcr files. The director file format is RIFF based. While parsing an
undocumented record of type 0xFFFFFFF8 the process trusts two user
supplied word values when performing arithmetic to calculate a heap
buffer size. By specifying large enough values an integer wrap can
occur. The allocated heap buffer can later be overflowed with user
supplied data. This can be leveraged by attackers to execute remote code
under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
