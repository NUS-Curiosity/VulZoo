TPTI-10-14: Adobe Shockwave Director rcsL Chunk Pointer Offset Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-10-14
August 24, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-2867

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing the
Director RIFF based file format. While handling the rcsL chunk, code
within DIRAPIX sign-extends a return value from a call to Ordinal1412
within the IML32X module. This ordinal is responsible for unmarshalling
a WORD value from the RIFF chunk. If the value is signed, DIRAPIX
sign-extends the value, performs arithmetic on it, and then proceeds to
use it as an offset into a heap-based buffer. By supplying any of a
specific range of values, an attacker can exploit this condition to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the web
browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
