true - so in an ideal world, we would need DNSSec everywhere and strict
certificate checking to significantly reduce the possibility of MiTM
attacks. In a not so ideal world, every little bit helps, so if we can
get mail servers to routinely use encryption between each other, that's
a nice first step and using valid certificates that can actually be
verified is a second one. Both will help significantly already.
