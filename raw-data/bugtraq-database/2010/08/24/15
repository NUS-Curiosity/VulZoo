Subject: London DEFCON - DC4420 - August meet - Wednesday 25th August 2010

allegedly, it's that time of the month again...

as all our speakers are either dying from strep throat having spent more 
hours than is medically advisable in the company of desert heat and/or 
air conditioning, or are sunning themselves on some far away beach where 
dc4420 is the last thing on their minds, this month will be largely a 
social, where you get to buy me beer, interrupted only by a couple of 
lightning talks should the urge to speak overwhelm one or more of you...

oh look, we have a volunteer already! alien will explain why chicago 
should absolutely positively be the last place you transit through on 
the way to vegas, and what happened when he got there...

     Upstairs at The Black Horse, 6 Rathbone Place, W1T 1HH
