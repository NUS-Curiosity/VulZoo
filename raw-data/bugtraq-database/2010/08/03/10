Like, without salting and stretching/strengthening?  That's not the best
suggestion.  I try to explain this without going into too much detail here:

http://www.openwall.com/articles/PHP-Users-Passwords#salting

At this time, vendors should implement either bcrypt (Blowfish-based):

http://www.openwall.com/crypt/

or SHA-crypt (usually the kind of it based on SHA-512, because that
makes better use of 64-bit CPUs):

http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/sha-crypt.html

There's almost no security difference between these two.  Both should
be replaced with something even better eventually - along the lines of
scrypt (adding more parallelism and configurable memory cost) - but
we're not ready for that yet (no peer-reviewed and agreed upon
implementation to recommend to vendors, even though some ideas in this
area have been floating around since 1990s).
