Subject: [Suspected Spam]New vulnerabilities in CMS SiteLogic

Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about new security vulnerabilities in CMS SiteLogic. It's 
Ukrainian commercial CMS. In addition to previously reported 
vulnerabilities, I will report about vulnerabilities in this CMS, which I 
disclosed in 2009 (it's second advisory with vulnerabilities which I 
disclosed last year).

-----------------------------
Advisory: New vulnerabilities in CMS SiteLogic
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/3580/
-----------------------------
Affected products: all versions of CMS SiteLogic.
-----------------------------
Timeline:

16.01.2009 - found XSS vulnerability.
06.04.2009 - found Command Execution vulnerability.
28.06.2009 - when I was informing developers about previous holes (which I 
wrote about in previous advisory), I mentioned them that there are many 
other holes in their CMS (but they ignored as previous holes, as new ones).
10.10.2009 - disclosed at my site.
11.10.2009 - additionally informed developers.
-----------------------------
Details:

These are Cross-Site Scripting and Command Execution vulnerabilities.

XSS:

http://site/?mid=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

Command Execution:

It's possible to upload arbitrary files (shell upload) via module “Banner 
system” in admin panel.
