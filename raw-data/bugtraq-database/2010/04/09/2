4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Pulse CMS, which 
can be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system.

An error in the validation of uploaded image files can be exploited to
upload files with an arbitrary extension to a folder within the web
root. This can be exploited to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code.

Successful exploitation requires authentication.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Partially fixed in version 1.2.4.

It can still be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading 
a malicious PHP script with multiple extensions (e.g. "shell.php.gif")
if Apache is not configured to handle the mime-type for media files 
with an e.g. "gif" extension.
