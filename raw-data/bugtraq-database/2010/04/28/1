Subject: Adobe viewer plugin can be made to crash IE or FF

I have discovered a way to craft a web-page that causes IE8 and FF3.51 =
to crash when a PDF document is embedded, and viewed with the latest =
adobe viewer plugin.

I do not know if the bug allows execution of code or anything because =
this assessment is beyond my skill.

I tried notifying Adobe about it, but of course they say they won't =
respond to the report so I cannot know if it is taken seriously or even =
looked at.

I'm happy to describe to someone how to cause the crash if they can make =
a better analysis of it than me. Can anyone suggest who or where to send =
this to, so a proper analysis can be made?
