CVE-2010-0843

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sun's Java Runtime Environment. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within a function responsible for allocating
objects in the com.sun.media.sound libraries. This function takes an
integer parameter and adds a fixed amount to it before allocating from
the heap. This can be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution by
forcing a call to this allocator with a large enough integer parameter.

-- Vendor Response:
Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
