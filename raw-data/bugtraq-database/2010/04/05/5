-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a
malicious file.

The specific flaw exists in QuickTimeMPEG.qtx and results when QuickTime
attempts to parse a malformed 'genl' atom that may be present in any
QuickTime media file. A heap overflow is caused when QuickTime fails to
perform proper bounds checking on the amount of data copied to the heap
by a set of nested loops which can result in arbitrary code execution.
