-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Mac OS X. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the Apple ImageIO framework during the
parsing of malformed JPEG2000 files. The function
CGImageReadGetBytesAtOffset can utilize miscalculated values during a
memmove operation that will result in an exploitable heap corruption
allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
current user.
