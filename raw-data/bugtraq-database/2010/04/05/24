Subject: Vulnerabilities in HoloCMS

Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in HoloCMS.

-----------------------------
Advisory: Vulnerabilities in HoloCMS
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/4068/
-----------------------------
Timeline:
17.03.2010 - found vulnerabilities.
25.03.2010 - disclosed at my site.
27.03.2010 - informed developers.
-----------------------------
Details:

These are Insufficient Anti-automation and Denial of Service
vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities exist in captcha script CaptchaSecurityImages.php, which
is using in this system. I already reported about vulnerabilities in
CaptchaSecurityImages (http://websecurity.com.ua/4043/).

Insufficient Anti-automation:

http://site/captcha/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=150&height=100&characters=2

Captcha bypass is possible as via half-automated or automated (with using of
OCR) methods, which were mentioned before (http://websecurity.com.ua/4043/),
as with using of session reusing with constant captcha bypass method
(http://websecurity.com.ua/1551/), which was described in project Month of
Bugs in Captchas. Last variant of attack is possible due to incorrect
implementation of protection in the system against this captcha bypass
method (only in 1.x versions).

DoS:

http://site/captcha/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=1000&height=9000

With setting of large values of width and height it's possible to create
large load at the server.

Vulnerable are HoloCMS 1.3.1, 3.1 and previous versions.

Best wishes & regards,
