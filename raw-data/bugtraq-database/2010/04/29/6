Subject: CONFidence 2010, 25-26th May - Call For Participation

########## INTRO ##########
In response to last year's high interest in the Krakow edition of
CONFidence we would like to sincerely inform and invite you to the
next event which will be held in Krakow, on the 25-26 May.

########## CONFidence & PH-NEUTRAL ##########
CONFidence is an internationally recognized conference where
practitioners, researchers, and developers in computer security meet,
learn and exchange practical ideas and experiences. The
world's top-class specialists, two days of lectures presenting new, so
far non-disclosed research results, more than 400 participants - all
of this during 7th edition of the CONFidence Conference. If you plan
to participate in a ph-neutral, you should previously come
to Krakow and, then together with a group of hackers at the end of May
move to Berlin.

########## CONFidence not only conference ##########
CONFidence is not only the conference but first and foremost gathering
of people who every day break system limits and IT solutions and at
the same time seek to improve their safety. It is also professional
workshops, discussion panels, stay in the Hackers' Squad, and
whole-day "underground" event. The meeting in May will bring two days
of non-stop hacking, hot talk topics, all in Krakow - Central Europe's
entertainment and party capital city. During the conference for the
participants wait multiple interesting attractions, games and
contests.
