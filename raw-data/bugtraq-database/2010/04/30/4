   AMSTERDAM, Nederland -- The sixth annual EUSecWest applied technical

   - will be held in downtown Amsterdam at the the Melkweg Multimedia

   experience will be presented in a series of informative tutorials.

   The EUSecWest meeting provides international researchers a relaxed,
   comfortable environment to learn from informative tutorials on key
   developments in security technology, and collaborate and socialize with
   their peers in one of the world's most scenic cities - a short walk
   away from several large hotels and the Leidseplein entertainment and
   shopping district, conveniently close to many famous museums,
   convenient transport, Vondel Park, and a plentitude of restaurants and
   bars.

   Security Masters Dojo expert network security sensei instructors, and
   their advanced, and intermediate, hands-on training courses - featuring
   small class sizes and practical application excercises to maximize
   information transfer.

   lightning talk proposals for selection by the CanSecWest technical
   review committee. This year we will be doing one hour talks, and some
   shorter talk sessions.

   Please make your paper proposal submissions before May 5th, 2010.

   travel and accommodations for the speakers. If you have a proposal for a
   tutorial session then please make your submission by mailing a plain
   text version of the information along with any other supporting
   material or formats to synopsis of the material and your biography,

--   will be opening up the presentation guidelines to include talks not in
   English (particularly Chinese) which we will offer to translate for the
   speaker if they are not a native English speaker.

   The EUSecWest 2010 conference consists of tutorials on technical
   details about current issues, innovative techniques and best practices
   in the information security realm. The audiences are a multi-national
   mix of professionals involved on a daily basis with security work:
   security product vendors, programmers, security officers, and network
   administrators. We give preference to technical details and new
   education for a technical audience.

   The conference itself is a single track series of presentations in a
   lecture theater environment. The presentations offer speakers the
   opportunity to showcase on-going research and collaborate with peers
   while educating and highlighting advancements in security products and
   techniques. The focus is on innovation, tutorials, and education
   instead of product pitches. Some commercial content is tolerated, but
   it needs to be backed up by a technical presenter - either giving a
   valuable tutorial and best practices instruction or detailing
   significant new technology in the products.

   Paper proposals should consist of the following information:
    1. Presenter, and geographical location (country of origin/passport)
       and contact info (e-mail, postal address, phone, fax).
    2. Employer and/or affiliations.
    3. Brief biography, list of publications and papers.
    4. Any significant presentation and educational experience/background.
    5. Topic synopsis, Proposed paper title, and a one paragraph
       description.
    6. Reason why this material is innovative or significant or an
       important tutorial.
    7. Optionally, any samples of prepared material or outlines ready.
    8. Will you have full text available or only slides?
    9. Language of preference for submission.
   10. Please list any other publications or conferences where this
       material has been or will be published/submitted.
