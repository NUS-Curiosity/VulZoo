Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.09.10: VMware VMnc Codec Heap Overflow
 Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.09.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 09, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

VMware Inc. markets several virtualization products such as ACE, Player,
Server, and Workstation. These products include a video coder-decoder
(codec) called 'vmnc.dll', or VMware Movie Decoder, that is registered
on the host machine at installation time. This codec will be used
whenever video streams of the 'VMnc' type, such as those produced when
using VMware Workstation's "Capture Movie" feature, are encountered.
For more information, refer to the links shown below.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in
VMware Inc.'s movie decoder allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability exists due to a lack of input validation when
processing certain specially crafted Audio-Video Interleave (AVI)
files. During processing, a heap buffer will be allocated based on one
part of the AVI file data. However, the amount of data copied into that
buffer is calculated based on a different part of the file. This leads
to an exploitable heap-based buffer overflow condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running an application utilizing
the vulnerable codec. In order to reach the vulnerable code, a targeted
user must play a specially crafted AVI media file. An attacker typically
accomplishes this via social engineering or injecting content into
compromised, trusted sites.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability using the
following software.

  vmnc.dll version 6.5.2.7026 from Workstation 6.5.2
  vmnc.dll version 6.5.3.8888 from Workstation 6.5.3

A full list of affected VMware products can be found in Security
Advisory VMSA-2010-0007.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling the 'VMnc' codec will prevent exploitation. In order to do so,
import the 'disable-vmnc-codec.reg' registry file as follows.

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers32]
  "VIDC.VMnc"=-
  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers32]
  "VIDC.VMnc"=-
