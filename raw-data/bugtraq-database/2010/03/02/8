Subject: [xss] i found a Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability about Discuz!
 'uid' Parameter


i'm sorry, i just write some real sites to confirm the truth of my found, now , i remove it. and thanks for you.
 
 
 
 
Discuz! is prone to an cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks. 
Discuz! 6.0.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected Discuz! 
 
Home Page : http://www.discuz.com/  
 
i found a xss on "uid" parameter in "eccredit.php" in discuz! 6.0.0 , it's "eccredit.php?action=list&uid="  
 
for example:
http://www.example.com:80/eccredit.php?action=list&uid="><script>alert(/Liscker/);</script>
