Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 03.02.10: IBM Lotus Domino Web Access
 ActiveX Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.02.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 02, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

IBM Lotus Domino includes an ActiveX control called Domino Web Access,
which provides Web-based access for Lotus Notes users. The control
features functionality that is used for uploading files and clearing
the cache upon logout. For more information, see the vendor's site
found at the following link.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in
IBM Corp.'s Lotus Domino Web Access ActiveX control could allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current
user.

 The vulnerabe function takes an attacker-controlled URL, and copies it
into a fixed-size stack buffer. No validation checks are performed on
the length of the URL. By passing in a long URL string, it is possible
to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the Web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Web page
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted
sites. After the user visits the malicious Web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow, and there are no
compiler/runtime protections such as stack cookies or safe exception
handling in the module. As such, reliable exploitation is trivial.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Lotus
Domino Web Access version 8.0.2. Previous versions may also be
affected. The libraries that contain the vulnerable code are dwa8.dll
and dwa8w.dll. IBM states that Lotus Domino Web Access versions 6.5,
7.0 and 8.0 are affected.

V. WORKAROUND

The vulnerable ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by
setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs:

{3BFFE033-BF43-11d5-A271-00A024A51325}
{983A9C21-8207-4B58-BBB8-0EBC3D7C5505}
{E008A543-CEFB-4559-912F-C27C2B89F13B}
