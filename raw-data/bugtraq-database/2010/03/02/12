They're using rootkit techniques to prevent the administrator from doing
what - by design and definition - he is *supposed* to be able to do.
Since this is not desireable, failing to do so certainly is not a
vulnerability. And no, there is no such thing as a "good" rootkit.

Any administrator who willingly allows this kind of crap withing arm's
length of their systems needs a good beating with a cluestick. Badly.

Just shows what a big load of bullshit UAC is. I've been successfully
using LUA for years, and I don't see any reason at all to switch to UAC.

You cannot protect a system from its administrator without demoting him
from being administrator. Period. And if you are going to demote him:
who is going to fix your system when things go wrong?
