Subject: QuickZip 0day detailed write-up

In case some of you missed it - I published 2 articles on the Offensive Security Blog (last one was published a few hours ago), explaining the process of building a (not so typical) SEH based exploit for a QuickZip 0day vulnerability.

Part 1 : http://www.offensive-security.com/blog/vulndev/quickzip-stack-bof-0day-a-box-of-chocolates/

Part 2 : http://www.offensive-security.com/blog/vulndev/quickzip-stack-bof-a-box-of-chocolates-part-2/


Enjoy !
