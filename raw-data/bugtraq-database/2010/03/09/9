ZDI-10-025: Microsoft Office Excel XLSX File Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-025
March 9, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-0263

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Office Excel

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a
malicious file.

The specific flaw exists in the decompression of XLSX files. The XLSX
file is a ZIP archive of the associated content making up the new Open
XML Document. Due to the lack of validation on the ZIP header when
decompressing certain XML elements it is possible to execute
uninitialized memory. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code
execution under the credentials of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
