"Writing JIT-Spray Shellcode for fun and profit"

by Alexey Sintsov from DSecRG (dsecrg.com)

Attacks on clients’ browsers have always been the real threat for everyone.
And here vulnerabilities have been not only in the browser but also in plug-ins.
Bank-clients, business software, antivirus software – all of them use ActiveX (for IE)
for clients and here have been and are still many vulnerabilities.
Vendors make steps to defend us from it. Software vendors patch vulnerabilities and OS vendors
use new mechanisms to prevent attacks at all. But security researchers are trying to find way to bypass these mechanisms.
The new versions of browsers (Internet Explorer 8 and FireFox 3.5) use permanent DEP.
And the new versions of OS use the ASLR mechanism. All this makes the old methods of attacks impossible.
But on BlackHat DC 2010 the interesting way to bypass DEP and ASLR in browsers (not only)
and Just-In-Time compilers was presented. This method is called JIT-SPRAY. But here was no one public PoC until now.

In this text we are describe how to write a shellcode for new JIT-Spray attacks and make universal STAGE 0 shellcode
that gives control to any common shellcode from MetaSploit, for example.

As we give much attention on ERP and Business applications security
you can also download new exploits for popular client side Business applications
such as SAP GUI and Oracle Document Capture that use JIT-Spray
Shellcode.
