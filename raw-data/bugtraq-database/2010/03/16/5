-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of SAP MaxDB. Authentication is not required to
exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the serv.exe process which listens by
default on TCP port 7210. The process trusts a value from a handshake
packet and uses it as a length when copying data to the stack. If
provided a malicious value and packet data, this can be leveraged to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.
