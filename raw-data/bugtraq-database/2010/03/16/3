-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable software utilizing Apple's WebKit library. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists due to a failure to unregister a callback
pointer during the destruction of a particular type of element when
embedded inside a 'blink' container. The application dereferences the
original resource which can can be leveraged by an attacker to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the current user.
