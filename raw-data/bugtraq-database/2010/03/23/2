GameSec 2010, the inaugural Conference on Decision and Game Theory for 
Security
will take place on the campus of Technical University Berlin, Germany, on
November 22-23, 2010.

Securing complex and networked systems and managing associated risks become
increasingly important as they play an indispensible role in modern life 
at the
turn of the information age. Concurrently, security of ubiquitous 
communication,
data, and computing pose novel research challenges. Security is a 
multi-faceted
problem due to the complexity of underlying hardware, software, and network
inter- dependencies as well as human and social factors. It involves 
decision
making in multiple levels and multiple time scales, given the limited 
resources
available to both malicious attackers and administrators defending networked
systems.

GameSec conference aims to bring together researchers who aim to establish a
theoretical foundation for making resource allocation decisions that balance
available capabilities and perceived security risks in a principled 
manner. The
conference focuses analytical models based on game, information, 
communication,
optimization, decision, and control theories that are applied to diverse
security topics. At the same time, the connection between theoretical 
models and
real world security problems are emphasized to establish the important 
feedback
loop between theory and practice. Observing the scarcity of venues for
researchers who try to develop a deeper theoretical understanding of the
underlying incentive and resource allocation issues in security, we 
believe that
GameSec will fill an important void and serve as a distinguished forum of
highest standards for years to come.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
* Security games
* Security and risk management
* Mechanism design and incentives
* Decentralized security algorithms
* Security of networked systems
* Security of Web-based services
* Security of social networks
* Intrusion and anomaly detection
* Resource allocation for security
* Optimized response to malware
* Identity management
* Privacy and security
* Reputation and trust
* Information security and watermarking
* Physical layer security in wireless networks
* Information theoretic aspects of security
* Adversarial machine learning
* Distributed learning for security
* Cross-layer security
* Usability and security
* Human behavior and security
* Dynamic control of security systems
* Organizational aspects of risk management
* Cooperation and competition in security
* and more...

Submission instructions will be available on the conference website. 
Prospective
authors are encouraged to submit a PDF version of their full papers in the
announced format and in a font no smaller than 10-points. The initial 
submissions
are limited to 12 single-column pages to decrease the workload of volunteer
reviewers. The camera-ready version of accepted papers is limited to 20
single-column pages. The conference language is English.

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in Lecture Notes
in Computer Science (LNCS). The proceedings will also be made available 
online
by Springer in full-text electronic form via Springerlink.
