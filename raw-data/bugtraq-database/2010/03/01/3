Subject: Re: Information disclosure vulnerability in Drupal's Realname
 User Reference Widget contributed module (version 6.x-1.0)

We have determined that Realname module and Realname userreference module do not share information that should be hidden. After all, both account->name and realname fields are _intended_ for display. Therefore this is not considered a vulnerability.
