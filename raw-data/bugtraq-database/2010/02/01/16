Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 02.01.10: RealNetworks RealPlayer CMediumBlockAllocator
 Integer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.01.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 01, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

RealPlayer is an application for playing various media formats,
developed by RealNetworks Inc. Since late 2003, Real Player has been
based on the open-source Helix Player. More information can be found at
the URLs shown. For more information, see the vendor's site found at the
following links.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in RealNetworks
Inc.'s Real Player could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the current user.

This problem specifically exists in the CMediumBlockAllocator::Alloc
method. When calculating the size of a memory allocation, an integer
overflow occurs. This leads to heap corruption, which can result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user executing Real Player.

To be successful, an attacker must persuade a user to use Real Player to
view specially crafted media. This could be accomplished via a Web page
or direct link to the malicious media.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Real
Player versions 10.5 (build 6.0.12.883) and 11 (build 6.0.14.738) on
