Subject: Security Advisory for Bugzilla 3.0.10, 3.2.5, 3.4.4, and 3.5.2

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers two security issues that have recently been
fixed in the Bugzilla code:

+ Some files stored on the web server are not correctly protected
  against external access and can be viewed from a web browser.

+ Restricting a bug to a group while moving the bug to another product
  has no effect if the group is not used by both products. The bug may
  become public if no other group restriction applies.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Issue 1
-------
Class:       Information leak
Versions:    all versions before 3.0.11, 3.2.6, 3.4.5, and 3.5.3
Description: Bugzilla allows web browsers to serve the contents of
             files in the CVS/, contrib/, docs/en/xml/, and t/
             directories, as well as the old-params.txt file.
             These files do not contain sensitive data by default, but
             custom installations may have added scripts or files into
             these directories which contain e.g. passwords or some 
             other sensitive information. We now forbird access to
             these directories from a web browser as a preventive
             measure.

CVE Number:  CVE-2009-3989

Issue 2
-------
Class:       Information leak
Versions:    3.3.1 to 3.4.4, 3.5.1, 3.5.2
Description: When moving a bug from one product to another, an  
             intermediate page is displayed letting you select the 
             groups the bug should be restricted to in the new
             product. However, a regression in the 3.4.x series
             made it ignore all groups which are not available in
             both products. As a workaround, you had to move the
             bug to the new product first and then restrict it to
             the desired groups, in two distinct steps, which 
             could make the bug temporarily public.
