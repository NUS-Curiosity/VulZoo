Overflow Vulnerabilities

http://www.vupen.com/english/research.php


I. BACKGROUND
---------------------

OpenOffice.org (OO.o or OOo), commonly known as OpenOffice, is an
open source software application suite available for a number of
different computer operating systems. It is distributed as free
software and written using its own GUI toolkit. It supports the
ISO/IEC standard OpenDocument Format (ODF) for data interchange
as its default file format, as well as Microsoft Office formats
among others. (Wikipedia)


II. DESCRIPTION
--------------------- 

VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team discovered critical vulnerabilities
affecting OpenOffice.org.

The first vulnerability is caused by a heap overflow error when
processing malformed "sprmTDefTable" records in a Word document,
which could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code.

The second vulnerability is caused by a heap overflow error when
processing malformed "sprmTSetBrc" records in a Word document,
which could be exploited by attackers to compromise a vulnerable
system.
