A remotely exploitable vulnerability has been found in the JavaScript Engine of the MobileSafari Browser(based on Webkit Engine) used on the Motorola Milestone(droid) smartphone.
In detail, the following flaw was determined:
The Motorola Milestone(Droid) is prone to a denial of service vulnerability when parsing certain HTML content. 
This is possible due to a failure in handling exceptional conditions.
This issue is caused by a memory corruption error when handling javascript elements,
which could be exploited by remote attackers to crash the browser by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted web page.
This issue can NOT be lead to remote code execution, so that the potential security risk is rated low.

The exploit has been tested on a Motorola Milestone(Droid) using following useragent:
