What exactly do you mean?
Traversing symlinks on the server/share, or creation of "wide" symlinks
by the client on the server/share?

Since Windows 2000 NTFS supports "junctions", which pretty much resemble
Unix symlinks, but only for directories.
See <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/205524/en-us>

On the server, create a junction in your share and let it point to an
arbitrary local directory outside the share, and clients connected to
that share can enter the junction and access the "linked" directory.

If you have write access to the share from the client you can create
a "wide" junction there too, just as the OP showed with smbclient/samba.

Except a mapping of directory symlinks to junctions for example.-(
