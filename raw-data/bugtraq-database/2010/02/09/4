Subject: Re: Samba Remote Zero-Day Exploit

Dear Kingcope,

The samba server follows symlinks by default. There are options
("follow symlinks", "wide links") for turning it off:

http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#FOLLOWSYMLINKS
http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#WIDELINKS

The "problem" at your installation seems a mis-configuration of
your server: please ask the admin to set "secure" options.
(Some samba installations, like mine, wish to allow same access as a
UNIX login would allow. Some shares like [home] are provided for ease
of use, users are encouraged to create symlinks to other "interesting"
places e.g. NFS-mounted directories.)

Cheers, Paul
