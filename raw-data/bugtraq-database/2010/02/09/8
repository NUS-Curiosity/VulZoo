Subject: ACM CCS 2010: Call for Workshop Proposals

======================================================================
Please excuse multiple postings of this message
======================================================================
ACM CCS 2010 --- CALL for WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
======================================================================
Proposals are solicited for workshops to be held in conjunction with
ACM CCS 2010. Each workshop provides a forum to address a specific
topic at the forefront of security research.

A workshop must be one full day in length. Proceedings of all
workshops will be available (on a CD) to the workshop attendees. Each
workshop will also have on-line proceedings through ACM Digital
Library, with a separate ISBN.

======================================================================
Important Dates

* Submission deadline: February 15, 2010

* CFP and Website for each workshop by March 15-25
* Suggested workshop papers submission deadline: around July 2
* Suggested workshop papers notification: before August 10
* Workshop papers camera ready: August 25 (hard deadline)

======================================================================
Workshop Proposal Submission

For new workshops, proposals should include:

* Workshop title
* A draft "Call for Papers" articulating the scope and topics covered
   by the workshop
* A brief summary and justification for the workshop, including
   anticipated benefits to the ACM CCS community.
* Planned activities
* Expected number of submissions and acceptance rate
* Expected number of attendees
* Program chair(s), and, if available, tentative program committee
* A one-paragraph biographical sketch for each organizer, describing
   relevant qualifications, including research and conference/workshop
   organizing experience

For previously-held workshops, in addition to the above, proposals
must provide the following information, for the most recent
incarnation of the workshop:

* Number of submissions
* Number of accepted papers
* Estimated number of attendees

Please submit workshop proposals by email to the ACM CCS Workshop
Chairs, Ting Yu (yu@....ncsu.edu) and Ninghui Li
(ninghui@...purdue.edu). All workshop proposals will be reviewed by
the CCS Steering Committee.

======================================================================
Proposal Evaluation Criteria

* The workshop is within the scope of computer and communications
   security and concerns a coherent and important technical topic of
   high interest in the community.
* Its novelty with respect to other forums, especially with respect to
   other CCS workshops.
* Its likely impact on the target community, including likely high
   participation.
* One of the best ways to show likely interest is to have a strong set
   of researchers who have agreed to serve on the PC.

======================================================================
CCS Support for Workshops:

If a workshop proposal is accepted, the ACM CCS workshop chairs will
work closely with workshop organizers. The ACM CCS workshop chairs
will help create/maintain the submission and reviewing websites for
workshops (likely through EasyChair), and are responsible for
monitoring and coordinating organizational aspects of the workshops.
