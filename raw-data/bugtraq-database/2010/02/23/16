Subject: London DEFCON February meet - DC4420 - Wed 24th Feb 2010

I think we can safely say that last month's meet was a huge success and 
the new venue was heartily approved by all... Attendance was back up and 
talks were excellent, as was food/drink/socialising etc., so thanks to 
all that made it!

This month we hope to continue in the same vein, with the line up being:

   Jean-Luc :  JVM breakout  (the technical one)

   autom8on : thermal lance quick demo  (the 'you can do this at home 
kids' fun one) ((( I'm hoping 'demo' is being used in the loosest 
possible way here!!!! )))

   Major Malfunction : Armchair UAV Spotting (since I didn't have time 
to do it last month...)

venue:

    Upstairs at The Black Horse, 6 Rathbone Place, W1T 1HH
