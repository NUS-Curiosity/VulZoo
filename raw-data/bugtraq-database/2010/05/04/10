Microsoft Office Visio DXF File Insertion Buffer Overflow



1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Microsoft Office Visio DXF File Insertion Buffer Overflow
Advisory Id: CORE-2010-0428
Advisory URL:
[http://www.coresecurity.com/content/ms-visio-dxf-buffer-overflow]
Date published: 2010-05-04
Date of last update: 2010-05-04
Vendors contacted: Microsoft
Release mode: User release



2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes (client-side)
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2010-1681
Bugtraq ID: 39836



3. *Vulnerability Description*

Microsoft Office Visio is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in
'VISIODWG.DLL', a DLL which is loaded when inserting a DXF file into a
Visio document,  either using drag-and-drop or "Insert, CAD drawing"
from the menu bar. This bug can be exploited to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the  user running Visio. The bug was fixed in
patch KB979364 [2] released with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-028
[1], but the bulletin contains no  mention of either the bug or the fix.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Microsoft Office Visio using VISIODWG.DLL version 10.0.5006.4


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*


   . Microsoft Office Visio using VISIODWG.DLL version 10.0.6880.4
(patched with KB979364 [2]).


6. *Solutions and Workarounds*

Apply patch KB979364 [2] included in bulletin MS10-028 [1].


7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Daniel Kazimirow,
from Core Security Technologies. Publication was coordinated by Jorge
Lucangeli  Obes.


8. *Technical Description*

The vulnerability occurs in the 'VISIODWG.DLL' library. At offset '74ef'
in the library there is an unsafe call to 'strcpy', which can be used to
execute arbitrary code. This call is replaced with a call to 'strncpy',
at offset '81e7' in the new version of the library.
