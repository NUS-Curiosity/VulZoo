Subject: [Wintercore Research] Consona Products - Multiple vulnerabilities


Affected products:

Consona Live Assistance
Consona Dynamic Agent
Consona Subscriber Assistance

Vulnerabilities:

-XSS
-Remote Code Execution
-Buffer Overflow
-Privilege escalation


Executive summary:

Consona products uses a propietary ActiveX site-lock mechanism that can
be defeated through XSS attacks.

Once an attacker can inject arbitrary JS code within the context of an
allowed domain,  unsafe methods can invoked to download and execute
arbitrary binaries.

A local privilege escalation flaw discovered in the Consona's Repair
Service can be used to bypass IE8 Protected Mode, thus gaining SYSTEM
privileges.

The XSS flaw leds to a complete system compromise.

Technical Details:

These vulnerabilities were discovered and presented, 2 months ago, by
Ruben Santamarta at RootedCon, a security conference held in Madrid.
