Acknowledgment: The Hewlett-Packard Company thanks Tenable Network Security along with TippingPoints Zero Day Initiative for reporting this vulnerability to security-alert@...com.

RESOLUTION

The vulnerability can be resolved by enabling the Secure Channel feature. This resolution requires installation of HP Performance Center v9.50 or subsequent.

Note: Starting with version 9.50 HP Performance Center has provided a documented feature called Secure Communication. Secure Communication prevents non-trusted sources from transmitting code to the Load Generators by establishing an encrypted and secured communication channel. Secure Communication is disabled by default.

There are detailed instructions regarding Secure Communication in the HP Performance Center System Configuration and Installation Guide. See the 'Configuration' chapter, 'Recommended Configuration' section. The chapter section 'Configuring Host Security Settings.' has instructions to enforce Secure Communication. Using Secure Communication involves both enabling 'enforce secure communication' and setting the security key.
