Subject: Re: Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) v8.2.254.0 "id" parameter
 Information Disclosure Vulnerability

Not working at my environment: Tested on Firefox 3.6.3 (Linux).

OWA version: 8.2.254.0

Exception type: Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Storage.CorruptDataException. OWA uses 
System.Convert.FromBase64String(String s) for parsing the address, so even when you 
try to put the representation there, you should get the invalid format of serialized ID anyways.
Weird it goes through at yours.

Pawel Jablonski
