Description:
    In previous versions of NTP, it is possible for remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) by using
    MODE_PRIVATE to send a spoofed request or response packet that
    triggers a continuous exchange of MODE_PRIVATE error responses 
    between two NTP daemons.  This has been fixed.
