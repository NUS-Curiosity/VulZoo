Subject: Re[4]: DoS vulnerabilities in Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera and other browsers

Dear John Smith,

 In  general  case  we  are  discussing,  DoS may be caused by e.g. some
 combination of allowed tags/properties or by malformed image.

 As  it  was  pointed  by  author,  this  attack  may  be performed with
 scripting  disabled  (with [iframe src=]). That's why e-mail vector may
 be significant.
