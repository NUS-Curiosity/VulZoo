Subject: Re: Re[4]: DoS vulnerabilities in Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera and other browsers

Hi Vladimir,

Thanks for your views.

I was carried away because the author used scripts (in a global script tag) 
in the PoC of the issue in question which made unconditional recursion 
possible.
Without scripts enabled, if iframe's src property is set to itself(?), it is 
parsed upto 1 level (i.e. not recursed). Hence it doesn't affect or DoS the 
latest browsers (the best I can say...).

A few other points:

1. if a links/ads or any other content-syndication provider allow unverified 
javascript to be served, DoS would be the least of the concern (read: it’s 
the breeding ground of XSS exploits)
2. I more than agree that an issue to be classified as a security 
vulnerability if a combination of tags/properties/scripts causes or is 
capable of causing malice in any form while conforming to the standards 
(which isn't the case here).
3. Just to reiterate my earlier post, DoS is more of an annoyance than 
malice. If the issue noted in this context DoS by a form of unconditional 
recursion (or infinite loop) to create 'out of memory' or stack overflow 
sortof situation (though modern uri handlers handle it gracefully) but 
requires a task kill operation on the script engine's host (the browser in 
this context).

Sadly, there're too many known unknowns to the #2 above which involves the 
support of non-standard techniques like Anti-Phishing Working 
Group/SmartScreen filter etc which doesn't attempt to or can be absolutely 
100% fool-proof...

Best Regards,
w

PS: Lets put IE6 out of context, I'm not sure why it is still brought up or 
why it's still used, because it’s a browser from the times when the first 
ancestor of Firefox (Phoenix) didn't exist. Yes, its that ancient! :)
