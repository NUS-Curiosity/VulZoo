Subject: Re: Ghostscript 8.64 executes random code at startup

Someone pointed out that even with -P-, gs will read gs_init.ps from
current directory:
  http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691350
Still, they do not regard this with any urgency.

I also see no -P- and no absolute paths for the ps files mentioned in
many "gs scripts" e.g. /usr/bin/pdf2dsc or /usr/bin/ps2ascii . Also,
crappy coding for "GS_EXECUTABLE=gs". Am not sure if these are
"originally gs" or "Debian special".

Cheers, Paul
