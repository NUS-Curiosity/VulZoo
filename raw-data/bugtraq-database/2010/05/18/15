Report Confidence:      Confirmed

SUMMARY
=======

Certain invalid GSS-API tokens can cause a GSS-API acceptor (server)
to crash due to a null pointer dereference in the GSS-API library.

This is an implementation vulnerability in MIT krb5, and not a
vulnerability in the Kerberos protocol.

IMPACT
======

An authenticated remote attacker can cause a GSS-API application
server (including the Kerberos administration daemon kadmind) to crash
by sending a malformed GSS-API token that induces a null pointer
dereference.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

* kadmind and other GSS-API server applications in all known releases
  of MIT krb5, up to and including krb5-1.8.1

* third-party GSS-API server applications that link link against the
  GSS-API library in all known releases of MIT krb5, up to and
  including krb5-1.8.1

* Independent implementations of the krb5 GSS-API mechanism may be
  vulnerable, as the underlying bug is based on plausible (but
  invalid) assumptions about the Kerberos protocol.

FIXES
=====

* The upcoming krb5-1.8.2 release and an upcoming krb5-1.7 series
  release will contain a fix for this vulnerability.

* Apply the following patch.  The patch was generated against
  krb5-1.8.1, but should also apply to krb5-1.7 series releases.

DETAILS
=======

The krb5 GSS-API mechanism specification requires that the checksum
field in the authenticator of the Kerberos AP-REQ (which is optional
in the base Kerberos protocol) be present and contain specific
contents.  If the checksum field is missing, the decoded structure
contains a null pointer, which code called through
krb5_gss_accept_sec_context() dereferences without first checking for
a null pointer.

Independent implementations of the krb5 GSS-API mechanism may be
vulnerable because a developer might reasonably make the invalid
assumption that the authenticator checksum field is not empty (and
hence, that the C representation would not contain a null pointer).
