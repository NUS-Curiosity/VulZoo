Conference Background
---------------------
IT-Security has become a steady concern for all entities operating
IT-Systems. These include enterprises, governmental and non-governmental
organizations, as well as individuals.  Yet, despite high-end
precautionary measures taken, not every attack or security mishap can be
prevented and hence incidents will go on happening.  In such cases
forensic capabilities in investigating incidents in both technical and
legal aspects are vital to understand their issue and feed back the
knowledge gained into the security process.  Documenting the measures
taken to prevent or minimize damage to own or external IT infrastructure
provides legal rear cover if an involved party decides to start
proceedings. In a possible lawsuit emerging from such an incident, its
treatment in a forensically proper way is crucial to be able to possibly
claim for damages or prevent from being threatened by claims of third
parties.  Thus, capable incident response and forensic procedures have
become an essential part of IT infrastructure operations.

In law enforcement IT forensics is an important branch and its
significance constantly increases since IT has become an essential part
in almost every aspect of daily life.  IT systems produce traces and
evidence in many ways that play a more and more relevant role in
resolving cases.


Conference Goals
----------------
IMF's intent is to gather experts from throughout the world in order to
present and discuss recent technical and methodical advances in the
fields of IT security incident response and management and IT forensics.
The conference provides a platform for collaboration and exchange of
ideas between industry (both as users and solution providers), academia,
law-enforcement and other government bodies.
