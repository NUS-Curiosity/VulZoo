Now in its fourth year, LEET continues to provide a unique forum for the
discussion of threats to the confidentiality of our data, the integrity
of digital transactions, and the dependability of the technologies we
increasingly rely on. We encourage submissions of papers that focus on
the malicious activities themselves (e.g., reconnaissance, exploitation,
privilege escalation, rootkit installation, attack), our responses as
defenders (e.g., prevention, detection, and mitigation), or the social,
political, and economic goals driving these malicious activities and the
legal and ethical codes guiding our defensive responses.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Infection vectors for malware (worms, viruses, etc.)
* Botnets, command and control channels
* Spyware

* Boutique and targeted malware
