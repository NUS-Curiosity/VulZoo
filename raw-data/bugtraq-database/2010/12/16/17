Subject: Updated online binary planting exposure test continues operation


After our Online Binary Planting Exposure Test became defunct as a result of
Microsoft fixing the Windows Address Book binary planting bug, we updated the test
with two unfixed vulnerabilities. Everyone is welcome to keep testing their Windows
computers for Internet-based binary planting attacks.
