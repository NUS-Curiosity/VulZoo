Hello Dan, is this exploitation not mitigated by best practice 
defense-in-depth strategies such as preventing the CAP_SYS_MODULE 
capability or '/sbin/sysctl -w kernel.modules_disabled=1' respectively?Â 
 It seems it'd certainly stop the Econet/Acorn issue.

Curious to hear your input as I fear too many rely solely on errata updates and not a good defense-in-depth approach.
