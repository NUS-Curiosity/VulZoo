openSUSE 11.2 and 11.3 do not have ECONET compiled,
openSUSE 11.1 has ECONET, but not the 0 ptr deref issue.

The CVE-2010-4258 problem is however in all openSUSEs.

Temporary workaround (for all distributions, not just openSUSE):
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops
This will now panic the machine instead of making it exploitable.

Ciao, Marcus
