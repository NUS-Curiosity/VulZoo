Can he? The OP isn't too clear about this, but it was my understanding,
that the local admin can impersonate the cached domain account on the
local machine, but not on the network. In which case your point about
the domain admin being "bigger" from the domain perspective is true, but
is also completely moot, as a local admin could only impersonate another
account with local admin privileges. Which he can do anyway.
