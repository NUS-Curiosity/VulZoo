That statement remains true.

IPSEC isn't 100% crypto; it is a complex layered subsystem with many
other elements to it.  In particular our IPSEC stack also supports the
IPCOMP sub-protocol -- the same management framework moves compressed
ip packets through the framework.  This means that there are parts of
the IPSEC stack that are 'dual use'.  There are also many other parts
of IPSEC which are related to non-encrypted encapsulations.

Our project permitted American developers to work on any part of the
tree which was not specifically cryptography; in this particular
instance that includes the parts of IPSEC which are 'dual use' or 'not
related to cryptography'.  We did not permit them to work on the
crypto-specific parts.

This is a driver for a crypto chip, but the driver itself does not do
any cryptography.  The driver moves things around so that the hardware
can do the cryptography.

There's no cleaning necessary for deflate compression, so remove it from
the switch.

Note, the commit message talks about compression.

That is a simplistic viewpoint held by your simplistic mind.
