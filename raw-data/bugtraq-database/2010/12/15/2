OUCH!
Obviously you have NOT understand a single word!

It is COMPLETELY irrelevant where cached credentials are stored on the
local computer, and I haven't written anything about that.

Logins with local user accounts are authenticated against the resp. SAM,
whereas logins with domain user accounts are authenticated against the
resp. AD. Only if the latter is not available cached credentials are used.
