No, the bug is not checking address overwrite limit in the do_exit() path,
which migh offer the chance to overwrite an arbitrary memory location. The
clone call in the supplied poc just made sure do_exit() actually accesses
the memory clearing the child tid (using the CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID). So if
your running process why so ever also had CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID set it would
trigger the problem as well.
