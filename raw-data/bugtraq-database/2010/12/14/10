Hi,

I've recently made publicly available "yet another fuzzer". It's
simple, easy to use via command-line interface, providing nice
analysis of software crashes in a simple form of file names.

It has been used by me and some others to find a few, possibly
exploitable, bugs in some major software packages; incl.: freetype2,
librsvg, libtiff..

The code and documentation can be found here:

PS: Thanks to Felix Gröbert, Parisa Tabriz and Tavis Ormandy for their
help and suggestions.
