Pre Jobo .NET "Password" SQL Injection Vulnerability

PRODUCT >>> http://www.preprojects.com/jobo.asp

Input passed to the "Password" form field in jobseeker/register (the Post Your CV page) is
not properly sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate
SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
