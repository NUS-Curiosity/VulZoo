                          SGI Security Advisory

Title    : Multiple Vulnerabilities in BSD LPR Subsystem
Number   : 20030406-02-P
Date     : April 25, 2003
Reference: CERT VU#39001
Reference: CERT VU#30308
Reference: CERT VU#293305
Reference: CVE CAN-2003-0144
Reference: SGI Security Advisory 20030406-01-P
Reference: SGI BUGS 864917 865485 873984 874729 880124 883255
Fixed in : IRIX 6.5.20 or patch 5071
______________________________________________________________________________

- --------------
- --- Update ---
- --------------

This is an update to SGI Security Bulletin 20030406-01-P.  The patch
referenced in that bulletin (patch 5048) did not contain the fixes for SGI
bug number 880124.  SGI support has released a new patch (patch 5071) that
does contain all the fixes.


- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that there are several vulnerabilities in the IRIX bsdlpr
printing subsystem:

  o  lpd chkhost() routine is easily spoofed
     See: http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/30308

  o  lpd should execl() sendmail -t, not sendmail
     See: http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/39001

  o  Unstable behavior in lpd resulting from the patch4835 fixes

  o  lprm buffer overrun
     See: http://www.insecure.org/sploits/lprm.overflow.html
          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/293305

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected with patches and in future releases of IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The bsdlpr subsystem is not installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems.  It is
an optional product which can be installed as "print.sw.bsdlpr".

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

To see if the bsdlpr subsystem is installed, execute the following command:

  $ versions print.sw.bsdlpr
  I = Installed, R = Removed

     Name                 Date        Description
     I  print                01/30/2003  Printing Tools, Release 1.16.5f
     I  print.sw             01/30/2003  Printing Tools Software 1.16.5f
     I  print.sw.bsdlpr      01/30/2003  Berkeley 'lpr' Printer Spooler

If the output shown is similar to the above, then the subsystem is installed
and the system may be vulnerable.



- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems if the bsdlpr
capabilities are needed in your printing environment.  SGI recommends either
upgrading to IRIX 6.5.20 (when available), or installing the appropriate
patch from the listing below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.20 when available, or install the
appropriate patch.

Security patches are available on both http://support.sgi.com/ and
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/patches/
