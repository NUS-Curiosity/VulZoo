Subject: SonicWall Pro DoS?




Came across an apparent problem on a SonicWall Pro running firmware 
version 6.4.0.1 ROM version 5.0.1.0 during a vulnerability assessment and 
couldn't find any other postings on this problem so fwiw.. the problem 
occurs when sending a large HTTP POST to the inside interface - may affect 
others just didn't test as the outside interface was blocked.  I was able 
to confirm this problem using two separate Nessus plugins (10012 and 
10687). The behavior of the firewall suggests a buffer overflow but since 
I'm not familiar with the internals of this system it's just a guess. 15-
20 seconds after sending the POST to the firewall the firewall goes 
through a reset cycle. This delay suggests to me a section of code that is 
being overwritten. At the very least, this is a Denial of Service problem. 
Vendor was notified of the problem.
