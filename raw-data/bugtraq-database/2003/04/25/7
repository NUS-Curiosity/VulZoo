Microsoft Security Solutions is happy to announce the release of the
_Windows Server 2003 Security Guide_ and its companion guide, _Threats
and Countermeasures: Security Settings in Windows Server 2003 and
Windows XP_. 

The new guides provide detailed security guidance on Microsoft Windows
Server 2003(tm) that is authoritative, proven, and tested. The guides
are designed to allow users to assess and mitigate a wide range of
significant security issues that may exist in their environment.

The Windows Server 2003 Security Guide provides easy to understand
guidance, tools, and templates to effectively secure Windows Server 2003
in a variety of enterprise environments. While the default installation
of the product is designed to be secure, a number of security settings
can be further configured based on specific requirements and scenarios. 

The Windows Server 2003 Security Guide consists of 12 chapters. Each
chapter builds on the end-to-end process required to implement and
secure Windows Server 2003 in a customer environment. The first few
chapters describe building the foundation for hardening the servers in
your organization; the remaining chapters document the procedures unique
to each server role.

The companion guide, Threats and Countermeasures: Security Settings in
Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, provides a reference to many of the
security settings available in the current versions of the Microsoft(r)
Windows(r) operating systems. 
For each setting discussed in this guide, information is provided
regarding the threat that the setting was designed to prevent, the
different countermeasures that can be applied, and the potential impact
of configuring these options. 

The guides can be found online at:
