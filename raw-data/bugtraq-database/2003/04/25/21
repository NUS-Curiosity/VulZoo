Subject: Vulnerability in nsd LDAP Implementation on IRIX


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

______________________________________________________________________________
                          SGI Security Advisory

Title    : Vulnerability in nsd LDAP Implementation
Number   : 20030407-01-P
Date     : April 25, 2003
Reference: CVE CAN-2003-0174
Reference: SGI BUGS 834042 874955
Fixed in : IRIX 6.5.20 (when available) or patch 5063
______________________________________________________________________________


- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It has been reported that IRIX's LDAP name service implementation does
not detect whether an LDAP server provides the USERPASSWORD attribute
for each entry in the password database. This could allow a user to log
in without any password.

SGI has investigated the issues and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected with a patch and in future releases of
IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The nsd daemon and the libns_ldap.so library are installed by default on
IRIX 6.5 systems as part of eoe.sw.base.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.16f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in
this case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is
the "version" we refer to throughout this document.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

If you need to use LDAP, there is no effective workaround available for
these problems.  SGI recommends either upgrading to IRIX 6.5.20 (when
available), or installing the appropriate patch from the listing below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.20 (when available), or
install the appropriate patch.

Security patches are available on both http://support.sgi.com/ and
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/patches/

   NOTES

     1) This version of the IRIX operating has been retired. Upgrade to an
        actively supported IRIX operating system.  See
        http://support.sgi.com/ for more information.

     2) If you have not received an IRIX 6.5.X CD for IRIX 6.5, contact your
        SGI Support Provider or URL: http://support.sgi.com/

     3) Upgrade to IRIX 6.5.20 (when available)

     4) Install the patch or upgrade to IRIX 6.5.20 (when available)

     5) After the upgrade to IRIX 6.5.20 or the appropriate patch has been
        applied, the system administrator may choose to reject all password
        database entries that do not have a USERPASSWORD attribute. This
        may be achieved by adding the following line to the file
        /var/ns/ldap.conf, in the sections that define the passwd.byname
        and passwd.byuid tables:

             require USERPASSWORD

        When this has been done, entries that do not have any data for the
        USERPASSWORD attribute will not appear in the password database.
