Subject: Re: Medium Vulnerability in SNMP on Linsys BEFVP41



I'd kiss a frog if this was true. Actually  I use over 50 of these
toys in production and it would have made me very happy if I could use
SNMP from outside the external interface. No surprise for me that
the tech support did not respond on your emails, it's likely that
they're using outsourced software in their products, since I've 
had a nice discussion some time ago with one of their support
representative who didn't ever know what I was talking about when 
referring words like 'Crypto engine failure','isakmp' etc
I also have some bug issues open in their tech support, which
remained unanswered until today. What I know is they told me SNMP
is *not* usable from outside, and I've tested this for myself.
All filters were off, not blocking any wan request, remote management
on. 
Recently I've bought a new one which contains version 1.40.5,
still unreleased on the web site, so hang on for this release.
Once again, don't rely on their support (which is stinky), maybe
Cisco will fix this as they've bought them some weeks ago.
