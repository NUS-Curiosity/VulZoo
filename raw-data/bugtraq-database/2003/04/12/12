As the main developer of AMaViS-ng, I would like to make three
comments at this time:

(1) Unfortunately, Phil did not contact me or any other AMaViS
developer, neither via private mail nor by sending a message to
security@...vis.org, before posting to Bugtraq. He did post to the
amavis-user list on Mon, 7 Apr 2003 00:33:52 +0200 (see:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=4298123), which
was only about 14h before posting to this list. "Prior notice" is
something else in my dictionary.

Neither did he inform anyone from the AMaViS development team of his
posting to this list. I only became aware of it because other
subscribers pointed me to his article.

(2) The issue is being investigated at the moment and I will post
updates when we know more about it.

(3) Using the information from Phil's posting to this list, we have
not been able to confirm the vulnerability so far. We hope to get this
issue sorted out soon.

Regards,
-Hilko
