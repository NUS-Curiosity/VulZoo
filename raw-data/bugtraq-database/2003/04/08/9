Date:              2003-04-07

Package description:
  Samba provides an SMB server which can be used to provide network
  services to SMB (sometimes called "Lan Manager") clients, including
  various versions of MS Windows, OS/2, and other Linux machines. Samba
  uses NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) protocols and does NOT need NetBEUI
  (Microsoft Raw NetBIOS frame) protocol.

Problem description:
  A buffer overflow has been discovered in Samba affecting all versions
  prior to 2.2.8a allowing for a remote root compromise.  An exploit
  has been released to the wild.  This release patches our 2.2.8 package
  up to 2.2.8a.
