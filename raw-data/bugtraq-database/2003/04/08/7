	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	Kerberos 5
Affected products:	ImmunixOS 7.0, 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0139 CAN-2003-0138 CAN-2003-0028 CAN-2003-0082

Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-007-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...ex.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the MIT Kerberos suite.
  This release removes triple-DES support in Kerberos IV and cross-realm
  authentication in Kerberos IV, as both are known to be insecure. This
  release also fixes two denial of service attacks against the Kerberos
  daemons.

  All Kerberos users should upgrade to these packages, with the caveat
  that organizations relying on Kerberos IV cross-realm authentication
  should upgrade to Kerberos 5 first.
