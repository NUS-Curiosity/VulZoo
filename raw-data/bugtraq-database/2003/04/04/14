Severity:	Remote root compromise

Fixed:		NetBSD-current:		March 30, 2003
		NetBSD-1.6 branch:	March 30, 2003 (1.6.1 will include the fix)

Abstract
========

- From the CERT advisory:

    There is a remotely exploitable vulnerability in sendmail that
    could allow an attacker to gain control of a vulnerable sendmail
    server. Address parsing code in sendmail does not adequately check
    the length of email addresses. An email message with a specially
    crafted address could trigger a stack overflow. This vulnerability
    was discovered by Michal Zalewski.

    This vulnerability is different than the one described in CA-2003-07.

    It is a different vulnerability than NetBSD SA2003-002.


Technical Details
=================

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================


We advise sites running sendmail to upgrade as soon as possible.  If upgrading
is impossible at this time, we recommend you turn off the sendmail service.

To determine if sendmail is running on your system, issue the command:

        # /etc/rc.d/sendmail status

To stop currently running sendmail processes, issue the command:

        # /etc/rc.d/sendmail stop

To ensure sendmail does not start after the next reboot, issue the command:

	# echo "sendmail=NO" >>/etc/rc.conf.d/sendmail

To allow sendmail to start once upgraded, remove the sendmail=NO line
from the end of /etc/rc.conf.d/sendmail.


The following instructions describe how to upgrade your sendmail
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of sendmail.

* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2003-03-30
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2003-03-31 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		gnu/dist/sendmail/sendmail

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install sendmail:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P gnu/dist/sendmail/sendmail
		# cd gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail

		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install


* NetBSD 1.6:

	The binary distribution of NetBSD 1.6 is vulnerable.   

	Systems running NetBSD 1.6 sources dated from before
	2003-03-30 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.6 sources dated
	2003-03-31 or later.

	NetBSD 1.6.1 will include the fix.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
		gnu/dist/sendmail/sendmail

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install sendmail:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-6 gnu/dist/sendmail/sendmail
		# cd gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail

		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install




* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

	The binary distribution of NetBSD 1.5.3 is vulnerable.   

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, or 1.5.3 sources dated
	from before 2003-04-01 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.5.*
	sources dated 2003-04-02 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		gnu/dist/sendmail/sendmail

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install sendmail:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-5 gnu/dist/sendmail/sendmail
		# cd gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail

		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
