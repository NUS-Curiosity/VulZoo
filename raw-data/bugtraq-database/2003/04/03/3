CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0165
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated eog packages that fix a security vulnerability are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Eye of GNOME (EOG) is a component for the GNOME desktop used by various Red
Hat Linux packages for displaying images.

A vulnerability was found in EOG version 2.2.0 and earlier.  A carefully
crafted filename passed to the program could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.  An attacker could exploit this because various packages
(Mutt, for example) make use of EOG for image viewing.

All users are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which contain a
backported patch correcting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 8.0:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/8.0/en/os/SRPMS/eog-1.0.2-5.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/8.0/en/os/i386/eog-1.0.2-5.i386.rpm

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/eog-2.2.0-2.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/eog-2.2.0-2.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/eog-debuginfo-2.2.0-2.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available at http://www.redhat.com/solutions/security/news/publickey/

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
