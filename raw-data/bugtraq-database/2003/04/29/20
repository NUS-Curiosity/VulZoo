	Not only on winXP; it has the same effect on win2000 server and
advanced server; windows.NET advanced server & interprise server RC1;
RC2 & the release version. With office XP or 2000 or without them.
Of course you could delete the file through the command prompt. :D
	Another interesting thing; in win2000 and winXP, the browser (
iexplore or explorer or ... ) hangs & shows the message that send this
error to microsoft & restart the browser.
In win.NET it crashes the browser & restarts it without any message.
But.....
	After u log off & again log on; it now shows the messages to
you; one by one.
It shows the stability of .NET system that keeps the messages for u. :))
