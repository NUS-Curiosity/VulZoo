Obviously use self-extracting .exes is a ludicrous idea from a security
point of view, however, at least you don't have to run them:

$ wget
"http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/7/f/37fcf915-c19e-4c09-8b05-1573ea58b164/W2KHG 1.1.exe"
$ unzip W2KHG%201.1.exe
Archive:  /arch/W2KHG%201.1.exe
  inflating: Windows 2000 Hardening Guide.doc
  inflating: Templates/installSceregvl.bat
