"netscape navigator" is cracked.
("that's all" is end of file if you are in a hurry)

[tested]
OS:Windows Server 2003 Enterprise
Browser: "Netscape Navigator 7.02"
"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.0.2) Gecko/20030208 
Netscape/7.02 "


[demo]
at
http://liudieyuinchina.vip.sina.com/DomainDot/DomainDot-MyPage.htm
or
http://umbrella.mx.tc ==> "DomainDot-MyPage" section

or
http://umbrella.mx.tc ==> "DomainDot-Screenshot" section


[exp]
URL "http://[Domain]./[DirectoryName]/[FileName]"(one more dot 
after "[Domain]") will actually navigate your browser to:
"http://[Domain]/[DirectoryName]/[FileName]".
then "document.domain" is "[Domain]."(one more dot in "document.domain").

try to execute javascript:
[CODE.JAVASCRIPT]document.domain=""

after being set to an empty string, document.domain is auto-caculated to 
be [DirectoryName].
of course, "[DirectoryName]" can be "www.paypal.com", but you still cannot 
access document at "www.paypal.com" by just having "www.paypal.com" 
as "document.domain".

now, you make "document.domain" to be "w.www.paypal.com", then set it 
to "www.paypal.com". 
you can access document at "www.paypal.com" now.


that's all.


[how]
do you still remember "IE dot bug"?
( http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/273168/2002-05-18/2002-05-
24/0 )

they are so similar, aren't they?


[gean]
i hope you'll get well soon!


[people]

greetings to:
Sandblad(the guy who found "IE dot bug"), "the Pull", dror(
