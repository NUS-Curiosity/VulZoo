I'd normally not post this type of shameless plug to a mailinglist, but as 
I think it's actually on topic this once, here goes:

Since I work with a mixed Windows/Unix environment I frequently do md5 (and 
sometimes sha1) full file checks of backups and what not. Finding the lack 
of built-in support for this in Windows annoying, I built a shell extension 
that is capable of calculating crc16, crc32, md5 and sha1 checksums, from 
the file properties sheet.

I have a version available on the web at 
http://www.earthmagic.org/?software if you want to have a play with it...
