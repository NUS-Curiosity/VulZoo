Just out of curiosity (I have no Windows systems, but anyway...) I
downloaded the .exe and was able to unpack it under Linux using
"unzip".  So if you want to examine this file more-or-less securely,
open it on a UNIX or Linux box instead of Windows.

What I found interesting is that some of the documentation is in
Microsoft Word or MS Excel format.  This implies that to take full
advantage of the information, you need to own an MS Office license.
Is this another example of abuse of monopoly?  For that matter, are .doc
or .xls documents necessarily safer than .exe's?  You decide...
