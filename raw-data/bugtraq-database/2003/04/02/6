	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	sendmail
Affected products:	ImmunixOS 6.2, 7.0, 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0161
Date:			Mon Mar 31 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-002-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...ex.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Michal Zalewski has discovered an integer signedness bug in sendmail's
  address handling code. A properly constructed email address could
  bypass length checks when writing to a fixed-length buffer. This bug
  may be remotely exploitable for root privileges.

  All buffers in the affected code are allocated on the stack, so
  StackGuard should prevent exploits of this vulnerability that involve
  modifying the function's return address. However, there may be other
  exploit paths not using function return addresses that StackGuard may
  not protect.

  We suggest upgrading when possible.
