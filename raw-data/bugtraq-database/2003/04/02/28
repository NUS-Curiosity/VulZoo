Conduct Cross-Site Scripting Attacks
Impact: Disclosure of authentication information, Execution of arbitrary

--------------------------------------------------

After the module quizz and private message of xoops, i have found an 
another risk in glossary whit some test on Web sites using xoops versions 
1.3.8 to 1.3.9 ( Glossary on V2.0 is not holed )

Description of glossary module :

This is just the module on xoops who permit to make dictionnary with 
search engine.

--------------------------------------------------
The vulnerability : 

A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks against this module 
and send a message like this :

<url=http://www.blocus-zone.com/modules/glossaire/glossaire-aff.php?
lettre=<IMG%20SRC="http://www.blocus-

( Note that the code that we have presented here is not dangerous, however 
there is some codes
much more malicious to steal the admin c o o k i e )

--------------------------------------------------
History: 

the team of xoops dï¿½vellopement as her community was prevented on 
11/24/2003. Patch are not available by xoops developer. Moreover, the 
author of the glossary module for 1.3.x versions, work now for an another 
content management system. 

Solution:

in glossaire-aff.php, add this script :
-----------------------------------------------

foreach ($_REQUEST as $key=>$value) {
$value=htmlspecialchars($value,ENT_QUOTES);
${$key} = $value;
$_GET[$key] = $value;
$HTTP_GET_VARS[$key] = $value;
}
