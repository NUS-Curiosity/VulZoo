I don't think that is a vulnerability.
The file /etc/master.passwd has read access for all users. Monitor can also
read it in a ssh session.
I you try that URL in a file with, let's say, 660 permissions you get a
blank page.

There is a remote security vulnerability in the Nokia IPSO operating
system.

Anyone with access to the webgui (Voyager) on the Nokia IP-box
can read any file on the system.

For example, login as the user 'monitor' (disabled by default)
and use the readfile.tcl to read any file:

http://x.x.x.x/cgi-bin/readfile.tcl?file=/etc/master.passwd

Tested on IPSO 3.6-FCS6
