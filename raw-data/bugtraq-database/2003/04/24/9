Just an interesting note about the above comment.

By generating 93 bytes of "cryptographic calibre" randomness, and
then base64 encoding it, you will have a password that has 744
(93*8) bits of entropy, but is 128 bytes long.  If a more
efficient encoding mechanism is used (one that uses the full
valid character set on a cisco, which I don't know personally) a
larger key could potentially be generated.

If a strong key such as the one described above is used,
according to some estimates, this will take a _very_ long time to
brute force.

Cheers,
