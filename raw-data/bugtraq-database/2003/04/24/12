NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name:    Internet Explorer ActiveX Control Heap Overflow
Systems Affected:  IE 5.01 SP3, 5.5 SP2, 6.0 Gold, 6.0 SP1
Severity:  Critical Risk
Category:               Heap Overflow
Vendor URL:   http://www.microsoft.com
Author:   Mark Litchfield (mark@...software.com)
Date:   24th April 2003
Advisory number: #NISR24042003


Description
***********
Internet Explorer is the most popular web browser in use by the internet
community with a reported 95% user base of internet users. IE suffers from a
heap based buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited via e-mail or
by viewing a web page.

Details
*******
There is an exploitable heap overflow vulnerability in Microsoft's ActiveX
control, Plugin.ocx. By default, plugin.ocx is marked safe for scripting,
and as such, if an IE user were to visit a malicious web page, the overflow
could be triggered allowing for a "remote" compromise of the user's machine.
Alternatively, an attacker could send their target a specially crafted
e-mail, loaded with an exploit to take advantage of this vulnerability. The
problem arises by passing an overly long string to the Load method of the
control.

Fix Information
***************
NGSSoftware alerted Microsoft to this vulnerability on 13th December 2002.
The patch information is available from
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/
