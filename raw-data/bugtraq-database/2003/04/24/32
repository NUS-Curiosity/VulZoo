I have found that if you try to open in Opera 7.10 url bar a very large
news url like this ( not too many or Opera will do nothing , near the
limit )
news:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...

Opera crashes with an acess violation . EIP is not overwritten but the
program won´t work any more until you reinstall it ( at least in my
machine ) . Having done it some times now I can´t open Opera even after
reinstalling it .
I don´t provide a webpage cause I was unable of making work a link with so
very large url ( i tryed iframes and Javascript )
