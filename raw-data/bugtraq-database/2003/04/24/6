Subject: Nokia IPSO Vulnerability




There is a remote security vulnerability in the Nokia IPSO operating
system.

Anyone with access to the webgui (Voyager) on the Nokia IP-box
can read any file on the system.

For example, login as the user 'monitor' (disabled by default)
and use the readfile.tcl to read any file:

http://x.x.x.x/cgi-bin/readfile.tcl?file=/etc/master.passwd

Tested on IPSO 3.6-FCS6
