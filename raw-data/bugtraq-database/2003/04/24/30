Subject: [RHSA-2003:118-01] Updated mICQ packages fix vulnerability


---------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated mICQ packages fix vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:118-01
Issue date:        2003-04-24
Updated on:        2003-04-24
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          mICQ malformed ICQ message DoS 0xFE
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2002-1363
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated mICQ packages are available for Red Hat Linux versions 7.2 and 7.3
that fix a remote crash.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

mICQ is an online messaging and conferencing program.

mICQ versions 0.4.9 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) using malformed ICQ message types without a 0xFE separator
character.

Users of mICQ are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages containing
mICQ version 0.4.10.2 which is not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. RPMs required:
