Subject: Re: Cracking preshared keys


To get the XAUTH based authentication information (that is the part where 
the RADIUS Server is involved) you must start a man in the middle attack 
and this MITM attack is only possible when you've already cracked the 
preconfigured preshared key and when you are in physical position to 
perform a MITM attack (that's really not too easy).

Hope that helps ;-
