---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated SquirrelMail packages are now available for Red Hat Linux.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - noarch
Red Hat Linux 9 - noarch

3. Problem description:

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. Multiple vulnerabilities
have been found which affect versions of SquirrelMail shipped with Red Hat
Linux 8.0 and Red Hat Linux 9.

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in SquirrelMail version 1.2.10 and
earlier allow remote attackers to execute script as other Web users via
mailbox displays, message displays, or search results displays.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0160 to these issues.

All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages containing
SquirrelMail version 1.2.11, which is not vulnerable to these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

85860 - Cannot view or download attachments.

6. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 8.0:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/8.0/en/os/SRPMS/squirrelmail-1.2.11-1.src.rpm

noarch:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/8.0/en/os/noarch/squirrelmail-1.2.11-1.noarch.rpm

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/squirrelmail-1.2.11-1.src.rpm

noarch:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/noarch/squirrelmail-1.2.11-1.noarch.rpm



7. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available at http://www.redhat.com/solutions/security/news/publickey/

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
