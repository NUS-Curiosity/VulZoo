I'm not sure that XAUTH is the same as the "IKE Shared Secret AAA".
I got the impression from the Cisco docs that with the latter,
either the Radius password or something derived from it was used to
create the shared key for the initial Diffie-Hellman exchange.

I've documented my (probably faulty) understanding of the

Thanks for any clarity you can lend.
