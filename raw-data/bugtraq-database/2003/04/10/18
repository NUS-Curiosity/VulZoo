Subject: xfsdump creates files insecurely on IRIX


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

______________________________________________________________________________
                          SGI Security Advisory

Title    : xfsdump creates files insecurely
Number   : 20030404-01-P
Date     : April 10, 2003
Reference: CVE CAN-2003-0173
Reference: SGI BUG 885222
Fixed in : IRIX 6.5.20 (when available) or patches 5059 and 5060
______________________________________________________________________________

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that xfsdump creates quota information files insecurely,
possibly leading to a root exploit by a local user.

See: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0173

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected with patches and in future releases of
IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The xfsdump binary is installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems as part of
eoe.sw.base.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.16f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems if you need to
use xfsdump on xfs filesystems with quotas.  SGI recommends either upgrading
to IRIX 6.5.20 (when available), or installing the appropriate patch from
the listing below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.20 (when available), or install the
appropriate patch.
