Description:
  There have been a number of vulnerabilities found in MySQL and the MySQL 
  Client package.
  
  Unfortunately, Immunix does not protect against all of these problems.
  Our recomendation is to upgrade these packages immediately.  
  
  CAN-2002-1373
  Signed integer vulnerability in the COM_TABLE_DUMP package for MySQL 
  3.23.x before 3.23.54 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service 
  (crash or hang) in mysqld by causing large negative integers to be 
  provided to a memcpy call.
  
  CAN-2002-1374
  The COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x before 3.23.54, and 4.x before 
  4.0.6, allows remote attackers to gain privileges via a brute force attack 
  using a one-character password, which causes MySQL to only compare the 
  provided password against the first character of the real password.
  
  CAN-2002-1375
  The COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x before 3.23.54, and 4.x to 4.0.6, 
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long response.
  
  CAN-2002-1376
  libmysqlclient client library in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.54, and 4.x to 4.0.6, 
  does not properly verify length fields for certain responses in the (1) 
  read_rows or (2) read_one_row routines, which allows remote attackers to 
  cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.
