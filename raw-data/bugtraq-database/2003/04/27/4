The good news is: these executables are perfectly well understood by
unzip:

[/tmp]% sha1 Windows_Server_2003_Security_Guide.exe    
SHA1 (Windows_Server_2003_Security_Guide.exe) = 6661cfb90bebf5a8375af4a2b71057be6bf58372
[/tmp]% unzip -t Windows_Server_2003_Security_Guide.exe | grep -v testing:
Archive:  Windows_Server_2003_Security_Guide.exe
No errors detected in compressed data of Windows_Server_2003_Security_Guide.exe.

Thanks Microsoft, for not putting the documentation into some
ultra-proprietary format.
