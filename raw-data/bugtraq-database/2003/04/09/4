                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated httpd packages fix security vulnerabilities.
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:139-01
Issue date:        2003-04-09
Updated on:        2003-04-09
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          apache
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2002:222

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated httpd packages which fix a number of security issues are
now available for Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The Apache HTTP Web Server is a secure, efficient, and extensible Web
server that provides HTTP services.

A memory leak in Apache 2.0 through 2.0.44 allows remote attackers to cause
a significant denial of service (DoS) by sending requests containing lots
of linefeed characters.

Apache 2.0 does not filter terminal escape sequences from its access logs,
which could make it easier for attackers to insert those sequences into
terminal emulators containing vulnerabilities related to escape sequences.

Apache does not filter terminal escape sequences from its error logs, which
could make it easier for attackers to insert those sequences into terminal
emulators containing vulnerabilities related to escape sequences. 

All users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the
applicable errata packages containing back-ported fixes applied to Apache
version 2.0.40.

After the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running
the following command:

/sbin/service httpd restart

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

73428 - make install for php4 can't find instdso.sh
82142 - Apache leaking file descriptors to cgi-bin programs.
82587 - nph-*.cgi scripts fail with latest httpd rpm
86254 - Wrong path in config_vars.mk gives mod_jk build errors

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available at http://www.redhat.com/solutions/security/news/publickey/

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
