We've notified Opera of this concern almost three months ago (05-Feb-2003),
after 7.01 was released.
Here is a part of the original mail we sent:

--- Opera 7 security fix ---
... we did find another concern in the new version. Using opera.postError,
it is still possible to use:

opera.postError("http://');alert();");

This will cause a new debug message to be added to the console. If the user
clicks this URL in the console, the alert will be executed. This scenario is
not very likely though, because it requires that the user clicks an "odd"
looking URL.
--- Opera 7 security fix ---

Opera answered this email two days later, saying a fix will be included in
the new version. Apparently, they didn't take this scenario one step further
to filter out &#39; as well.

Cheers.
