Debian Security Advisory DSA 292-3                     security@...ian.org

Package        : mime-support
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary file creation
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no

I am awfully and sincerely sorry.  Apparently, I wasn't able to assign
enough time to this issue and produced insufficiently tested
updates.  I'll do my best not to repeat this.

This update fixes the second problem from the original advisory:

  When run-mailcap is executed on a file with a potentially
  problematic filename, a temporary file is created (not insecurely
  anymore), removed and a symbolic link to this filename is created.
  An attacker could recreate the file before the symbolic link is
  created, forcing the display program to display different content.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been corrected in
version 3.18-1.3.

For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been
corrected in version 3.9-1.3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.23-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mime-support packages.


Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
