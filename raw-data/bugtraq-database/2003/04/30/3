Hi All.

	For the last year or so I've published OpenSSH binary packages for AIX at
[1].

	I would like to advise all users of these packages that all versions up
to and including the 3.6.1p1 version *are* affected by this and have been
removed.

	A patched version (3.6.1p1-1) is available which addresses this issue.  I
urge all users of these packages to upgrade or apply the workaround
immediately.

    Good judgement comes with experience. Unfortunately, the experience
usually comes from bad judgement.
