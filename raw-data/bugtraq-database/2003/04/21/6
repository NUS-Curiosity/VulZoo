A *year-old* DoS.  This is one good reason for researchers to make sure 
they aren't posting duplicates.  I've criticized Microsoft's support 
policies in the past for cutting off support channels for small bugs such 
as this.

On a more positive note, I'd like to add that Microsoft is apparently re-
investigating this issue to determine why I wasn't able to squeeze at 
least a service-pack fix out of them. :-)

W2ksp3 is not vulnerable to the bug in the same way that other OSes are; 
MS nicely patched it so that it displayed a warning when processing 
folder templates over a network.  Other systems lack this protection, and 
will happily download and script folder content over a hostile network.  
By crafting the folder template to exploit this, you could cause an 
infinite loop on some Windows versions, as the shell crashes, and 
restarts automatically -- with its folders intact.  This starts an ugly 
spiral until the system becomes unusable from the console, and must be 
restarted.  Worse, similar behavior occurs the next time a user logs in --
 the system must be un-plugged from the internet to prevent the mess from 
starting over.
