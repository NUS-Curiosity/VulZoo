OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project

Package:             samba
Vulnerability:       remote root exploit
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= samba-2.2.8-20030405     >= samba-2.2.8a-20030407
OpenPKG 1.2          <= samba-2.2.7a-1.2.1       >= samba-2.2.7a-1.2.2
OpenPKG 1.1          <= samba-2.2.5-1.1.2        >= samba-2.2.5-1.1.3

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Digital Defense Inc. has discovered [1] a buffer overflow
  vulnerability in the Samba SMB/CIFS server [0]. An intruder
  exploiting this vulnerability could gain root access on the affected
  host system. An active exploit is publically available [2]. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2003-0201 [3] to the problem.

  Additional buffer overflows were detected by an internal code
  audit by the Samba team in response to the original report. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2003-0196 [4] to these additional problems.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  samba". If you have the "samba" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [5][6]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [7][8], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [9][10] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [11], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [5] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [6]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get samba-2.2.7a-1.2.2.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig samba-2.2.7a-1.2.2.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild samba-2.2.7a-1.2.2.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/samba-2.2.7a-1.2.2.*.rpm
