-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	samba
Affected products:	ImmunixOS 7.0, 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0201
Date:			Mon Apr  7 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-006-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...ex.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Digital Defense found an actively-exploited samba static-buffer
  overflow on a honeypot system. They figured out the vulnerable section
  of code and alerted the Samba team, who found some additional bugs
  while fixing this bug.

  In samba version 2.0.10, this buffer is located on the heap, so
  StackGuard does not provide protection for this buffer overflow.
  There are actively-used samba 2.2 exploits that allow remote anonymous
  users to gain local root privileges. The samba 2.2 exploit analyzed by
  Digital Defense used a statically allocated buffer. While we do not
  know of any exploits against the 2.0.10 version, it may be possible
  to re-write the exploit in use to attack the heap-based buffer in
  samba 2.0.10. We recommend upgrading.

  Please note this is different from (and includes the fixes from)
  IMNX-2003-7+-003-01, which addressed different samba security flaws.
