aim: kloned


Modified the encryption format to avoid guillermito's program.
http://www.pipo.com/guillermito/jpegx/index.html

Still has all previous features 
Can read version 1 & version 2 files.
Can clean files & overwrite jpegx messages in files.
Will automaticly overwrite with the new encryption format.

Now includes a wizard to make it easier to read/write jpeg files.
Got input? check out the new homepage.

Problem
--------------------------------------------------
Nothin complex here. Just open a crypted .jpg with
the wizard, enter ANY password and message is then
successfully decrypted. Only works when using the 
wizard.
