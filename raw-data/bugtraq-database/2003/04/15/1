 Over the weekend of April 12th and 13th someone once again was releasing
 back doored code for BitchX on a false ftp site that was linked from the
 official BitchX Website.  We stress to everyone to please take notice of
 information that we post on http://faq.bitchx.org to help prevent these
 problems from causing you to download falsified source code for BitchX.

So it's entirely possible the source you downloaded was backdoored;  It 
would have been nicer had you included the site you downloaded from.  
According to bitchx.org it looks like it was only one off-site FTP.  
As it was an 'official' FTP (the assumption we're making), whether 
they're to blame or not is left for someone else to decide.
