Netcomm, Vulnerability in FTP server

NB 1300 modem/router

Affected firmware: all known versions

______________________________________________

Description and Background:

The NB1300 has by default the ftp server (VxWorks (5.4.1)) exposed to the 
WAN interface. 
The default password is often not changed by the User.
User: admin Password: password
When connection is made to the ftp server the routers core system 
Files are exposed to the admin account. 
Perform a simple "get config.reg" and the username and password 
Of the account are given in clear text.

_______________________________________________

Impact:

1.
The username and password may be used to access the users 
Account details, collect their email, use the data available to them 
Etc... 
2. (untested) The system files of the VxWorks (5.4.1) OS may be modified 
or deleted 
to impact a denial of service, rendering device useless.

_______________________________________________

Fix: disable the ftp WAN access and/or change
Admin account details.

Recommendations:
Vendor to supply product with interface disabled by default
