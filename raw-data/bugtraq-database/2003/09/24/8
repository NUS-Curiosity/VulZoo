Mark,
	The code you just sent looks familiar to a SPAM I received
attempting to hijack users' e-gold accounts.  Out of curiosity I
followed that link which loaded start.html (attached).  What worries me
is that I'm running IE 6.0.2800.1106 with all the latest patches from
Microsoft and this page (start.html) rewrote wmplayer.exe on my local
drive without notice.  After closing the page, I found two .exe files on
my desktop (which loaded from http://doz.linux162.onway.net/eg/1.exe).
Is this a new unknown vulnerability?

Hi, can anyone shed some light on this for me?  If this is new, its 
going to spread like wildfire.  AOL or incidents lists have yet to 
reply....  it appears to be a legitimate threat as I have at least one 
user "infected" already..  Thank you..
