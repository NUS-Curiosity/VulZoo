That method of stealing was taken from my website, "counter" is used to trick users into thinking that the script is just for a counter, but in reality it is just the object vulnerability. Anyways, AIM will do nothing to fix this. Why? Because it is not a vulnerability within AIM, nor is it really there problem. Prevention-

1. Do not save passwords
2. Delete registry data (only if you use test buddy [staff aim], the passwords are in plain text)
3. Get a firewall
4. Update/Get a Virus Scanner
5. Get an IE patch

Do the above and you will be A-Okay, AIM-wise and all around security wise.
