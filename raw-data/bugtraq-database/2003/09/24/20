I agree with you that such errors should produce rejections.

But there's an awful lot of otherwise legitimate mail software out
there that commits (and more that accepts and passes along) rudimentary
errors like

- One-digit hour, minute, or second values
- Invalid timezone strings ("Pacific Standard Time", "CEST", "JST", etc)
- Completely missing timezones
- Non-encoded high-half characters in header text
  (From: "Fran√ßois" <fxm@...mple.net>)
- High-half characters in mail implicitly marked charset=US-ASCII
- Non-8859 characters (0x80-0x9f) in mail marked charset=iso-8859-1
- Retrying messages that have been 5xx-rejected

Indeed, I recently discovered I had been auto-unsubbed from this very
list for, as near as I can tell, rejecting mail exhibiting some of
those syntax errors.
