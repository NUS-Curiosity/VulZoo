Moreover, they're still working on this SMTP server. Just one week ago,
they were running another Postfix-like MTA, with completely different
behaviour:

root@...rch0:~# telnet kjashfjhshghgfddg.com 25
Trying 64.94.110.11...
Connected to kjashfjhshghgfddg.com.
Escape character is '^]'.

250 OK
data
221 snubby1-wcwest Snubby Mail Rejector Daemon v1.3 closing transmission
channelConnection closed by foreign host.

What if Verisign is planning to open more similar TCP/IP services on that
host? What if they're going to further modify the existing ones, to better
invade individuals' privacy?
