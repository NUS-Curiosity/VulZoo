[slackware-security]  ProFTPD Security Advisory (SSA:2003-259-02)

Upgraded ProFTPD packages are available for Slackware 8.1, 9.0 and
- -current.  These fix a security issue where an attacker could gain
a root shell by downloading a specially crafted file.


Here are the details from the Slackware 9.0 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
Tue Sep 23 14:43:10 PDT 2003
n/proftpd-1.2.8p-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to proftpd-1.2.8p (patched).
  This fixes a security problem in ProFTPD.  From http://www.proftpd.org:

    X-Force Research at ISS has discovered a remote exploit in ProFTPD's
    handling of ASCII translations that an attacker, by downloading a
    carefully crafted file, can exploit and gain a root shell.  The source
    distributions on ftp.proftpd.org have all been replaced with patched
    versions. All ProFTPD users are strongly urged to upgrade to one of
    the patched versions as soon as possible.

  Note that the upgraded package does not change the displayed version
  number to 1.2.8p (it remains 1.2.8), but we've verified the source code
  to make sure that this is in fact the patched version.  We recommend all
  sites running ProFTPD upgrade to the new package right away.
  (* Security fix *)
