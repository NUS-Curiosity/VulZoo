Art,
 
You are correct, I should not have replied to Mark when I had not yet had my morning coffee. The dynamic rendering of OBJECT elements still trigger the HTA functionality exposed in Windows. Personally, though, I see this as an unrelated vulnerability regarding static/dynamic code rendering which has a greater impact than just allowing HTA code to execute.
 
Both GM#001 and thePulls POC, which malware cites, are one and the same issue instead of two separate, they both trigger the dynamic rendering of HTML instead of the static - GM#001 just does this without requiring scripting.

	At the present, the patch for MS03-032 breaks one of at least three
	exploit techniques.  The patch does not resolve the vulnerability.
	MS03-032 acknowledges this.  I have seen several examples of this
	vulnerability being exploited in the wild.
	In particular, the current MS03-32 patch doesn't account for an HTML
	document created via XML/data binding:
	
	  <http://greymagic.com/adv/gm001-ie/>
	
	The patch also does not account for an HTML document created via
	script:
