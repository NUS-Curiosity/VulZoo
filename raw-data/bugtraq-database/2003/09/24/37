At the present, the patch for MS03-032 breaks one of at least three
exploit techniques.  The patch does not resolve the vulnerability.
MS03-032 acknowledges this.  I have seen several examples of this
vulnerability being exploited in the wild.

In particular, the current MS03-32 patch doesn't account for an HTML
document created via XML/data binding:

The patch also does not account for an HTML document created via
script:
