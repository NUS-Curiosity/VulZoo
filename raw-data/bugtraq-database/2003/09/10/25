[exp]
refer to BackMyParent at UMBRELLA.MX.TC.

so, the chanllenge is: "javascript-protocol Url is left
in the history list"
in this attack:
window.open("javascript:[JpuScript]"), and then use
"NavigateAndFind" to navigate to [VictimUrl],
At last, Javascript-protocol Url is left in the history
list.
