Subject: MSIE->LinkillerSaveRef:another caller-based authorization




LinkillerSaveRef:another caller-based authorization(is
broken).
("that's all" is end of file if you are in a hurry)

[tested]
Browser Ver
{ 
MS Internet Explorer: 6.0.2600.0000.xpclnt_qfe.021108-2107;
Encryption: 128-bit;
Patch:; Q810847; 
}
(So, it's far from fully patched. It also works after
applying the patch for method caching attack.) 
OS Ver: "Windows XP Cn ver"

[demo]
http://www.safecenter.net/liudieyu/LinkillerSaveRef/LinkillerSaveRef-MyPage.HTM
or
http://umbrella.mx.tc 
---> LinkillerJPU section
---> LinkillerJPU-MyPage file

[exp]
refer to "Linkiller" at UMBRELLA.MX.TC
progress: 
another caller-based authorization.
"method caching attack" still works if root-caller is
the victim.

[how]
got a new hammer, search for a new nail.

[greetings]
the Pull, dror, guninski, http-equiv, sandblad,
greymagic and "Friedrich L.Bauer"(man, for your
execellent book).
of course, mom and dad.

best wishes
