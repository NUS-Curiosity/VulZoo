Subject: MSIE->Findeath: break caller-based authorization




Findeath: break caller-based authorization.
("that's all" is end of file if you are in a hurry)

[tested]
Browser Ver
{ 
MS Internet Explorer: 6.0.2600.0000.xpclnt_qfe.021108-2107;
Encryption: 128-bit;
Patch:; Q810847; 
}
(So, it's far from fully patched.) 
OS Ver: "Windows XP Cn ver"

[demo]
(press CTRL+F and search for something.) 
http://www.safecenter.net/liudieyu/Findeath/Findeath-MyPage.HTM
or
http://umbrella.mx.tc 
---> Findeath section
---> Findeath-MyPage file

[exp]
window.open checks the root-caller's security id.
("root-caller" is some script which is not invoked by
another function.) 

my function can be called by the FIND
dialog(RES-protocol page in MYCOMPUTER zone):
hijack this function:
"window.document.selection.createRange"
and ask the user to search for something.
at last, FIND dialog calls
"window.document.selection.createRange".

[how]
while using the CTRL+F dialog, i suddenly remembered
einstein. 
he stated: if time can change others, time can also be
changed be others. 
of course, i know the FIND dialog are calling some
methods in the main window obj, 
so window obj can also play some tricks. (yeah.
einstein is not always a loser. :-) )

and then thanks to "GreyMagic" for "GreyMagic Security
Advisory GM#002-OP"
he/they used function hijack. oh, just a reminder.

[greetings]
the Pull, dror, guninski, greymagic, sandblad and
"Friedrich L.Bauer".
of course, mom and dad.

best wishes
