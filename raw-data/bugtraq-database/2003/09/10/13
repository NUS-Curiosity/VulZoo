Subject: Re: Microsoft security update broken?


Hi

Maybe it has someting to do with M$ having ended support of Win98 as of 
30th June 2003, or have people detected the same problem with other Win 
OS's?

I say this quoting a previous bugtraq message from Andreas Marx dated 
5th Sept. 2003:

"Hi!

I was just wondering what has happened with MS03-034, because Windows 98 
was not listed as platform anymore (in the section "Platforms not 
affected"), only Windows Me. This usually means, that this platform is 
not supported any longer and no further patches will be provided 
anymore. I contacted Microsoft and they told me, that this is the case 
with Windows 98/98 SE:

THERE WILL BE NO MORE (FREE) SECURITY UPDATES FOR THIS PLATFORM (WIN 
98). PERIOD.

According to their lifecycle policy 
(http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?id=fh;[ln];lifeprodw) the 
free-of-charge support period has ended 30-Jun-2003. But I always 
thought that they will still be releasing security updates until the 
end-of-life-period, which is, according to the above website, 16-Jan-2004.

However, I was wrong. So, if you're still using Windows 98/98 SE you 
should switch to an other OS very soon. I'm sure that new security 
vulnerabilities will be discovered on this platform and due to the fact, 
that there will be no more security updates, the use of Windows 98 will 
get more and more risky every day. Virus authors will adopt these 
security vulnerabilities soon to get their nasty malwares spreading 
faster than ever. And without a proper fix from MS, you will run into 
big trouble.

If a Blaster-like worm will be released that affected Win 9x platforms, 
you won't be able to use your computer anymore, because there will be no 
fix for it. No av program would help you much, because they can only 
stop dropped files, but not the exploit itself. You have lost. You will 
need to switch to a more recent OS. And you have to pay for it...

Bears thinking about maybe...
