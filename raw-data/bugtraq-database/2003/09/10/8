[exp]
try this Url in your browser:
file:javascript:alert(123)

yeah. "file" protocol is a good thing for bypassing
URL-based security check.
one vulnerable function is
"window.external.NavigateAndFind" method.

you should have already known this:
top window and its iframe/frame share the same
"external" object.
so, BadSon method to conquer the "external" object.


[how]
how to get "file:javascript:" trick?
think about "mhtml:http:" for a while and i believed
there would be more.

of course, mom and dad.
