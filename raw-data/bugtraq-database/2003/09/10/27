  The fix has been committed to -STABLE branch.
  
  You don't need to upgrade to -current, moreover this is not a trivial
operation since the format of executables files changed on x86 since 3.3.
  
  Just keep your current 3.3 version, sync your CVS tree with the OPENBSD_3_3
tag, recompile your kernel and reboot.

  If you're not familiar with the process of following the -STABLE branch,
please have a look at :

  http://www.openbsd.org/stable.html
  http://www.uk.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html
  http://www.openbsd.org/cvsup.html
  
  Best regards,
