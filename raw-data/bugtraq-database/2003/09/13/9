===============
1) Introduction
===============

MyServer is a free, powerful web server program designed to be easily run on
a personal
Computer by the average computer user.
It is a multithread application and supports HTTP, CGI, ISAPI, WinCGI and
FastCGI protocols.


======
2) Bug
======

a buffer overflow might allow Remote attacker to invoke malicious code by
submitting a request containing excessive data.
That will cause a buffer overflow and might allow to run code of choice
Under the web server privileges.
The problem is in the MSCGI library (cgi-lib.dll) that doesn’t handle
correctly long
String values for the URI variables.


====================
3) Proof of concept.
====================

nc.exe -v www.victim.com < request.txt

--
The script is attached.
This will crash the program with a memory overflow.


======
4) Fix
======

The author has confirmed this bug and temporary fix is available through
MyServer cvs repository at:
http://myserverweb.sourceforge.net/cvs.php
Complete patch will be available in the next upcoming release of myserver.
