Hey!

He was testifying before a Congressional commitee.  He was drunk on the power 
and importance of the situation and talking "up" to his audience.  He was 
seeking influence, and gave the message that he thought would mark him in 
good stead with the `august assemblage`.

Have you ever been in a car with 4 other people, and stopped by a cop?  Did 
you ever have one of your friends suddenly become "good citizen" and deputize 
themselves?  Same psychology.  You find the status-seekers at work like this.  
They'll make the deals that get themselves promoted.  If it is at your 
expense - maybe you'll find out later.  Maybe not.  

Do not trust the heads of corporations - for the simple fact that their 
interests are /not/ the same as your own.  If they coincide for the time 
being, understand that this is just another circumstance they will take 
advantage of.  The CEO of /any/ major corporation cares far more about the 
position and status of CEO than they do any abstract like 'information 
security' or 'freedom of association'.  Do not expect loyalty from the tiger 
when mealtime arrives.
