Subject: Re: Internet explorer 6 on windows XP allows exection of arbitrary code (Demonstration Exploit Warning)


Hi,

Jelmer probably forgot to mention this about the
demonstration exploit[1] in his advisory[2]: Back up
"C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe"
before using the exploit as the exploit replaces the
original wmplayer.exe(main WMP executable) with the
dropped file(also named wmplayer.exe). After
exploitation, the dropped wmplayer.exe can be deleted
and the backed-up, original version replaced.

If this is not done, the existing installation of
Windows Media Player will be damaged and will have to
be reinstalled. And, ofcourse, since the exploit
depends on replacing the WMP executable, it will not
work if Media Player is running. Test the exploit
while Media Player is not running.

Tested here successfully with Win2kSP0 IE6 WMP9.
