Subject: Windows Movie maker 2 determines a supportive file type JUST by
 judging its extension!





---DESCRIPTION---
Windows Movie Maker 2 only determines whether a file type is supportive by it or not, ONLY by judging its extension. So, suppose if you have to import a VCD movie (*.dat) to your Windows Movie Maker 2 you have to copy the whole file to a read/write drive rename its extension to *.mov (ie: any extension that media player 2 recognizes)
	Amazingly, windows movie maker 1 effectively judges a supportive movie file by its header so it doesn't matter even if you rename a movie file to *.zip, it would effectively look at the header data and allow us to import in WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER 1. But strangely, Windows Movie Maker judges a supportive file type just by judging its extension! This could prove very inconvenient if we have to import a file through network or read-only drives.

---CONCLUSION---
INDEED A POOR PROGRAMMING PRACTICE! (o;
