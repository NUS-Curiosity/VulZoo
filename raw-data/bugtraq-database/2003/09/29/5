Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0037

Package name:      proftpd
Summary:           remote exploit if upload enabled
Date:              2003-09-27
Affected versions: TSL 1.2, 1.5, 2.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  ProFTPd is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity,
  security, and ease of configuration.  It features a very Apache-like
  configuration syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure,
  including support for multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and
  permission-based directory visibility.


Problem description:
  An error exists in the ASCII upload handling of Proftpd version 1.2.7
  and later that can be used to trigger an buffer overflow and thus
  execute arbitrary code.  This has now been fixed.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.
