Synopsis:          Updated OpenSSL packages fix vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:292-01
Issue date:        2003-09-30
Updated on:        2003-09-30
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          ASN.1 ASN1 openSSL
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2003:101
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0543 CAN-2003-0544 CAN-2003-0545

1. Topic:

Updated OpenSSL packages that fix ASN.1 parsing vulnerabilities are now
available for Red Hat Linux 9.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386, i686

3. Problem description:

OpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, open source toolkit that
implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security
(TLS v1) protocols, as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography
library.

NISCC testing of implementations of the SSL protocol uncovered two bugs in
OpenSSL 0.9.6 and OpenSSL 0.9.7.  The parsing of unusual ASN.1 tag values
can cause OpenSSL to crash. A remote attacker could trigger this bug by
sending a carefully-crafted SSL client certificate to an application.  The
effects of such an attack vary depending on the application targetted;
against Apache the effects are limited, as the attack would only cause
child processes to die and be replaced.  An attack against other
applications that use OpenSSL could result in a Denial of Service.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the names CAN-2003-0543 and CAN-2003-0544 to this issue. 

NISCC testing of implementations of the SSL protocol uncovered an
additional bug in OpenSSL 0.9.7.  Certain ASN.1 encodings that are
rejected as invalid by the parser can trigger a bug in deallocation of a
structure, leading to a double free.  A remote attacker could trigger this
bug by sending a carefully-crafted SSL client certificate to an
application. It may be possible for an attacker to exploit this issue to
execute arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0545 to this issue.

These erratum packages contain patches provided by the OpenSSL group that
protects against these issues.

Because server applications are affected by this issue, users are advised
to either restart all services that use OpenSSL functionality or reboot
their systems after installing these updates. 

Red Hat would like to thank NISCC and Stephen Henson for their work on
these vulnerabilities.

These packages also include a patch from OpenSSL 0.9.6f which removes
the calls to abort the process in certain circumstances.  Red Hat would
like to thank Patrik Hornik for notifying us of this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

99066 - memory leak in SSL_new()

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
