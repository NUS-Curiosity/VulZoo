Agreed, I noticed they did put some effort into fixing these issues
eg. the greymagic issue with the malformed xml file for instance only
allowed  xss'ing a a site containinging this file.
before sp1 one would have been able to script in the res:// page. wich would
have much more severe consequences concidering that
IE's zoning system is just so horribly and utterly broken.  So they did well
on this , the problem just is that microsoft keeps having these
little oversights, special cases they forget about such as the res pages in
the mediabar or also recently forgetting to patch the dynamic version of the
object tag.
It's generally a tell tale sign of bad software design

Combining vulnerabilies is nothing new people always have and always will.
HTTP-EQUIV seems especially well versed in this kind of stuff, remember for
instance my mhtml/codebase trick and his mediaplayer issue wich also lead to
code execution.
IE is rather heavily researched so at any given time you will have quite a
number of unpatched vulnerabilties, as you are probably more aware of than
anybody, considering http://pivx.com/larholm/unpatched/ is your site :)
For non buffer overflow  code execution generally a number of conditions has
to be met. in this case it where 3

- find way of executing code
- find something to inject the exploit code in
- find something that will allow us to inject exploit code into stuff not
under our control

seperatly none of these is perticularly dangerous but combined their full
power is unleeched
But it's a lot to ask from a single researcher to ask to come up with 3
issues (unless your name is Liu Die Yu  offcourse :) then you can easily
come up with 10 hehe) I got to 2 liu provided 3
