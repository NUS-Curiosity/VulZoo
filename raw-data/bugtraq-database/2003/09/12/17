Subject: Update to the Oracle EXTPROC advisory


Hello,
Please note that Oracle has updated the extproc buffer overrun advisory.
There was some confusion caused because the intial Oracle advisory stated
that a username and password were required to exploit the overflow which was
contrary to the results of our research; we concluded that no user ID or
password was necessary. Whilst I answered many of the mails querying this
discrepancy, for those that I did not have a chance to reply to, please
accept my apologies. The updated Oracle can be found here :
http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/2003alert57.pdf . In summary,
Oracle 9i Database Release 2, Oracle 9i Database Release 1 and Oracle 8i
Database (8.1.x) are all vulnerable and that "Risk to exposure is high, as a
valid username and password is not needed in all cases to exploit this
potential vulnerability."
Cheers,
