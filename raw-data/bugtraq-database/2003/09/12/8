Subject: Re: Internet explorer 6 on windows XP allows exection of arbitrary code


The new addition here is abusing how you are able to load a ressource file,
residing in a  local security zone, into a window object. Service Pack 1 for IE6
did a lot to deter this on most regular window objects, but should have extended
that effort to searchpanes as well. Seeing as the content of a search pane can
be any registered COM extension to IE, perhaps more should be done to completely
separate these from the reach of ordinary scripting.

Combining the mediabar ressource loading with the file-protocol proxy
demonstrates just how effectively one can combine several vulnerabilities to
achieve a higher level of automation in planting and executing files. The media
bar ressource loading, and any other ressource loading technique, can be
combined with any other cross-domain scripting vulnerability to achieve the same
result.

We will definitely see more combinatorial vulnerabilities in the time to come.
