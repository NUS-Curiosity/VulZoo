When you log onto XBOX live it will automatically updates EVERY MS
software that's on it.  And it wont let you cancel. It will also
download and run a check for modifications to your XBOX.  And if it
finds any will ban your MAC address and kick you off the live service.
And towards the end of the EULA it states "Microsoft reserves the right
to upgrade\modify software on your XBOX system"

Subject: Computer Sabotage by Microsoft

 

Hi,

 

well it finally happened. I came back home after work, connected my

XBOX to the internet and went into the XBOX-Live menu configuration.

Well what happened. The XBOX started automaticly downloading the new

crappy XBOX-Live dashboard, which is of course fixed. 

 

This is IMHO an act of computer sabotage. I have never allowed MS

to modify my dashboard or to auto update my dashboard.

 

Is any lawyer on the list who can point me to the right paragraphs?

I do not believe this computer sabotage is legal in any european

country.

 

Yours,

Stefan Esser
