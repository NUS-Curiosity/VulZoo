Hello,

> And towards the end of the EULA it states "Microsoft reserves the 
> right to upgrade\modify software on your XBOX system"

and BMW reserves the right to remove the wheels of your car when they want
to.

Even if that would be within any agreement. Once you bought your car, anyone
touching it (including BMW) will go to court. There is no logical reason why
law should handle the copy of software on the XBOX harddisk in a different
way than a car. If it does, the law itself is flawed.
