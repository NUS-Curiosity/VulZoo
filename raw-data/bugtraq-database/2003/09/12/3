Subject: RE: Computer Sabotage by Microsoft


	This would be part of the service agreement you agreed to when
you bought Xbox-Live. Since Xbox-dash and Xbox-Live are so intergral to
one another and any online gaming service you sign up for
(battlenet/gamespy/etc..)  require that you have the most up-to-date
versions to play on their network, I don't belive that this is Illegal.
I'm not compleletly surprised at this due to the heavy handed approach
Microsoft has taken towards maintaining security on the Xbox-Live
network.

Hi,

well it finally happened. I came back home after work, connected my XBOX
to the internet and went into the XBOX-Live menu configuration.
Well what happened. The XBOX started automaticly downloading the new
crappy XBOX-Live dashboard, which is of course fixed. 

This is IMHO an act of computer sabotage. I have never allowed MS to
modify my dashboard or to auto update my dashboard.

Is any lawyer on the list who can point me to the right paragraphs?
I do not believe this computer sabotage is legal in any european
country.

Yours,
Stefan Esser
