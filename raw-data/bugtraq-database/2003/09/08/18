It  proofs code needs to be rewritten. I don't understand why limitation
is  on  per  minute,  not per second base. Oh no - I understand. This is
result  of  the  code  was  written  more  than 10 years ago. But what I
completely  misunderstand  is  how  disabling  service  for  10  minutes
increases security. It's because I'm green, stupid and brain damaged.

IMHO  reasonable  behavior is limiting a number of requests accepted per
second  without  disabling service. But this code became a kind of saint
cow.  Only hope is young monsters like xinetd will rid this dinosaur off
as a result of evolution.
