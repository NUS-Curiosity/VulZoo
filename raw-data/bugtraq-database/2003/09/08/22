Subject: Microsoft security update broken?


The microsoft security update for MS03-023 downloaded via the windows update web site appears to be broken.  Either the patch does not properly install or is not able to be detected by the web based update scan after install.

Symptoms:  running the update-scan at www.windowsupdate.com after having already installed the MS03-023 update will continue to indicate the MS03-023 patch has not yet been installed on the target system, under windows 98.  I've rebooted and rescanned a win98 system 4 times and every time it comes up saying the patch has not been installed.  I haven't tested this on other windowws platforms yet.

Has anyone else noticed this?  Is it just my systems with the problem?  Could the microsoft update not really be installing or maybe the update scan isn't looking for the correct files?
