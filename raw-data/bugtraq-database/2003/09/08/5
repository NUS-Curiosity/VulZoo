Description of product:
-----------------------

The ICQ Web Front is a simple tool designed for
creating your very own Web site, which communicates
directly with your ICQ. The pages of your Web site
are stored in your PC, and when you are online your
PC acts as a mini server, which other ICQ users and
the Internet community at large can connect to
and view. The ICQ Web Front will enable other ICQ
and Internet users to request a chat with you,
send messages directly to your Contact List,
view your personal details including your picture,
and even download pre-defined files from your hard disk.
