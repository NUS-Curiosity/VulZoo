You don't want to start with the "original".  Really.

You could start with my version.  I've integrated the best features of
FreeBSD and OpenBSD into one derived the NetBSD version.

See NetBSD's PR#18955.  Let me know if you want the very latest source
from my local 1.6.x-STABLE tree (I should append it to the PR soon though).

I will certainly take a look at the mechanisms implemented for Apache.

Thanks for posting this reference!

Fending off D.D.o.S. attacks that make normal service requests of public
servers while still maintaining usable services is anything but easy.  :-)
