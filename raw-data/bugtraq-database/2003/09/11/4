Hi, I have created a similar effect with the same funcionality
by using 131A6951-7F78-11D0-A979-00C04FD705A2 object
and Jelmer's trick to raise drag&drop back in April [worx for WinXP only].
I wonder if your code is similar, however your page is not accesible, cannot
check.

*Cannot provide the working demo [maybe except private], as I agreed with my
current employer not to publish any exploit or content similar in
functionality by any means.
