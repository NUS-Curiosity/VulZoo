Subject: Windows 2003 Server - Defeating the stack protection mechanism


For those interested, NGSS has just published a paper describing how to
defeat the mechanism built into Windows 2003 Server to prevent exploitation
of stack based buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Previous work done in this
area presented methods that only worked in highly specific scenarios - the
new methods presented in this paper are generic. The paper can be downloaded
from http://www.nextgenss.com/papers/defeating-w2k3-stack-protection.pdf .
