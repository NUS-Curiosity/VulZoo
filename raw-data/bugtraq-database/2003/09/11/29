You gave those scoundrels at Microsoft your money, and are now surprised that 
they behave like...

scoundrels?

The box was already chipped and keyed against /you/ when you bought it.  That 
doesn't sound like a good purchase decision - unless you are informed of the 
nature and limitations this represents.  It sounds like you have some idea 
about this:  You say 'it /finally/ happened'.

Xbox is spyware and a testbed for NGSCB/Palladium.  They don't make enough 
ten-foot-poles to keep this stuff away.
