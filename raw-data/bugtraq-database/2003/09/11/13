                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated pine packages fix vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:273-01
Issue date:        2003-09-11
Updated on:        2003-09-11
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          iDefense
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2002:270
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0720 CAN-2003-0721
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated Pine packages that resolve remotely exploitable security issues are
now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.1 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Pine, developed at the University of Washington, is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages (including mail and news).

A buffer overflow exists in the way unpatched versions of Pine prior to
4.57 handle the 'message/external-body' type. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0720
to this issue.

An integer overflow exists in the Pine MIME header parsing in versions
prior to 4.57.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0721 to this issue.

Both of these flaws could be exploited by a remote attacker sending a
carefully crafted email to the victim that will execute arbitrary code when
the email is opened using Pine.

All users of Pine are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain a backported security patch correcting these issues.

Red Hat would like to thank iDefense for bringing these issues to our
attention and the University of Washington for the patch.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt
