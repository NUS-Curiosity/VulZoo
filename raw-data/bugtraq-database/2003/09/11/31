As far as I know in the EU the EULA of MS is not worth the paper it is
written on.

Fact is fact: They updated my dashboard without my written permission.
This is computer sabotage and it also decreased the value of the box,
because it doesnt allow executing of arbitrary programs anymore.
One of the features of the box i payed nearly 200 euros for. And I do
not see anywhere on the box a sticker that says "MS monopoly alert,
does only play what MS wants"

(ignoring the fact that the XBOX is advertised as playing audio cds
which is not true with all those CD copy protections in .de)
