Subject: Symantec wants to criminalize security info sharing


Hi,

Here's an interesting quote from John Schwarz, the COO of Symantec, in a
Wired.com article from today:

   Just Say No to Viruses and Worms
   http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,60391,00.html

   "But perhaps the most controversial suggestion came 
   from John Schwarz, president and COO of antivirus 
   firm Symantec, who called for legislation to criminalize 
   the sharing of information and tools online that can be 
   used by malicious hackers and virus writers." 

As we all know, when it comes to discussing information about computer
security vulnerabilities, it is difficult to separate security uses of
this information and hacking uses of the same information.

For example, if Symantec were to get this law passed, are they prepared
to see their employees who work on the Bugtraq email list go to jail?
;-)
