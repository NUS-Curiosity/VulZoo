Subject: Liu Die Yu findings verified, details


Some of you may find that Lius webpage at safecenter.net/liudieyu is
inaccessible - this is caused by DNS problems. My USA based machines
resolve safecenter.net to 64.85.73.31 which doesn't know about any
liudieyu, while my EU based machines resolve safecenter.net to
66.70.10.15 where you can find his site. Interested people should change
their hosts file.

Since Liu is testing on IE6 Gold (6.0.2600.0000.xpclnt_qfe.021108-2107),
some of the vulnerabilities he has found are long patched, while others
still exist in IE6 SP1.

Some are patched at an unknown time without notice in any security
bulletin, others are explicitly patched by the latest cumulative IE
patch, MS03-032, which can be found at

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-032.asp


Works:
======
WsOpenFileJPU, cross-domain scripting
HiJackClick: 1+1=2, pointing mouseclicks on non-IE windows, adding to
favorites
NAFjpuInHistory, cross-domain scripting
WsFakeSrc, cross-domain scripting
NAFfileJPU, cross-domain scripting
BackMyParent2:Multi-Thread version, cross-domain scripting
RefBack, cross-domain scripting

Doesn't work:
=============
Findeath, patched by MS03-032
LinkillerJPU, patched by MS03-032
WsBASEjpu, specifically patched by MS03-032
BodyRefreshLoadsJPU
WsOpenJpuInHistory


The impact of the working cross-domain scripting vulnerabilities is
known for ages, cookie theft, identify theft, stealing  sensitive
information such as banking data and, once you get a window object
pointed at a local zone, local file reading and command execution.

Hijacking mouse events for IE and routing them to non-IE/system windows
is sure to reveal several new vulnerabilities or variations in the time
to come.

With these 7 new, the total number of publicly known unpatched
vulnerabilities in IE is now at 30:
