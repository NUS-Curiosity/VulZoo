Subject: Jamming communication [COM] ports in windows...


---Description---
In windows filenames like CON, AUX, PRN, CLOCK$ ,COM* , LPT* [ "*" stands for 1, 2, 3, 4 etc... ] can't be created cauz it's reserved for "System Device Driver" NAMES by OS itself.

---Exploit---

Well, using simple command "say"

edit COM*                  [ "*" stands for 1, 2, 3, 4 etc... ]

---<Example>---

c:\> edit COM8         < Here COM8 was actually reserved by my MODEM in my computer >

type it in CMD prompt or "RUN" etc... Using this Any/EVERY available communication port's in WINDOWS could be JAMMMED! By using JUST the privileges of a "GUEST" account.

---Summery---
The exploits have been successfully tried in Windows xp pro. and windows 98. I assume! It works in all versions of windows. While trying the exploit THE COM* should not be in use.
