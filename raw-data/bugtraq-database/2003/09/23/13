Subject: VeriSign's SiteFinder VS Microsoft smart search


With VeriSigns new SiteFinder tool now in action, I decided to check if 
Microsofts "smart search" using the MSN technology was still working properly.

For reference to Microsofts smart search read this article.

By default when you install Internet Explorer 5.5 and up you have smart search 
installed and set active.  What this does is if you go to a nonexistent 
website, like www.aamazon.com you would be shown a list of possible sites you 
may be interested in.  This is just like what VeriSign is doing, only at the 
browser level.  It also allows you to search from your address bar instead of 
using a search engine, or 3rd party browser attachment.

>From my tests Microsofts smart search no longer works, but Sitefinder looks so 
simular to Microsofts smart search that most users will not notice a change.

My questions are, has anyone else tested this and seen the same results, and 
has Microsoft has done anything in retaliation to this, or filed any compliants.
