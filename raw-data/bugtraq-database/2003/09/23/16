Subject: [Fwd: Re: AIM Password theft]

Hi, can anyone shed some light on this for me?  If this is new, its 
going to spread like wildfire.  AOL or incidents lists have yet to 
reply....  it appears to be a legitimate threat as I have at least one 
user "infected" already..  Thank you..

Hi, please find attached the vbs code that appears to be running when 
visitors hit www.haxr.org.

This reportedly pulls username/password from registry of AIM accounts, 
then something elsewhere gets buddy lists through this password theft 
and sends links to them via AOL to start the process again.

We've had at least one "infection" if you want to call it that, and a 
user's AIM account was hijacked and this link sent to all users in his 
buddy list which then propelled the "infection" as they click the link 
to www.haxr.org.

Does anyone have any information about this issue?  Any help on this 
would be greatly appreciated. Still chasing it down..

-Mark Coleman
