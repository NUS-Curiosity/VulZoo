Subject: RE: Winamp 2.91 lets code execution through MIDI files


As was the case with Windows Media Player, when you install Winamp the
registry settings for MIDI files are set to automatically open the file
in the associated program. As such, this is also automatically
exploitable through webpages and HTML mail.
