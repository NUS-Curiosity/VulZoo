Subject: Administrivia: [Important] Community Involvement in the Future of
 Bugtraq



Good day,

We here at SecurityFocus value the community and would like to
involve you, the Bugtraq subscribers, in its operation.  As part of that
effort, we are considering implementing a more democratic process for
making important decisions on the future of Bugtraq and the
Security Focus website.  Before we attempt this, we would like to know how
many subscribers would actually vote if a system were developed allowing
this.  We are also interested in hearing any feedback, concerns, or issues that
members of the community wish to express.  Please take a few moments to
reply to this message if you are interested in participating in
collectively guiding Bugtraq forward.  We will follow-up on this
proposition if the response to this initial probe indicates that a
significant portion of the user base is willing to take part.

Kind regards,

David Mirza Ahmad & and the rest of the staff of SecurityFocus.

The battle for the past is for the future.
We must be the winners of the memory war.
