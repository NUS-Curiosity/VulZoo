Synopsis:          Updated gtkhtml packages fix vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:264-01
Issue date:        2003-09-09
Updated on:        2003-09-09
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2003:126
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0541
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated gtkhtml packages that fix a null pointer dereference are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

GtkHTML is the HTML rendering widget used by the Evolution mail reader. 

Versions of GtkHTML prior to 1.1.10 contain a bug when handling HTML
messages.  Alan Cox discovered that certain malformed messages could cause
the Evolution mail component to crash due to a null pointer dereference in
the GtkHTML library.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0541 to this issue.

Users of Evolution are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain GtkHTML version 1.1.10 correcting this issue.

Red Hat would like to thank the Ximian security team for investigating and
fixing this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt
