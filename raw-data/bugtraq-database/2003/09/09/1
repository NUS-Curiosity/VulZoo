Some AV will catch these because of malware's exploit code which he has
reused. Some AV will catch this because of greymagic's exploit code. Which
is all fine and good, a bit like a magic trick. Yes, the demonstration
exploit is caught... But the worm or trojan exploit someone maliciously
sends to your system -- this won't be caught. 

The only sure way to detect this, I already wrote about [to Bugtraq]. That
is by setting a firewall rule which blocks the dangerous mimetype string
[Content-Type: application/hta]. Everything else in the exploit can change. 

But, why merely detect it and risk encoded and other types of AV/IDS/IPS
evading techniques? Why not just do this fix? I think, ultimately, it
depends on how safe you want to be. Some people do not mind having their
systems be at risk. That is their choice.
