Subject: Re: CyberInsecurity: The cost of Monopoly


Destroying the monopoly also lets the World get rid of (Anti)Virus 
companies, since they are protected by Microsoft Virus Support(TM).

Viruses are a threat which has been intentionally neglected by Microsoft 
since the AntiVirus thing became a business. A BIG business. Imagine if 
Microsoft removed the Virus Support. Billions of dollars would stop 
being moved from people's pockets to the software giants. Mega companies 
would simply disappear from the Market. Hundreds of people would be 
unemployed. Given the facts, Microsoft is simply UNABLE to fix such 
vulnerabilities.

Vulnerabilities in Microsoft systems can only be fixed before they 
become a business. This rule has became worst after their antitrust trial.

Virues have never been a threat for Open Source systems, since they 
(viruses) use vulnerabilities that get fixed by users *regardless* of 
some company liking or not.

Diversification and Open Source is the solution for most security threats.

These guys have done a GREAT WORK!
