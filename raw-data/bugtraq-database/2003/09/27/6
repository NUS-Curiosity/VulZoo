thankfully, some of us will see Dan as a hero and @stake as another
wannabe monopoly.  i have noticed the overall quality of @stake's work
going down the tubes of late.  just another nail in the coffin?

yeah, i know, this won't get through.  mailing lists ran by the nazi's
probably won't allow allied propoganda through.  but damn, i used to have
such high respect for those guys (@stake)...  "used to" being the key
phrase.
