Subject: MDKSA-2003:088 - Updated pam_ldap packages fix vulnerability with pam filtering

                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
________________________________________________________________________

Package name:           pam_ldap
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:088
Date:                   September 2nd, 2003

Affected versions:	9.1
________________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 A bug was fixed in pam_ldap 162 with the pam_filter mechanism which is
 commonly used for host-based access restriction in environments using
 LDAP for authentication.  Mandrake Linux 9.1 provided pam_ldap 161
 which had this problem and as a result, systems relying on pam_filter
 for host-based access restriction would allow any user, regardless of
 the host attribute associated with their account, to log into the
 system.  All users who use LDAP-based authentication are encouraged to
 upgrade immediately.
