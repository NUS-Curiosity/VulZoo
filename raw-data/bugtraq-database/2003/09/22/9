Subject: Denial of service vulnerability in Xitami Open Source Web Server


Denial of service vulnerability in Xitami Open Source Web Server
================================================================

Date: 22.09.2003
=====


Affected Systems
================

The vulnerability was discovered on several versions (production and 
beta) of Xitami
webserver for Windows NT:

- Xitami 2.5B4 (bw3225b4.exe)
- Xitami 2.5B4 (bs3225b4.exe)
- Xitami 2.4D9 (bw3224d9.exe)

I did no tests with the other versions and os/platforms (OS/2, Alpha, 
OpenVMS, Unix).
Therfore i can't confirm that the vulnerability exists there.

The Problem
===========

Xitami is a multiplatform open source web server and the flagship of iMatix.
The services crashes when it receives a http get request (to a .shtm 
file) with 
a header field of >= 5154 bytes, followed by a ":".
 
Xitami dies due to a Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Error, an
abnormal program termination inside XIWIN32.EXE has occurred. 
The message is *not* followed by any Win32 exception dialog.

Vendor:
=======

iMatix was informed about the vulnerability on 04.09.2003 and 05.09.2003 
via email.
Up to now, i did not receive an answer from iMatix :(

You can visit the vendors webpage here:

Other Notes
===========
Unlike some server crashes, the service process will *not* recover from 
the crash
caused by the attack.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will NOT be logged, as the
service crashes.

It seems also not to be clear, what the actual production and beta release
versions are.
At http://www.xitami.com/download.htm, the current production is 2.4d9 
and the current
beta is 2.5b5.
At the same time, at http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index2.htm, the 
current
production is 2.5b4 and the current beta is 2.5b4?!?
