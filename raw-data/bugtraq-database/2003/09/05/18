It sort of seems similar to etherleak but minus the horrible part. I
don't know what part of memory it would return, but I think because of
the nature of the service it could return areas of protected memory.

"Under certain conditions, the response to a NetBT Name Service query
may, in addition to the typical reply, contain random data from the
target system's memory. This data could, for example, be a segment of
HTML if the user on the target system was using an Internet browser, or
it could contain other types of data that exist in memory at the time
that the target system responds to the NetBT Name Service query."

It's not something you could directly own the box with, unlike RPC vuln
that Blaster uses; it merely exposes some trivia, thus the "low" rating.
