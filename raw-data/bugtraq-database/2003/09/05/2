Well, there will have to be SOME packets entering your network, they will just
be indistinguishable from regular traffic. If you wanted to detect a passive OS
fingerprinting, you might want to test derivations from ordinary patterns of
regular traffic, such as a user constantly requesting the same HTTP ressource or
constantly trying to send the same ICMP packets.

You won't be able to detect a pOf scan with some static ruleset, but from the
patternbreaking actions of a user trying to generate lots and lots of legitimate
traffic. This would likely become easier if pOf was used as part of some larger
toolset.
