Subject: ISS Server Sensor Denial of Service




EnterEdge has discovered a Denial of Service condition in ISS RealSecure 
Server Sensor 7.0. The condition is present when running ISS's RealSecure 
Server Sensor 7.0 on a Microsoft IIS server with SSL.  By passing invalid 
unicode characters via ssl, the server sensor will shut down the IIS 
service.  This was tested with IIS 5.0 using ISS server sensor 7.0 xpu 
20.16 and 20.18.  ISS was notified and has since released xpu 20.19 which 
resolves this DoS vulnerability.
