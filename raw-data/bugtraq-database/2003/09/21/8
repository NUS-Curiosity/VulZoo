I  think this is bogus (although I could be wrong) as I can't find any
mention of it on any reputable news site, including google.  If this is
a troll, then I fell victim to it =)

Greed Kills VeriSign Inc.
Thursday September 18, 6:40 pm ET 


KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -(Dow, Chemical & Jones)- Verisign Inc. (NasdaqNM:VRSN
- News) in a sudden move today filed for protection under Chapter 11
of the US Bankruptcy Code. CFO D. Ana L Evan was overheard stating that
Verisign is being besieged by a staggering US$20 billion combined
lawsuit
from as many as 100 infuriated internet companies.

When asked to comment, William P. Fuksic, Senior Vice President of
Corwhoreporate
Marketing Services, stated that it was all Stratton Scalevosiritis,
Chairman,
 President and CEO's fault for having been mentored under Microsoft's
Chairwomen Williametta Gates back in the early days of Microsoft's
growth.

"They are both gluttenous pigs" said Fuksic. "We are all greedy pigs,
 we really should have left a piece of the pie the others. For this I
am sorry"
