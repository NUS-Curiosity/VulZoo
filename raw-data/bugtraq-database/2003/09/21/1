Subject: <Advice> Possible Backdoor into openssh-3.7.1p1-i386-1.tgz from Slackware Mirror


Hi,

I have update my Slackware 9.0 with openssh-3.7.1p1-i386-1.tgz  from
http://www.slackware.at/data/slackware-9.0/patches/packages/openssh-3.7.1p1-i386-1.tgz

Now i have 3 new  tcp/ip ports into my system: (thank Nmap) :-)

- 867 Open
- 879 Open
- 889 Open

Example:

telnet> open
(to) 127.0.0.1 867
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.

These ports are choice random from a range of  300 - 1200 !! and the size of
the tgz is various for every mirror:

628642 Sep 20 17:58 openssh-3.7.1p1-i386-1.tgz (from www.slackware.at)
628481 Sep 20 21:01 openssh-3.7p1-i386-1.tgz   (from www.slackware.com)

All these examples make to think an possible backdoor into SSH (take from
mirror)

Excuse for my bad english.

Thank you !

Mark
