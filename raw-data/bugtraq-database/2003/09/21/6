I've verified the GPG signature for the package on ftp.slackware.at, and
it has not been tampered with.  The GPG signature of the
openssh-3.7.1p1.tar.gz has also been tested, and is signed with the
correct signature of the OpenSSH developer who signs such things.
Additionally, I've tested installing the package and found no unexpected
ports were opened.

Conclusion:  This report is false.

Note that these are completely different package versions.
