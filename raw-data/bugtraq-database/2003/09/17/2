- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It has been reported that under certain conditions a NFS client can
avoid read-only restrictions on filesystems exported via NFS from a
server running IRIX 6.5.21 and mount them in read/write mode.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2003-0680 to this vulnerability:
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0680

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures
be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.  This issue has been
corrected in future releases of IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.21f


The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.21f" in
this case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name
is the "version" we refer to throughout this document.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for this vulnerability.
SGI recommends either upgrading to IRIX 6.5.22 (when available),
or installing the appropriate patch for IRIX 6.5.21 from the listing below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.22, or install the appropriate
patch.
