Symantec's response to Issue #1: Symantec's Auto-Protect feature in Symantec 
AntiVirus for Handhelds 
scanner is designed to detect malicious code, in real time, as files are 
saved to a device. At this time the anticipated mechanism for transport to 
a Pocket PC is via the file system, which is scanned in real-time by 
Symantec AntiVirus for Handhelds: for malicious code to be loaded into 
memory, it would have to be downloaded/synchronized/saved to the device 
first, and it would first be detected by Auto-Protect in Symantec 
AntiVirus for Handhelds. 


Symantec's response to Issue #2: Symantec AntiVirus for Handhelds does have 
the ability to detect a byte 
stream anywhere in a file ? but the suggested scenario is altering the 
eicar string such that it no longer is an eicar string. Therefore Symantec 
AntiVirus for Handhelds does not recognize it, not because it can't match 
the string, but because the string itself has been modified. Additionally, 
the current eicar definition (as defined by eicar.org) concedes to 
efficiency and does not require detection at any point in any file.
