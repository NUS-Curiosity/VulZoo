Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0033

Package name:      openssh
Summary:           Buffer Management error
Date:              2003-09-17
Affected versions: TSL 1.2, 1.5, 2.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  OpenSSH is OpenBSD's rework of the last free version of SSH, bringing it
  up to date in terms of security and features, as well as removing all
  patented algorithms to seperate libraries (OpenSSL).


Problem description:
  Taken from the announcement of openssh 3.7.1:

    All versions of OpenSSH's sshd prior to 3.7.1 contain buffer management
    errors.  It is uncertain whether these errors are potentially exploitable,
    however, we prefer to see bugs fixed proactively.
    
    OpenSSH 3.7 fixed one of these bugs.

    OpenSSH 3.7.1 fixes more similar bugs.

  The TSL team has choosen to backport these fixes into the various versions
  of openssh packaged in TSL.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.
