I hate to muck with a DNS server to fix this problem.  And since
I prefer DJBDNS, a BIND patch wouldn't do me any good anyway.

Is it always returning the same IP address, or have any other
noticable characteristics?  If so I'd think we could set up
a firewall rule to drop all DNS replies that contain the
Verisign-be-damned IP address.  That'd protect everything,
regardless of name server or method of access (using
host/nslookup/etc manually.)
