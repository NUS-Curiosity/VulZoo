Subject: Whitepaper - Blindfolded SQL Injection


WebCohort Presents "Blindfolded SQL Injection" - a white paper
describing how SQL Injection can be performed without deatiled error
messages:

Description:
-----------
Until today, exploiting SQL Injection attacks depended on having the Web
Server return detailed error messages or having any other source of
information. As a result, many security administrators supressed these
error messages, assuming this would protect them from SQL Injection
exploitation. This white paper shows, however, that supressing the error
messages does not provide real protection. The research done at
WebCohort reveales a set of techniques that can be easily used by
attackers in order to bypass this obstacle, making it clear that more
substantial measures must be taken against SQL Injection attacks.
