Yo everyone!

_6Mo_hAcK posted a perl script that he said DoS'es Zonealarm. Well my W2K
SP3 + ZA Pro 3.0.081 wasn't affected by his code, but as I coded something 
very similar a while ago, I modifed few lines and ran it against my ZA. 
Indeed sending massive amounts of UDP packets to random destination ports 
severly lags my W2k+ZA, rendering it mostly useless.

Also, the same code affects Win98 (SE apparently not affected?. Tried
that in VMware:)) It completely freezes while packets are being sent at it. As
soon as the flood stops the machine resumes normal operation, without any
obvious remaining negative effects. Note this is NOT related to Zonealarm. 
This is an independant vuln in Win98. That machine didnt have any firewall 
installed. 

While I found that Win98 was affected by flooding it with udp packets, the 
Zonealarm vuln(which is why I originally wrote the code :) was found by 
someone else. 

See attached code for both vulnerabilities.
