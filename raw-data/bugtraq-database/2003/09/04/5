1. Topic:

Updated httpd packages that fix several minor security issues are now
available for Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
freely-available Web server.

Ben Laurie found a bug in the optional renegotiation code in mod_ssl
included with Apache 2 versions 2.0.35 through 2.0.46 that can cause
cipher suite restrictions to be ignored. This is triggered if optional
renegotiation is used (SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate) along with verification
of client certificates and a change to the cipher suite over the
renegotiation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0192 to this issue.

Yoshioka Tsuneo found that unpatched versions of Apache 2 versions 2.0.35
to 2.0.46 have a bug that can cause a remote Denial of Service. When a
client requests that proxy ftp connect to a ftp server with an IPv6
address, and the proxy is unable to create an IPv6 socket, an infinite loop
occurs.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
name CAN-2003-0254 to this issue.

Saheed Akhtar found that unpatched Apache 2 versions 2.0.35 through 2.0.46
have a bug in the prefork MPM when handling accept errors. In a server with
multiple listening sockets, a certain error returned by accept() on a
rarely-accessed port can cause a temporary denial of service.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2003-0253
to this issue.

It is possible for Apache 2 to get into an infinite loop handling internal
redirects and nested subrequests. A patch for this issue adds the new
LimitInternalRecursion directive.

All users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the
applicable errata packages, which contain back-ported fixes correcting
these issues, and are applied to Apache version 2.0.40.

After the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running
(as root) the following command:

/sbin/service httpd restart

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

85022 - Apache fails to start: Cannot create SSLMutex file
97111 - httpd insists on always calculating Content-Length from CGI output.
98545 - Handle errors when starting piped logged processes
98653 - Mod_rewite prg maps out of sync
98852 - CAN-2003-0192: mod_ssl renegotiation issue
98853 - CAN-2003-0253: remote denial of service against prefork MPM
98855 - CAN-2003-0254: remote denial of service by hostile DNS
