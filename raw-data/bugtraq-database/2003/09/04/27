Umer,

Running p0f does not necessarily offer a stimulus/response test.

Regarding detecting a machine with p0f installed/running, you may have
better success simply trying to detect for any network adapter in
promiscuous mode.  And there's tons of info available on that...

HTH,

Question concerning the the POF, how can we setup a IDS to detect a POF
scan.
