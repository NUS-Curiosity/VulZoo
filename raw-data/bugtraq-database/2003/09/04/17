cvsup (or cvs) to update to new operating system or ports/pkgsrc sources
is different because:

- you don't get the final product; the binaries are not built
  automatically nor installed.

- it is used to build from source; and the source code changes can
  be compared and reviewed by anyone.

p.s. If you are a pkgsrc user, be sure to install and use
security/audit-packages.

p.p.s. I help run a BSD security update service; I don't think any of our
customers automatically upgrade with security updates although it is
possible.
