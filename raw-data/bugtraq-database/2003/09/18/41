Can't tell about The Netherlands or any other european contry, but in
Germany this sort of EULA would have to be part of a contract directly
between Microsoft and the customer to beccome effective. A Vendor cannot
determine the contract between the current owner of the product (be it
wholeseller, retailer or customer) and a third party. German
jurisdiction calls this rule "Erschoepfungsgrundsatz".
