Subject: Web counter in the new Swen/Gibe.F worm


Hi,

Joe Stewart of Lurhq.com has made an interesting discovery about the new
Swen/Gibe.F worm that started circulating today:  When the worm infects
a new machine, it hits a Web counter.  

The URL of the counter is:

 
http://ww2.fce.vutbr.cz/bin/counter.gif/link=bacillus&width=6&set=cnt006

If this URL wraps in your email reader, here's a shorter version:

   http://tinyurl.com/nufo 

At 2:30 EST, the counter is about 615,000.

Here's a bit more about the worm:

The server log entries for this counter might prove interesting to virus
researchers.  These entries could provide data for a statistical study
of computer worm transmissions.  Perhaps the Vutbr.cz Web site would be
willing to go public with this information.
