	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	sendmail
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0681, CAN-2003-0694
Date:			Wed Sep 17 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-021-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Michal Zalewski discovered flaws in sendmail's prescan() function.
  prescan() is used sufficiently frequently in the sendmail sources that
  it is not clear where the overflowed buffers are located in memory,
  thus administrators should assume that StackGuard provides limited
  coverage at best. This flaw is CAN-2003-0694.

  Timo Sirainen has discovered CAN-2003-0681, "a potential buffer
  overflow in ruleset parsing which is not exploitable in the default
  sendmail configuration; only if non-standard rulesets recipient (2),
  final (4), or mailer-specific envelope recipients rulesets are used
  then a problem may occur."

  Immunix would like to thank Claus Assmann, Ademar de Souza Reis Jr,
  and Todd C. Miller.
