Subject: openssh 3.7.1 patched or not?



why does the tarball for openssh-3.7p1.tar.gz have channels.c as:

  RCSID("$OpenBSD: channels.c,v 1.194 2003/08/29 10:04:36 markus Exp $");

when the advisory http://www.openssh.com/txt/buffer.adv shows

   --- channels.c	29 Aug 2003 10:04:36 -0000	1.194
   +++ channels.c	16 Sep 2003 21:02:40 -0000	1.195

same problem with buffer.c:

   RCSID("$OpenBSD: buffer.c,v 1.17 2003/09/16 03:03:47 deraadt Exp $");
vs
   --- buffer.c	16 Sep 2003 03:03:47 -0000	1.17
   +++ buffer.c	16 Sep 2003 21:02:39 -0000	1.18

it's like 3.7.1 doesn't have all the changes in it?! If I'm right, and
others have missed this, there may be a lot of folks with a false sense of
security.
