Subject: Re: Re: Verisign abusing .COM/.NET monopoly, BIND
 releases new


I'm pretty sure that the record has not been pulled - junkdomains still
resolve to verisign if you use the 13 [a-m].gtld-servers.net root servers.
What has most likely happened is that many ISPs have now installed the
patched version of BIND which nullifies the effect of verisigns fun and
games.
