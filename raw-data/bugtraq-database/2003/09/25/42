Well SOBIG's mail relay is hardly well behaved.  I thought REJECT was more 
appropriate. SOBIG won't send bounces on REJECT, and that way other people
who get caught by this will get some diagnostic (since it is the sender relay 
that sends the bounce).

BTW I've put a copy of my received samples and analysis files at
