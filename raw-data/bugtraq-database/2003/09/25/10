Unfortunatly I found paper mail getting to me with an address that was 
only used by a Veri$ign company and the address in this format was not 
available through the WHOIS records. They sold my data without my consent.

That was the moment I decided to go to another register with my domain 
info. So I think ill intend is not just suspected but must be considered 
to be a real fact of life with Veri$ign

I for one have removed the Veri$ign root certificates and will inform
sites relying on them about the risk they take with Veri$ign and do advise 
others to take smilar actions so we hurt them through their wallet.
