That's not entirely correct. Since every host in non-existant domain now
resolves to 64.94.110.11 (DNS record type A), all email traffic with
misspelled recipient domain is actually forwarded to Verisign's
sitefinder, without the need for a specific MX record:

root@...doo:~# host jasfkjhaf.com
jasfkjhaf.com           A       64.94.110.11

E.g., try sending a test email to whatever@...-existant, you'll get
something like that:

<test@...fkjhaf.com>:
64.94.110.11 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 550 <unknown[X.X.X.X]>: Client host rejected: The
domain you are trying to send mail to does not exist.
Giving up on 64.94.110.11.
