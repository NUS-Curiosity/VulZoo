Wrong.  Mail transfer agents fall back to A records if no MX records
exist for a given entry.  That's why Snubby was running in the first
place - to keep mail from accumulating in everybody's queues for a week
where at first it would've been discarded immediately.

And rejected with an incorrect error message leading - again - to faulty
diagnostics.  The Internet Architecture Board has written a good
document about the operational impact of Verisign's move:

As said, that won't change much.  Someone proposed Verisign added "* IN
MX 0 ." as an additional wildcard but testing has shown that MTAs keep
mail spooled instead, so this won't work either.

How much worse can it get?  On second thoughts, don't give Verisign any
ideas...
