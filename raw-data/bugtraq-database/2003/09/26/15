Subject: SV: Ruh-Roh SOBIG.G?


Hi,

There is no new Sobig worm here. I just ran through samples received by
the original poster and I can confirm that these are all Sobig-F
samples. The worm is known to be polymorphic which by nature will change
the size and content of the code. Nothing new here.

Kind regards // Med venlig hilsen
