Stan,

Thanks for pointing that out, but the problems i
reported to Software602 LanSuite 2003 were
acknowledged as new, and i had to wait for
approximately a month for the patch.

Beside, the problems you reported applied in LanSuite
2002, and some of them do exist in version 2003 too
but to be honest, this is the first time i've seen
this vulnerability report regarding LanSuite software.
Most of the previous problems report about Software602
Lansuite were DoS attacks (Lansuite Proxy, and 'aux') 
I did a search on securiteam, securityfocus, and
google for any known issues that are similar like mine
regarding LanSuite, but haven't got any luck or i just
missed it?

Best regards,
Phuong Nguyen
