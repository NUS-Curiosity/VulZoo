I thought it had expired on 9/10, and it did stop coming for a while. I'm seeing it
again too; actually, I'm seeing two different attachment sizes in the new ones, one
around 70K and the other around 100K. 

Did someone reissue Sobig.F with a new expiration date?

Hi,

There is no new Sobig worm here. I just ran through samples received by the original
poster and I can confirm that these are all Sobig-F samples. The worm is known to be
polymorphic which by nature will change the size and content of the code. Nothing new
here.

Kind regards // Med venlig hilsen
