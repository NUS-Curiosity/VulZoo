A user-agent has to assume that it's message might be dropped if it
creates base64 with junk in it. So it should not create these things
and it's perfectly resaonable for a MTA/virus-scanner to drop those
messages.

Again, as the mail-client does not have a way to know how the generated
data is interpreted in those ambigous cases its reasonable to just
drop those messages.

Is there already a list of broken MUAs? Do the vendors even know
(yes, they should have cought that during testing... ;-) )

Either reject them or convert them to a canonical form. But that will
generate further problems, e.g. if you modify signed payload that way.
