I think it is. Traditionally, newer RFCs *extend* existing ones - they
do not break there formats. So properly engineered new functionality
will either a) live within the boundary of an existing protocol or b)
specifiy a new one. In the case of a) canonocalication will do no harm,
in the case of b) it will not be applied as this is a separate protocol.
