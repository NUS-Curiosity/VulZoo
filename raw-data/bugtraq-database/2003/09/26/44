Subject: Packetstorm started a try2crack of A.R.C.S. Algorithm




Try2Crack !

A.R.C.S., or the Angelo Rosiello and Roberto Carrrozzo Stream cipher, is a copyrighted algorithm that the authors have allowed http://packetstorm.org sole rights to host and distribute. The algorithm's theory utilizes Vernam's cipher, respecting Shannon's principles, and is based on MD5. The authors hope that someone will try to break this cipher and welcome all attempts and added research. Be forewarned, commercial use of this algorithm is forbidden without the Authors' consent.

The homepage for A.R.C.S. is www.rosiello.org.

If you successfully crack the file that was encrypted with A.R.C.S. on http://packetstorm.org, Packet Storm will send you a free t-shirt with the classic shellcode on the front of it. Supplies are limited, but we are not extremely worried. Thanks to all that help further the research and development of strong crypto.
