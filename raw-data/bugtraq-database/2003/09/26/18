Be careful, our advisory talks about the OpenPKG _package_ option
"with_pam", not the GNU autoconf option "--with-pam" of the contained
OpenSSH vendor source. OpenPKG source RPM packages provide "with_xxx"
options which can be set to "yes" or "no" on the command line during
package build ("rpm --rebuild --define 'with_pam yes' openssh*.src.rpm")
in order to build variants of binary RPMs.

If you look at http://cvs.openpkg.org/openpkg-src/openssh/openssh.spec,
you see that in the OpenSSH case the OpenPKG option "with_pam yes" is
mapped onto --with-pam on the GNU autoconf command line later.
