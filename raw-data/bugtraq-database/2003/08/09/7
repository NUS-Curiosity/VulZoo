>                    Cisco CSS 11000 Series Denial of service
>
> Description of vulnerability
> ----------------------------
>
> A heavy storm of TCP SYN packets directed to the circuit address of the 
> CSS 
> can cause DoS on it, high cpu load or even sudden reboots.
>
> The issue is known by cisco as the ONDM Ping failure (CSCdz00787). On the 
> CS800 chassis the
> system controller module (SCM) sends ONDM (online diagnostics monitor) 
> pings to each SFP card
> in order to see if they are alive, if the SCM doesn't get a response in 
> about 30 seconds the
> SCM will reboot the CS800 and there will be no core.
>
> By attacking the circuit IP address of the CSS with SYN packets the 
> traffic is sent up to the SCM
> over the internal MADLAN ethernet interface. If this internal interface 
> becomes overloaded
> the ONDM ping request and response traffic can be dropped leading this to 
> an internal DoS
> since no internal comunications are available.
>
> Any attacker could do this externally with a few sessions of NMAP and a 
> cable/ADSL internet
> connection.
>
> Affected Versions and platforms
> -------------------------------
>
> This vulnerability affects the models 11800, 11150 and 11050 with chassis 
> CS800.
>
> Solution
> --------
>
> Upgrade to software release WebNS 5.00.110s or above.
> http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/contnetw/ps789/prod_release_note0918
> 6a008014ee04.html
>
> AcL's to protect the circuit address are recomended.
