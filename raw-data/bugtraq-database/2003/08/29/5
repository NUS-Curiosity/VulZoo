I dispute your claims and put it down to you dealing with things at
a very small level with people who don't usually get much email.

For over a week, I've been getting sobig email at a rate greater
than 1 per minute to just myself at this address.

That's over 1440 per day or close to 10,000 per week.  How many do
your customers get?

A small fraction of it is from anti-virus products.  I don't reply to
any of it and nobody gets it from me.  As soon as I've marked a couple
of hundred for deletion, more have already arrived.

Darren
p.s. If you doubt the numbers I'll happily save a sample and you can
check the volume/time stamps yourself.
