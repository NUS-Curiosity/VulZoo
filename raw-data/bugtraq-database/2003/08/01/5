RAV Online Scanning ActiveX Buffer Overflow in RAVUPDT.DLL
=================================================

PROGRAM: RAV ONLINE SCANNING ACTIVEX
HOMEPAGE:  www.ravantivirus.com
VULNERABLE VERSIONS: Online Version Only


DESCRIPTION
=================================================

RAV Online Scanning is a free antivirus scanner for internet users. It is
run on the user's browsers as an ActiveX.

DETAILS
=================================================

The ActiveX uses a file called RAVUDPT.DLL to handle networking functions.
In the main ActiveX file (RAVONLINE.DLL) there is a function named
update(serveraddr as string) with serveraddr is the ftp or http address of the
database to update. However if update() is passed with a 
long string, then when the long string is parsed into RAVUDPT.DLL, it will
cause a buffer overflow.


WORKAROUND
=================================================

Delete the old ActiveX(rav*.dll) in the "Downloaded Program Files" in
your Windows Directory. Vendor already got noticed but no response yet.
