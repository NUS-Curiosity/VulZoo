Subject: [Advisory] IISShield V1.0.2


Hi all, 

A problem related to the denial of an Http Request in a specific byte check was encountered. The issue fixed is related to a very special situation which does not interfere with the scanning and inspection features of IISShield.

Users are advised to download the latest version (v1.0.2)  at http://www.kodeit.org/tools/iisshield.zip <http://65.54.244.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=d7e1dacdd463756a2be2db296c081f90&lat=1059696745&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2ekodeit%2eorg%2ftools%2fiisshield%2ezip> 

Changelog available at http://www.kodeit.org/tools/iisshield_log.htm <http://65.54.244.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=ee21560a6ebc04d8a7c8bf669154b4c9&lat=1059696745&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2ekodeit%2eorg%2ftools%2fiisshield_log%2ehtm>
