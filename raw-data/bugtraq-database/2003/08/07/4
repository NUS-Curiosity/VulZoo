	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	wu-ftpd
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0466
Date:			Wed Aug  6 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-019-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Janusz Niewiadomski has discovered an off-by-one vulnerability in
  wu-ftpd's fb_realpath function; this function is called with arguments
  occasionally on the stack and occasionally statically allocated.
  Therefore, StackGuard's protection should not be relied upon to
  prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, though it may mitigate a
  specific exploit, should one appear.

  It is beleived this flaw is remotely exploitable. It is not known at
  this time if the Immunix GLibC system library is vulnerable to a
  similar flaw.

  Immunix would like to thank Janusz for working with vendors to solve
  this issue in a timely manner.
