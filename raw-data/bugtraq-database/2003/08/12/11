Allowing the option for corporates and/or isp's to dns poison that
to resolve to 127.0.0.1, or even dns race with tools like team teso's
if one doesn't use internal/cacheing NS.

Might save some traffic on 15 August. Alternative, route all traffic
to the resolved IP addresses to /dev/null, but with the above, the
traffic shouldn't even leave the machine in question.
