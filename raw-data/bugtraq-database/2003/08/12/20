Subject: 3 Comprehensive links in combat with MSBlaster Worm


More DCOM Fun,
The boards and lists are flooded with data on this little bugger. Almost too
much data, and vital stuff gets lost in the myriad email chains and re:
threads. I summed up these 3 links for easy access. Hope it helps.

DCOM ISS Scanner:
http://www.iss.net/support/product_utilities/ms03-026rpc.php
Microsoft Patches:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-026.asp
DCOM Cleaner for Infected Boxen:
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.blaster.worm.removal.tool.html

And remember... PATCH and block the ports 135 - 139 -445 - 593
