Could be a nice feature of a worm to modify the "hosts" file and
prevent infected maschines to do DNS lookups.

Users typing "www.microsoft.com" into their browsers could be tricked
into downloading stuff from hostile servers and the "windows update"
could be disabeled easily.

This probably istn't a new concept, eh?
