Please see the news release of the AN.ON project:
http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/material/themen/presse/anonip_e.htm

"... Since it is not permissive to release information about current

been released in the source code since the beginning of the Open Source
Project, also the implemented recording function was of course released.
