Subject: Re: msblast.d and a review of defensive worms



I think this article (posted on the Nanog list) should be the final
nail in the coffin on "defensive worms".

http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2003/0819navy.html

Reportedly 3/4s of the Navy Marines Corps Internet was unusable
because of the "beneficial" Welchia (patching RPC) worm.  Network
operations is at least partially outsourced to EDS, but the article
doesn't state who is responsible for administering the machines.
