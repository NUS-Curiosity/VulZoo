Subject: [SNS Advisory No.68] Internet Explorer Object Type Buffer Overflow in Double-Byte Character Set Environment


----------------------------------------------------------------------
SNS Advisory No.68
Internet Explorer Object Type Buffer Overflow in Double-Byte Character Set Environment 

Problem first discovered on: Fri, 06 June 2003 
Published on: Thu, 21 Aug 2003
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
---------
  Microsoft Internet Explorer is vulnerable to a buffer overflow under 
  the double-byte character set environment.


Problem Description:
--------------------
  A buffer overflow occurs in Microsoft Internet Explorer when HTML 
  files with an unusually long string including double-byte character 
  sets in the Type property of the Object tag are processed. 

  In order to trigger this vulnerability, malicious website administrators
  could induce Internet Explorer users to view a specially crafted web 
  site and consequently execute arbitrary code with the users' privileges.

  This problem differs from the issue described in MS03-020 in that it
  affects only specific language versions, including Japanese.  
  Arbitrary codes could be successfully executed on Internet Explorer 
  6 SP1 Japanese in a testing environment. 


Tested Version:
---------------
  Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 Japanese Edition


Solution:
---------
  Apply an appropriate patch available at:

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-032:
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-032.asp
