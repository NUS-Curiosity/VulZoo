Actually, this bug is (probably) also non-exploitable when wu-ftpd is 
compiled using the gcc 3.x, which aligns stack variables in a different way:

(gdb) b fb_realpath
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8063c72: file realpath.c, line 103.
(gdb) cont
Continuing.
(gdb) x/bx &resolved[4096]
0xbfffc770:     0x00
(gdb) awatch *0xbfffc770
Hardware access (read/write) watchpoint 2: *3221210992
(gdb) cont
Continuing.
Hardware access (read/write) watchpoint 2: *3221210992

Value = 0
0x400d81d9 in strcat () from /lib/libc.so.6

In my example (wu-ftpd 2.6.2 compiled on Debian with gcc 3.3.1), the 
address of NULL-overflowed byte is 0xbfffc770 and the saved %ebp is located 
at 0xbfffc788:

(gdb) info frame 2
Stack frame at 0xbfffc788:
  eip = 0x8063ae4 in wu_realpath (realpath.c:60); saved eip 0x8053b35
  called by frame at 0xbfffe7d8, caller of frame at 0xbfffb748
  source language c.
  Arglist at 0xbfffc788, args: path=0x808cef0 'A' <repeats 200 times>...,
     resolved_path=0xbfffc7a0 "\001\001", chroot_path=0x8082e60 ""
  Locals at 0xbfffc788, Previous frame's sp in esp
  Saved registers:
   ebx at 0xbfffc784, ebp at 0xbfffc788, eip at 0xbfffc78c

I have tested the generic RedHat 8.0 (which provides wu-ftpd-2.6.2-5 
compiled with gcc 3.x) and the behaviour was exactly the same.

Wu-ftpd suppiled with Debian Woody also seems to be non-exploitable -- it's 
  compiled on kernel 2.2 with PATH_MAX 4095.
