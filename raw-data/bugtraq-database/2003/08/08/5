Subject: Directory Traversal in Sun iPlanet Administration Server 5.1


Text of original posting to Sun:

>>Originator: EDS Information Assurance Group - Jim Hardisty, Mark Brewis

>>Date of Contact: 22nd April 2003

>>Issue:During a recent Penetration Test, a member of the team, Jim
Hardisty, identified an issue with an installation of >>iPlanet
Administration Express.  It is possible to escape the log viewer under
iPlanet Administration Express, and 
>>since the application runs with root privilege, it is possible to access
any file on the host server, including 
>>security critical files.

>>Version:         iPlanet Administration Server 5.1

>>The following URL will return the last 5000 accesses to passwd:

>>http://192.168.192.168:5000/admin-serv/tasks/configuration/ViewLog?file=pa
sswd&num=5000
&str=&directories=admin-serv%2Flogs%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc&id=a
dmin-serv

>>Once an escape has been made, the drop-down menu details all files under
the called directory, e.g., /etc will lists 
>>shadow, hosts, hosts.allow, hosts.deny etc.

>>We have identified users:

>>        1) Failing to recognise the nature of the application, seeing it
only as a web configuration app, and not 
>>		 appreciating that it runs setuid 0.  As a result, they have
been cavalier with password security, applying >>		 poor
password controls, and have not applied ACLs to prevent unlimited internal
access to the application.
       
>>        2) Failing to apply a password to the application.  During
install, there must be a forced set password, and 
>>		 end-user must understand that this is a root level password
they are setting.

>>        3) Exposing the application to the Internet.

>>Whether there are other escape sequences that will work is unknown.
