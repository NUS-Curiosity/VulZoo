Affected Systems: 1.0

Issue: Remote attackers can know the path of the site

Author: G00db0y@...e-h.org

Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in C-Cart Shopping Cart
v1.0. C-Cart is "a powerful yet simple shopping cart written in PHP 
with a MySQL database to store the product details".



Details

It's possible to make a malformed http request for many files in
C-Cart Shopping Cart and in doing so trigger an error. 
The resulting error message will disclose potentially sensitive 
installation 
path information to the remote attacker.

Example:

http://www.site.com/shop/search.php?q='
http://www.site.com/shop/show.php?q='



Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch is not yet produced.


Suggestions:

Filter all files.
