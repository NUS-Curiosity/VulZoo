Subject: Generic security problems in online games and applications

Hi all,

we like to announce the attached paper about some generic security 
problems
in online games and applications. It does not contain in deep technical
specification about all the possibility and the usage, because we don't
want that a mass abuse of online contests and games take place. Maybe we
will release an example with a small tutorial later.

Greetings

Steffen Kewitz, Martin J. Muench, Max Moser
