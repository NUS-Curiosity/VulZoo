This is not a regulatory issue.  This is a business issue.  Current software
from third-party(Non-OS vendor) sources is in the exact same position.  It
is the end-user's responsibility to regression test in a lab simulating the
ACTUAL live operating environment, including other 3rd party software.  If I
am dealing with a vendor that is consistently incompatible with a properly
secured buildout, I can vote with my dollars and look elsewhere.  However,
it is often more cost-effective to mitigate the vulnerabilities in other
ways, than to change out systems.

No, why should they?  That would be trying to fit every possible use-case
scenario into an single, "can't possibly be secured" box.  That is very far
from the reality.  Security is not a thing. It is a complex process.  If I
can acheive an acceptable level of risk by utilizing a given method of
connecting my systems, why shouldn't I do it?  The key is making an informed
decision, not a frightened one.

N-Tier architecture comes to mind.  Not to mention proxied services and
connectors.  And, that is assuming that these are necessary in every case,
which they would not be.

Of course.  The security and stability of my systems is my responsibility.
If I feel that I must remediate a system that is proprietary, then I take
that up with the vendor.  Just like with my Nokia/Checkpoint firewall and
Cisco routers.  This model is already in play.

Legally, according to the EULA that the user accepts, the end user is
responsible.  The same as with Microsoft, Cisco, Sun, and every other vendor
in the US.  The final responsibility for security is mine. So, why should I
try to shift the liability?  If I have issues with the product, I'll buy
someone else's.

How many SCADA systems handle PHI?  That aside, security is still the
responsibility of the Site Admin.

Sounds like the old Microsoft line Circa Pre-2000.

If necessary, Yes.

You mean like Office 2000 and MSDE integration?  That is marketing.  If
someon lets marketing hype guide their technical decisions, then their
issues are much larger than SCADA insecurity.

That was a failure in policy and enforcement.  Just like most security
breaches,  It didn't require anything more than that to occur.  The fact
that a SCADA system was impacted underscores the need for an improved policy
and enforcement regimen.  After all, if they let some one plant a pound of
C-4 on the PLC and detonate it, would that justify requiring the vendor to
make the system bomb-proof?  Of course not.

Vendors being held responsible for system security and integrity....  Sure
would make my life easier <grin>
