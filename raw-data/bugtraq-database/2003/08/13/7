 This program is a tool to remove the malicious worm
 that spreads through exploiting the DCOM RPC vulnerability using TCP port 135. 
 This worm attempts to download the msblast.exe file to the %WinDir%\system32 directory and execute it.
 Once executed it creates a hidden Cmd.exe remote shell that will listen on TCP port 4444, 
 allowing an attacker to issue remote commands on the infected system.
 This tool was made to Automate the process of removing the worm from memory and all files related to it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Directions:
 1. Execute the file called DCOMKill.exe
    This will automatically kill the worms process 
    running in memory and remove the registry startup method
    and then it will erase any files left by the worm.
 
 2. All done  :) ... next step 
    W32.Blaster.Worm exploits the DCOM RPC vulnerability. This is described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-026, 
    and a patch is available there. You must download and install the patch.Also buy an antivirus and keep it 
    updated weekly . Also I'd suggest getting a firewall to protect from any outside intruders.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tech Info:
Startup registry key-
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
  "windows auto update"="msblast.exe"
Dropped files-
 Windows system directory (c:\windows\system32 c:\winnt\system32)
                 msblast.exe
Note:
if you are running Windows XP, it is recommended that you temporarily turn off System Restore. Windows XP uses this feature, 
which is enabled by default, to restore the files on your computer in case they become damaged. If a virus, worm, or Trojan 
infects a computer, System Restore may back up the virus, worm, or Trojan on the computer.
