D'oh!

Did you not read the whole advisory?

We know you like Dameware from earlier messages of yours, so I'll try 
to make this really easy for you...

Here's a hint -- I've snipped away everything from the original 
advisory other than the part even you should be able to understand:

Now, do you think that Dameware folk would "fix" a "feature"?

Did you even think?

Please stop littering our mailboxes with your ill-considered 
dribblings.  Please...
