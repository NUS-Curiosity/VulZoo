Correct about messing with the hosts file -- has been used by various 
adware, spyware and browser hijackers for various purposes and 
occasionally by other malware to, for example, block access to AV 
and/or other security sites (pointing www.<company>.com to 127.0.0.1 
for example).  Offhand I don't recall it being used specifically to 
target Windows Update or other MS sites with the intention of causing 
the user to unwittingly d/l something malicious (in general, if a piece 
of malware has this level of access to the victim's machine it probably 
can do much, if not all, it needs without engaging in network address 
subterfuges...).
