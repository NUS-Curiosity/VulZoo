Subject: Best Buy Employee Toolkit Vulnerability




Title: URL Parsing and Plain Text Password disclosure in Best Buy Employee 
Toolkit Software
Provided by: cm`

----------------
  Best Buy Employee Toolkit Interactive is a software program used 
nationally by Best Buy Terminal Systems. The software allows employees the 
ability to check multiple systems throughout the internal network. A URL 
Parsing vulnerability in the configuration screen could allow an attacker 
to execute a command shell interface and hijack certain network 
connections or read plain-text passwords.

-----------------
Impact: High
-----------------

Analysis:
 -URL Parsing
   By pressing CTRL+SHIFT within the Employee Toolkit software and 
clicking on the exit button, a logged in user is given access to the 
Toolkit's configuration screen. An area within the configuration screen 
allows a logged in user to enter a URL. There are no bounds checking on 
what is entered in the URL area and an attacker could use this to execute 
a local command shell or execute other programs locally stored.

 -Plain-text Password Disclosure
   Once an attacker has executed a local command shell, they then have 
access to the root directory which houses a batch file that remotely 
mounts the Store's central server. The batch file uses the 'net use' 
command to map the server's drive and holds the password for the 
administrator of the central server in plain text.

  By combining the trickery of both the URL Parsing vulnerability and the 
plain-text password disclosure an attacker could execute telnet to 
remotely log into the central server as the administrator.
  Finding the servers on the local area network is as easy as executing 
the 'net view' command at command shell. Another method for finding these 
servers is to open a page within the employee toolkit and pressing CTRL+P 
to bring up the printing interface. Choose to print the text to a file 
then click the network button. This will bring up all of the computers 
connected to the Best Buy network.
