Yes, indeed. But if you install PaX and all the other nice and really
usefull things out there I think you can sleep pretty well. I mean
all the bypassing for the really hard stuff (PaX, gr, SELinux)
is really theoretical from what I have seen. I really want to see
that guy (or girl? :) that exploits a GR'ed box remotely where the
target box runs single-service and well audited code. You do not
have to fear that person that gets into it, and you will probably never know
(s)he was there, so who cares?
Not speaking about user-shells, trojans on client-systems and social engenering
here.
