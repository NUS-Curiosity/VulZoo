Subject: CNN: 'Explores Possibility that Power Outage is Related to Internet Worm'


Just flipped on CNN, watching the masses snake through the streets of
Manhattan as correspondents state that this could be an affect of the
blaster worm.

Interesting but I don't see how an worm of this magnitude (smaller than that
of Slammer/Sapphire and others) could influence DCS and SCADA systems around
the US, particularly just in the North East.

Thoughts?
