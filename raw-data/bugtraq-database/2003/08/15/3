Subject: Re: Re: Buffer overflow prevention


Hrmm why does this bring HP to mind... oh yeah I remember...

HP-> "... oh you say you found a bunch of overflows... that does not 
matter... there is no way you will bypass our non-executable stack.. we 
are not going to fix any of them... we are gonna let em fester... our 
non-exec stack is Hack proof"

(time elapse... 2 months)

SNO-> "...oh yeah we bypassed your non-exec stack and have successfully 
exploited several of those overflows we told you about a few months ago...
bash-2.05a$ id
uid=201(dotslash) gid=15(users) groups=0(system)
bash-2.05a$ ./TRU64_su
# id
uid=0(root) gid=15(users) groups=15(users),0(system)
# sysconfig -q proc executable_stack
proc:
executable_stack = 0
(hrmm your stack REALLY helped out)

HP-> "ok thanks we will procede to sue you now"
