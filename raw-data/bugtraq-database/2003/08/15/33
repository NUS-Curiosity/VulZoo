You are doing system call monitoring based on a program model, and
killing programs which deviate, assuming I read the documentation
correctly...

A:  You have false positives unless you generate this database through
program analysis or some other technique.  "Security" procedures which
make systems less reliable are only rarely acceptable.



B: This has been done, based on program analysis, traces, and a whole
host of other techniques.  Probably the best example based on program
analysis is

"Intrusion Detection via Static Analysis"
David Wagner and Drew Dean:

This is probably the nicest imply because their model does NOT have
false positives, only false negatives.



C:  How to waltz through this "100%" protection:
"Mimicry Attaks on Host-Based Intrusion Detection"
