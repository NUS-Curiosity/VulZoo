Solaris 2.6 and above also support a kernel variable which can be set 
via /etc/system called "noexec_user_stack", which can make the stack for 
userland processes non-executable by default.  Note that this behavior 
is the default for 64-bit binaries in Solaris 7, 8, and 9, and this 
kernel variable forces the behavior for 32-bit binaries.  I run all 
sorts of odd software and have never had an issue with having this 
always turned on for all of my systems.
