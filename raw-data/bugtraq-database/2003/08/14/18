That is not actually in the standard GCC; it is in a forked GCC that 
OpenBSD chooses to ship.

We (Immunix) are in the process of trying to make StackGuard (the 
original) meet all of the criteria required for acceptance into GCC. At 
the GCC Summit <http://www.gccsummit.org/2003/> in May, we presented a 
StackGuard talk 
<http://www.gccsummit.org/2003/view_abstract.php?talk=31> on that topic.
