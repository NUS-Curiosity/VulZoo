  "Real security" is not the word.
  
  PaX / Propolice / W^X / non-exec stacks don't solve bugs. What they do is
to _abort_ execution of a process when it behaves abnormally.

  So instead of giving attackers the opportunity to run arbitrary code, you
only give them the ability to cause a denial of service.

  This kind of protection should be coupled with tools that automatically
restart daemons when they crash (ex: daemontools and monit) to actually keep
the service running when under attack. Still, all of this is a couple of
unreliable band-aids.
