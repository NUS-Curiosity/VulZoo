For them, the people that know the changes they made, they can still trust the 
system as much as they ever have. I have no doubt that for them it is as 
secure as ever and I think that helps explain why they cling to this claim. 
You and I, however, don't have that advantage and therefore can't trust it.

To the extent that you ever trusted this statement, it is still as true as it 
ever was. What has changed is more likely your realization that the system 
relies on resources necessarialy beyond your control and inspection. If their 
statement isn't true now, it wasn't true then.

I wouldn't be so suprised at such a ruling, although I'd really like to hear 
from someone with familiarity with German law.

If this is their proverbial cry for attention, then I kind of like the 
strategy. Consider that with explicit external notification of any sort 
(anonymous remailer, etc...), they are the ones taking action to subvert the 
system intentionally. Assuming that the opponent in this situation is a 
governmental entity with local physical enforcement power, then there's not a 
lot of situations in which they can imagine being verifiably unobserved in 
making any kind of public statement. Putting this in a CVS commit, however, 
allows them to claim that they were just trying to comply (wink wink) and 
doesn't run larger risks since there's nothing out of the ordinary to deny.

This doesn't mean I trust them, but it is probably one of the better ways for 
them to subvert the order IMO.

Regards.
