Likewise, the worm research has been focusing on how to automatically
detect, analyze, and respond to a new worm or similar threat.  For
some classes (eg, Scanning worms like Slammer, blaster, code red,
etc), this appears quite doable.

So the likely viable worm defenses ideally should deal with 0 day
worms, which means stopping a new vulnerability contained in a new
worm.
