Subject: Re: SCADA providers say security not our problem


Right on target Michael, and exactly the point most of us in 
this and related threads have pivoted from. The Blackout was the 
result of poor or nonexistent system security engineering, 
implementation, and auditing. 

We may be able to accept that the initial trigger incident that 
caused the Blackout may have very well been a broken 
transmission line and the subsequent loss of a generation plant. 
However, such an incident should have been autonomously 
identified and protection measures taken to instantaneously and 
autonomously compensate by either shutting down supply to local 
sub-stations or cities "loads", and/or shifting the load toward 
other generation power sources. Consequently, it appears that 
the trigger incident, as well as the status of operating 
parameters went unnoticed, and/or the safeguard failed to 
respond to abate the surge from cascading. 

One could only deduce that certain monitoring systems and 
devices within the Power Utilities / Sub Stations / Grids 
protection system topology were either offline (why? Blaster, 
Slammer, etc?), compromised by Blaster, Slammer, etc, or 
otherwise operationally infective in safeguarding the 
infrastructure do to the poorly throughout design and 
implementation of the security topology. 

I believe that like the HIPAA Security rules, regulations should 
be established to set Security standards which the Power 
Utilities, as well as and Gas, Water should be held to comply 
with. This is critical infrastructure not. Of course, such 
standards and regulations should include all covered-entities, 
(just like HIPAA), meaning software and hardware vendors.  It 
time to produce secure software and hardware, and yes get paid 
for it.

I can recall back in the late 70s designing the kernel for a 
microprocessor controlled baby incubator. (I think it was 8080A 
based) One of the TOP design requirements of the safeguard 
subsystem was to prevent any potential failure from accidentally 
frying its occupants. This requirement became not only a 
critical design objective but also a condition of testing and an 
element of final QC. 

We designed and wrote our programs, in assembly, with this 
requirement, as well as others less critical to the maintenance 
of the health and safety of the baby, as a test condition for 
every functional operation. If the software's function, process, 
or resulting action failed, or system component failed, to 
satisfy this safety condition, then it was back to redesign. 
Ultimately, the security (e.g. analysis of and response to: 
Threats, Vulnerabilities, Unexpected, Unauthorized or Illegal 
Actions) of this critical care system was paramount, and all 
engineers, programmers, technicians, assemblers, QC, as well as 
executives were held accountable. 

The same system security engineering practice should be applied 
to the design and implementation of our Nations / Worlds 
critical infrastructure, requiring 100% compliance or no go. 

Yes, such a pragmatic system security approach will cost more 
money. Hell, with such design constraints I wouldn't lift a 
finger to design a circuit or program one line of code unless I 
was well paid. Nonetheless, it must be done. 
Needless to say, I would not be the least surprised if the 
Utilities involved soon offer up a fall guy/gal to take the heat 
and spotlight off of them, as they do not want the public to 
know of the security inadequacies, or more regulations 
controlling there cash flow.
