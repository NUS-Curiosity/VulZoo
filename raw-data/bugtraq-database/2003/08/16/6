Subject:		UnixWare 7.1.2 Open UNIX 8.0.0 UnixWare 7.1.1 UnixWare 7.1.2 : exploitable buffer overrun in metamail
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-SCO.15
Issue date: 		2003 August 15

1. Problem Description

	Metamail is a package that implements MIME. Using a
	configurable "mailcap" file, metamail determines how to
	treat blocks of electronic mail text based on the content
	as described by email headers. Some popular packages for
	handling electronic mail have hooks that allow metamail to
	be called automatically while a message is being processed.

	Many buffer overflow conditions exist in version <= 2.7.
	The lack of boundary checks could lead to execution an
	arbitrary commands if the receiver processes the messages
	using the metamail package.

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has 
	assigned the name CVE-1999-1263, CVE-1999-0365, and CVE-1999-0037 
	to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list 
	(http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for security problems.
