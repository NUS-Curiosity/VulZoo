The text at the URL translates to

The court of Frankfurt/Main has ordered yesterday (Az: 5/6 Qs
47/03) that the court order against the partners of the
AN.ON-project (this includes the privacy commisioner of
Schleswig-Holstein) requested by the Bundeskriminalamt (the
german FBI) has been suspended. Under that court order the AN.ON
project by ULD Schleswig-Holstein and TU Dresden had been
ordered to implement logging of all accesses to a particular IP
address.

The project partners have disabled the protocol functions in JAP
as soon as they got notice of this decision. At this point in
time only a single data record had been logged. How this single
data record will be used will be decided only after the final
decision of Landgericht Frankfurt. The record is currently held
by the AN.ON project.

The project partners will be releasing a complete documentation
of all proceedings after the Landgericht has made its decision
(they are legally barred from doing so before that point in
time).
