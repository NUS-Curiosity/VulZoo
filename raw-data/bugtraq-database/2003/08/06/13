Hello Daymon and All,

I have CC'd in the Oracle Security Team....

I know Oracle 9 is vulnerable and can be exploited without a user ID or
password. I demonstrated an exploit for this problem at the European
Blackhat Security Briefings. I know a number of the Oracle security guys
have actually read the associated paper and are (or at least should be)
_FULLY_ aware that this vulnerability _CAN_ be exploited without
credentials. Oracle: let me know if you need more proof of this and I can
send you the exploit.

As this new bug was introduced in the patch for the problem I reported
here - http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/oraplsextproc.txt - and Oracle
will not give out patches to those who are not customers, I've never had the
opportunity to test this on 8.

At an educated guess, however, I believe 8 will be the same as 9.

The analyst should do more analysis then. It is really very simple.

I believe the Oracle security guys know this can be done without credentials
and if this is the case then it seems that one hand is not speaking to the
other. If however, the Oracle security guys believe this is not exploitable
without a userID and password then let me know. I'm more than happy to
supply Oracle with the exploit.

Can we get this resolved, once and for all, please.

Thank you,
David Litchfield
