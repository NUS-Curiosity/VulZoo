                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
________________________________________________________________________

Package name:           unzip
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:073-1
Date:                   August 19th, 2003
Original Advisory Date: July 7th, 2003
Affected versions:	8.2, 9.0, 9.1, Corporate Server 2.1,
			Multi Network Firewall 8.2
________________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 A vulnerability was discovered in unzip 5.50 and earlier that allows
 attackers to overwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction by
 placing non-printable characters between two "." characters.  These
 invalid characters are filtered which results in a ".." sequence.
 
 The patch applied to these packages prevents unzip from writing to
 parent directories unless the "-:" command line option is used.			
  
Update:

 Ben Laurie found that the original patch used to fix this issue missed
 a case where the path component included a quoted slash.  An updated
 patch was used to build these packages.
