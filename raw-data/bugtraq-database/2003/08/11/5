all what you have to do
is adding these lines in the begining of admin.php
======admin.php======
<?php

if (strstr($adsess,"'") != NULL){
  echo "Silent Needle: i don't like you.<br>dont try to hack. :) [be a 
white hat don't be a black hat]<br><a href='index.php'>index.php</a>"; 
  exit;
}
if (strstr($adsess,"\"") != NULL){
  echo "Silent Needle: i don't like you.<br>dont try to hack. :) [be a 
white hat don't be a black hat]<br><a href='index.php'>index.php</a>";
