ZH2003-22SA (security advisory): Zorum XSS Vulnerability and Path 
Disclosure


Published: 11 august 2003

Released: 11 august 2003

Name: Zorum

Affected Systems: v.3.4

Issue: Remote attackers can inject XSS script and know the path of the 
site. 

Author: G00db0y@...e-h.org

Vendor: http://zorum.phpoutsourcing.com/

Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in Zorum v3.4 (and older 
versions?).
"Zorum is a message board software, which may be used with equal success 
on both
intra- and internet sites."



Details

*******
 
It's possibile to inject XSS script in the method variable. 

Example: 

http://www.site.com/pathofzorum/index.php?method=&lt;script&gt;alert('test')
&lt;/script&gt;

It's possible to make a malformed http request for many variables in
Zorum and in doing so trigger an error. The resulting error message will 
disclose 
potentially sensitive installation path information to the remote 
attacker. 

Example:

http://www.site.com/pathofzorum/index.php?
method=userfunctions&'list=secmenu&



Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch is not yet produced.


Suggestions:

************

Filter the method variable (xss problem), filter all variables.
