ZH2003-19SA (security advisory): BBPro Store Builder Path Disclosure


Published: 10 august 2003

Released: 10 august 2003

Name: BBPro Store Builder

Affected Systems: current version

Issue: Remote attackers can know the path of the site

Author: G00db0y@...e-h.org

Vendor: http://www.imediasoftware.com/products/storebuilder/

Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in BBPro Store Builder (and 
older
versions?). "BBPro Store Builder handles creating and managing your online 
store."



Details

*******
 
It's possible to make a malformed http request in BBPro Store Builder and 
in doing so 
trigger an error. The resulting error message will disclose potentially 
sensitive 
installation path information to the remote attacker.

Example:

http://www.site.com/pathofstorebuilder/index.php?cat='


If we do a simple http request in many files in BBPro Store Builder we 
will have the
same problem.

http://www.site.com/pathofstorebuilder/shared/_settings.php



Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch is not yet produced.


Suggestions:

************

Filter all files.
