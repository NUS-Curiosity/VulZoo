ZH2003-20SA (security advisory): Stellar Docs Path Disclosure and Security 
Leak

Published: 10 august 2003

Released: 10 august 2003

Name: Stellar Docs

Affected Systems: v1.2

Issue: Remote attackers can know the path of the site and access the 
administrative section

Author: G00db0y@...e-h.org

Vendor: http://www.imediasoftware.com/products/stellardocs/index.php

Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a flaw in Stellar Docs v1.2 (and older
versions?). Stellar Docs is an "incredibly easy to use online 
documentation manager"


Details

*******
 
It's possible to make a malformed http request in Stellar Docs and in 
doing so 
trigger an error. The resulting error message will disclose potentially 
sensitive 
installation path information to the remote attacker.

Example:

http://www.site.com/pathofstellardocs/data/fetch.php?page='


By doing this request we will receive this kind of error: 

Warning: mysql_num_rows(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result 
resource
 in /home/www/pathofstellardocs/_admin/cdb.php on line 20

Now we know where is the admin directory. So we can try to connect to the 
adminstration
section:

http://www.site.com/pathofstellardocs/_admin/

We will have a login form where we will insert these data:

user: admin      password: admin

We have seen that there is no page to change them, so only modifying the 
source code
of the administration pages we can change these data. 




Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch is not yet produced.


Suggestions:

************

Filter all files and change administrator password by editing his pages.
