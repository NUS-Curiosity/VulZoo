Subject: [BUG-CORRECTION] IISShield logfile generation


Hi all,

A problem was fixed in IISShield that concerned the start-up of the ISAPI
FIlter and was related to the log filename generation for the daily logfiles
of IISShield.
Downloadable zip file already has the mentioned fix.

If anyone finds any other problems, please feel free to report them to me or
to the IISShield mailing list available at:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/IISShield/
A notice of this fix will be available at the site shortly!

As always, thank you for the given support,
Tiago Halm

IISShield is an IIS ISAPI Filter preventing any known and unknown attacks
from disrupting IIS. The preventive approach of IISShield is an added value
preventing IIS from even trying to interpret requests trying to break-in.
With a detailed logging engine, IISShield helps IIS administrators to know
in advance and protect IIS from known or unknown HTTP attacks that flow over
the Internet.
The configuration is quite detailed giving the ability to precisely decide
over what is accepted and what is not regarding the HTTP Layer.
RFC Compliance is just one of the core features of IISShield offering an
assurance of quality of service to the IIS Administrator.
Technical comparison with another well known tool with similar capabilities
is also provided outlining the powerfull capabilities of IISShield.
