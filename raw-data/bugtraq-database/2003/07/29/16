Subject: RE: RPC DCOM still vulnerable even after applying patches


Positively confirmed on patched Windows 2000 SP4 - did not reproduce on
patched XP Home.

Drag/Drop and other COM functions stop working, after a very visible
svchost.exe crash.

The hdmore loopback exploit is more friendly - it gave a nice DoS on all
RPC/COM services (no drag/drop) without crashing svchost. Of course,
this is only with the new return addresses that are not tied to any
specific servicepack..

This is in reference to exploit code available here:
http://www.securiteam.com/exploits/5CP0N0KAKK.html
.......

We (Douglas Mclean/and I) have checked it against
windows 200 SP4 machines that "even if you apply the
patch kb823980", you can get DOS attacks as tcp port
135 service (loc-srv)gets crashed and we get this
error on the box against which the exploit is being
run:

"SVCHOST.exe has generated errors and will be closed
by Windows. You will need to restart the program. An
error log is being created".

You are not able to access Event log either and other
funny things are detected too.

--------
So, even if you apply the patch MS03-026 you still are vulnerable and
you can still get DOS attacks.
