This has been its /modus operandi/ for over four years:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;239750

    Microsoft Knowledge Base Article - 239750
    "Text/Plain" Content-Type Header Field Is Ignored

    SYMPTOMS
    Internet Explorer may not use the "Text/Plain" Content-Type header
    field to properly open a text file on a Web site. For example, if a
    text file has an extension commonly associated with an executable
    binary file, Internet Explorer may try to run the text file instead
    of opening it as text.

    ...

    STATUS
    Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft
    products that are listed at the beginning of this article.
