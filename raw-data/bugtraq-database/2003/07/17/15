Subject: RE: Windows Update - Unsafe ActiveX control


You should not enable "unsafe activex", in order to get Windows Update
to work, however. 

http://*.windowsupdate.com , http://download.microsoft.com,
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com , https://download.microsoft.com, and
http://*.windowsupdate.com should all be enabled in trusted sites zone.
This is by default on Windows 2003.

Some references which are a good rule of thumb:

ne/overview/esc_changes.asp

Windows 2003 does have a good system in this way for the paranoid. It
disables activex and activescripting, but it allows for Windows Update
to properly work. Its' settings are documented in the above url.
