Description

************

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a serious security flaw in Elite News 
Ver.1.0.0.0-1.0.0.3 Beta. 
Elite News is a news publishing system which allows you to easily post 
news and reviews without a MySQL database.


Details

********

1.Direct access to stats.php file allows you to see Elite News 
administrator's username.

  ex: www.example.com/elitenews/stats.php

2.Fill in the administrator's username in login.html.
  Leave the password field blank.
  Click "Login".
   
  ex: www.example.com/elitenews/login.html

3.Then directly access newpost.php to post a message as an Elite News 
administrator.



Furthermore

************

login.php sets a cookie in your temporary internet files with the 
administrator's username.


Cookie content:

/elitenews
ex: UserAdmin
www.example.com/elitenews/
1536
2873507712
29576153
2673509856
29576139
*
Elitenews
1
www.example.com/elitenews/
1536
2873507712
29576153
2673509856
29576139
*



newpost.php "reads" this cookie and thus it's possible to see the "Send" 
and "Reset" buttons which are not shown if you don't login with the 
administrator's username. 


(Bogus) PHP Code/Location:

/elitenews/newpost.php:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<?php
$admin = $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS["Elitenews"]; 
if ($admin != "")
{
echo "<input <input type=submit value=Send><input type=reset value=Reset>";
}
?>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's also possible to access other Elite News files like modify.php, 
editordelete.php etc...


Solution:

*********

The vendor has been contacted and a patch is not yet produced.
