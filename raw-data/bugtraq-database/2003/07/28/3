Subject: Remotely exploitable overflow in mod_mylo for Apache


There exists a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the mod_mylo module for 
apache. 

It is a relatively obscure MySQL logging module for Apache that appears not to 
be in widespread use at present. However, it is present in FreeBSD ports, so 
may affect FreeBSD slighly more than Linux systems.

Advisory + exploit attached.

Regards,
Carl
