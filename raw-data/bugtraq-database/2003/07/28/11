Introduction
--------------
We are proud to present IISShield, an Application Layer Firewall to protect
IIS over the HTTP protocol layer.
Today's Internet exposure must be protected at all levels. Application Layer
Firewalls are an emerging technology providing a needed higher level of
protection to Web Servers given the new class of attacks over the HTTP
protocol layer.
Description
--------------
IISShield is an IIS ISAPI Filter preventing any known and unknown attacks
from disrupting IIS. The preventive approach of IISShield is an added value
preventing IIS from even trying to interpret requests trying to break-in.
With a detailed logging engine, IISShield helps IIS administrators to know
in advance and protect IIS from known or unknown HTTP attacks that flow over
the Internet.
The configuration is quite detailed giving the ability to precisely decide
over what is accepted and what is not regarding the HTTP Layer.
RFC Compliance is just one of the core features of IISShield offering an
assurance of quality of service to the IIS Administrator.
Technical comparison with another well known tool with similar capabilities
is also provided outlining the powerfull capabilities of IISShield.
Notes
-------
- Instalation of this ISAPI Filter must be manually done at the WebServer
level;
