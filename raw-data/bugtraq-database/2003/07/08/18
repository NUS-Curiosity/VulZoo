######Overview:

The 51 scripts are textbased webapplications (a forum, a board and a news
system) which are not bad. The design is great and it has many functions.
The official website is http://www.laforge-groups.de

######Exploit:

1. Get admin/user password hashes

All user/admin information are stored in a file named "user.idx" in the
"data" directory. So it is possible for you to open the files with your
browser to get the information. 

For example: 

~/newsdata/data/user.idx
~/forumdata/data/user.idx
~/boarddata/data/user.idx

Then crack the md5 hash and hope that the admin has a not so good
passwort.


######Vendor Response:

They told me that no patch is available and that the user can protect
that directoy with the special file but they think about fixing it in
newer versions.

Greetz to:

Erik, (O_o)oOoOoOo.
