By unobvious I assume you mean "can't be arsed to spend 5 seconds searching
for it" ?
Let's see...
http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=microsoft+security+contact&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&meta=

First hit :

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/contact.asp

Simple drop-down menu and then the web form.   Damn, that was a pain...

Righto...

http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=security@microsoft.com&meta=

First hit :

http://www.securityfocus.com/news/545

And there's an SF article about Microsoft wishing to move security
notifications from email (secure@...rosoft.com as mentioned in that very
article) to the web-based form so cunningly previously enumerated.   Both
methods are thus obtained in less time than it took to write this email.
Some vendors are a damn site harder to track down, let alone them ignoring
you unless you have a support contract - you might want to pick a better
example of this ?   Mind you, I have to type with a blunt crayon held
between my teeth as along with the straight-jackets, no sharp objects are
allowed here ;-)

Cheers.
