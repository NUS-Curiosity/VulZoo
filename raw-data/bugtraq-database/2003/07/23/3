State       Microsoft informed (secure@...rosoft.com) and bug fixed
Description MSN search is a link directory moderated by Microsoft. It is

            possible to inject some scripting with a search query. An
            attacker could initiate scripting attacks as denial of
            service attempts or cookie stealing. The script
dnserror.aspx
            is not affected by this cross site scripting vulnerability. 
Exploit     http://search.msn.ch/results.aspx?srch=105&FORM=AS5&
            q=%3cscript%3ealert('test')%3b%3c%2fscript%3etest
            (URL is splitted into two parts; it doesn't work anymore)
Solution    All scripting functions in the webbrowser that are not
needed
            should be deactivated. Check all URLs for unexpected strings
            (expecially "script") before following them. Some
application
            gateways and intrusion detection systems are able to detect
            such an attack.
