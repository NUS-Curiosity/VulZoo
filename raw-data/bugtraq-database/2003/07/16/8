Windows® networking ( TCP) and messenger service are both initialized
before any user/admin login
has taken place, and are remotely accessable


odd... setting up default XP box in DMZ  I complete the install setting up
networking ( dhcp ) and ( workgroup )
only one passworded administrator account as prompted by the instalation
media.... reboot.
 I leave box unatended for aprox 30 minuts at the login screen...
Upon sucessfull passworded login, a message-ala-windows messenger service
is displayed.. ( damn spammers )

BEFORE THE DESKTOP !!! and before anything ( except wallpaper ) has
initialized


here is output from a remote nbtenum session before a sucessfull login of a
freshly booted XP box

Network Adapter Adapter: \Device\NetbiosSmb
MAC Address: 000000000000
Adapter: \Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{D36A0C7D-1EC4-417E-9A7C-DF4F13AF9D4C}
MAC Address: 00A0CC397071
Logged On Users Username: 333\BITCHBOX$
Logon Server:

dunno if this particular behavior has been observed before ( im donning
Nomex® for the flames )
