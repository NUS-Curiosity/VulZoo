As for the device I have in use here (delivered pre-configured from my 
provider): not reachable from the internet. Firmware version is 71238a11.

Finding new firmware versions is hard if the vendor doesn't list a 
product on his website. At least I wasn't able to find it there (tried 
the global website as well as the german). Any ideas where else to look 
for a newer firmware version?

Yeah, that's fun. I received something about 10 messages. Out of office 
replies, anti-spam-notices ("please click on the following link to 
confirm your message"), "unable to deliver" messages... why can't people 
remove inactive accounts, and why can't they tell the mailinglist 
program to switch them temporarily off the feed?

Bye, Mike
