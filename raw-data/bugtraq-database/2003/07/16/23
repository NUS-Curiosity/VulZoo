	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	nfs-utils
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0252
Date:			Mon Jul 14 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-018-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Janusz Niewiadomski has discovered an off-by-one overflow in xlog() in
  the nfs-utils package. It is rumoured this bug is exploitable, however
  as it writes a single zero byte to memory, an exploit may be difficult
  to write.

  Because the overflow is so small, StackGuard may not be able to
  prevent exploitation of this flaw.
