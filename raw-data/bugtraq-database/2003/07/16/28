Subject: Disclosure-for-pay?


My company recently received a communication from someone purporting to
know of a security vulnerability in our web application. The individual
stated that they would sign an NDA and report the details of the
vulnerability to us if we paid his "consulting fee" and provided future
services to him at no cost.

Am I crazy here, or does this sound not good in several different ways?

Is that kind of demand for payment for reporting a vulnerability at all
the norm?

I'd love any advice here.

Thanks
