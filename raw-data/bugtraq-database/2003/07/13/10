Indeed, they are.  While it's interesting to see that MDaemon (which is
actually distributed by Alt-N Technologies, FYI) was vulnerable to this
issue in a revision as late as 6.7.9 (the current is 6.8.4), this issue,
and also the EXAMINE memory corruption issue, was identified as a
vulnerability in the software on March 23, 2001.

It is worth noting that searching Google with the two terms "MDaemon" and
"Examine" brought up several references to this vulnerability in the first
ten hits.  The Bugtraq Database entry is located here:
