######Overview:

The bitboard2 is a board that need no database to work. So it is useful
for webmaster that have no access to a sql database.

######Exploit:

1. Get the admin passwort hash

The crypt hash of the admin password is stored in
"/admin/data_passwd.dat".
Everyone has access to it. So only get the hash and crackit with john.

The real problem is that many admins don't use secure passwort ;-)

They told me that they are going to fix it in the next version.
