Subject: New information regarding CERT Advisory CA-2003-15



-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Cisco Systems has posted an update to their recent Cisco Security
Advisory, which was referenced in CERT Advisory CA-2003-15. This
update includes more specific technical details and new information
about more specific Access Control Lists (ACLs) that can be used to
protect vulnerable devices. The updated Cisco Security Advisory is
available at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030717-blocked.shtml

If you have already upgraded, no new action is required. Similarly, if
you have applied ACLs previously and are satisfied with them, no new
action is required (though upgrading is still recommended). This new
information is useful if you use an intrusion detection system or
network monitoring system, or if you need to apply a more specific
ACL.

No exploits are known to exist publicly at this time.
