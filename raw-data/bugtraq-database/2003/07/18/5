Subject: RAV Antivirus : Buffer Overflow in Online Scanning ActiveX


RAV Online Scanning ActiveX Buffer Overflow
=================================================

PROGRAM: RAV ONLINE SCANNING ACTIVEX
HOMEPAGE:  www.ravantivirus.com
VULNERABLE VERSIONS: Online Version Only


DESCRIPTION
=================================================

RAV Online Scanning is a free antivirus scanner for internet users. It is
run on the user's browsers as an ActiveX.

DETAILS
=================================================

The ActiveX file called ravonline.dll has a function named browseForFolder()
that can be overflowed by passing a very long string as an argument. Since
the function browseForFolder() is imported from Shell32.dll, so it looks
like
the problem maybe lay in the Shell32.dll but not in the ActiveX itself (I am
still working on that) however users that use RAV Online Scanning are still
vulnerable to the overflow.

WORKAROUND
=================================================

Delete the old ActiveX(ravonline.dll) in the "Downloaded Program Files" in
your Windows Directory. Vendor already got noticed but no response yet.
