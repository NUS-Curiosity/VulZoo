This is very interesting. A side 'benefit' is that we can mask our 
true url with the same scheme.

For an href in html in order to mask the true destination the <a 
href="....>bloatedcorp.com</a>, can be manipulated by trivial 
javascript to generate a custom representation in the status bar to 
fool our recipient should they 'hover' the mouse over the link.

This can be defeated quite simply like so:

<A href="http://%09%09%09%09%09%09%09 
09www.malware.com">http://www.microsoft.com</A> 

In an html mail message [default in Outlook Express] plus restricted 
zone in Outlook Express 6 [again default] where no scripting is 
allowed, the above link when presented to the recipient in an html 
email message, and tested by 'hovering' the mouse over it, yields 
nothing. Blank. Thereafter accepting the url, transports us to our 
site as required.

End Call
