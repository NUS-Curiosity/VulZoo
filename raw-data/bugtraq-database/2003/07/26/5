Subject: EEYE:ALERT Free RPC/DCOM vulnerability scanning tool


Due to the recent release of multiple exploits for the very serious
Microsoft RPC/DCOM vulnerability
(http://www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/ms03-026.asp) we
have decided to release a free scanning tool that will allow
administrators to check to see if DCOM is enabled on remote machines,
and also if the remote system is vulnerable (patched or not). The
original vulnerability was discovered by the very talented researchers
at LSD. You definitely should read their advisory at:
http://www.lsd-pl.net/ if you have not already.

This scanning tool does NOT require administrator access. There are
various commercial, and open source, scanners which check for this
vulnerability. However, those tools either require administrator access
(which will be non-existent at any large company with a large number of
IP's) or the tools will be intrusive in their testing and therefore
bring down servers. Our check does not require administrator access, nor
is our check intrusive in bringing down servers.

If you find any bugs in the tool please contact eEye Digital Security
via the email support option within the tool. Do not respond to this
eMail list as it is not the proper forum.

You can get the tool at: http://www.eeye.com

P.S. Users of Retina (Network Security Scanner) have already had this
check within the latest Retina updates.
