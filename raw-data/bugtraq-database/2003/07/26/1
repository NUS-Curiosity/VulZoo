Subject: Re: scan.sygate.com.  over-scanning?


I requested a scan from them over a year ago. They ran a complete 
vulnerability scan about five minutes after the port scan, followed by a 
*second* vulnerability scan almost six hours later. Following the second 
scan, there appeared to be some manual attempts by someone on their staff 
to verify certain (fake) vulnerabilities found. The whole process was 
bordering criminal, glad to see someone else noticed it...
