Subject: [VulnDiscuss] Contact information for Microsoft Security Response Center [tf]


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Periodically we hear people say they tried to contact Microsoft about
a product or service vulnerability and that Microsoft didn't respond.
 We are concerned that people may not know how to report security
vulnerabilities to Microsoft.
 
The Microsoft Security Response Center investigates all reports of
security vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products. If you believe
you have found a security vulnerability affecting a Microsoft
product, we'd like to work with you to investigate it. 
 
You can contact the Microsoft Security Response Center by emailing
secure@...rosoft.com directly, or you can submit your report via our
web-based vulnerability reporting form located at
https://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/se
curity/bulletin/alertus.asp.

Sincerely,
Microsoft Security Response Center
