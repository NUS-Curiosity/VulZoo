Subject: Re: Email marketing company gives out questionable security advice


I am continually amazed at the number of web sites which are unusable when
java and ActiveX are disabled.  Generally, html geeks get paid to make cool
web sites (and email) which use all the local/interactive "make your machine
do things" features; most don't seem to be aware of (or care about) the
security implications.  Try blocking active content at your firewall and see
how long it takes for clients to complain about not being able to use web
sites (even medical practice / insurance company web sites), not being able
to get emails/attachments, etc.  Education efforts aside, this puts us in
the position of having to field complaints about "the damn firewall".  Does
anyone else deal with this?
