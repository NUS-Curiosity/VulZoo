Subject: [STX] Multiple Security Vulnerabilities




Multiple files vulnerable to a buffer overflow:

-

gnuchess is an updated version of the GNU chess playing program. It has a 
simple alpha-numeric board display, an IBM PC compatible  interface, or it 
can be compiled for use with the chesstool program on a SUN workstation or 
with the xboard program under X-windows.

-

gnuan produces an analysis of a chess game. For each move it shows the 
move, the score and the principle variation selected by gnuchess.

-

isdnrep  reads  the  isdnlog log files, generates reports, does 
statistics, and other things. It  can  also  generate HTML output for use 
with a web server.

; By default the above are not suid.
