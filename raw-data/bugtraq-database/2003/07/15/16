It's far worse than that, if the state in which my router was supplied is
typical. As I received it, the webserver was enabled by default, *and* 
was accessible from the internet as well as the local network. I had to
explicitly set up ip_filter rules to restrict access (the same goes for
telnet access by the way). Worse, there was a bug which caused ip_filter 
rules not to be saved properly, so they were not restored after a reset. 
Fortunately this has been fixed in the last flash update (71205a32) but 
this same update also removes the requirement to specify a username.
You now only need any one of the valid passwords to login. Asus really
don't seem to have a clue. Finding out what has changed between the flash
versions, either from them or from Solwise the UK distributors, is impossible.

It takes a particularly special kind of incompetence to keep the passwords
unencrypted and accessible via the webserver. I certainly won't be buying
another of their products.

The only workaround I know of is to set up ip_filter rules, which is way 
beyond the capabilities of most home users (truthfully, quite a number 
may not even have changed the default login password). I'm not aware of 
any way to disable the httpd completely. Anyone?
