As I haven't seen the whole of the post you are replying to, I cannot 
be sure of the OP's "intention" as the above may have been (subtly) 
removed from its proper context.

But, FWIW, you should be aware that there are many ServU FTP servers 
out there, sitting on big, fat, open pipes.  The ones I'm thinking of 
have mainly been put there as part of establishing the "pubstro"-style 
warez bot nets.  Given how ServU got to be installed on these machines 
_and remain there_ (usually via ancient IIS exploits or null or 
otherwise easily-guessed admin passwords on Internet-visible Windows 
networking) it's a fair bet that banner scanning and the like to find 
them won't be detected _at the sites hosting these ServU servers_.
