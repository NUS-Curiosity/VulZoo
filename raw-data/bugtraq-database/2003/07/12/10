Description

***********

Zone-h Security Team has discovered a serious security flaw in StoreFront 
6.0 
(and older versions?). "Storefront offers merchants and developers a 
feature 
rich, fully customizable e-commerce solution at a fraction of the cost to 
deploy 
and maintain."

Details

*******

Storefront is an ASP shopping cart / storefront system that covers all 
the 
needs for ecommerce web sites. 

It's possible to retrieve sensible users information. There is a sql 
injection vulnerability in /login.asp of StoreFront system. It's possible
to login with this email id and password:
' or 'a'='a

to have then access to the first user in database structure. If an 
attacker 
knew any email address of a registered user, it'll be possible for him to 
retrieve
the  registered uses's information from this login page. 

Example: 

Email of registered user: example@...mple.com

Email id (user in the login.asp): example@...mple.com
Password: ' or 'a'='a
