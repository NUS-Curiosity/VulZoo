That article is at best out of date. It doesn't list any products past NT4 or
IE5, when in fact everything after NT4 and IE5 is still vulnerable, including a
fully patched XP and IE6.

I tested the registry entry mentioned in that article and it has no effect on
XP/IE6. I'm not convinced they are even trying to address the same issue with
that particular 'fix'.

I've put up a page at the following URL you can use to test your browser:

Yes, it is explained there, but that doesn't excuse MS refusing to fix this
security hole. They should at a minimum ship their OS's in a secure state - and
at the very very least provide an option for turning this off.

As noted above, this has been known for four years - so much for the MS Secure
Computing Initative - it's laughable.

cheers,
