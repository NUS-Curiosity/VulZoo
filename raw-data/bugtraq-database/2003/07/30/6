Subject: Another Mac OS X ScreenSaver Security Issue (after Security
    Update 2003-07-14)





Hi there!

I discoverd another security issue with the Mac OS X screensaver.
If you have installed escapepod from Ambrosia Software and hit
crtl-alt-delete(==backspace) when the screensaver with password
protection is running, it kills the screensaver and the desktop is
open to anybody - so it has the same effect as the recently
emerged password-exploit.
I expected that there should be a forced logout, if the screensaver
dies... - but there is no such behavior...

I have allready reported this to product-security@...le.com, but 
as usual with no reply...

Tested on this System Configuration:

Mac OS X 10.2.6 with Security Update 2003-07-14
1GB RAM
1GHZ PowerBook G4
escapepod 1.0.0d3 from http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/
freebies/
