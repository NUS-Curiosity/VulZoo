Subject: RE: RPC DCOM still vulnerable even after applying patches


M$ has confirmed that these are actually separate new
vulnerabilities unrelated to MS03-026. The MS03-026
patch "specifically addresses the privilege escalation
vulnerability in DCOM" per their security
representative. New patches are due out shortly.
