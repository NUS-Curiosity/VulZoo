-----[ cPanel Malicious HTML Tags Injection Vulnerability
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---

--[ Author: Ory Segal, Sanctum inc. http://www.SanctumInc.com
--[ Discovery Date: 06/17/2003 (Vendor was notified)
--[ Release Date: 07/06/2003 
--[ Product: Tested on cPanel 6.4.2-STABLE
--[ Severity: Medium
--[ CVE: Not assigned yet

--[ Summary

>From the vendor's web site:
"...The Cpanel interface is a client side interface, which allows your
customers 
to easily control a web hosting account. With the touch of a button, they
can 
add e-mail accounts, access their files, backup their files, setup a
shopping 
cart, and more..."

Web users can embed Malicious HTML tags in HTTP requests, which will later 
be parsed by the web site administrator's browser, in several cPanel
screens. 
This may lead to theft of cookies associated with the domain, or execution
of 
client-side scripts in the administrator's browser.
 
--[ Description

The 'Error Log' and 'Latest Visitors' screens in cPanel, provide the web
site 
administrator with HTTP request logs. These scripts do not sanitize the URL
part 
of HTTP requests and present them to the administrator as is, thus, allowing
an 
attacker to embed malicious HTML tags that will later be parsed and executed
by 
the administrators browser.

For example, lets take a look at the 'Error Log' screen:

[From errlog.html]
...
<b>Last 300 Error Log Messages in reverse order:</b><hr>
<pre>
[Tue Jun 17 08:41:14 2003] [error] [client x.x.x.x] File does not exist: 
/home/dir/public_html/foobar.html
</pre>
...

The following request will present a pop-up screen with the cookies 
that are currently associated with the domain:

  GET /<script>alert(document.cookie);</script> HTTP/1.0
  Host: www.site.com


--[ Note

The 'Latest Visitors' screen of the tested version (6.4.2-STABLE) presented
the 
latest requests as HTML links, thus the malicious payload must terminate the
<a> 
tag before opening a new one. For example:

  GET /"></a><script>alert(document.cookie);</script> HTTP/1.0
  Host: www.site.com

--[ Solution

According to the vendor, the problem was fixed in version 7.0, which can be 
downloaded at: http://www.cpanel.net/downloads.htm
