Why do you people insist on using such an unobvious address? Do you have
a catch-all in place?

secure@...rosoft.com is a whimsical address almost as silly as designating
"abuse@...rosoft.com" to "badstuff@...rosoft.com". 

If check where those people you heard saying they tried to contact you
tried first, you would see that the first and most logical address would
be security@...rosoft.com

I really do hope you have that address monitored as well, because as
long as you are in existence, people will not learn what the correct
address is and where to burrow down on your site to make submissions.

Can you confirm that this address security@...rosoft.com is being monitored
as well.

Microsoft Security Response Center:

Periodically we hear people say they tried to contact Microsoft about
a product or service vulnerability and that Microsoft didn't respond.
 We are concerned that people may not know how to report security
vulnerabilities to Microsoft.
 
The Microsoft Security Response Center investigates all reports of
security vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products. If you believe
you have found a security vulnerability affecting a Microsoft
product, we'd like to work with you to investigate it. 
 
You can contact the Microsoft Security Response Center by emailing
secure@...rosoft.com directly, or you can submit your report via our
web-based vulnerability reporting form located at
https://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/se
curity/bulletin/alertus.asp.

Sincerely,
Microsoft Security Response Center
