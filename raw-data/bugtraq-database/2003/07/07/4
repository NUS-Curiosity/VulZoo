This isn't a new issue; well not exactly.  The method for crashing to 
screensaver is new to me, but the result isn't.  When I first got my 
Powerbook (December of last year), it came with a .Mac screensaver 
which, IIRC, attempts to load its slideshow images off the Internet.  At 
the time, I was able to crash the .Mac screensaver by pulling the 
network plug while the screensaver was trying to update its images.  
Doing this caused the screensaver to crash and the Desktop to return 
(despite password locking).  I reported this vulnerability to Apple, but 
never got a response, and it obviously hasn't been fixed.  I don't have 
an exact date on when I originally reported it, but I believe it was 
sometime in January '03.
