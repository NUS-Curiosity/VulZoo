Subject: rundll32.exe buffer overflow


Hi,

 

There is buffer overflow in rundll32.exe when it is passed big string as
routine name for a module. I've tested this on WindowsXP SP1. But other
version of windows might be vuln.  

 

rundll32.exe  advpack32.dll,<'A'x499>   

 

advpack32.dll is just example. Any executable/dll  will work. The
cmdline does get converted to UNICODE. And EIP ends up being 00410041.
