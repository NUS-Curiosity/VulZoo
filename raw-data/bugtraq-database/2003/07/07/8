Subject: XSS in OWA allows stealing  windows domain user credentials




-2 vulnerabilities in OWA.
-Vendor contacted

Microsoft Outlook Web Access comes with a feature that
allows script filtering on HTML formatted mail
attachments.It is possible for an attacker to make a
request in a particular way so that OWA does not filter
the attachment causing the script to execute. Be aware
that this is not the same issue of bid 3650 nor
bid 2832... In those attack scenarios the trick seemed
to be a special obfuscated script code that would
bypass the filtering protection of the OWA.

Our attack is based on the fact that it is possible to
force the OWA to not  apply it's filtering engine. 
Microsoft OWA allows the user to view an HTML formatted
attachment. The URL to access the attachment in this
way has a parameter (Security) that, if not 
present in the query, will completely disable any kind
of script filtering. An attacker can trick an OWA user
to make such kind of request with a malicious link in
the body of the message (links are allowed). The
attacker needs to know the IP or the host name of the
Exchange server in order to succefully construct the
link, but all the info the attacker needs can easily be
obatined in te "Referer" header of an HTTP request from
a link in the message body of the vitim. So the attack
procedure will be:

1) a link in message body making a request to the
attacker's box will provide
him the info (in the referer) of the name/ip, etc of
the Exchange.
2) a link in the body of a new message will do the job
of calling for an
attachment without the script filtering feature.

Note: this attack is similar to our "XSS Antivirus
Bypass" of Hotmail:

Bad news are not the XSS, although it provides mail
access, session hijacking,etc... Bad news are that the
Cross Site Scripting present in the OWA allows the
attacker to automatically obtain the domain name,
username and password in of the victim.

The session tracking in the OWA uses cookies and "Basic
Auth", we do not know if there's also any kind of IP
tracking.
The Basic Auth string is the name of the domain, the
username and password base64 encoded...so it is trivial
to decode it.How a to retrieve this info?
The OWA is over an Internet Information Server, wich,
by default, allows "TRACE" method in HTTP requests :-)

A javascript using ActiveX or extended XML can do a
TRACE http request, and send the response (wich has the
"Basic Auth" header content) to the attacker.

So it's important to notice that we are talking of 2
vulnerabilities:

1) Javascript filtering bypass
2) User domain credentials retrieval

User domain credentials can not be encoded in this way
(base64)!!!

This practice is very dangerous, and any future Cross
Site Scripting in the OWA could be used to access those
credentials. 

Soon we will provide a proof of concept exploit to show
how this two vulnerabilities can be exploited toghether
easily.
