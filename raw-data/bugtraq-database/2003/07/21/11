NOTE: that the individual is not saying "Pay me or I'll tell everyone
about it".  He's just saying "Pay me or I WON'T tell you about it".
There is a subtle but critical difference.  Your example is incorrect
from that standpoint.

Personally I don't think it is very good business, but it is not as
damning as many people are screaming about.  In fact, the most unethical
part is the "provide future services at no cost".

	Call me unruly, but that sounds like extortion to me.  Indeed,
it's all too akin to someone knocking on your door and claiming they've
found a way to steal your car...but if you'll give them free rides
around town, they'll keep it quiet.

	No, this is _not_ the norm.  If anything, it's unethical.  In
some circles, it's considered illegal.  There have been a few people
who've been pinched by law enforcement for such "offers."

	Bottom line: you didn't hire this individual to audit your
applications, so he's out of line asking for compensation.
