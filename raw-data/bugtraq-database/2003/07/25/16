Analysis:
Windows NT 4.0 : outdated
IBM JAVA 1.3.0 : outdated

File handling in servlets : Bad design anti-pattern (better use EJB)

- - That does not help if the getCanonicalPath is used in a
  library that is not available in source code. You might
  have to use a decompiler or use a tool that searches for
  nested calls to such routines. I have written such a tool if
  you like to use it contact me via email.

- - But generally: Developers should think about system design that does not
  base on direct file access in the web-tier (least function principle).

- - DEPLOYERS should update their JVM (if their code
  does not use proprietary IBM stuff) to an uptodate JVM like
  Sun JRE 1.4.1_03.
