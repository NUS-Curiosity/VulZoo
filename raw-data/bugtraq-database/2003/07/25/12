Subject: MS03-029 / Q823803 breaks RAS?


Hi all,

After installing MS03-029 / Q823803 on a number of our NT4 servers and
workstations (via Windows Update) yesterday, we found that RAS failed to
start on all machines on which it was installed.

Specifically, the Remote Access Connection Manager service fails to start,
due to an error loading a PPP module.

Uninstalling the hotfix does not solve the issue, as the uninstall appears
*not* to replace the version of kernel32.dll installed by the hotfix with
the original version (dated 21/11/2001).

Manually replacing kernel32.dll with the pre-hotfix version and rebooting
appears to resolve the issue, but obviously leaves the hotfix unapplied.

Has anyone else encountered this issue?

Cheers,

Adam
