Subject: Workaround for stopping MS2003-030 exploitation via HTML?


CERT recently issued an advisory about this vulnerability (CA-2003-18,
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-18.html) that said that setting the
Internet Explorer 'Run ActiveX Controls' security setting to disable in
appropriate IE security zones would prevent exploitation of this in web
pages and HTML-format email. This sort of makes sense, since media player
can be used as an ActiveX control.

Can anyone confirm that this is really true, though?
