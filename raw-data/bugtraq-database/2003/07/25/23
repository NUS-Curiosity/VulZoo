Subject: question about oracle advisory



Oracle's released three security-related patches today.  I'm trying to
get my head around them to write up a Stanford Security Alert, but
there's conflicting information.  According to
http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/2003alert57.pdf the buffer
overflow in the EXTPROC code can only be triggered by an authenticated
user with the CREATE LIBRARY or CREATE ANY LIBRARY privilege.

According to the NGSSoftware advisory that announced the vulnerability,
the buffer overflow can be exploited without any authentication or
privilege-checking.

Anyone have any ideas?
