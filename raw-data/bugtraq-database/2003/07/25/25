CERT Advisory CA-2003-18 Integer Overflows in Microsoft Windows DirectX
MIDI Library

   Original issue date: July 25, 2003

   A complete revision history is at the end of this file.


Systems Affected

     * Microsoft  Windows  systems  running DirectX (Windows 98, 98SE, NT
       4.0, NT 4.0 TSE, 2000, Server 2003)


Overview

   A  set  of  integer  overflows exists in a DirectX library included in
   Microsoft  Windows.  An  attacker  could exploit this vulnerability to
   execute arbitrary code or to cause a denial of service.


I. Description

   Microsoft  Windows  operating  systems include multimedia technologies
   called  DirectX  and  DirectShow.  From  Microsoft  Security  Bulletin
   MS03-030,   "DirectX  consists  of  a  set  of  low-level  Application
   Programming  Interfaces  (APIs)  that are used by Windows programs for
   multimedia support. Within DirectX, the DirectShow technology performs
   client-side audio and video sourcing, manipulation, and rendering."

   DirectShow  support  for MIDI files is implemented in a library called
   quartz.dll. This library contains two vulnerabilities:

     VU#561284 - Microsoft Windows DirectX MIDI library does not
                 adequately validate Text or Copyright parameters in
                 MIDI files

     VU#265232 - Microsoft Windows DirectX MIDI library does not
                 adequately validate MThd track values in MIDI files

   In  both  cases,  a specially crafted MIDI file could cause an integer
   overflow, leading to incorrect memory allocation and heap corruption.

   Any application that uses DirectX/DirectShow to process MIDI files may
   be  affected  by  this  vulnerability. Of particular concern, Internet
   Explorer  (IE)  uses  the  Windows  Media  Player  ActiveX control and
   quartz.dll  to  handle  MIDI  files  embedded  in  HTML  documents. An
   attacker  could  therefore  exploit this vulnerability by convincing a
   victim  to  view an HTML document, such as a web page or an HTML email
   message, that contains an embedded MIDI file. Note that in addition to
   IE,  a  number  of  applications,  including Outlook, Outlook Express,
   Eudora,  AOL,  Lotus  Notes, and Adobe PhotoDeluxe, use the WebBrowser
   ActiveX control to interpret HTML documents.

   Further  technical  details  are  available  in  eEye Digital Security
   advisory AD20030723. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) refers
   to these vulnerabilities as CAN-2003-0346.


II. Impact

   By  convincing  a  victim  to  access a specially crafted MIDI or HTML
   file,  an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
   the  victim.  The attacker could also cause a denial of service in any
   application that uses the vulnerable functions in quartz.dll.


III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Apply  the  appropriate  patch  as  specified  by  Microsoft  Security
   Bulletin MS03-030.

Disable embedded MIDI files

   Change  the  Run  ActiveX  controls  and  plug-ins security setting to
   Disable  in the Internet zone and the zone(s) used by Outlook, Outlook
   Express,  and  any  other application that uses the WebBrowser ActiveX
   control to render HTML. This modification will prevent MIDI files from
   being automatically loaded from HTML documents. This workaround is not
   a  complete solution and will not prevent attacks that attempt to load
   MIDI files directly.

   Instructions  for  modifying IE security zone settings can be found in
   the CERT/CC Malicious Web Scripts FAQ.
