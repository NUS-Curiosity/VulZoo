That's not really allowing another program to bind the keys.  In the case of
the Netware client, Microsoft's GINA is completely replaced by the NWGINA
which handles the authentication at that point.  It doesn't simply bypass
MS's GINA unless I'm incredibly misinformed.  A malicious user can certainly
write their own GINA, but I don't think that's on the same level as simply
remapping some keys.  I also don't believe you can have multiple GINAs in use
at once.
