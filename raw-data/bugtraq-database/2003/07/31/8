This is not a bug in Apple software. This is a third party extension.

Ambrosia's Escape Pod is a utility that kills the frontmost app when the
shortcut keystroke is typed. Naturally it does not ship with MacOS X.

Since the screen saver is just another application (called
ScreenSaverEngine), if you hit the kill key when its running, it gets
killed.  Fancy that!

You should really report this to Ambrosia, and ask for a feature that
inhibits the kill functionality for specific applications.
