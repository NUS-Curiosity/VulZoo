	  Update 2003-07-14)


I wouldn't consider this a bug. It is like me writing a script that kills
any process named "ScreenSaverEngine". If I run it with my privileges it
should allow me to kill the process (assuming I own ScreenSaverEngine).
Escape Pod does what it is meant to. OS X does what it is meant to--that is
unless you are suggesting that the operating system not allow the user to
kill the screen saver process which is just stupid because I have had my
screen saver crash on me.

I know that! But it should be the concern of the OS that you cannot 
circumvent its security system with the help of other applications!
