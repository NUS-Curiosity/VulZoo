                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
________________________________________________________________________

Package name:           wu-ftpd
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:080
Date:                   July 31st, 2003

Affected versions:	8.2
________________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 A vulnerability was discovered by Janusz Niewiadomski and Wojciech
 Purczynski in the wu-ftpd FTP server package.  They found an off-by-
 one bug in the fb_realpath() function which could be used by a
 remote attacker to obtain root privileges on the server.  This bug
 can only be successfully accomplished by using wu-ftpd binaries
 compiled on Linux 2.0.x and later 2.4.x kernels because the 2.2.x
 and earlier 2.4.x kernels define PATH_MAX to be 4095 characters.
 
 wu-ftpd is no longer shipped with Mandrake Linux, however Mandrake
 Linux 8.2 did come with wu-ftpd.  If you use wu-ftpd, you are
 encouraged to upgrade to these patched packages.
