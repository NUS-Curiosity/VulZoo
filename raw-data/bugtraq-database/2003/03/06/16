I'm rather puzzled by it too :-).  Some days before before the 9.2.2
release, my 9.2.1 nameserver was getting repeatedly killed (with an
assertion failure) by a stream of DNS queries over TCP from one of our
users.  Every time I restarted it, it would die again within a few seconds.
We "solved" the problem by blocking traffic from the customer who was
generating all the TCP queries.

I reported this to ISC, and was informed that this was fixed in 9.2.2rc1
(but my request for more details was ignored).

So, if nothing else, I consider 9.2.2 to be a fix for a denial of service
problem.
