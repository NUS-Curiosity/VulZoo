Yes, it works on the M35 as well.

A friend sent it to me and it locks up my phone completely when I try to
read it.

An interesting side effect is that when a call comes in when the phone's
stuck, the display flashes with the incoming number, but the phone doesn't
ring or vibrate... It's also impossible to answer the call. Weird.

Now how can I delete this message? There's no "Edit" option in the message
menu; I have to view it before I can edit or delete it....
