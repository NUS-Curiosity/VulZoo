Subject: Guestbook v1.1.3 CSS Vuln


Project:   Filebased guestbook.
Author:    Copyright (c) Urs <urs@...cle.ch>
Version:   1.1.3
Update:    17-09-2002
Homepage:  http://www.circle.ch/scripts/

This PHP guest book script is vulnerable to hostile cross scripting in the 
'comment' section of guest book posts. Comments span across multiple pages, 
with the newest on the first page- thus a malicious user could easily embed 
hostile code and expect all that read the guest book with script-processing 
browsers to execute it.

The vendor has indicated that this project has been discontinued.
