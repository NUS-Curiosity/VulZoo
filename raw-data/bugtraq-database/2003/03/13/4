Rapid7 Advisory R7-0012
Lotus Notes/Domino R6-beta PROTOS LDAP Denial of Service Regression

   Published:  March 12, 2003
   Revision:   1.0
   http://www.rapid7.com/advisories/R7-0012.html

   CVE:           CAN-2001-1311 (regression)
   CERT Note:     583184        (regression)
   CERT Advisory: CA-2001-18    (regression)
   Lotus SPR:     DWUU4W6NC8    (regression)
   Bugtraq ID:    7039

1. Affected system(s):

   KNOWN VULNERABLE:
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R6 pre-release and beta versions
    o Lotus Domino R5.0.7 and earlier

   NOT VULNERABLE:
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R6.0 Gold
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R6.0.1
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R5.0.7a through R5.0.12

2. Summary

   In July 2001, the PROTOS protocol testing group at the University
   of Oulu in Finland released an LDAP protocol test suite that exposed
   flaws in LDAP implementations from multiple vendors.  [1]

   Lotus Domino R5.0.7 and earlier were affected by the PROTOS LDAP
   issues, resulting in buffer overflows and denial of service against
   the Domino server.  Lotus addressed these issues in Domino R5.0.7a,
   released May 18th 2001.  [2]

   While regression testing the pre-release and beta versions of Lotus
   Domino R6 with the PROTOS LDAP test suite, we found that these
   releases were vulnerable to the issues PROTOS discovered.

3. Vendor status and information

   Lotus
   http://www.lotus.com/
   http://www.ibm.com/

   Lotus was notified and they have fixed this vulnerability.  Lotus
   originally tracked these issues as SPR #DWUU4W6NC8 and are tracking
   the R6 beta issues with this SPR.  [3]

   See the References section for more information.

4. Solution

   Users running R6 beta and pre-release builds should upgrade to R6.0
   Gold or higher.  Due to other vulnerabilities discovered in R6.0
   Gold, you should consider upgrading to R6.0.1, which was released in
   February 2003.

   Users running R5.0.7a and higher are not affected.

   Domino incremental installers may be downloaded from the following
   URL (which has been wrapped):

5. Detailed analysis

   Credit for discovery of this vulnerability goes to the PROTOS
   project.  Please see their LDAP test suite page for more
   information. [1]
