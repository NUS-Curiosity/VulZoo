Wietse Venema offered the following responses for Postfix. First out
of the gate was [1], this regexp-based quick-response; capable of
false-positives, but not as scary as might be feared since it only
looks in the headers (place this in a regexp map, assign that to
header_checks):

	/<><><><><><>/ reject possible CA-2003-07 sendmail buffer overflow exploit

Then he came out with [2], a new release of postfix with
functionality like that of patched sendmail, sanitizing messages
as they pass through and logging when it does so. This enhancement
he then broke out as a light patch [3] to apply against most
versions of postfix that might be in use, for people who'd like the
protection without having to upgrade to a newer version.

To be clear here: Postfix is not itself susceptible to this problem.
The only purpose for this patch is to allow Postfix to mung messages
to protect vulnerable sendmails downstream from it.
