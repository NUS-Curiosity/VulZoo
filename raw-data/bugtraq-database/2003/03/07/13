Subject: Smoothwall Firewall SNORT buffer overflow


All,

Please note that the Linux based firewall smoothwall
(http://www.smoothwall.org) is using a vulnerable version of snort.
A patch has been released for the stable GPL 1.0 version: 
http://www.smoothwall.org/home/news/item/20030305.01.html
However, no patch has been released for the beta version GPL 2.0 Mallard. If
you are running this version you should disable snort from the admin
configuration panel.

I am sending an email to this list because I have contacted the snort
developers some days ago and no announcement/information has yet been
published on their website or on the 
developer mailing list.
Snort vulnerability reference:
