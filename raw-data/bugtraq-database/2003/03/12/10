Enforcing TLS/SSL is a temprorary workaround against script-kiddies - 
exploit (out-of-the-box) will not be able to authenticate.

(there is a user foobar, with passwd "lalala" on the system)

$ ./qex rootbox foobar lalala
Phase 1: Seeking buffer size
Connecting to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx... Logging in... Could not log in. Did you 
provide a valid username/password-combination?
Exiting due to error...

that's becouse:

$ telnet 0 110
Trying 0.0.0.0...
Connected to 0.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK ready
user foobar
- -ERR [AUTH] You must use TLS/SSL or stronger authentication such as APOP to 
connect to this server
quit

Not a fix, but who sends plaintext passwords anyway :) Unfortunately, I 
must assume, that at some point some "friendly" soul will equip qex with 
TLS/SSL.

What is the vendor response on that?
