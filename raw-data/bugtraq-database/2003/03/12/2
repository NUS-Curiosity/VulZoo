At first glance, doesn't this look like a null pointer reference bug 
rather than a buffer overflow? The message didn't (clearly) specify which 
four bytes of memory the attacker could overwrite and how it would be 
possible to gain control of the program flow. Since you have classified 
this as critical, perhaps you could clarify these points? Does there 
exist a working exploit which does something else than crash IE? Thanks,
