Subject: Re: QPopper 4.0.x buffer overflow vulnerability


The first I heard of the problem was this morning.  Was any notice 
sent to qpopper-bugs@...lcomm.com or qpopper-patches@...lcomm.com in 
advance of the posting here?  If so, please let me know the details 
so I can see what happened to the message.  If not, I'd like to know 
why.

A fixed Qpopper (version 4.0.5fc2) is available now at 
<ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/eudora/servers/unix/popper/beta/>.  I plan on 
releasing 4.0.5 final tomorrow unless I hear of any problems with 
4.0.5fc2.
