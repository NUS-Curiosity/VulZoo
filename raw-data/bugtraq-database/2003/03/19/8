Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0011

Package name:      samba
Summary:           Remote root compromise
Date:              2003-03-18
Affected versions: TSL 1.01, 1.1, 1.2, 1.5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  Samba provides an SMB server which can be used to provide network
  services to SMB (sometimes called "Lan Manager") clients, including
  various versions of MS Windows, OS/2, and other Linux machines. Samba
  uses NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) protocols and does NOT need NetBEUI
  (Microsoft Raw NetBIOS frame) protocol.


Problem description:
  A buffer overrun has been found in all versions of Samba from 2.0.*
  to 2.2.7a inclusive.  This allows a remote attacker to gain root
  privileges on a samba server.


Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.

  Note to users of 1.01, 1.1 and 1.2:  This is a major upgrade.  Please
