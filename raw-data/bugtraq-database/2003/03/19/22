Subject: [OpenSSL Advisory] Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 padding


OpenSSL Security Advisory [19 March 2003]

Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack on RSA in SSL/TLS
===========================================

Czech cryptologists Vlastimil Klima, Ondrej Pokorny, and Tomas Rosa
have come up with an extension of the "Bleichenbacher attack" on RSA
with PKCS #1 v1.5 padding as used in SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0.  Their
attack requires the attacker to open millions of SSL/TLS connections
to the server under attack; the server's behaviour when faced with
specially made-up RSA ciphertexts can reveal information that in
effect allows the attacker to perform a single RSA private key
operation on a ciphertext of its choice using the server's RSA key.
Note that the server's RSA key is not compromised in this attack.

This problem affects all applications using the OpenSSL SSL/TLS library.
OpenSSL releases up to 0.9.6i and 0.9.7a are vulnerable. The enclosed
patch modifies SSL/TLS server behaviour to avoid the vulnerability.


Security Patch
--------------

The following patch can be applied to OpenSSL releases 0.9.6b up to 0.9.6i,
0.9.7, and 0.9.7a.
