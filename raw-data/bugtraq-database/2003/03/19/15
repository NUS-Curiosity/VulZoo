Package:             delegate
Vulnerability:       remote code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= delegate-8.3.4-20030222  >= delegate-8.5.0-20030306
OpenPKG 1.2          <= delegate-8.3.3-1.2.0     >= delegate-8.3.3-1.2.1
OpenPKG 1.1          <= delegate-7.9.11-1.1.0    >= delegate-7.9.11-1.1.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a SNS security advisory [0], a remote code execution
  vulnerability exists in the application level gateway DeleGate [1]
  version 8.4.0 and earlier. Fetching a large robots.txt file through
  DeleGate HTTP proxy could result in a buffer overflow.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q delegate". If you have the "delegate" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution). [2][3]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [4][5], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [6][7] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [8], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [2] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [3]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get delegate-8.3.3-1.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig delegate-8.3.3-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild delegate-8.3.3-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/delegate-8.3.3-1.2.1.*.rpm
