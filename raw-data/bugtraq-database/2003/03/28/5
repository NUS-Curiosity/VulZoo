Subject: D-Link DI-614 wiresless router crash/reboots


A user of ours has reported that the D-Link DI-614+
Wireless router/firewall is vulnerable to several old,
well known vulnerablities.  The user was able to reproduce
the problem multiple times with consistent results.  Not
having the equipment, we have NOT reproduced these ourselves,
and would appreciate if anyone can corroborate these
problems.

The vendor was notified on March 13th and has not responded
back.

Both tests causing problems were reproduced using the Nessus
test suite. Test IDs are Nessus test ID numbers and are
supplied for reference.

Nestea:  A Nestea attack applied to the device causes the
     device to spontaneously reboot. The device is out of
     operation for only a few seconds and is then back in
     service with no other known impact.

Linux 0 length fragment bug: Sending the appropriate packet
     causes the device to crash requiring a power off-on cycle
     to recover.
     Ref: http://www.securityspace.com/smysecure/catid.html?id=10134

If anyone can support that their device does or does not behave
similarly it would be appreciated.
