Thomas forgot to include the Firmware that machine is
running.

I am a user of the above mentioned device, new firmware for
EUROPEAN (important as the european distributors are lagging
a few versions behind) and US versions can be found here (2)

Please note that as seen on DSLREPORTS (1) the router
sometimes behaves unstable. With some firmware versions
even a normal Telnet session causes a reboot on the 
router. That said, I donÂ´t think the router is vulnerable
to only these specific attacks, but the firmware running there
is simply buggy.

Applying the current firmware (2) solved all problems
I had with the router, no more stalls or reboots. The attacks
mentioned here had no effect on my DI-614+.

I recommend every European (and of course US) user to upgrade
to the latest firmware and if he has the guts ;) to the
latest Beta firmware drivers.
