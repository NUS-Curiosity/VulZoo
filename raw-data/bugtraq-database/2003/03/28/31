Hi,

executing

<scr1pt language="Javascript">
t = new Packages.sun.plugin.javascript.navig5.JSObject(1,1);
</scr1pt>

crashes Netscape 7.02 and Opera 7 on Windows XP.
The active JVM in both tested browsers is Java 1.4.1_02 from Sun.

This liveconnect (javascript-2-java-communication) stuff seems
to be still very dangerous.

Sincerely
Marc Schoenefeld
