For those of us not familiar with Acrobat plugins, is there some facility
for the program retrieving/installing plugins automatically, or, to exploit
this would you need to entice a user to manually place your .api file in
their "plug_ins" directory (or run an installer program that would do so, in
which case you could run arbitrary code anyway in the installer)?
