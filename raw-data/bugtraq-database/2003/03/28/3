Description:
  This update fixes two problems with openssl packages and recompiles
  openssh and mod_ssl against the new version of openssl. Quoting from
  the OpenSSL advisory:
    Vlastimil Klima, Ondrej Pokorny, and Tomas Rosa have come up with an
    extension of the "Bleichenbacher attack" on RSA with PKCS #1 v1.5
    padding as used in SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0. Their attack requires the
    attacker to open millions of SSL/TLS connections to the server under
    attack; the server's behaviour when faced with specially made-up RSA
    ciphertexts can reveal information that in effect allows the attacker
    to perform a single RSA private key operation on a ciphertext of
    its choice using the server's RSA key. Note that the server's RSA
    key is not compromised in this attack.
  The other problem, quoting from the CERT advisory: David Brumley and Dan
    Boneh, researchers at Stanford University, have written a paper that
    demonstrates a practical attack that can be used to extract private
    keys from vulnerable RSA applications.  Using statistical techniques
    and carefully measuring the amount of time required to complete an
    RSA operation, an attacker can recover one of the factors (q) of the
    RSA key. [...] Under optimal conditions, a 1024-bit RSA private key
    was extracted in approximately two hours using ~350,000 guesses.
