I don't believe your shell code will work on other Kernel32.dll than the
version with the following ImageBase:
"\x00\x00\xe7\x77" // offsets of kernel32.dll for some win ver..

Because your code is reversed as:

loc_8F:
    mov     eax, [esi]
    add     eax, ebp
    cmp     dword ptr [eax], 50746547h
    jnz     short loc_C0
    cmp     dword ptr [eax+4], 41636F72h
    jnz     short loc_C0
    cmp     dword ptr [eax+8], 65726464h
    jnz     short loc_C0
    mov     eax, [edi+24h]
    add     eax, ebp
    movzx   ebx, word ptr [eax+edx*2]
    mov     eax, [edi+1Ch]
    add     eax, ebp
    mov     ebx, [eax+ebx*4]
    add     ebx, ebp

        ; should jump to found
loc_C0:
    add     esi, 4
    inc     edx
    cmp     edx, [edi+18h]
    jnz     short loc_8F
        ; then reached all and could not find, so find another version
So, if the Kernel32.dll happens to be different than the default, it will
simply crash without going too far.
