I must be missing what you are saying to replace 1234 with, as I didnt get
anything but errors.

However,

Deactivating the module only would not be sufficient as the module itself is
still accessible.

I would say that if you want to secure it completely, either remove it from
the modules, or rename it to something unique so that it cant be found.
