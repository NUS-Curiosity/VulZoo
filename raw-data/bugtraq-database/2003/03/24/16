Subject: DEF CON Announcement: CFP, Media now on line!


Hello everyone,

I would like to make several DEF CON related announcements.

The Call For Papers for speaking at DEF CON ELEVEN (or XI, 0x0B, 1.1, 
11)  is now on-line and in effect. Continuing last year, we will continue 
to pay speakers. We are also continuing to improve speaker quality. It is 
no longer enough to have green hair and an attitude.
Check it out at: http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-11/defcon-11-cfp.html

The speeches from DEF CON 0a are now on-line with the DEF CON media server. 
90% of the talks are encoded with Real Helix and should be at a better 
resolution than past media. The missing talks are being hunted down now and 
re-encoded. Only video is currently available, with the audio only encoding 
to follow. Listen to 60+ talks spanning privacy, wireless, hacking, network 
defense and more!

Solicitation for papers, stories, and art: Contrary to rumors on IRC, DEF 
CON is not starting a publication. What we are doing is expanding the show 
program to be more of than just a show guide since last year's program with 
the added articles was such a huge hit. As such we are looking for serious 
technical articles, relating to the underground scene, privacy, computer 
security, humor, stories, and art.

Thank you,
