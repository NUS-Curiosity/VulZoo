Security advisory

Issue: GiantRat Mailer exposes plain text PoP password

Date: 03/13/03

Vendor first notified: Febuary 2003

Affected versions: All (tested v3.1, 2.x, 1.x

ABOUT GiantRat Mailer:

GiantRat Mailer is an innovative email client that has settings for the sight-impaired and has optional voice prompts utilizing MS-Agent.  Currently there are thousands of installations worldwide in use by the blind.

SECURITY ISSUES:

In the root of the client installation, e.g., c:\program files\giantrat, the GiantRat.ini file clearly shows user login information and the PoP password in line 18.  There is no encryption whatsoever.

Risk:  Obvious � the blind can�t see it but we sure can�even after a few shots of Stolichnaya.

ADVISE TO USERS:

Make sure your hard drives are secure and safe from prying eyes. 

VENDOR RESPONSE:  The company was made aware and has implemented an XOR encryption algorithm effective 03/13/2003 that scrambles the password in the .ini file.

Updates are available.
