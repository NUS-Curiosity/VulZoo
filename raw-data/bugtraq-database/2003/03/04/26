Subject: Re: BIND 9.2.2 Vulnerabilities?



Hi! 

Yesterday morning I saw no notice whatsover. 
I downloaded 9.2.1 and upgraded to it.
ISC called it  a 'bugfix' release.

However - I just looked at the CHANGES file for 9.2.2 

There are no security notes in the section for 9.2.2
but in the notes for 9.2.2rc1 these appear: 

1356.   [security]      Support patches OpenSSL libraries.
                        http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-23.html

1349.   [security]      Minimum OpenSSL version now 0.9.6e (was 0.9.5a).
                        http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-23.html

as well as a zillion other changes. 

Now I have to upgrade all over again :(

Should they note that there are security 
bugs in the current release, or is it my responsibility to read 
all of the CHNGES files for all the release candidates _before_ 
I upgrade from one relase to another??????

Did I miss something as well here?
