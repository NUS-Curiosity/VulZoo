Question: are the header and ident issues *only* remote overflow
problems, or is this also a local vulnerability?  Ie. if one has a
system that doesn't run sendmail in daemon mode (-bd), but does make
sendmail available as an SUID root binary for submission to the local
smarthost and does run sendmail is queue-process mode (ie. -q15m), is
the system still vulnerable?  Given that the problem is in the header
parsing, I would expect this to be both a remote and a local problem,
but I'd like to make sure before doing lots of upgrades.

Thanks.
