Hello Geoff,

Thank you for your reply.

Some reactions on your statements:

1. I've tested the SNMP 'set community name'.  None responded 
to 'internal' after I changed it to something else. 
You are right when you mean the SNMP 'GET community name', that one can't 
be changed.

2. I'm not suggesting to keep the Web Server (EWS) password empty, only 
the 'Web Jetadmin (WJA) device password'. 
But you are right with the newer JetDirect cards (610N and higher). In 
those cards the 'Web Jetadmin device password' is equal to the EWS 
password (and also equal to the telnet password).

In the 'older' JetDirect cards (600N and older), the 'WJA device password' 
has nothing to do with the EWS password (they can even be different). The 
WJA device password is just stored in a reserved place in the devices' 
NVRAM and can only be used by the WJA.

I have tested your suggesting by disabling the EWS (ews-config:0).  The 
EWS shows now the message '404 not found'.  But when I place a device 
password using WJA, the password is again readable in ASCII text using 
SNMP.  So it won't help.

And you are right about the raw ascii string; I made a typo in that one.
