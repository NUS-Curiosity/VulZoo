APPLE-SA-2003-03-03 sendmail

Security Update 2003-03-03 is now available.  It contains fixes for the
following potential security issues:

* Sendmail:  Fixes CAN-2002-1337 where a remote attacker could gain
elevated privileges on affected hosts.  Sendmail is not enabled by
default on Mac OS X, so only those systems which have explictly enabled
sendmail are vulnerable.  All customers of Mac OS X, however, are
encouraged to apply this update.

* OpenSSL:  Fixes CAN-2003-0078, where it is theoretically possible for
a third-party to extract the original plaintext of encrypted messages
sent over the network.  Security Update 2003-03-03 applies this fix for
Mac OS X 10.2.4, and customers of earlier Mac OS X versions may obtain
the patch from the OpenSSL web site:
http://www.openssl.org/

Security Update 2003-03-03 may be obtained from:

   * Software Update pane in System Preferences
      (updating from Mac OS X 10.1.5 and 10.2.4)

   - OR -

   * Apple's Software Downloads web site:
   
     Updating from Mac OS X 10.2.4:
        http://www.info.apple.com/kbnum/n120195
     The download file is named: "1024SecUpd2003-03-03.dmg"
     Its SHA-1 digest is: 2eb722f340d4e57aa79bb5422b94d556888cbf38

Security Update 2003-03-03 for Mac OS X 10.1.5 is planned to be
available on March 4.
