However, my S35i is _completely_ disabled, just as the original poster 
 described, no luck with just pressing the "hang up"-key, one has to 
 yank the battery out. Also, there is no "Edit Message" available until
 after one reads a message, and thus disables the phone.

Please also note that if you append something to the "%String", the bug 
 no longer hits (for my S35i, that is). Most web->sms - gateways append
 some signature to SMSs, and thus, by sheer luck, can't be used to exploit
 this.

cheers,
