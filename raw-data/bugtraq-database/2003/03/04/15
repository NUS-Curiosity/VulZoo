I'm not sure how the exploit works, but if I understood the LSD-analysis 
correctly, it uses the comment for the payload, and needs many <> in a 
parsed header. With exim4, this ACL should/could help.

First it checks for the header-syntax, that will reject the <><><><> 
used in the LSD-POC-code. The second condition should refuse to accept 
comments longer than 20 chars.

acl_data = check_message

check_message:
   require message = Invalid header syntax (Maybe sendmail exploit)
           verify  = header_syntax
   deny    message = Ohh, this looks like the sendmail-exploit
           condition = ${if match {$h_from: $h_cc: $h_bcc: $h_reply_to: \
                              $h_sender: $h_to:} {\N\(.{21,}?\)\N}{1}{0}}


No warranty ;)
