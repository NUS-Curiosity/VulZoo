Package:             sendmail
Vulnerability:       code execution, root exploit
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= sendmail-8.12.7-20030205 >= sendmail-8.12.8-20030304
OpenPKG 1.2          <= sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.0    >= sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.1
OpenPKG 1.1          none                        N.A.

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to an ISS X-Force advisory [1], a buffer overflow
  vulnerability exists in all versions from 5.79 to 8.12.7 of the
  Sendmail MTA [0]. Attackers may remotely exploit this vulnerability to
  gain "root" or superuser control of any vulnerable Sendmail server.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2002-1337 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q sendmail". If you have the "sendmail" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [6] or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [7], build a corresponding binary RPM from it [3]
  and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [4].
  For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the following operations
  to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
  accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.1.*.rpm
