-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The password is not enabled by default, but the readme has the following installation instructions:

- ---

open setup.php and edit these options

$ADMIN[RequirePass] = "Yes";   // Checks to see if upload has a vaild
 password
$ADMIN[Password] = "password";   // This is the password if the above
 option is Yes
$ADMIN[UploadNum] = "5";  // Number of upload feilds to put on the html
page
$ADMIN[directory] = "uploads";  // The directory the files will be
uploaded to (must be chmoded to 777)

- ---

I dunno if I would bet the bank on this security, but it is pretty clear in the readme that you should enable password protection. And obviously, change the default password. But hey, the package is 3k zipped, so I probably wouldn't expect a lot of cutting edge security features.
