What happens if the string is sent repeatedly while the phone is turned
on but is unattended or receives text messages silently? Is the battery
drained as predicted?

Please note that this vulnerability isn't as serious as you describe it.
At least on my S45, I am able to interrupt this 2 minute delay at any
time by pressing the 'hang up' key (but I have to press it for about
half a second instead of just hitting it), the message can be read by
using 'edit message' instead of 'read message', and it can be deleted
without problems.

So while this obviously is a bug, it can hardly be called a DoS.
