                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          New samba packages fix security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:095-01
Issue date:        2003-03-17
Updated on:        2003-03-17
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          smb
Cross references:

CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0085 CAN-2003-0086
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated Samba packages are now available to fix security vulnerabilities
found during a code audit.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

Samba is a suite of utilities which provides file and printer sharing
services to SMB/CIFS clients.

Sebastian Krahmer discovered a security vulnerability present
in unpatched versions of Samba prior to 2.2.8. An anonymous user could
exploit the vulnerability to gain root access on the target machine. 

Additionally, a race condition was discovered which could allow an attacker
to overwrite critical system files.

All users of Samba are advised to update to the erratum packages which
contain patches to correct these vulnerabilities.  Erratum packages for
releases which use Samba 2.0.x will be available shortly.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
