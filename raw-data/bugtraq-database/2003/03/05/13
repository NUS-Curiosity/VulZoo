Subject: Re: BIND 9.2.2 Vulnerabilities?



That was really what I was trying to get at.  If there are vulnerabilities 
I don't think that they are being discussed in a manner that brings this 
to the attention of those of us who are running 9.2.1.  It seems that the 
announcement was rather low-key and I stumbled across this information on 
the website almost by mistake.
