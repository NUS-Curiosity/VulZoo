---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated Gnome-lokkit packages fix missing FORWARD ruleset in Red Hat Linux 8.0

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

Gnome-lokkit is a utility that provides firewalling for the average Linux
end user based on responses to a small number of simple questions.

Red Hat made modifications to Gnome-lokkit to support firewalls based on
iptables instead of ipchains.  In Red Hat Linux 8.0, the iptables ruleset
created by Gnome-lokkit did not place any rules on the FORWARD chain.  This
is a security vulnerability if an administrator enables packet forwarding
and uses an unmodified ruleset created by the Gnome-lokkit tool.

Users are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which contain a
patch to Gnome-lokkit to also apply the INPUT chain ruleset to the FORWARD
chain.

Red Hat would like to thank Deneb Meketa for bringing this issue to our
attention.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

84975 - does not include FORWARD chain
