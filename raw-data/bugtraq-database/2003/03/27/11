Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0014

Package name:      glibc
Summary:           xdr / rpc
Date:              2003-03-26
Affected versions: TSL 1.1, 1.2, 1.5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by multiple
  programs on the system. In order to save disk space and memory, as well as to
  make upgrading easier, common system code is kept in one place and shared
  between programs. This particular package contains the most important sets of
  shared libraries: the standard C library and the standard math library.
  Without these two libraries, a Linux system will not function.  The glibc
  package also contains national language (locale) support and timezone
  databases.


Problem description:
   An integer overflow was discovered in the xdrmem_getbytes() function of
   glibc 2.3.1 and earlier.  This function is part of the XDR encoder/decoder
   derived from Sun's RPC implementation.  
   
   This vulnerability might cause buffer overflows and could possibly be
   exploited to execute arbitray code.



Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
