Subject: RE: JRun: The Easiness of Session Fixation


Hi Christoph,

I'm sure you know this but as the author of the session fixation paper I'd
like to make things perfectly clear for everyone: The JRun functionality
that you mentioned is *NOT* a security problem by itself. There has to exist
a session fixation vulnerability in a web application to be exploited using
this functionality in the first place!
You're right that it makes fixing a session much easier but it's just an
unfortunate side effect. Again, if the web application is immune to session
fixation, your ability to set a session ID cookie becomes completely
irrelevant to security. Session fixation is a vulnerability of web
applications, not the web servers these apps are running on. Apologies to
everyone for repeating myself, but my paper seems to have caused a bit of
confusion among readers.

To answer one of your questions, you can make a call to session.invalidate()
for invalidating any current session the browser may be in. This will make
JRun issue a new JSESSIONID cookie.
