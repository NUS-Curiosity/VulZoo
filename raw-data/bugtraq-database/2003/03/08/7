in reference to the cworld article, i would say some1 is kinda confused 
around here.....:)

The "russian hacker web site" is actually www.security.nnov.ru, a well 
known infosec news and advisory site, not in the business of "producing" 
exploits for the mass.

They actually made public the advisory from LDS (i would try to confuse a 
polish guy with a russian one ;) 
http://www.security.nnov.ru/search/news.asp?binid=2630

On my opinion, all this rumors surondin the famous sendmail exploit, are 
not meant to aware and alert ppl about risk but to actually misinform them 
and produce terror (and the involved "necesary?"investment on trying 
to "fix this")

i also was truly surprised after reading the comments form ppl like 
Ingevaldson from x-force ensuring "analysis of the code shows that it 
works" or Eric Allman saying "...there are other variables that are not 
pointers that have security implications; finding one of them within range 
will be more difficult, but probably not impossible..." (without specify 
what kind of risk he founds behind this).

The kind of comments that provide companies subjective risk indications, 
are just a tool against ppl trying to be serious about risk management 
security investment.
