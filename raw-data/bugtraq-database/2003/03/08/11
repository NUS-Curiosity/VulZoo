Wellknown and supported way to remove/hide users from Welcome screen.

Also I would like to note that there is a flaw in your report.
Any user can retrive lists or users and shares in default configuration 
for NT4 and W2K using "null sessions". XP has some changes.
This was already discussed  in

Just wanna everything will be clear,
