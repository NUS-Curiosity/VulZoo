                          SGI Security Advisory

Title    : Java Security Fixes
Number   : 20030303-01-I
Date     : March 19, 2003
Reference: CERT CA-2002-07
Reference: CERT VU#368819
Reference: CVE CAN-2002-0059
Reference: SGI BUGS 875825 875826 874656 868744
Fixed in : Java2 v1.4.1 APIs.

______________________________________________________________________________

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that there are multiple vulnerabilities in Java:

  o  A defect in the Java(TM) Virtual Machine may allow illegal
     access to protected fields or methods of an object:
     http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F50083

  o  The Java(TM) Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) may incorrectly validate
     the digital certificate of a web site:
     http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F50081

  o  The Java Plug-in may incorrectly validate the digital certificates of
     signed JAR files:
     http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/300767
     http://lsd-pl.net/java_security.html

  o  A defect in the Bytecode Verifier may allow new instances of objects
     to be created without calling the proper initialization method from
     within the constructor of the created class:
     http://sunsolve.Sun.COM/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F49304

  o  CERT has reported a bug in the zlib compression library:
     http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-07.html
     http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?&doc=secbull/220
     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0059

     SGI's implementations of the Java(TM) Runtime Environment include zlib
     and are affected. This bug may allow malicious code to corrupt memory
     and possibly crash the Java Runtime Environment.

SGI has investigated the issues and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in SGI's release of the Java2 v1.4.1 APIs.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

Java is installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems as part of java_eoe.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no workaround for these issues. SGI recommends installing the new
Java API package noted below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a new version of Java (version 1.4.1) to address these
vulnerabilities. Our recommendation is to upgrade to this version of Java.
