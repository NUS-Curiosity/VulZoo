Package:             mutt
Vulnerability:       buffer overflow in IMAP client
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= mutt-1.4i-20030103     >= mutt-1.4.1i-20030320
OpenPKG 1.2          <= mutt-1.4i-1.2.0        >= mutt-1.4i-1.2.1
OpenPKG 1.1          <= mutt-1.4i-1.1.0        >= mutt-1.4i-1.1.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a posting on Bugtraq [0], Edmund Grimley Evans fixed a
  buffer overflow which exists in the IMAP client code of the mail user
  agent Mutt [1]. The bug was found by Core Security Technologies [2].

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  mutt". If you have the "mutt" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary
  RPM [4]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get mutt-1.4i-1.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig mutt-1.4i-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild mutt-1.4i-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/mutt-1.4i-1.2.1.*.rpm
