David,
 
Have you found any attack vectors that do not require IIS?
 
Thanks
 
Dennis

	The patch announced by Microsoft on the 17th March 2003 fixed a security
	vulnerability in the core of the Windows 2000 operating system. This flaw
	was actively being exploited through WebDAV requests to Microsoft's Internet
	Information Server 5. It must be stressed that IIS was simply the attack
	vector; the method or route used to actually exploit the flaw. The problem,
	however, is much wider in scope than just simply machines running IIS.
	Researchers at NGSSoftware have isolated many more attack vectors including
	java based web servers and other non-WebDAV related issues in IIS. Due to
	this, NGSSoftware urge Windows 2000 users to apply the patch.
	
	For a paper that examines the vulnerability in detail, please read
	http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/ms03-007-ntdll.pdf .
