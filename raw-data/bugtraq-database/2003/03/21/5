Subject: New attack vectors and a vulnerability dissection of MS03-007


The patch announced by Microsoft on the 17th March 2003 fixed a security
vulnerability in the core of the Windows 2000 operating system. This flaw
was actively being exploited through WebDAV requests to Microsoft's Internet
Information Server 5. It must be stressed that IIS was simply the attack
vector; the method or route used to actually exploit the flaw. The problem,
however, is much wider in scope than just simply machines running IIS.
Researchers at NGSSoftware have isolated many more attack vectors including
java based web servers and other non-WebDAV related issues in IIS. Due to
this, NGSSoftware urge Windows 2000 users to apply the patch.
