1. Topic:

Updated Evolution packages are available which fix several vulnerabilities.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

Evolution is a GNOME-based collection of personal information management
(PIM) tools.

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the Ximian Evolution email
client. These vulnerabilities make it possible for a carefully crafted
email to crash the program, cause general system instability through
resource starvation and get around security measures implemented within the
program.

Users of Evolution are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages. For
Red Hat Linux 7.3, these packages update Evolution to version 1.0.8 with
patches to correct these vulnerabilities. For Red Hat Linux 8.0, these
packages contain backported security fixes which correct these vulnerabilities.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
