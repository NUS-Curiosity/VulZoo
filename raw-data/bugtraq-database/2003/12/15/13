Subject: Get admin rights using Doro (pdf creator)


Hi,

a few days ago i discovered a bug in Doro[1]. Doro is a free tool to
create pdf files from any windows program. After installing Doro you
have a new printer called 'Doro PDF Writer'.
If you select 'Print' the spooler calls the printer filter 'doro.dll'.
The 'doro.dll' then starts 'doro.exe' and a file requester appears.

I guess that most of you see the problem. The spooler is controlled by
the account 'system'. Therefore the file requester has the same rights.

It's easy now to create a new user and move them into the group
'admins'.

I informed the coder of the software and he approved the problem.


regards
Ramon
