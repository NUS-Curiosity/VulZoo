______________________________________________________________________________

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    The the flexible and powerful FTP command-line client  lftp is vulnerable
    to two remote buffer overflows.
    When using lftp via HTTP or HTTPS to execute commands like 'ls' or 'rels'
    specially prepared directories on the server can trigger a buffer overflow
    in the HTTP handling functions of lftp to possibly execute arbitrary code
    on the client-side.
    Please note, to exploit these bugs an attacker has to control the server-
    side of the context and the attacker will only gain access to the account
    of the user that is executing lftp.

    There is no temporary workaround known.

    Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
    integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
    Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply
    the update.
    Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
    are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SUSE Distributions and Workarounds:

    - mc
    By using a special combination of links in archive-files it is possible
    to execute arbitrary commands while mc tries to open it in its VFS.
    The packages are currently tested and will be release as soon as
    possible.

    - mod_gzip
    The apache module mod_gzip is vulnerable to remote code execution
    while running in debug-mode. We do not ship this module in debug-mode
    but future versions will include the fix.
    Additionally the mod_gzip code was audited to fix more possible security
    related bugs.

    - freeradius
    Two vulnerabilities were found in the FreeRADIUS package.
    The remote denial-of-service attack bug was fixed and new packages
    will be released as soon as testing was successfully finished.
    The other bug is a remote buffer overflow in the module rlm_smb.
    We do not ship this module and will fix it for future releases.

    - tripwire
    Tripwire is a file integrity checker. The tripwire version on SuSE Linux
    8.2 and 9.0 do crash when a requested file does not exists.
    New packages will be available soon.

    - cvs
    The cvs server-side can be tricked to create files in the root filesystem
    of the server by requesting malformed modules. The permissions on the
    root filesystem normally prevent this malfunction.
    New packages will be available soon.

    - irssi
    Under special circumstances the the irc-client irssi can be crashed
    remotely by other irc-clients.
    A fix will be available soon.

    - atftp
    A buffer overflow vulnerability discovered by Rick Patel has been
    fixed in the atftpd (trivial file transfer protocol, UDP oriented)
    daemon, contained in the atftp package. Update packages for the
    affected SUSE Linux distributions 8.1 and 8.2 have been published on
    our ftp server today.
    We explicitly thank Dirk Mueller, KDE developer, for notifying SUSE
    Security about the pending treatment of this incident.

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SUSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SUSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@...e.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SUSE in rpm packages for SUSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SUSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@...e.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .
