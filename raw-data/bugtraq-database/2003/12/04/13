Package:             rsync
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= rsync-2.5.6-20030807     >= rsync-2.5.7-20031204
OpenPKG 1.3          <= rsync-2.5.6-1.3.0        >= rsync-2.5.6-1.3.1
OpenPKG 1.2          <= rsync-2.5.5-1.2.0        >= rsync-2.5.5-1.2.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a rsync security advisory [0], a heap overflow
  vulnerability exists in rsync [1] version 2.5.6 and earlier when used
  as a rsync server which typically listens on TCP port 873. An exploit
  is already known. A successful attack can lead to arbitrary code
  execution in the run-time environment of the rsync server process. The
  attack is known to be considerably easier when the "use chroot = no"
  option is set in rsync.conf, which is not the default in OpenPKG. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2003-0962 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  rsync". If you have the "rsync" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary
  RPM [4]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get rsync-2.5.6-1.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig rsync-2.5.6-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild rsync-2.5.6-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/rsync-2.5.6-1.3.1.*.rpm
