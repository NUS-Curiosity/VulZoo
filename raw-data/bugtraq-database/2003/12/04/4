Subject: Re: RE: Yahoo Instant Messenger YAUTO.DLL buffer overflow


Yeah! Yahoo is sux. Yahoo Messenger has tons of bugs.
But you are more sux than yahoo since you stole my
work and posted my found bug to yahoo and bugtraq.
Funny enough when your little company SentryUnion is
trying to sell "Indetify Theft" protection service but
you got owned, stole mail and money from your paypal
account, logged everything your chatted with gf via
one another yahoo messenger 0day. 

Stop leaking and killing my bug kid. Go to school to
learn more.
