Subject: XSS Vulnerabilities in Alan Ward Acart




Vulnerability:	XSS Vulnerabilities in msg

Description:	XSS (Cross Site Scripting) vulnerabilities exist in the msg parameter passed in the URL to many pages.  This can be used to run arbitrary code on the website, or redirect to some other malicious script.  These pages include:
	deliver.asp
	error.asp
	signin.asp
	admin/error.asp
	admin/index.asp

Exploit:	A test script was used to prove this vulnerability
	www.example.com/acart2_0/affected_page.asp?msg= &lt;script&gt;alert("test")&lt;/script&gt;

Solution:	The developer needs to properly sanitize variables passed through the URL to remove possible malicious code.
