Subject: [Hat-Squad] Remote buffer overflow in Mdaemon Raw message Handler




			Hat-Squad Security Team Advisory
			    http://www.hat-squad.com

Product: Alt-N Technologies Mdaemon Mail Server
Version: MDaemon  6.85 and Below to 6.52
Vulnerability: Remote buffer overflow in Raw Message Handler
Release Date: 12/29/2003

Vendor Status: 
Informed on 29 Dec 2003
Quick response on 29 Dec 2003

Overview:

FORM2RAW.exe is a CGI which allows users to send email using MDaemon from a web. It processes the fields of an HTML form and creates a RAW message File in the Raw queue Directory of MDaemon mail server. This file then will be proccessed and qeued for delivery by MDaemon.
According to the Help file "By default, MDaemon 6.52 or higher will not send emails created by Form2Raw unless the email address passed in the 'from' tag (see below) is a valid account on the MDaemon server.If you want to disable this behavior you can set the FromCheck=No in FORM2RAW.INI file".

Problem:

Sending more than 153 bytes  in the "From" field to FROM2Raw.exe creates a Raw File that when proccessed by mdaemon will cause a Stack buffer overflow.The EIP register will be overwritten when From Field length was 249 bytes.
The FORM2RAW.exe is accessible by default from WorlClient Web server listening on Port 3000.

			   strcat(buffer,"c");	//One byte left after ESP :-(
			   strcat(buffer,"&To=me@...l.org&Subject=hi&Body=hello HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n");
			   
			   send(s, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);

Robin Edwards <support@...pdesk.altn.com> Wrote: 

We have had a similar vulnerability report with Form2Raw and hope to release a patch soon.  In the meantime it is easy to disable Form2Raw by following the instructions below:
-----
To disable FORM2RAW open the 
\MDaemon\WorldClient\WorldClient.ini file with Notepad and 
delete the following two lines:

CgiBase2=/Form2Raw.cgi
CgiFile2=C:\MDaemon\CGI\Form2Raw.exe
 
Afterward, restart WorldClient to register the change.
