- --- Update ---
- --------------

This is an update to SGI Security Advisory 20030904-01-P.

The original OpenSSH and OpenSSL packages did not have incremented
version numbers, so it was difficult to determine if a system was
vulnerable or fixed after the packages were installed. (SGI BUG 901671)

IRIX 6.5.20 and above include Kerberos. IRIX 6.5.19 does not have Kerberos,
so there was a conflict with the OpenSSL package. Patches are being
released to address this problem on IRIX 6.5.19. (SGI BUG 901706)

There was an additional OpenSSL ASN.1 vulnerability reported by:
http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2003/006489/openssl2.htm
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0851
which has been fixed by these updated patches. (SGI BUG 904644)


- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It has been reported that OpenSSH/OpenSSL that ships with IRIX has several
security vulnerabilities that may lead to root access on vulnerable systems.

1) buffer.c vulnerability fixed in OpenSSH 3.7 (CAN-2003-0693)
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=106373247528528&w=2
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0693

2) More buffer management vulnerabilities fixed in OpenSSH 3.7.1 (CAN-2003-0695)
    http://www.openssh.com/txt/buffer.adv
    http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-24.html
    http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/333628
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0695

3) Openwall's "memory" security fixes to OpenSSH 3.7.1 (CAN-2003-0682)
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0682

4) ssh-keysign cores dump on IRIX (SGI BUG 899663)

5) Multiple OpenSSL vulnerabilities in ASN.1 parsing
    http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt
    http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2003/006489/openssl.htm
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0543
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0544
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0545

Please note that the OpenSSH which ships with IRIX is NOT vulnerable
to the two recent PAM vulnerabilities found in portable OpenSSH 3.7/3.7.1:
    http://www.openssh.com/txt/sshpam.adv
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0786
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0787

    * However, the Freeware OpenSSH from http://freeware.sgi.com/
    is PAM enabled and possibly vulnerable to these issues.

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures
be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These vulnerabilities have been corrected in future releases of IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

OpenSSH client is installed by default on IRIX 6.5.19 and above.  OpenSSH
server is provided on IRIX 6.5.19 and above, but not installed by default.
OpenSSL libraries are installed by default on IRIX 6.5.19 and above

To determine the version of OpenSSH you are running, execute the
following command:

  % versions -b openssh openssl

This will return a result similar to the following output:

 I = Installed, R = Removed

  Name     Date        Description
I openssh  09/16/2003  OpenSSH server and client tools, 3.6.1p2
I openssl  09/16/2003  openssl libraries, 0.9.7b

If the output is similar to the above, then OpenSSH/OpenSSL are installed
and the system may be vulnerable unless patched.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these vulnerabilities.
SGI recommends upgrading to IRIX 6.5.22 or installing the appropriate
patches.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.22, or install the appropriate
patches.

SGI Freeware team has also provided an updated OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 package
available from http://freeware.sgi.com/Dist/fw_openssh-3.7.1p2.tardist
Freeware is not supported by SGI.
