This means you do not need setuid root because devpts sets up the slave
pty owner and group automatically and you do not need direct access to
utmp/wtmp, e.g. via setgid utmp, because libtempter functions call an
external setgid utmp helper called utempter to modify those files (the
calling process is required to hold a corresponding master pty).
