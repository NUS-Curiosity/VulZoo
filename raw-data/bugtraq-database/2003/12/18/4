GLSA:        200312-07
Package:     net-ftp/lftp
Summary:     Two buffer overflow problems found in lftp
Severity:    minimal
Gentoo bug:  35866
Date:        2003-12-16
CVE:         CAN-2003-0963
Exploit:     remote
Affected:    <=2.6.9
Fixed:       >=2.6.10


DESCRIPTION:

Two buffer overflow problems have been found in lftp, a multithreaded
command-line based FTP client. A specially created directory on a web
server could be used to execute arbitrary code on the connecting machine.
The user's machine has to connect to a malicious web server using HTTP or
HTTPS, then issue an "ls" or "rels" command.

Please see

for more details on this problem.


SOLUTION:

All machines which have net-ftp/lftp installed should be updated to use
version 2.6.10 or higher using these commands:

        emerge sync
        emerge -pv '>=net-ftp/lftp-2.6.10'
        emerge '>=net-ftp/lftp-2.6.10'
        emerge clean
