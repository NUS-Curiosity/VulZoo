  A simple bulk-emailer is much worse than file-sharing network - this way
  a potential virus/trojan may be sent out to tens of millions (and 80%
  will click "run").

  Of course, any tool may be misused... You can buy a knife and kill someone,
  so should we stop selling (any) knives, or require certification or police
  permit (and registration) before selling one? :)
