Subject: Dell BIOS DoS


I agree with your points Jon, but lets be fair here, BIOS passwords do
have a use - especially on laptops.

Although nobody in there right mind would rely on them as the sole
protection for a machine, they are certainly worthwhile both as a
deterrant to the casual snooper and as a delaying tactic to your average
criminal.

At the very least they can buy a couple of hours for the end-user to
contact his/her IT department to block any dial-in accounts and reset
any passwords that may be compromised... assuming they remember to call
you that is ;-)

Cheers

Ross

...and once upon a time the default backdoor dell password was "dell".

seriously, bios passwords are worthless. there are numerous ways to get
around them. most motherboards have a jumper that you can set to reset
your cmos / bios (probably misusing one of those terms) to the factory
defaults. or you can just yank the cmos battery out. for your laptop, it
might be a bit trickier, but you can usually get to the jumpers
underneath the keyboard (at least on my old sager you could).
