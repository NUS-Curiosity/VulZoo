GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200312-05

GLSA:        200312-05
Package:     app-crypt/gnupg
Summary:     GnuPG ElGamal signing keys compromised and
                format string vulnerability
Severity:    minimal
Gentoo bug:  34504, 35639
Date:        2003-12-12
CVE:         CAN-2003-0971, CAN-2003-0978
Exploit:     unknown
Affected:    <=1.2.3-r4
Fixed:       >=1.2.3-r5


DESCRIPTION:

Two flaws have been found in GnuPG 1.2.3.

First, ElGamal signing keys can be compromised. These keys are not
commonly used. Quote from
<http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2003q4/000276.html>:

   "Phong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and
   uses ElGamal keys for signing. This is a significant security
   failure which can lead to a compromise of almost all ElGamal keys
   used for signing. Note that this is a real world vulnerability
   which will reveal your private key within a few seconds."

Second, there is a format string flaw in the 'gpgkeys_hkp' utility
which "would allow a malicious keyserver in the worst case to execute
an arbitrary code on the user's machine." See
<http://www.s-quadra.com/advisories/Adv-20031203.txt> for
details.


SOLUTION:

All users who have created ElGamal signing keys should immediately
revoke them. Then, all Gentoo Linux machines with gnupg installed
should be updated to use gnupg-1.2.3-r5 or higher.

        emerge sync
        emerge -pv '>=app-crypt/gnupg-1.2.3-r5'
        emerge '>=app-crypt/gnupg-1.2.3-r5'
        emerge clean
