This POC code needs nasm greater than 0.98.36, otherwise you get the following 
error when trying to compile it.

exploit@...ble exploit $ nasm -v
NASM version 0.98.36 compiled on Jul 17 2003
exploit@...ble exploit $ nasm brk_poc.asm -o a.out
brk_poc.asm:5: error: attempt to set a negative program origin

It works with 0.98.38.
