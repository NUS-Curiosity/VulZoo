Eugene,

Actually, I agree with you, that should be stronger.  What I think is 
even worse is the case of local heap exploits, where the attacker knows 
with some precision when the process starts.  It seems that this should 
be patched to use some source of randomness such as /dev/random instead 
of time().

Thanks!
