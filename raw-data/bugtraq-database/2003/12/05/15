That is correct, this is a process described in our EULA in Section 1(k) Software Activation and Section 1(l) LiveUpdate. Please see our EULA for details, which is available on our website under this URL: http://www.altova.com/order_license4.html

This is incorrect insofar as the information transmitted is data that has been entered by the user into the Registration dialog (Help menu / Registration). This does include the e-mail address, provided that the user has entered this into the Registration dialog when requesting an evaluation key-code from our license server.

Regarding the collection of e-mail addresses from users of our software, who are requesting an evaluation key-code, please see our strict privacy policy, which is available at this URL: http://www.altova.com/privacy.html

Altova takes privacy and security very seriously, and we believe we have properly disclosed any legitimate anti-piracy measures in our product in the EULA.

Sincerely,

Alexander Falk
