FYI: You can use a customized block page in /custom that does not display
the URL, such as creating a "Sorry, This URL is Blocked" page with your
company's logo. Heck, you can also just edit the "master.html" block page in
the /default dir to remove the URL displayed field.

Dear Mr. P.Taylor,

It  runs  error message in context of blocked site. Now lets try to find
out possible impacts:

1.  It's  possible  to  run  javascript  on  the user host in context of
blocked  site.  But  it's  most  likely  blocked  site is not in list of
trusted  web  sites  on user's host, so it's impossible to get something
different from running same script on another webpage.

2. It possible to steal cookie, submit some forms, etc, on blocked site.
But  site  is  blocked. So, it's impossible to steal something or submit
something to this site.

Conclusion: there is no security impact

Post  Conclusion: Guys, it's perfect you can find all these XSS/CSS bugs
in  John Doe's guest books, Read-Doc-from-CDRom servers, etc. But please
think  about  _security_  impact  before  submitting  this to _security_
related lists.

MPT> Websense Blocked Sites XSS

MPT> Risk: High

MPT> Product URL: http://www.websense.com

MPT> Found By: PeterT - petert@...gine-sw.com

MPT> Problem:
MPT> When Websense blocks a web site, it returns a web page to the browser

MPT> that the site has been blocked. This error message contains the URL
which

MPT> Proof of Concept:
MPT> A URL like

MPT> Resolution:
MPT> The vendor has come out with a patch. Notified on Nov 29, 2003.
