Subject: [iSEC] Linux kernel do_brk() vulnerability details


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

We have released a paper covering technical details of the do_brk() bug
and the results of our research done while writing the exploit code. 
It also describes the numerous techniques we have used to create a very 
effective exploit code that leads to full privilege escalation even on
systems running a kernel secured with various security patches.

It can be found at: http://isec.pl/papers/linux_kernel_do_brk.pdf
