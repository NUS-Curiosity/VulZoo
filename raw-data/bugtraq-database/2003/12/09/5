Internet Explorer URL parsing vulnerability
Vendor Notified 09 December, 2003

# Vulnerability ##########
There is a flaw in the way that Internet Explorer displays URLs in the address bar.

By opening a specially crafted URL an attacker can open a page that appears to be from a different domain from the current location. 

# Exploit ##########
By opening a window using the http://user@...ain nomenclature an attacker can hide the real location of the page by including a 0x01 character after the "@" character.
Internet Explorer doesn't display the rest of the URL making the page appear to be at a different domain.
