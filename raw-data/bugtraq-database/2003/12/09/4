...and once upon a time the default backdoor dell password was "dell".

seriously, bios passwords are worthless. there are numerous ways to get 
around them. most motherboards have a jumper that you can set to reset 
your cmos / bios (probably misusing one of those terms) to the factory 
defaults. or you can just yank the cmos battery out. for your laptop, it 
might be a bit trickier, but you can usually get to the jumpers 
underneath the keyboard (at least on my old sager you could).
