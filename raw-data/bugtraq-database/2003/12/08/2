[Outlook and Notes users, please ensure your Out Of Office messages are
not sent in response to public mail lists. It is annoying. Thank you.]

[Virus Scanner administrators: (a) GPG signatures are not an executable
format; (b) as most virii forge From: and From_ headers, it makes no
sense to rely on either header for error recovery purposes -- please
configure your scanners to discard during the SMTP conversation instead.
Thank you.]

	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	rsync
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7.3, 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0962
Date:			Fri Dec  5 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-73-001-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  The rsync team has alerted us to a remotely exploitable heap overflow
  that is being actively exploited. As the overflow is on the heap,
  StackGuard offers no protection to this vulnerability.

  There are two methods this vulnerability could be exploited; the first
  is through a publicly visible rsync server, typically on TCP port 873.
  The second is through an ssh or rsh connection to the remote host.

  We would like to thank Timo Sirainen, Mike Warfield, Paul Russell,
  Andrea Barisani, Andrew Tridgell, and Martin Pool.
