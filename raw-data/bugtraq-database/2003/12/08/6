Subject: Patchmanagement.org announcement


PatchManagement.org is the industry's first mailing list dedicated to
the discussion of patch management. The PatchManagement mailing list
discusses the how-to's and why's of security patch management across a
broad spectrum of Operating Systems, Applications, and Network Devices.
This list is meant as an aid to network and systems administrators and
security professionals who are responsible for maintaining the security
posture of their hosts and applications. 

Moderators for patchmanagement.org include Tina Bird (Stanford), Jason
Chan (@Stake), Ben Laurie (Apache Foundation), Eric Schultze
(Shavlik), and myself.

The complete text of the group's charter, including its acceptable and
unacceptable usage policies, can be found at
