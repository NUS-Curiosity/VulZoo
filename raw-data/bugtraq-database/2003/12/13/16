Only this is a scenario where we don't have the "original text". If we
had, we could have just ripped out the sequence numbers and skipped
the whole problem.

As long as we don't know anything of the original data we have to
guess the correct checksum.

Still, 1 of 65535 is a lot better than... what is it, 2**64 ?
