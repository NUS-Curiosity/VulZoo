There's also a PSIRT statement regarding this issue, and it's at best
embarrassing for Cisco engineering folks:

I know several people work on XAUTH MITM attacks; I guess it will fall
in a couple of weeks.  (Just sniffing the user password is easy, the
group password is typically public anyway; the remaining challenge
consists of putting together several tools to transparently fake a Cisco
VPN concentrator).
