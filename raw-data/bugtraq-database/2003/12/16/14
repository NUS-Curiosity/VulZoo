Synopsis:          Updated httpd packages fix Apache security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:320-01
Issue date:        2003-12-16
Updated on:        2003-12-16
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Apache httpd ASF
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0542 CAN-2003-0789
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated httpd packages that fix two minor security issues in the Apache Web
server are now available for Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
freely-available Web server.

An issue in the handling of regular expressions from configuration files
was discovered in releases of the Apache HTTP Server version 2.0 prior to
2.0.48.  To exploit this issue an attacker would need to have the ability
to write to Apache configuration files such as .htaccess or httpd.conf.  A
carefully-crafted configuration file can cause an exploitable buffer
overflow and would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the
context of the server (in default configurations as the 'apache' user).
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2003-0542 to this issue.

A bug in the CGI daemon-based "mod_cgid" module was discovered that can
result in CGI script output being sent to the wrong client. This issue only
affects Red Hat Linux 9, and only when the server is configured to use the
"worker" MPM. The default configuration uses the "mod_cgi" module for CGI
and is not affected by this issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0789 to this issue.

Users of the Apache HTTP Server should upgrade to these erratum packages,
which contain backported patches correcting these issues, and are applied
to Apache version 2.0.40.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

After the errata packages are installed, restart the HTTP service by
running (as root) the following command:

/sbin/service httpd restart

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

103744 - slow-running CGI scripts are buffered too much
103049 - httpd hung up reading  /dev/random
105725 - long httpd graceful reload times
106454 - ProxyPass modifies http header removing Content-Length field
106858 - SSL_EXPERIMENTAL is not defined in mod_ssl build
