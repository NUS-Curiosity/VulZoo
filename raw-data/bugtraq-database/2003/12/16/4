Indeed.  However, due to several mitigating factors, this issue doe not 
appear to be exploitable (at least not with any of the techniques I am 
aware of).  The overflow occurs in main() and there is an unavoidable 
exit() at the end of the function.  So while you can overwrite the 
return stack frame, the process will never use your new value.
