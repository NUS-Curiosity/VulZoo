                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated lftp packages fix security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:403-01
Issue date:        2003-12-16
Updated on:        2003-12-16
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0963
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated lftp packages are now available that fix a buffer overflow
security vulnerability.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

lftp is a command-line file transfer program supporting FTP and HTTP
protocols. 

Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar discovered a buffer overflow bug in versions of lftp up to
and including 2.6.9.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted
directory on a website such that, if a user connects to that directory
using the lftp client and subsequently issues a 'ls' or 'rels' command, the
attacker could execute arbitrary code on the users machine.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0963 to this issue.

Users of lftp are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain a backported security patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.

Red Hat would like to thank Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar for discovering and alerting us
to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
