Subject: Remotely Anywhere Message Injection Vulnerability


Remotely Anywhere Message Injection Vulnerability
=================================================

In addition to http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/9120 i found that it is
possible to inject a message into the login page of Remotely Anywhere.
Its not a XSS attack, because there is no directly executed script code,
even if a msg-box pops up containing the injected message
(have a look at http://www.oliverkarow.de/research/ra.jpg for a
screenshot).


Exploiting:
===========

https://host:2000/default.html?logout=asdf&reason=Please%20set%20your%20password%20to%20ABC123%20after%20login
