                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           ethereal
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:114
 Date:                   December 10th, 2003

 Affected versions:	 9.1, 9.2
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A number of vulnerabilities were discovered in ethereal that, if
 exploited, could be used to make ethereal crash or run arbitrary code
 by injecting malicious malformed packets onto the wire or by
 convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
 
 A buffer overflow allows attackers to cause a DoS (Denial of Service)
 and possibly execute arbitrary code using a malformed GTP MSISDN
 string (CAN-2003-0925).
 
 Likewise, a DoS can be caused by using malformed ISAKMP or MEGACO
 packets (CAN-2003-0926).
 
 Finally, a heap-based buffer overflow allows attackers to cause a DoS
 or execute arbitrary code using the SOCKS dissector (CAN-2003-0927).
 
 All three vulnerabilities affect all versions of Ethereal up to and
 including 0.9.15.  This update provides 0.9.16 which corrects all of
 these issues.  Also note that each vulnerability can be exploited by
 a remote attacker.
