Subject: Re: Multiple Vendor SOAP server (XML parser) attribute blowup DoS



Hi Marc,

I presume Sun refers to http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/303509. 
In this case,
the only commonality between the two issues is that they both result 
from a problem in the
underlying XML parser, but the problems in the XML parser are 
fundamentally different.

Thanks,
-Amit

    Hi,

    this seems to be somehow related (at least the Java DoSes) to

    "Large number of entity expansions cause 100 % CPU resulting in DoS
    condition."

    (http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4791146.html)

    This bug is public since 12/2002, and fixed in JDK 1.4.1_03 according
    to Sun.

    Marc
