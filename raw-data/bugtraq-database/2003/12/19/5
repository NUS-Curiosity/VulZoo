Hi, Chris,

This fix is integrated in VPN client releases
3.5.1C and later
3.6(Rel) and later
3.7(Rel) and later
4.0(Rel) and later

The feature is documented at
http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/vpn/client/rel4_0/admin_gd/vcach2.htm#19276
Refer to the .pcf Parameter (Keyword) "VerifyCertDN".

The above URL is also now documented in the Release-note for CSCdw87717 to
make it more convenient to find, by our customers.

Brgds,
/Sharad
