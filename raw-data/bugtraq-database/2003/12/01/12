Subject: Re: Multiple Remote Issues in Applied Watch IDS Suite (advisory attached)

>CVE Candidate: CAN-2003-0970 - Authentication Bypass to Add IDS Rules

These numbers are incorrect.

>  CAN-2003-0960 - Logical error in Applied Watch Console allowing user-adds
>  CAN-2003-0961 - Logical error in Applied Watch Nodes allowing rule-adds

These numbers are different from the first two.  They are also
incorrect.

The proper CVE candidate number for the Applied Watch issue is
CAN-2003-0974, which can be confirmed at:

  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0974

(If you are curious as to why a single identifier was used, see
http://cve.mitre.org/cve/contentdecisions.html for some background
information on CVE content decisions.)


The IDs as referenced in the original advisory are actually related to
the following issues:

  CAN-2003-0960 - OpenCA certificate chain error
  CAN-2003-0961 - Linux kernel do_brk() "bounds checking" flaw
  CAN-2003-0970 - Sun Fire ARP packet DoS
  CAN-2003-0971 - GnuPG ElGamal breakable sign+encrypt keys


These other IDs can also be confirmed on the CVE web site.
