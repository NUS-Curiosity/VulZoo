This is what Sardonix was designed to do. I cannot assure that you will 
get a taker, but I suggest a post to the sardonix mailing list would help.

Hint: subscribe to the list first. The list is configured to moderate 
non-subscriber posts, and I'm killing off about 25 spams a day now, so a 
legit non-subscriber post could get lost in the shuffle.
