Safari will never exit a loop in javascript. Since javascript isn't 
executed in a thread, this cause a DoS (Safari crashes).
Firebird has been tested and is not vulnerable. I don't know about other 
browers on MacOSX, but they are probably not vulnerable. (OmniWeb?)

/As usual, read more for exploit/explanation/

|Adv: safari_0x02
Release Date: 22/11/03
Affected Products: Safari =< 1.1.1
Impact: Denial of Service
Severity: Remote, low

A very simple javascript block like this one:

while (true)
{ document.location "sherlock://com.apple.movies?" }




is enought to lock up Safari, effectivly DoSing it.
Notice that you must call a protocol helper in the loop, here I'm 
calling Sherlock. Otherwise, the loop is aborted and Safari functions 
normally.
There is no fix available yet. Vendor has been informed.
