1. Problem Description

   Multiple vulnerabilities affecting several components of gwxlibs. The issues are:

        Multiple Vulnerability Issues in OpenSSL up to and including 0.9.6j and 0.9.7b

                NISCC/006489/openssl/1 

                        CAN-2003-0543 Integer overflow in OpenSSL 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 may allow 
			remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an SSL client
                        certificate with certain ASN.1 tag values.

                        CAN-2003-0544 OpenSSL 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 does not properly track the number
                        of characters in certain ASN.1 inputs, which mahy allow remote attackers to
                        cause a denial of service (crash) via an SSL client certificate that causes
                        OpenSSL to read past the end of a buffer when the long form is used.

                NISCC/006489/openssl/2 

                        An invalid public key in a certificate will crash the verify code if it is set
                        to ignore all errors. This isnt done in production code just for debugging
                        purposes. Successful exploitation would result in a Denial of Service
                        condition.

                NISCC/006489/openssl/3 

                        CAN-2003-0545 Double-free vulnerability in OpenSSL 0.9.7 may allow remote attackers
                        to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an
                        SSL client certificate with a certain invalid ASN.1 encoding.

                        Certain ASN.1 structures which are rejected as invalid by the parser result in
                        part of the corresponding structure being freed up incorrectly. In theory
                        exploitation of this vulnerability could result in an attacker being able to
                        execute malicious code.

                GNU TLS Library Record Layer Timing Information Leakage Weakness

                        CAN-2003-0131 The SSL and TLS components for OpenSSL 0.9.6i and earlier, 0.9.7,
                        and 0.9.7a may allow remote attackers to perform an unauthorized RSA private key
                        operation via a modified Bleichenbacher attack that uses a large number of SSL
                        or TLS connections using PKCS #1 v1.5 padding that cause OpenSSL to leak
                        information regarding the relationship between ciphertext and the associated
                        plaintext, aka the "Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack."

        Buffer overflow in the gzprintf function in zlib 1.1.4

                CAN-2003-0107 Buffer overflow in the gzprintf function in zlib 1.1.4, when zlib
                is compiled without vsnprintf or when long inputs are truncated using vsnprintf,
                may allow attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.

		Since OpenServer builds of libz use vsnprintf(), only the less serious truncation 
		part of this potential vulnerability applies even when this supplement is not installed.

		This supplement contains zlib 1.1.4 patched with an unofficial patch has been 
		released which implements proper verification of the usability of the vsnprintf() 
		function. No new official zlib version has been released.
