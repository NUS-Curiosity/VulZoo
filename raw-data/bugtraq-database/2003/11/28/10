                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           gnupg
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:109
 Date:                   November 28th, 2003

 Affected versions:	 9.0, 9.1, 9.2, Corporate Server 2.1,
			 Multi Network Firewall 8.2
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A severe vulnerability was discovered in GnuPG by Phong Nguyen
 relating to ElGamal sign+encrypt keys.  From Werner Koch's email
 message:
 
 "Phong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses
 ElGamal keys for signing.  This is a significant security failure
 which can lead to a compromise of almost all ElGamal keys used for
 signing.  Note that this is a real world vulnerability which will
 reveal your private key within a few seconds.
 
 Please *take immediate action and revoke your ElGamal signing keys*.
 Furthermore you should take whatever measures necessary to limit the
 damage done for signed or encrypted documents using that key."
 
 And also:
 
 "Note that the standard keys as generated by GnuPG (DSA and ElGamal
 encryption) as well as RSA keys are NOT vulnerable.  Note also that
 ElGamal signing keys cannot be generated without the use of a special
 flag to enable hidden options and even then overriding a warning
 message about this key type.  See below for details on how to identify
 vulnerable keys."
 
 MandrakeSoft urges any users who use the ElGamal sign+encrypt keys to
 immediately revoke these keys and discontinue use of them.  Updated
 packages are provided that remove the ability to create these keys and
 to create signatures using these keys (thanks to David Shaw for
 writing the patch).
