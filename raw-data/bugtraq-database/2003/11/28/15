Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0044

Package name:      bind
Summary:           negative cache sec. fix
Date:              2003-11-27
Affected versions: TSL 1.2, 1.5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS (Domain
  Name System) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named), which resolves
  host names to IP addresses, and a resolver library (routines for applications
  to use when interfacing with DNS). A DNS server allows clients to name
  resources or objects and share the information with other network machines.
  The named DNS server can be used on workstations as a caching name server,
  but is generally only needed on one machine for an entire network. Note that
  the configuration files for making BIND act as a simple caching nameserver
  are included in the caching-nameserver package.Install the bind package if
  you need a DNS server for your network. If you want bind to act a caching
  name server, you will also need to install the caching-nameserver package.

Problem description:
  According the the bind announcment dated Thu, 27 Nov 2003, the new upstream
  bind 8.3.7 fixes a security problem:
   
    Security Fix: Negative Cache Poison Fix.
