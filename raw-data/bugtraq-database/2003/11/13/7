I disagree. If its a 3rd party app if should not count against the OS
unless every instance of the OS runs that app.

What about apps that run on both windows and linux? When you start
counting 3rd party apps in the equation, you are throwing a horrible
slant into the mix. This is similar to getting a new 3rd party part for
your car then blaming the carmaker when that part fails. Microsoft needs
to include things like apache becasue the make both their OS and the
webserver, so a comaprsion of security flaws broken down by responsible
groups would make Microsoft look horrible.
