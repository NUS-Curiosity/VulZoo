                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated zebra packages fix security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:307-01
Issue date:        2003-11-13
Updated on:        2003-11-13
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          DoS
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0795 CAN-2003-0858
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated zebra packages that close a locally-exploitable and a
remotely-exploitable denial of service vulnerability are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Zebra an open source implementation of TCP/IP routing software.

Jonny Robertson reported that Zebra can be remotely crashed if a Zebra
password has been enabled and a remote attacker can connect to the Zebra
telnet management port.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0795 to this issue.

Herbert Xu reported that Zebra can accept spoofed messages sent on the
kernel netlink interface by other users on the local machine.  This could
lead to a local denial of service attack.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0858 to
this issue.

Users of Zebra should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain
a patch preventing Zebra from crashing when it receives a telnet option
delimiter without any option data, and a patch that checks that netlink
messages actually came from the kernel.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
