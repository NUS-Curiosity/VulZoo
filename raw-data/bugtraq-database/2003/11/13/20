Application: PeopleTools 8.20/8.43 and prior
Environment: Various
Author: Glyn Geoghegan [glyn.geoghegan@...saire.com]

-- Scope --

The aim of this document is to clearly define a vulnerability in the 
PeopleSoft IScript functionality, as supplied by PeopleSoft Ltd. [1], 
that would allow an attacker to perform a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) 
attack.


-- History --

Discovered: 01.07.03 (Glyn Geoghegan)
Vendor notified: 04.07.03 
Document released: 12.11.03


-- Overview --

The PeopleSoft IScript environment allows developers to produce custom 
environments, tailored to an organisations needs. By using a malformed 
URL in an HTTP request to the IScript application, it is possible to 
achieve an XSS attack, potentially giving access to confidential 
information, such as session cookies etc.


-- Analysis --

The IScript interface accepts a number of arguments via HTTP POST/GET 
calls. 

By using a carefully constructed URL, mobile code such as JAVA, can be 
executed within the users context. This style of attack can be used to 
gain access to sensitive information, such as session cookies etc.


-- Recommendations --

PeopleSoft have released details of this and other issues under security 
rollup vulnerability ID 20031112, which is available to registered users 
from the PeopleSoft support site [2].

PeopleSoft recommends that customers address the vulnerability by 
applying the following fixes available on PeopleSoft Customer 
Connection.

   8.42      8.42.14

For those who can not implement the patches promptly, as a mitigating 
strategy a firewall or other HTTP filtering device can be used to block 
queries containing sensitive strings, or as a last resort all access to 
the PeopleSoft application can be disabled in entirety.
