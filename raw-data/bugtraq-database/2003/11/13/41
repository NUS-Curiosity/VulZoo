Subject: RE: Microsoft prepares security assault on Linux


You really need to know someone before you make such comments Jason. I've no reason to believe you have any insight into "the real reason that Microsoft has been nice to" me, beyond your own opinion. Can you honestly believe your *opinion* is the "real reason?"

You certainly have no idea what I do for a living.

"have they ever perceived you as a developer/book author/technical writer/purchasing agent/distributor/business partner/other for-profit commercial entity?"

At one point or another over the past 17 years, I have been all of these in the eyes of various people at MS.

I cast no aspersions on you and certainly didn't expect you to use trash to rebuke an honest alternative opinion.

Shame, I used to make a point of reading your posts.

Cheers,
Russ - NTBugtraq Editor
