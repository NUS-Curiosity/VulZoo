Subject: Corsaire Security Advisory: PeopleSoft Gateway Administration servlet path disclosure issue



-- Corsaire Security Advisory --

Title: PeopleSoft Gateway Administration servlet path disclosure issue
Date: 04.07.03
Application: PeopleTools 8.20/8.43 and prior
Environment: Various
Author: Martin O'Neal [martin.oneal@...saire.com]
Audience: General distribution
Reference: c030704-003


-- Scope --

The aim of this document is to clearly define a vulnerability in the 
PeopleSoft Gateway Administration servlet, as supplied by PeopleSoft 
Ltd. [1], that allows an attacker to disclose the actual path of server 
configuration files.


-- History --

Discovered: 01.07.03 (Martin O'Neal)
Vendor notified: 04.07.03 
Document released: 12.11.03


-- Overview --

The PeopleSoft Gateway Administration servlet provides a web-based 
interface to configure handlers. In the event of an invalid value being 
entered, the actual path of the server side configuration files is 
disclosed in the error response.


-- Analysis --

The gateway.administration servlet is used within the PeopleSoft 
environment to configure handlers. This application accepts a number of 
values via an HTML form. If an invalid value is entered, then the 
servlet responds with an error page that contains the actual path of the 
server side configuration files. 

This path can then be used in conjunction with other potential 
vulnerabilities to attack specific OS and application configuration 
files.


-- Recommendations --

PeopleSoft have released details of this and other issues under security 
rollup vulnerability ID 20031112, which is available to registered users 
from the PeopleSoft support site [2].

PeopleSoft recommends that customers address the vulnerability by 
applying the following fixes available on PeopleSoft Customer 
Connection. 

   Release   Patch
   8.18      8.18.15
   8.19      8.19.12
   8.20      8.20.03 
   8.42      8.42.14 
   8.43      8.43.11

For those who can not implement the patches promptly, as a mitigating 
strategy a firewall or other HTTP filtering device can be used to block 
queries containing sensitive strings, or as a last resort the 
administration functionality of the PeopleSoft Gateway can be disabled 
by restricting access to the servlet itself.


-- CVE --

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CAN-2003-0628 to this issue. This is a candidate for
inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardises
names for security problems.
