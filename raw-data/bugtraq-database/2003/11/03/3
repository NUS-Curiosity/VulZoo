                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated fileutils/coreutils package fix ls vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:309-01
Issue date:        2003-11-03
Updated on:        2003-11-03
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0853 CAN-2003-0854
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated fileutils and coreutils packages that close a potential denial of
service vulnerability are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.1 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The fileutils package contains several basic system utilities. One of
these utilities is the "ls" program, which is used to list information
about files and directories. In Red Hat Linux 9, the ls program is part of
the coreutils package.

Georgi Guninski discovered a memory starvation denial of service
vulnerability in the ls program.  It is possible to make ls allocate a
huge amount of memory by specifying certain command line arguments.  This
vulnerability is remotely exploitable through services like wu-ftpd, which
pass user arguments to ls.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0854 to this issue.

A non-exploitable integer overflow in ls has also been discovered.  It is
possible to make ls crash by specifying certain command line arguments. 
This vulnerability is remotely exploitable through services like wu-ftpd,
which pass user arguments to ls.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0853 to this issue.

This erratum contains new fileutils packages for Red Hat Linux versions
7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0.  It also contains new coreutils packages for Red
Hat Linux 9.  These packages contain backported patches correcting these
vulnerabilities.

The Red Hat Linux 7.2 and 7.3 packages also add support for the
O_DIRECT flag, which controls the use of synchronous I/O on file systems
such as OCFS.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt
