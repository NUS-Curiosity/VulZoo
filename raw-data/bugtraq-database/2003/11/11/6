Yes, fix for this hole was included into 2.0.6 (above in the thread
someone post a piece of code from 2.0.6 wich cover this).
But be carefull phpBB team sometimes update their packages without
changing number. So better if you check your code in
include/usercp_viewprofile.php (there must be the code quoted above).
