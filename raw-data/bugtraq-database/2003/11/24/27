Many (older) recipies for replacing set-uid binaries consisted of:

	mv /usr/bin/buggy /usr/bin/buggy.old
	chmod 0 /usr/bin/buggy.old

so it's certainly possible to work around that problem.

But it can't be denied that hard links to files one doesn't
own pose some interesting challenges; not just in the scope
of quotas but also when it comes to actions users cannot
undo (such as making many links to files belonging to other
users in /tmp)

And you can easily work around it when replacing executables.
