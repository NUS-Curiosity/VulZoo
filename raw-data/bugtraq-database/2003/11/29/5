I had actually posted earlier regarding MAC addresses and the ease of adding
static entries in the ARP table to hit a host on the local LAN (once in),
but it did not seem to make it.

It is refreshing to see you  (the vendor, not you Crispin) use "the
effectiveness and implications" rather than stand by "un-hackable," even
though I know it was the OP's statement, and not the vendors.  Even if
hackable, it looks like a pretty effective layer of security, which may make
attackers look for LHF.    I have accomplished similar security-in-depth
features by requiring IPSec for all IP traffic (certificate based) though
that is of course at the network software layer, and some administrative
issues are introduced by such a configuration.  Interesting stuff, though.
