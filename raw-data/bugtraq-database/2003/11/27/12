I do have a Speedtoucht 510 ADSL Modem, but had never encountered this
"problem" before.
Maybe it is because technology here is less advances than in other countries
and the modem you tried had a newer software, at an early version.
If it is of any relevance, I have not tried on scanning a big IP range (of
course, using nmap or nessus)

cable link.  Using the ADSL modem mentioned above, we found that a standard
NMAP/NESSUS scan of an IP range would force the router to reboot itself
after 20 seconds.   Thinking this was faulty hardware we replaced it with
another brand new Speedtouch...to find the same problem occurred.   Having
talked to Thomson, they simply dismissed it as faulty hardware....but twice?
