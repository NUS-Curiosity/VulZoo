See, this is semi intelligent. any user writeable filesystem, typically
/tmp, /var/tmp, /home and sem-writeable fs's like /var/spool/mail (everyone
forgets the mail spool), mail queues, etc, etc will largely solve this
problem.

That is without a doubt one of the silliest things I have heard.

1) hard links are legitimate, very useful (think chroot)
2) alias'ing a commands... *snicker*. So I copy the ln binary to another
name and execute it (which causes you to make /home, /tmp, etc noexec, to
which the attacker replies with "/lib/ld-linux.so.2 /tmp/my-ln", a losing
battle ultimately.
3) change my shell, unalias the command, etc.

My advice: learn to use the "find" command to look for files and directories
that are writeable by users (either world writeable, writeable by groups the
users belong to, or owned by the user themself) and move those directories
onto seperate partitions. Forgot the silliness of playing with "alias" and
whatnot.
