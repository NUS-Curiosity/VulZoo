Actually, security is in fact an 'add-on' a 'shim', which makes all in the
info-sec realm akin to remodelers.  Had TCP/IP a prime focus upon
security this might be a different matter as you suggest, but, such is/was
not the case.  And since most programs and the processes that brought them
into being by their creators do not put security at the forefront of the
design/programming process, applications tend to mimick the TCP/IP model.

So, we remodel, shim and retrofit <smile>.

The carpentry of IT...

OK, so you're a Ph.D.  Just don't touch anything.
