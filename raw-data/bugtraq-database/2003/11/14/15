And 802.11b is supposed to only be a few hundred meters, but that
hasn't stopped people from accessing across 50 kilometers!

And 16 kilometers with omnidirectional antennas!

Thus although bluetooth's range is supposed to be 10 meters, for
purposes of attack envelope, it should probably be considered 100
meters or more.
