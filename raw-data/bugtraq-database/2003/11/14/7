No, you didn't misread - The T610, whilst still vulnerable to some 
attacks, does provide more protection
of OBEX profiles. In this respect, it's better than the other phones / 
devices we've tested.

On the particular T610 that was tested, we found that whilst it was 
possible to upload files to the phone we could not download files from it.
