HEX has submitted incorrect information on Web Wiz Forums (again!!!).

The values of the variables mentioned by HEX are filtered further on in the code. 

The file register_new_user.asp is not a file that exsits in Web Wiz Forums version 7.01 or above.

The only variable that was not filtered correctly was the Location field which is populated by a drop down box.

Form March 2003 the location variable was changed to filter the location field.

This does not effect versions of Web Wiz Forums from 7.5 and above.
