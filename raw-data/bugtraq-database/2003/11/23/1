Subject: Infinite JavaScript Loop


i changed the topic, although it's a problem already
described by kang [1]. but i think it's not only Safari
to blame. maybe it was already discussed somewhere and
i simply dont know, so sorry if i bore you.

i could only test macos browsers. so would be nice to
hear about others.

tested browsers:
MacOS X: Safari, OmniWeb, Mozilla, Camino, iCab, Explorer
MacOS 8/9: Mozilla, Explorer

the difference to kangs idea is simply to make something
work in javascript and loop it infinite. the output is only
to see how often the loop happens before the browser break up.

<script language=JavaScript>
var i = 0;
while (1)
{
i++;
document.write('<p>'+ i + ': yes</p>');
}
</script>
