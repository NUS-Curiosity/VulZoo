I retested the T610 and got the following,

Service Name: Dial-up Networking

    Channel: 3
State: Closed.

Service Name: Serial Port 1
    Channel: 4

Service Name: Serial Port 2

Service Name: OBEX File Transfer
    Channel: 7
State: Closed.

The firmware version is: R1L013

It appears that this firmware version is not vulnerable. A quick google
shows that it may be due to other problems in the firmware.
