Subject:		OpenLinux: Webmin/Usermin Session ID Spoofing Vulnerability
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-035.0
Issue date: 		2003 November 17
Cross reference:	sr882687 fz528142 erg712377 CAN-2003-0101

1. Problem Description

	Webmin is a web-based system administration tool for Unix. Usermin
	is a web interface that allows all users on a Unix system to
	easily receive mails and to perform SSH and mail forwarding
	configuration. 

	Internal communication between the parent process and the child 
	process using named pipes occur in these software packages during 
	creation or verification of a session ID, or during the setting 
	process of password timeouts. Because the control characters 
	contained in the data passed as authentication information are 
	not eliminated, it is possible to make Webmin and Usermin to 
	acknowledge the combination of any user and session ID specified 
	by an attacker. If the attacker could log into Webmin by using this 
	problem, there is a possibility that arbitrary commands may be 
	executed with root privileges. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has
        assigned the name CAN-2003-0101 to this issue. This is a
        candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org),
        which standardizes names for security problems.

	CAN-2003-0101 miniserv.pl in Webmin before 1.070 and Usermin before 
	1.000 does not properly handle metacharacters such as line feeds and 
	carriage returns (CRLF) in Base-64 encoded strings during Basic 
	authentication, which allows remote attackers to spoof a session ID 
	and gain root privileges.


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Package
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	OpenLinux 3.1.1 Server		prior to webmin-0.89-12.i386.rpm
	OpenLinux 3.1.1 Workstation	prior to webmin-0.89-12.i386.rpm


3. Solution

	The proper solution is to install the latest packages. Many
	customers find it easier to use the Caldera System Updater, called
	cupdate (or kcupdate under the KDE environment), to update these
	packages rather than downloading and installing them by hand.
