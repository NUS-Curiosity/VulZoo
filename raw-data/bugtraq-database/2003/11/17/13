			SCO Security Advisory

Subject:		OpenLinux: Key validity bug in GnuPG 1.2.1 and earlier
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-034.0
Issue date: 		2003 November 17
Cross reference:	sr883602 fz528211 erg712405 CAN-2003-0255
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	As part of the development of GnuPG 1.2.2, a bug was
	discovered in the key validation code. This bug causes keys
	with more than one user ID to give all user IDs on the key
	the amount of validity given to the most-valid key.

	CAN-2003-0255 The key validation code in GnuPG before 1.2.2
	does not properly determine the validity of keys with
	multiple user IDs and assigns the greatest validity of the
	most valid user ID, which prevents GnuPG from warning the
	encrypting user when a user ID does not have a trusted path.

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has
	assigned the name CAN-2003-0255 to this issue. This is a
	candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org),
	which standardizes names for security problems.


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Package
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	OpenLinux 3.1.1 Server		prior to gnupg-1.2.2-1.i386.rpm
	OpenLinux 3.1.1 Workstation	prior to gnupg-1.2.2-1.i386.rpm


3. Solution

	The proper solution is to install the latest packages. Many
	customers find it easier to use the Caldera System Updater, called
	cupdate (or kcupdate under the KDE environment), to update these
	packages rather than downloading and installing them by hand.
