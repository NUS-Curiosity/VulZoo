Subject: Re: [Full-Disclosure] Microsoft prepares security assault on Linux


I wrote an information security book last year under contract with 
Microsoft Press. The book was never published -- among other things it 
explains truthfully the poor security condition of Windows and offers 
detailed instructions and advice for defending against Microsoft's bad 
business practices and incorrect security decisions. URLs for the free 
electronic book are:

The security awareness for Windows communicated by my book would have 
enabled people to avoid intrusions, infections, damage, and down time 
from MS Blaster, SQL Slammer/Sapphire, and many of this year's other 
threats. It would also have helped to educate developers of Web 
applications so that fewer new vulnerabilities would have been created.

A few of the specific warnings provided by my book include:

* FrontPage Server Extensions are badly flawed from a security 
perspective and should never be used.

* Ports open by default (RPC/DCOM/SMB/Messenger/Workstation Service/etc) 
will be found to expose remote exploitable buffer overflow 
vulnerabilities and therefore must be protected and closed at all costs.

* Don't use/rely on Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer because it 
intentionally ignores known vulnerabilities in order to more often 
report a happy "you're all patched" message to the admin.

* Internet Information Services cannot be trusted out of the box but 
instead must be carefully security hardened beyond anything that 
Microsoft normally recommends, and many IIS features must be disabled in 
order to achieve a trustworthy subset of Microsoft software.

* ... more ...

If Microsoft intends to launch a PR/advertising campaign against Linux, 
perhaps it would take a moment out of its busy schedule to explain why 
it won't publish a book that tells the truth and provides warnings in 
advance that the only way to safely operate a Windows computer is to 
subscribe to infosec mailing lists such as bugtraq and full-disclosure 
in order to remain constantly aware of the real-world condition and 
capabilities of attackers?

Microsoft suppresses awareness of vulnerabilities in order to profit.

The only way to achieve security in computing is through awareness.

Therefore, Microsoft's profits cause additional insecurity. Go figure.
