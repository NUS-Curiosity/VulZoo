i guess the main argument against this joke is that an operating
system with 10 different web servers, 10 different mail servers, 10
different ftp servers, 20 different window managers, 10 different
browsers, 20 different mail clients, and so on, and so on, will have
how many more bugs than a monolithic approach with 1 web server,
1 mail server, 1 ftp server, etc...

the numbers are not exact, but i guess this fact is what microsoft
will exploit. what really counts is numbers on deployed servers, not
bugs in software that very few use...
