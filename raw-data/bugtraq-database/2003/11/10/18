If you're using a Windows 2000 or higher network (servers and
workstations), you can use Group Policy (Edit your local IE settings as
you want them to be for all users, then Create / edit a policy, go to
User Configuration/Windows Settings/Internet Explorer
Maintenance/Security, click "Import the current security zones and
privacy settings", and then you can edit from there.

IF you follow this method, I STRONGLY suggest you use a single station
for all GPO updates in your network - there's a small problem with
service packs potentially causing all GPO settings to be lost due to
date-checking of GPO modules.

The other option that I'm aware of is a product called ScriptLogic
(again, only MS-network aware, but I'm willing to bet a good Netware
admin can get it to run for all user's logon script with little
prodding) which runs on NT4 and higher networks, which will allow you to
set a host of registry settings at logon.  www.scriptlogic.com

If you're a programmer, use the registry settings Thor just emailed.
