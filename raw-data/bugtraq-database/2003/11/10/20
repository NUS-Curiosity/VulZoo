Are you sure about that? It's arguable that it's the outcome of the 
action that is more important than the content or value of the action 
itself (i.e. By action or admission of action allow an offence to be 
committed).

If I have backdoored a system, and I can have the system reject good 
input (i.e. the sysadmin issuing a command to remove the backdoor), then 
the system has continued to remain insecure as a result of rejecting 
good input.

That may be a contrived example, but this is a topic that bears being 
pedantic ;) so if a principle isn't true in all cases it isn't true at all.
