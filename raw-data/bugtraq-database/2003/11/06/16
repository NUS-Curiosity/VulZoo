But isn't this crossing of security boundaries essentially caused by the 
same mental error that buffer overflows are caused by?  Trusting 
untrustable input is at the foundation of each, isn't it?

If you create a boundary that says, "This is private space.  Only trusted 
data can enter.", yet you decide that, for whatever supposedly legitimate 
reason you want to allow input from some other space, isn't it incumbent 
upon you as the programmer to disallow all but "proper" input?

It appears to me that this chaining of weaknesses is nothing more than an 
extension of the same problem that each weakness has individually, i.e. the 
failure of the programmer to do "bounds" checking.  Granted, it's more 
complex to figure out how to exploit the weaknesses, but the reason the 
exploit is possible is because of the same naive trust that fails us every 
time.

We need a paradigm shift in programming from "allow all but the known bad" 
to "disallow all but the known good", don't we?
