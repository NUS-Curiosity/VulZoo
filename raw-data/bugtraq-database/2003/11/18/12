um, that's the wrong errata entry.  For 3.4 -

006: SECURITY FIX: November 17, 2003
  It may be possible for a local user to overrun the stack in 
compat_ibcs2(8).
  ProPolice catches this, turning a potential privilege escalation into 
a denial of service. iBCS2 emulation does not need to be enabled via 
sysctl(8) for this to happen.
  A source code patch exists which remedies the problem.
