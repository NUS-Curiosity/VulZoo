  I've never seen it do that, in the about 50 or so instances
I've encountered.  Does it only do it occasionally?  Does it
attack the same host against which 135/tcp failed, or some
random third party?
  (Does it, perhaps, distinguish between 135/tcp "failed to 
connect" and 135/tcp "connected, but target was patched and
so could not be infected"?)
