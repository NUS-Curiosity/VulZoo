Subject: RE: Six Step IE Remote Compromise Cache Attack


I see this more as a method to bring attention to the fact that even
though the individual flaws seem trivial, they can be combined to
perform a malicious act.

Vendors often do not act on an individual flaw as quickly if they feel
the exploit is trivial. This however shows that the individual flaws
pose a greater risk when combined, and that a 'trivial' flaw shouldn't
be ignored simply because it seems 'harmless'.

Why have these flaws not been patched even after almost two years of
knowing that they exist?
