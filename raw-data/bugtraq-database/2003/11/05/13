There has already been several proof-of-concepts for each and every
vulnerability that was used to produce this exploit, and Microsoft are
patching those vulnerabilities. We already know and have demonstrated
that they can be abused, this exploit is just a refinement of those
POC's to ease exploitation - hence my concern.
