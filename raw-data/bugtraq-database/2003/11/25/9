CERT Summary CS-2003-04

   November 24, 2003

   Each  quarter, the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) issues the CERT
   Summary  to  draw  attention  to  the types of attacks reported to our
   incident  response  team,  as  well  as  other noteworthy incident and
   vulnerability information. The summary includes pointers to sources of
   information for dealing with the problems.

   Past CERT summaries are available from:

   ______________________________________________________________________

Recent Activity

   Since  the  last regularly scheduled CERT summary, issued in September
   2003 (CS-2003-03), we have documented vulnerabilities in the Microsoft
   Windows Workstation Service, RPCSS Service, and Exchange. We have also
   documented  vulnerabilities  in  various  SSL/TLS  implementations,  a
   buffer overflow in Sendmail, and a buffer management error in OpenSSH.
   We  have  received  reports  of  W32/Swen.A,  W32/Mimail variants, and
   exploitation  of an Internet Explorer vulnerability reported in August
   of 2003.

   For  more  current  information  on  activity  being  reported  to the
   CERT/CC,  please  visit the CERT/CC Current Activity page. The Current
   Activity  page  is  a  regularly updated summary of the most frequent,
   high-impact  types  of  security  incidents  and vulnerabilities being
   reported  to the CERT/CC. The information on the Current Activity page
   is reviewed and updated as reporting trends change.

    1. W32/Mimail Variants

       The  CERT/CC  has  received reports of several new variants of the
       'Mimail'  worm. The most recent variant of the worm (W32/Mimail.J)
       arrives  as  an  email  message  alleging  to  be  from the Paypal
       financial   service.  The  message  requests  that  the  recipient
       'verify'  their  account  information to prevent the suspension of
       their  Paypal account. Attached to the email is an executable file
       which  captures  this  information (if entered), and sends it to a
       number of email addresses.

       Multiple  vulnerabilities  exist in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
       and  Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols allowing an attacker
       to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.

    5. Exploitation of Internet Explorer Vulnerability

       The CERT/CC received a number of reports indicating that attackers
       were   actively   exploiting   the   Microsoft  Internet  Explorer
       vulnerability  described  in  VU#865940. These attacks include the
       installation  of tools for launching distributed denial-of-service
       (DDoS)   attacks,   providing   generic  proxy  services,  reading
       sensitive  information  from  the  Windows  registry,  and using a
       victim   system's  modem  to  dial  pay-per-minute  services.  The
       vulnerability  described in VU#865940 exists due to an interaction
       between  IE's  MIME  type  processing  and the way it handles HTML
       application (HTA) files embedded in OBJECT tags.

                CERT Advisory IN-2003-04
		Exploitation of Internet Explorer Vulnerability
                http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-2003-04.html

    6. W32/Swen.A Worm

       On  September  19,  the  CERT/CC began receiving a large volume of
       reports  of  a  mass  mailing  worm,  referred  to  as W32/Swen.A,
       spreading on the Internet. Similar to W32/Gibe.B in function, this
       worm  arrives as an attachment claiming to be a Microsoft Internet
       Explorer  Update  or  a  delivery  failure  notice from qmail. The
       W32/Swen.A  worm  requires a user to execute the attachment either
       manually or by using an email client that will open the attachment
       automatically.  Upon  opening the attachment, the worm attempts to
       mail  itself  to  all  email addresses it finds on the system. The
       CERT/CC  updated  the  current  activity  page  to contain further
       information on this worm.

    7. Buffer Overflow in Sendmail

       Sendmail,  a widely deployed mail transfer agent (MTA), contains a
       vulnerability  that  could  allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
       code with the privileges of the sendmail daemon, typically root.

       function in versions of OpenSSH prior to 3.7.1. This vulnerability
       could enable an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.
