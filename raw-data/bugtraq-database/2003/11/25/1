Subject: Eudora 6.0.1 LaunchProtect


Eudora 6.0.1 (on Windows) has LaunchProtect, to warn the user before
running executable attachments. However this only works in the attach
folder; using spoofed attachments, executables stored elsewhere may run
without warning. In some setups, even executables in the attach folder
may run without warning.

Harmless demo below.

Cheers,
