Subject: Cache Disclosure Leads to MYCOMPUTER Zone and Remote Compromise




Cache Disclosure Leads to MYCOMPUTER Zone and Remote Compromise

[tested]
OS:WinXp, CN version
Microsoft Internet Explorer v6.Sp1; up-to-date on 2003/11/16

[overview]
By combining cache file disclosure and several other unpatched vulnerabilties, an malicious INTERNET page can reach MYCOMPUTER zone. The demo uses Adodb.Stream to launch a remote compromise attack.

[demo]
There are two harmless demos:
Online demo, powered by ASP:
http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/LocalZoneInCache/LocalZoneInCache-Demo/index.html
(runs harmless demonstration executable)

[technical details]
First, place an HTML file in IE cache directory and get its location.

Second, this HTML file can be parsed as an HTML page and treated as in MYCOMPUTER security zone.

At last, Overwrite NOTEPAD.EXE and make IE launch it by openning a view-source protocol URL:
(HTTP-EQUIV of MALWARE 's http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/343521)

[Workaround]
Disable Active Scripting in INTERNET zone, so HTML page opened in the cache can't send information back to the attacker.

[Employment]
I would like to work professionally as a security researcher/bug finder. 

See my resume at my site. I am very eager to work, flexible, and 
extremely productive. I have a top notch resume, with credentials 
from leading bug finders. I am willing to work per contract, relocate, 
or telecommute. 
 
[Give a Hand]
I haven't got a job as a security researcher yet and my family don't support my security work - so, I don't have a computer of my own. Please consider about donating at:
