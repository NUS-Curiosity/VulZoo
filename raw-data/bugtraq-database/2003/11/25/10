BackToFramedJpu - a successor of BackToJpu attack

[tested]
OS:Win2k3,CN version
IE: with MS03-048 installed.

OS:WinXp, CN version
Microsoft Internet Explorer v6.Sp1; up-to-date on 2003/11/16

[overview]
A cross-zone scripting vulnerability has been found in Internet Explorer. If a webpage contains some subframe(either FRAME tag or IFRAME tag), its security zone may be compromised.

[demo]
There is a harmless demo:
http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/BackToFramedJpu/BackToFramedJpu-MyPage.htm

[technical details]
After applying MS03-048 patch, no javascript-protocol URL won't be stored in URL history list any more, which means classical "javascript-protocol URL in history" attack doesn't work any more.
(Liu Die Yu's http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/BackMyParent2/index.html)

However, if an attacker do the following things:
Navigate a sub-frame in victim document to a javascript-protocol URL, 
(first, navigate sub-frame to attacker's page, and then navigate the sub-frame a javascript-protocol URL)
and then navigate the top window away,
At last,navigate back("history.back()").

the javascript-protocol URL will be loaded by the top window(victim document) and script in the javascript-protocol URL will be executed in the security zone of victim document - a.k.a cross-site/zone/domain scripting

[Workaround]
Disable Active Scripting in INTERNET zone.

A wise man learns from other's mistakes; a fool learns from his own.

[Employment]
I would like to work professionally as a security researcher/bug finder. 

See my resume at my site. I am very eager to work, flexible, and 
extremely productive. I have a top notch resume, with credentials 
from leading bug finders. I am willing to work per contract, relocate, 
or telecommute. 
 
[Give a Hand]
I haven't got a job as a security researcher yet and my family don't support my security work - so, I don't have a computer of my own. Please consider about donating at:
