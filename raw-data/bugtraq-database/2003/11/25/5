I think that it has been noticed, however patches are difficult as these 
features are tied to the design of the system. So allow me to put forth a 
general question: what collaborative multiuser (shared-namespace) systems 
have people worked with that didn't suffer from this problem? I'm more 
interested in real systems used in a production environment, not just some 
toy OS's that never got out of the lab.
