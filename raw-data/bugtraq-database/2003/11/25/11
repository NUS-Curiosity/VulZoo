IE Remote Compromise by Getting Cache Location

[tested]
OS:WinXp, CN version
Microsoft Internet Explorer v6.Sp1; up-to-date on 2003/11/16

[overview]
With the help of LocalZoneInCache(refer to "[technical details]" part), an attacker can compromise a user's system even though the user has:
1. Customized IE cache directory,
2. Applied MS03-048 patch,
3. Set killbit for ADODB.STREAM ActiveX.

[demo]
online demo, powered by ASP:
http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/execdror6/execdror6-Demo/index.html
(runs harmless demonstration executable)

[technical details]
execdror6 is derived from execdror5.
(Liu Die Yu's http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/execdror5/) 
execdror6 differs from execdror5 in that:
1st, execdror6 uses LocalZoneInCache to reach MYCOMPUTER security zone.
(Liu Die Yu's http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/LocalZoneInCache/index.html)
2nd, execdror6 gets IE cache directory directly from location.href.
(LocalZoneInCache makes attaker's HTML page opened in cache directory.)

[Workaround]
Disable Active Scripting in INTERNET zone, so HTML page opened in the cache can't send information back to the attacker.

[Employment]
I would like to work professionally as a security researcher/bug finder. 

See my resume at my site. I am very eager to work, flexible, and 
extremely productive. I have a top notch resume, with credentials 
from leading bug finders. I am willing to work per contract, relocate, 
or telecommute. 
 
[Give a Hand]
I haven't got a job as a security researcher yet and my family don't support my security work - so, I don't have a computer of my own. Please consider about donating at:
