	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	fileutils
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0853 CAN-2003-0854
Date:			Fri Oct 31 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-026-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>

Description:
  Georgi Guninski has discovered an off-by-one error in ls(1)'s columns
  handling code. This provided a providential opportunity to handle the
  exponential memory usage involved in the columnar display; thus, we
  have included a patch from Solar Designer to limit the number of
  columns to 1024, reducing the chance of memory exhaustion and working
  around the off-by-one vulnerability.

  ls(1) is exposed through wu-ftpd, potentially to unauthenticated users.
  If your setup is a chroot wu-ftpd, please replace the copy of ls in
  the chroot with this copy.

  This patch fixes CAN-2003-0853 and CAN-2003-0854. Many thanks to
  Georgi Guninski and Solar Designer for spotting the problem and
  providing the solution.
