I've been making a few tests using WebAdmin 2.0.3 running under IIS (WebAdmin.dll)

On my tests, I haven't been able to exploit this issue beyond the scope of a Denial of Service. The Active Server Pages 
service just reboots itself and two entries are added to the event log:

Application Log:

System Log:

Event Category:	None
Event ID:	37
Date:		24/06/2003
