1. Topic:

XFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System providing the
core graphical user interface and video drivers.

Updated XFree86 packages for Red Hat Linux 7.3 are now available which
include several security fixes, bug fixes, enhancements, and driver updates.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

Security fixes:

- - Xterm, provides an escape sequence for reporting the current window
title. This escape sequence takes the current title and places it directly
on the command line. An attacker can craft an escape sequence that sets the
victim's Xterm window title to an arbitrary command, and then reports it to
the command line. Since it is not possible to embed a carriage return into
the window title, the attacker would then have to convince the victim to
press Enter for the shell to process the title as a command, although the
attacker could craft other escape sequences that might convince the victim
to do so. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2003-0063 to this issue.

- - It is possible to lock up versions of Xterm by sending an invalid DEC
UDK escape sequence. (CAN-2003-0071)

- - XFree86 4.2.1 also contains an updated fix for CAN-2002-0164, a
vulnerability in the MIT-SHM extension of the X server that allows local
users to read and write arbitrary shared memory. The original fix did not
cover the case where the X server is started from xdm.

- - The X server was setting the /dev/dri directory permissions incorrectly,
which resulted in the directory being world writable. (CAN-2001-1409)

Driver updates and additions:

- - Savage driver updated to Tim Roberts' latest version 1.1.27t

- - New "cyrix" driver which works better on MediaGX hardware.

- - New input drivers for Fujitsu Stylistic (fpit), Palmax   
  PD1000/PD1100 Input driver (palmax), Union Reality UR-98 head tracker   
  (ur98)

- - Backported apm driver, DPMS support enhancements, and a few accel fixes

- - Backported chips driver, with hardware mouse cursor and 2D acceleration 
  fixes

- - Backported cirrus, i740, siliconmotion, and ark drivers

Various bug fixes and enhancements:

- - Stability improvements to RENDER extension and libraries

- - Various fixes to the Xaw library

- - Fix a long standing problem in the X server where the mouse, keyboard, or  
  video would hang, or the server to go into an endless loop whenever the  
  system time was changed backwards

- - Fix a crash in the Radeon and Rage 128 drivers using VMware with DGA 
  when DRI is enabled

- - Work around some multihead and RENDER exention problems in the Matrox 
  "mga" driver

- - fc-cache is now run upon font package installation in all font
  directories containing fonts managed by fontconfig/Xft

- - mkfontdir now forces the permissions of the files it generates to be mode 
  0644 to ensure they are world readable independant of umask

- - A new option "ForceLegacyCRT" to the radeon driver allows use 
  of legacy VGA monitors which can not be detected automatically.  This 
  option is only safe to use in single-head setups and may cause serious 
  problems if used with dual-head.

- - xterm session management is now enabled by default, whereas the stock
  XFree86 default in 4.2.0/4.2.1 was accidentally disabled upstream

- - Removed and obsoleted the XFree86-xtrap-clients package, now merged
  into the main XFree86 package

- - Added support for previously unsupported ATI Rage 128 video hardware

- - Fixed Polish euro support

- - Added neomagic Xvideo support which may work for some users

- - Added fix for deadkey-quotedbl in ISO8859-15

- - Disabled debug messages in Cirrus Logic driver

- - Fixed a bug in the VESA driver, where the X server would crash with
  an FPE when the DisplaySize option was used

- - Fix to ATI Mach64 support which was out of PCI specs causing problems  
  on some Dell and IBM servers

- - Fix a problem which caused certain combinations of Radeon and Rage 128
  hardware and particular motherboards to hang, due to bus mastering
  getting disabled when VT switching.

There are various other fixes included which users can review by examining
the RPM package changelog of any of the new XFree86 packages.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated XFree86 4.2.1 packages, which
are not vulnerable to the previously mentioned security issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
