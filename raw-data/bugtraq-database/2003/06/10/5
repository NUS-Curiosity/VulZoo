According to mattmurphy@...rr.com:

> Workarounds
[...]

While those workarounds are ok in principle, it should be noted
that this bug (CAN-2003-0245) has been fixed in Apache 2.0.46
published about two weeks ago.

Instead of applying any workaround an update to the latest
Apache version is recommended.
