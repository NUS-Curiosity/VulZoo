Subject: Symantec NAV 7.6 CE Major Fault




Symantec NAV 7.6 Corporate Edition has a MAJOR fault when running on XP. 
It simply will NOT scan floppies on the fly (even with the most 
restrictive settings enabled) This is a bug that has been confirmed by 
Symantec (after 3 months of sitting on their bum doing absolutely NOTHING 
about it) 

I still haven't seen a solution - other than dumping the product yet.

Below are snippets from actual Symantec tech support e-mails.

"With 7.61 on the XP Pro machine (your Vectra) we did not catch the virus 
at the floppy, however we did catch it when we burned it to CD. 

I tested with 7.61 build 45 on XP PRO.. not your machine.. we did not 
catch the virus at the floppy. 
I tested the 8.01 on a machine that wasn't yours as well and it worked as 
designed. 

I am thinking at this point there could be a couple of things happening. 
1)XP PRO does something between NAV 7.6x and the floppy 
2) XP PRO does something to Nav 7.6x "

I think they should advertise this widely but.....
