============================ Description ============================

DoS caused by buffer overflow abend running special script against 
login.

For security reasons, NCPIP.NLM and JSTCP.NLM were renamed to 
NCPIP.OLD and JSTCP.OLD. NCPIP.NLM should never be loaded on a 
PUBLIC interface unless port 524 is blocked by a firewall, even 
if using the NCP exclude options. JSTCP.NLM posted a listener on 
port 6901 that is not needed by iChain. 

User could access a restricted/secure page without authenticating.

Numerous other updates are included in this field patch.  See the 
Technical Information Document (TID) for further details.

============================== Impact ===============================
