Subject: [RHSA-2003:070-01] Updated hanterm packages provide security fixes


---------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated hanterm packages provide security fixes
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:070-01
Issue date:        2003-06-06
Updated on:        2003-06-06
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          hanterm-xf
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0077 CAN-2003-0079
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated hanterm packages fix two security issues.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

Hangul Terminal is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, based on Xterm.

Hangul Terminal provides an escape sequence for reporting the current
window title, which essentially takes the current title and places it
directly on the command line.  An attacker can craft an escape sequence
that sets the window title of a victim using Hangul Terminal to an
arbitrary command and then report it to the command line.   Since it is not
possible to embed a carriage return into the window title the attacker
would then have to convince the victim to press Enter for it to process the
title as a command, although the attacker could craft other escape
sequences that might convince the victim to do so.

In addition, it is possible to lock up Hangul Terminal before version 2.0.5
by sending an invalid DEC UDK escape sequence.  

Users are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain
Hangul Terminal version 2.0.5 with a backported security patch.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
