	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	wget
Affected products:	ImmunixOS 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2002-1344
Date:			Tue Jun  3 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-011-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@...unix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Steven M. Christey has discovered wget did not perform sufficient
  input sanitization of ftp server responses; this could allow a
  malicious ftp server to overwrite files through wget, if the wget
  process permissions allow the file overwriting.

  Stefano Zacchiroli has found a buffer overrun that can make wget
  segfault on long URLs. We do not know if this is remotely exploitable.
