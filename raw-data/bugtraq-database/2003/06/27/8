Subject: Development Impacts of Security Changes in Windows Server 2003


During the development of Windows Server 2003 we spent a great deal of
time reducing the default installation attack surface. The changes we
made may have an impact on software you develop for the product. A new
article, "Development Impacts of Security Changes in Windows Server
2003" outlines some of the changes.
