Subject: Re: Etherleak information leak in Windows Server 2003 drivers


Chris,

The original Etherleak paper which was written by myself and Josh  
Anderson specifically states that:

"The Ethernet standards impose strict limitations on the size of  
encapsulated packets,
requiring small packets to be padded up to a minimum size. Many device  
drivers
responsible for Ethernet frame generation incorrectly handle the  
padding of small
packets. They use data from the end of the frame manipulation buffer  
without initializing
it to zero as required by the RFCs. The location of the buffer  
containing the frame
determines the contents of the padding bytes."

Sure, the examples were given with ICMP echo requests and replies, but  
this does not implicate that it is restricted to these type of packets  
only. Further more, in another email we have sent to bugtraq shortly  
after  
(http://www.sys-security.com/archive/papers/ 
More_information_regarding_Etherleak.txt) we specifically stated that:

"You need to send packets which are less than 46 data bytes long (the  
minimum
packet size) to examine if you experience this vulnerability with your  
Ethernet
card and device driver. Any packet less than 46 data bytes long would  
do the
trick..."

The nice thing about your advisory is that Microsoft now digitally  
signs the device drivers.

Sincerely yours,
