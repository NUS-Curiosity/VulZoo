Subject: [ANNOUNCE]: ScanADS 1.0


============== ScanADS ==============
Type: Command-Line executable
Open Source: Yes
License: BSD

Description
--------------
We are proud to present a tool to scan Alternate Data Streams (ADS) on local
and remote systems.

Scans Alternate Data Streams (ADS) in a local/remote system. Files and
directories can have several kinds of ADS, some of which are not visible by
normal means. These types of streams are not detectable by the "traditional"
dir command and its space (bytes occupied) are not reflected in disk space
usage reports.

Features
-----------
Reports files/directories containing ADS
Reports ADS name
Reports ADS size (bytes)

ScanADS can be downloaded from http://www.kodeit.org/utils/scanads.htm

Cheers,
Tiago Halm
