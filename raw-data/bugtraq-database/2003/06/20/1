SurfControl Web Filter for Microsoft ISA Server Vulnerability


Package:		SurfControl Web Filter for Microsoft ISA
Vendor Web Site:	http://www.surfcontrol.com
Version: 		4.2.0.21
Platforms: 		Windows 2000 Server		
Local:			No
Remote: 		Yes
Fix Available:		No (recommended steps listed below)
Vendor Contacted: 	Sunday, June 08, 2003 
Advisory Author:	Thomas Adams (tgadams@...lsouth.net)



Background:
SurfControl Web Filter is a url filtering system, designed to be easily 
deployed onto most networks. SurfControl for Microsoft ISA is a plugin 
the allows the Microsoft ISA server to have more control over the 
internet usage. The plugin still allows most of the same benefits from 
the stand alone product including: customizable reporting, easy admin 
interface, and the remote interface for report retrieval.


Exploit:
An attacker is able to view/download any file from the server using a 
directory traversal attack:

http://isa-surfserver:8888/.../.../.../.../winnt/ 


Vendor Response:
SurfControl team was notified concerning the above vulnerability. 
SurfControl had previous knowledge that this existed on the stand alone 
SurfControl platforms, but did not know it existed on the plugin for 
Microsoft ISA. They recommended disabling the reports server and said it 
is turned on by default for "convenience to users."  Convenience before 
security from a leader in filter products? 

To disable the report server, go to Admin Tools> Services> and stop
