Subject: Re: PALM DESKTOP SOFTWARE / WIN 2000

If a user logged in and the workstation is locked, the answer is yes the user can still retrieve data.

If the user has not logged and the C-A-D screen is up waiting for a valid login, the answer is no.

Palm desktop does not start as a service and only starts after a valid logon. Another thing about Palm desktop (at least all
versions up to 4.01) Palm Desktop software had to be installed with local Admin rights for each user on 2K, then have that
right revoked back to their normal level. The sync software will only run on a user account that was installed properly.

Example:

Joe Blow user, installed Palm desktop with admin rights. Can function correctly.
Mary Smith user, logs onto the same machine with her account and tries to sync, it's a no go Palm sync will not work.

I've had some interesting experiences with Palms in our environment, 17 users on 2 shared W2K machines means I have to
install Palm desktop software 32 times. Each time giving the user local admin rights, installing, synching the first time if
it's a USB cradle (new hardware detected for each different palm), then removing the admin rights.
