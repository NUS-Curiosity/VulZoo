Subject: BlackICE PC Protection Cross Site Scripting Evasion


Hi!

I'm using BlackICE PC Protection (formerly known as BlackICE Defender)
for a very long time[1, 2]. It is one of my favorite hostbased intrusion
detection systems and personal firewall for windows.

During some tests for a paper on cross site scripting I've seen that
there is an evasion possibility in BlackICE PC Protection. If I'm
realizing such an request with a GET or POST method, the cross site
scripting is possible but I get an alert[3]:

> [Unauthorized Access Attempt] This signature detects if an HTTP GET
> request contains a 'script' tag.

It seems that BlackICE PC Protection doesn't check a HEAD, PUT, DELETE,
and TRACE request for the <script> pattern. So it is possible to evade
the successful cross site scripting attempt with a PUT or DELETE
attempt. That's because these two are the only request methods that let
me implant an arbitrary script. This is not a really critical issue -
But good to know.

I checked this with BlackICE PC Protection 3.6cbd and Apache 1.3.27. If
I push the "Event Info" button I'll get the page
http://www.iss.net/security_center/reference/2000640.html. There stands
that other ISS products have this security check too:

- BlackICE Agent for Server
- BlackICE PC Protection
- BlackICE Server Protection
- RealSecure Desktop Protector
- RealSecure Guard
- RealSecure Network Sensor
- RealSecure Sentry
- RealSecure Server Sensor

I can't say definitively that these products are affected too. It may be
possible.

My suggestion is to advance the pattern matching also for the other
possible HTTP request methods - Especially for PUT and DELETE. For
example my Snort host is not affected by such an evasion[4]:

I informed Internet Security Systems (ISS) about this flaw. I sent my
suggestion at Sat, 10 May 2003 11:51:07 +0200 to
support-L1@...workice.com and support@....net

Bye, Marc
