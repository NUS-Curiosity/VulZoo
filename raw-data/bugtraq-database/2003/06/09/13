0. PRODUCTS
=============

  FTP Voyager is a GUI base FTP Client for Windows.
  Rhino Software (http://www.rhinosoft.com/)


1. DESCRIPTION
================

  The buffer overflow occurs on the stack area if a file list that
  contains a long line is returned from a server.
  By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute an arbitrary
  code on a user's system if the user connects to a malicious server.

  With this vulnerability, there could be following risks;

  * Infection with Virus or Trojan, etc.
  * Destruction of the system.
  * Leak or alteration of the local data.


2. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
=====================

  FTP Voyager  9.1.0.3
  FTP Voyager 10.0.0.0

  And previous versions may have same vulnerabilities.


3. SYSTEMS NOT AFFECTED
=========================

  FTP Voyager 10.0.0.1


4. EXAMINES
=============

  Tested versions :
    FTP Voyager  9.1.0.3
    FTP Voyager 10.0.0.0
    FTP Voyager 10.0.0.1

  Tested platforms :
    Windows 98SE Japanese
    Windows 2000 Professional SP3 Japanese


5. VENDOR STATUS
==================

  2003-05-23  Vendor released fixed-version (10.0.0.1).


6. SOLUTION
=============

  Upgrade to version 10.0.0.1  or later version.


7. TECHNICAL DETAILS
======================

  FTP Voyager requests a file list to a server using "LIST" command
  or etc when it's connected to the server.
  And then, if the returned file list (except the filename, including
  file extensions) contains, the buffer overflow would occur on
  the stack area.

  Example:

    -r-xr-xr-x 1 owner group AAAAA...(over 0x270 bytes)... Feb 1 00:00 Filename.ext

  If a saved Structured Exception Handler is overwritten with
  the address of buffer that has an arbitrary code or the address
  of instruction data that redirects to there, the processing path
  moves to that buffer.

  Therefore, it is able to execute an arbitrary code as the privilege
  of FTP Voyager process.

  Each offsets of the Structured Exception Handler are different from
  others by a part of the list.


8. SAMPLE CODE
================

  None release.
