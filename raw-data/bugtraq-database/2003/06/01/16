Subject: JBOSS 3.2.1: JSP source code disclosure


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

jboss 3.2.1 with jetty seems to be vulnerable to jsp source code disclosure.

Trying to access the ServerInfo.jsp with an suffixed "%00" shows the source
code of this JSP. Seems to be a forgotten debug feature :-]
