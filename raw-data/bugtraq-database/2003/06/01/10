"Another ZEUS Server web admin XSS!" vendor response

On May 29th 2003, a cross-site-scripting attack against
the Zeus
Administration Server was reported on bugtraq (incident
"Another ZEUS 
Server web admin XSS!").

Zeus Technology has investigated this report and
confirm that a cross-
site-scripting exploit is possible under very limited
conditions.  This
vulnerability is present in Zeus Web Server version
4.2r2 and earlier.  
Zeus have product patches which will be available
shortly through Zeus's
support channel (support@...s.com).

These patches will be included in the next revision of
Zeus Web Server
(4.2r3) when it is released.


Zeus Technology continue to advise that the
Administration Server is
shut down when not in use as a matter of routine.

Zeus Technology work closely with customers,
evaluators, security
professionals and other researchers to ensure its
products are secure
and free from defects. Any security-related comments
received at
security@...s.com, or through any other means are
treated with the 
utmost attention.  Zeus Technology regret that the
researcher published 
details of the exploit before contacting Zeus and
allowing Zeus to 
prepare and distribute a fix.
