CERT Summary CS-2003-02

   June 3, 2003

   Each  quarter, the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) issues the CERT
   Summary  to  draw  attention  to  the types of attacks reported to our
   incident  response  team,  as  well  as  other noteworthy incident and
   vulnerability information. The summary includes pointers to sources of
   information for dealing with the problems.

   Past CERT summaries are available from:

Recent Activity

   Since  the last regularly scheduled CERT summary, issued in March 2003
   (CS-2003-01),  we  have  seen an integer overflow vulnerability within
   Sun's  XDR Library, multiple vulnerabilities in Lotus Notes and Domino
   Server,  a  buffer  overflow  vulnerability  in Sendmail, and multiple
   vulnerabilities within Snort's preprocessors.

   For  more  current  information  on  activity  being  reported  to the
   CERT/CC,  please  visit the CERT/CC Current Activity page. The Current
   Activity  page  is  a  regularly updated summary of the most frequent,
   high-impact  types  of  security  incidents  and vulnerabilities being
   reported  to the CERT/CC. The information on the Current Activity page
   is reviewed and updated as reporting trends change.

    1. Integer overflow in Sun RPC XDR library routines

       An  integer overflow vulnerability exists in the xdrmem_getbytes()
       function  distributed as part of the Sun Microsystems XDR library.
       This  overflow  may  allow  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
       code on the victim machine.

    2. Multiple Vulnerabilities in Lotus Notes and Domino

       Multiple  vulnerabilities  had been reported to affect Lotus Notes
       clients and Domino servers. Due to the confusion surrounding these
       vulnerabilities  we released an advisory to clairfy the details of
       the  vulnerabilities,  the versions affected, and the patches that
       resolve these issues.

    3. Buffer Overflow in Sendmail

       There  is  a  remotely  exploitable vulnerability in sendmail that
       could  allow  an attacker to gain control of a vulnerable sendmail
       server.

       Due  to  a  variable  type  conversion  problem,  sendmail may not
       adequately  check  the length of email address tokens. A specially
       crafted email message could trigger a stack overflow.

    4. Multiple Vulnerabilities in Snort Preprocessors

       There  are  two  vulnerabilities  in the Snort Intrusion Detection
       System,   each   in   a   separate   preprocessor   module.   Both
       vulnerabilities  allow  remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
       with the privileges of the user running Snort, typically root
