The free IRC servers for Unix have never shipped with a gui and this
has never stopped them from supporting encrypted passwords.  Are you
justifying lesser programming practises just because you're developing
for Windows?

And this never happens, does it?

Or, lets use another example, what if someone used your software on
a system that was using microsoft's terminal service packages or
something citrix like where a central server does support multiple
users ?  The users' whose passwords are being stored by your software
might be remote in this case but what of the real users?  Yes, an
extreme case and equally unlikely, but you never know...

Sounds like a poorly designed authentication interface, to me, where
real security was not given due consideration and an "obvious" solution
used despite the compromise to security that results.  Maybe there'll
be something about them in an upcoming email to full-disclosure/bugtraq,
lampooning them for similarly poor design choices and implementation
that introduces unnecessary security risks.

That's good to hear.
