I've done a quick debugging session: The overflow does not seem exploitable
other then a DoS.
What happens is that there is not enough heap to hold the long strings so it
writes past the heap to a location where no memory is allocated. This will
cause an unhandled exception.

Kind regards,

Berend-Jan Wever.
