Updated on:        2003-06-05
Product:           Red Hat Linux

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated KDE packages that resolve a vulnerability in KDE's SSL
implementation are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.1 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64

3. Problem description:

KDE is a graphical desktop environment for the X Window System.

KDE versions 2.2.2 and earlier have a vulnerability in their SSL
implementation that makes it possible for users of Konqueror and other SSL
enabled KDE software to fall victim to a man-in-the-middle attack.  Red Hat
Linux 7.1 and 7.2 shipped with KDE packages that are vulnerable to this issue.

Users of KDE should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain KDE
2.2.2 with a backported patch to correct this vulnerability.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
