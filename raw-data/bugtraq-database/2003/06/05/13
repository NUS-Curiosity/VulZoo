    Pi3 Web Server v2.0.2 Beta 1


In-Reply-To: <3EDBB632.4030000@...pbit.org>

The problem has been encountered with the Win32 version
of Pi3Web 2.0.2 beta 1, a pre-released beta for public
testing.
As I determined, it is not necessary, to have specific
configuration options set in order to reproduce the
exploit (maybe dependent on the runtime-environment).

The problem is fixed in Pi3Web 2.0.2 beta 2, available
from:
http://belnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/pi3web/Pi3Web-x86Win32-2_0_2-beta2.exe

Pi3Web 2.0.2 beta 1 is no more available and has been
available for only about one week (5 downloads of
Pi3Web 2.0.2 beta 1 registered at sourceforge).
