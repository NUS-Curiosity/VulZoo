- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that there are several bugs in IRIX 6.5.19 that were
caused by the extensive changes to add IPv6 capability.  Some of those
bugs have security implications:

  o  inetd can become hung when portscanned

  o  snoop now runs with a reduced capability set, so it doesn't handle
     packets as a root user.

There are other bugs fixed by the patches referenced herein, but they are
not security-related:

  o  Flood ping no response interval too long

  o  inetd will not start when discard lines commented out of /etc/services

  o  ppp spins in tight loop and never starts when configured for "quiet"
     mode

  o  Canonical name not shown in 'ping <ip_addr>' output

  o  rcp "Option f is not valid"


SGI has investigated the issues and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in IRIX 6.5.21, with patches and in
future releases of IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The binaries involved are installed by default on IRIX 6.5.19 and later
systems.  Since earlier versions of IRIX were not IPV6 capable, those
earlier versions are not vulnerable to these issues.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.


- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems.  SGI
recommends either upgrading to IRIX 6.5.21 when available, or installing the
patch from the listing below.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a patch for these vulnerabilities. Our recommendation is to
upgrade to IRIX 6.5.21 when available, or install the patch.
