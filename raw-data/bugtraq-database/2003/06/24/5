NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Remote System Buffer Overrun WebAdmin.exe
Systems Affected: Windows
Severity: High Risk
Category:               Buffer Overrun
Vendor URL: http://www.altn.com/
Author: Mark Litchfield (mark@...software.com)
Date: 24th June 2003
Advisory number: #NISR2406-03


Description
***********

WebAdmin allows administrators to securely manage MDaemon, RelayFax, and
WorldClient from anywhere in the world

Details
*******

There is a remotely exploitable buffer overrun in the USER parameter.

By default the webadmin.exe process is started as a system service.  Any
code being passed to the server by an attacker as a result of this buffer
overrun would therefore (based on a default install) execute with system
privileges.
