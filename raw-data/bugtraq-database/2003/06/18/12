Subject: ASP replacement for ISM.DLL available


In an effort to provide customers with greater defense in depth,
Microsoft has released an Active Server Pages (ASP) replacement for the
Internet Information Server 4 and Internet Information Services 5 change
password capability, ISM.DLL. This new script code no longer runs as
SYSTEM, therefore reducing the attack surface of the Web server. Note
that IIS5.1 and IIS6 do not ship ISM.DLL, they both use the updated ASP
functionality.

This package has been tested and approved for use with Microsoft
Exchange versions 5.5 and 2000 running Outlook Web Access (OWA).

If you use the password change functionality of IIS, it is HIGHLY
recommend you use this new package.
