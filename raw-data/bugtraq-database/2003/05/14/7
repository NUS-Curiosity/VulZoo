php-proxima Remote File Access Vulnerability

---------------------- 
Vendor Information: 
---------------------- 

Homepage : http://www.php-proxima.com
Vendor : informed 
Mailed advisory: 14/05/03 
Vender Response : None 

---------------------- 
Affected Versions: 
---------------------- 

php-proxima 6.0 and prior

---------------------- 
Vulnerability: 
---------------------- 

php-proxima is a website portal system made in php. php-proxima is actually
a different version of php-nuke, very similar although it has some changes.

One of the changes is that php-proxima contains a file called autohtml.php.
By sending a specific request as shown bellow an attacker may be able to
include local files and therefore read them.

The problem appears here:

***************************
..

witch($op) {

    case "modload":
	if (!isset($mainfile)) { include("mainfile.php"); }
	$index = 0;
	include("header.php");
	OpenTable();
   				include("autohtml/$name");

..
***************************

Since the case has been coded so poorly in terms of security, a user
can avoid including mainfile.php and inject anything into $name.

Example:

http://victim/autohtml.php?op=modload&mainfile=x&name=<local filename>

---------------------- 
Solution: 
---------------------- 

You can fix this problem by replacing
include("autohtml/$name");
with
// include("autohtml/$name");

Please check the vendor's website for new patches.
