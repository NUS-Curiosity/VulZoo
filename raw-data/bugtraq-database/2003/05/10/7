Subject: BitchX: Crash when channel modes change




On May 7th 2003, we recieved a bug report through our tracking system 
which noted a crash problem with BitchX for all versions up to 1.0c20cvs. 
Certain mode changes would cause BitchX to core consistantly. 

This problem was resolved in less than 24 hours. The patch was commited 
to CVS by powuh.

Myself and other have tested the patch included in this bugnote, and find 
it to work excellent for solving this problem. 

I have patched names.c and committed it to the CVS, revision 1.9 of 
names.c 

-- End bugnote
