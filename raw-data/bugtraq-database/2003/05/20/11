Subject: Blue screen in Windows


Issue :

Blue screen in Windows


Tested versions :

W2000 Server Sp3 with IE 6.0 Sp1
XP Pro with IE 6.0


Vendor status :

MS is investigating the issue but as they spent months to just acknowledge
it I decided to publish it


Description :

With Internet Explorer you can make calls using netmeeting ,
navigating to callto Urls . On the systems tested if you try to
navigate to a specially crafted callto url Windows halt with a
Kmode exception not handled . I can´t reproduce this always,
particulary not after rebooting from the system halt , but the issue
was confirmed in two different computers .

I am afraid I can´t give any debugging info cause no causing module is
shown in the BSOD .


Exploit :

In the spanish version of this advisory you can find a demonstration
