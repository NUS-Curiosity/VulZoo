Subject: ntoskrnl.exe and isql.exe hard crash (update) NetWare the root
 cause


While paying closer attention to my machine as it blue 
screened due to Query analyzer crashing, I noticed that 
the actual exception occurs in nwfs.sys. This file I 
believe is installed with the Netware Client. This fact 
also coincides with my other lab machines not having the 
BSoD when a large buffer was stuffed into "server" field. 
Any one else running netware and query analyzer able to 
help me prove this? 
Thanks,
-wire.
