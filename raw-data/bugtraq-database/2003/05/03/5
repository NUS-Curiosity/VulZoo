I submit all new Kermit versions of Kermit to HP.  I include HP in the
development and test cycles.  They are supposed to update their copies.
OK, let me try some of the HP-UX systems at:

  http://www.testdrive.hp.com/

Here's what I find:

 HP-UX spe175 B.11.22 U ia64 rx2600
   C-Kermit 8.0.200, 12 Dec 2001, for HP-UX 11.00
   This one is fairly current - it has the buffer overflow fixes.

 HP-UX spe169 B.11.11 U 9000/800/A500-7X
   C-Kermit 7.0.197,  8 Feb 2000, for HP-UX 11.00
   This one is four years newer than the one you found but
   it is before the buffer overflow fixes.

I suspect that HP ships newer Kermit versions with newer OS versions, but
does not issue new Kermit patches for older OS versions.  If that is true,
then you have a point.  But:

 . HP probably wants you upgrade your OS version.  They don't want
   to maintain patches for every combination of C-Kermit version and
   HP-UX version.

 . The current version is always available direct from us, for EVERY
   version of HP-UX on EVERY hardware platform.  See:
