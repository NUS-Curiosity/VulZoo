About Vignette
--------------

Vignette develops Content Management and Application Portal Software.


Description of vulnerability
----------------------------

Vignette Software installs by default some help applications under de /vgn web directory.

One of this utilities is the Vignette Legacy Tool. This application is accessed through it's main template /vgn/legacy/edit. This template is protected by the [ NEEDS LOGIN ] directive and it's not accesible for unauthenticated users.

The problem is that the real job of this application is carried by the /vgn/legacy/save template, which is not protected.

The only check that is done is in the RECORD directive. But this check is easyly bypassed.

The check only looks for an vgn_creds cookie, but it does not check it's content. So what is only needed to do a succesful query is to put some random value on this cookie.

This way it's possible to do a SELECT query, over any SQL table that is accesible from the Vignette user that has access to the database.


Affected Versions and platforms
-------------------------------

This vulnerability has been tested in Vignette StoryServer 4, StoryServer 5 and Vignette V/5. But it seems that all currently avaliable versions are vulnerable.


Solution
--------

Insert a [ NEEDS LOGIN ] directive in the top of the source code for the /vgn/legacy/save template.
Vignette users should procceed to contact vignette throught the standard channels VOLS etc in order to get a solution.
