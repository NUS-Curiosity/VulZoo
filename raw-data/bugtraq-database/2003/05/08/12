Subject: s0h: Kerio Personal Firewall and Tiny Personal Firewall remote exploit/patch.

Hello,

April 28, 2003, the CoreSecurity team publishes security advisory concerning 2 holes in Kiero Personal Firewall, of which one of both is Remote Buffer Overflow in the process of connection of the remote admin module.
Kiero Personal Firewall using PFEngine, an common firewall engine, it proves that the vulnerability is also present in Tiny Personal Firewall! 
In the same time, every PFE firewall based products are vulnerable...

Today, the Thursday, May 8, 2003 6:27 PM, ThreaT (again@#!) from Skin Of Humanity Group released the exploit and the UNOFFICIAL patch for Kerio Personal Firewall version 2.1.4.0 (and previous versions) and Tiny Personal Firewall version 2.0.15.0.

Please enjoy sources of the patch at : http://www.s0h.cc/~threat/goodies/PFpatch/sources_PFpatch.zip

To correct this problem on your personnal firewall use this address : http://www.s0h.cc/~threat/goodies/PFpatch/PFpatch.exe

To understanding the hole and the exploitation method please get the exploit at http://www.s0h.cc/~threat/source/PFExploit.c.

A french advisory was writed at http://s0h.cc/~threat/goodies/PFpatch/

Sight that Kiero did not want to answer the CoreSecurity request, we did not inform Kerio. i think they do not understood what it passed. (no offence).
