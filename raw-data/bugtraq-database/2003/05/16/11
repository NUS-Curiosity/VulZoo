Packages updated:	fileutils
Affected products:	Immunix OS 7.0, 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2002-0435

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Wojciech Purczynski discovered filesystem race conditions in the GNU
  fileutils suite, that allows for local root compromise if root renames
  or removes group- or world-writable directory trees.

  This release fixes this problem by comparing (dev, inode) pairs before
  and after chdir("..") calls. If the pairs don't match, an error is
  returned. Thanks to Jim Meyering for the patch.
