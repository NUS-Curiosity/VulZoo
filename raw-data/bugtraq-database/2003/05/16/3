Subject: [RHSA-2003:169-01] Updated lv packages fix vulnerability


---------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated lv packages fix vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:169-01
Issue date:        2003-05-16
Updated on:        2003-05-16
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          local root exploit
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0188
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

New lv packages that fix the possibility of local root exploit are now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.1 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Lv is a powerful file viewer similar to less. It can decode and encode
multilingual streams through many coding systems, such as ISO-8859,
ISO-2022, EUC, SJIS Big5, HZ, and Unicode.

A bug has been found in versions of lv that read a .lv file in the current
directory.  Local attackers can use this to place an .lv file in any
directory to which they have write access.  Any user who subsequently runs
lv in that directory and uses the v (edit) command can be forced to execute
an arbitrary program.

Users are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a
version of lv that is patched to read the .lv configuration file only in
the user's home directory.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
