Subject: Re: Qpopper v4.0.x poppassd local root exploit


I'm working on a fix, but would like to point out that poppassd is 
not built nor installed by default.  Also, poppassd is an inherently 
insecure protocol that sends both the current and new passwords in 
the clear, and in general should only be used with full understanding 
of the situation.
