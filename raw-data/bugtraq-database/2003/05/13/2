Problem first discovered on: Mon, 24 Mar 2003
Published on: Tue, 13 May 2003

Overview:
---------
  IP Messenger for Win ver 2.02 and previous versions are prone to a 
  buffer overflow vulnerability in the file & folder transfer mechanism.

Problem Description:
--------------------
  A buffer overflow occurs when a user attempts to save a file containing 
  an unusually long filename received through IP Messenger for Win. 
     
  Remote attackers could take advantage of this flaw to execute code of 
  their choice with the privileges of the IP Messenger user.

  Note that versions of IP Messenger that do not support the file & folder 
  transfer mechanism are not affected by this issue.

Tested Versions:
----------------
  IP Messenger for Win ver 2.00
  IP Messenger for Win ver 2.01
  IP Messenger for Win ver 2.02

Solution:
---------
  It is possible to rectify this problem by upgrading to IP Messenger 
  for Win ver 2.03.
