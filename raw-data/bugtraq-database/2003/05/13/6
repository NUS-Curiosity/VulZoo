I pasted your example code (&lt; &gt; converted to < >
and the cr's removed ) into the name and text fields on
my blog (ver 2.62 +patch) under the 2 basic security
settings for comments -- with 'Allow html' off and with
'Allow html' on and the default santize specs (which
allows only certain html tags) in both cases I got a
very ugly comment -- js code rendered as text -- that
did nothing to my page's display.

Yes, you can turn santize off -- you can leave your
front door unlocked too. Neither one is recomended.
MT's default is 'Allow html' off, and you don't have to
do anything special to turn santize on if you switch to
allowing html.
