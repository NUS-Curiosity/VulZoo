you're screwed....they don't care...I got burned like 3 or 4 times and they
really just don't care...they tell you to goto this fruad site which I think
helped somewhat due to:

but really I don't think ebay cares...I would be interested in participating
in an ebay ban...too bad there are no other auction companies taht care
either...
