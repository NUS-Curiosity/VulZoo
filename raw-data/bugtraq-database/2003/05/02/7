                   Red Hat Security Advisory

CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0084
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated mod_auth_any packages are now available for Red Hat Linux.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

mod_auth_any is a Web server module that allows the Apache httpd server to
call arbitrary external programs to verify user passwords.

Vulnerabilities have been found in the way mod_auth_any escapes shell
arguments when calling external programs. Versions of mod_auth_any included
in Red Hat Linux 7.2 and 7.3 are affected.  These vulnerabilities
allow remote attackers to run arbitrary commands as the user under which
the Web server is running.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0084 to these issues.

All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which address
these vulnerabilities by changing the method by which external programs are
invoked.

Note: This updated module is more careful in checking the results of the
AuthAnyUserProg. Previous versions did not distinguish between the program
outputting nothing due to success or a crash.  This replacement version
treats a zero-length result as if it were an "Authentication Error," and
expects the program to output a valid username on success.  

Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Jarboe and Maneesh Sahani for bringing
these issues to our attention.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available at http://www.redhat.com/solutions/security/news/publickey/

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
