Subject: Re: Dynamic DNS "Spoofing" & IRC


Well you dont even have to have dyndns... just control over the over the 
domain is sufficient.
Just connect and change the dns afterwards...

This dosn't have anything to do with dns & irc really... it just utilizes 
the fact that your ircclient performs a dns check seperatly.

The problem with rechecking dns is that for a pretty large network such as 
ircnet or efnet it would take some resources to do this check, thus 
allowing a denial attack being made more easily against one server.
