Jonathan,

I'm currently reporting 40ms pings to yahoo and tracerts look normal,
although I did experience very odd tracerts and pings last month. More about
my experience can be found below:

http://www.techimo.com/forum/t61169.html I post under the name "implexant"

Could you post a copy of a tracert that looks suspicious?

Anyone else having issues on the net?  Ours is really slow, on trace
routes it looks like it is dieing around the Level 3 backbone.  Anyone
else with the same issues?  Does anyone know what is going on?

TIA
