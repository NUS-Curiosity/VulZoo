MS SQL Server DOES allow multiple statements, you
should be confused with mysql. The ideas presented in
paper work most of the time on web applications
vulnerable to SQL injection, the only problem is when
firewalls block all outbound connections, but that can
be bypassed using other OLEDB providers.
