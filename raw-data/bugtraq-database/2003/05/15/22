Subject: Re: Flooding Internet Explorer 6.0.2800 (6.x?) security zones ! - UPDATED




Marek,

Further to my confirmation of seeing this in the past as detailed 
below, I am today delighted to inform you that I can reconfirm that 
it functions precisely as you describe:

1. Definitely processor related as after 10 minutes of bogging down 
the machine, BANG ! it automatically opened the .exe

2.  Thereon after, all following .exe's are also automatically opened

Tested on the following page which is nothing more than a sh!tload of:
 
<iframe src="fooware.exe">'s

Harmless .exe

Note: may of course be different on other machines [i.e. processor 
power...increase amount of frame 'suppose]

Well Done ! It's a beauty !


======
I had sent this to bugtraq when you initially posted it, confirming 
having seen it in the past as well. Will try your html file and see 
if can get it up and running again.
