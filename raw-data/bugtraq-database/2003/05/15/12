  EnGarde Secure Linux is an enterprise class Linux platform engineered
  to enable corporations to quickly and cost-effectively build a complete
  and secure Internet presence while preventing Internet threats.

OVERVIEW
- --------
  This kernel update fixes several bugs and vulnerabilities.  A summary
  of the changes from the last kernel update are below.

    * Systems with more then one swap partition defined could OOPS when
      "swapoff -a" was run.

    * This update improves the kernel module loader vulnerability fix
      (CAN-2003-0127) initially fixed in ESA-20030318-009.

    * Using specially selected forged source addresses, a remote attacker
      can cause a very large number of collisions in the kernel's
      networking hash tables, resulting in a denial of service attack.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
      assigned the name CAN-2003-0244 to this issue.

    * The "ioperm" system call does not properly restrict privileges,
      potentially allowing an unprivileged local user access to the I/O
      ports on the system.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
      assigned the name CAN-2003-0246 to this issue.

  Guardian Digital products affected by these issues include:

    EnGarde Secure Community 2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.5

  It is recommended that all users apply this update as soon as possible.
