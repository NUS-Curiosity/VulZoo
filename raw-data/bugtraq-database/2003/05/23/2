Subject: Compaq Insight Manager - related to Bugtraq ID 2500


Another one out of the back catalogue, seen again today.

Version:

Compaq Insight Manager Version 5.0 or below

Issue:

The Proxy vulnerability identified in Bugtraq ID 2500, and the patch
produced by Compaq for that vuln. does not prevent ftp proxying.

On a host denying http proxying, it is possible to ftp over http to a third
party host, using CIM as the proxy.  You can't put or get (probably because
there isn't an ftp server on CIM to buffer the transfer), but you can
browse, allowing for a targeted attack.


Again, I talked to Compaq about this over a year ago, and they appeared to
work on the principle that the problem went away in the newest version of
CIM.  I'd forgotten about it until today, when I saw  a CIM/CMA installation
again.

Advice - keep upgrading and patching, or stop using CIM.
