  Looking back two weeks in BugTraq archives, I see the following
posting:
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/320270/2003-04-30/2003-05-06/0

  This suggests that many more programs are similarly vulnerable,
because they take shortcuts. After all, it is quite common and generally
even good practise to skip redundant code paths. The flipside of the
coin is that it may allow these kind of timing attacks.
