Regarding the potential XSS vulnerability discussed in 
DarkHunter's message, Movable Type was updated to prevent this 
possible exploit on February 13, with the release of version 2.6 of 
the sofware. In addition, all of our users were alerted to the 
potential of a security issue and urged to update to the newer 
version. Our current version is 2.63, downloadable at http://
www.movabletype.org, and it prevents this exploit by default, as 
noted by Jordan Wiens in his follow-up message.
