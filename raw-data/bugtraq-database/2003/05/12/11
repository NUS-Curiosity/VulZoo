Subject: One more flaw in Happymall




Happymall E-Commerce Directory Transversal Bug and Cross-site scripting

Vendor: Happycgi.com

Product: Happymall

Versions: 4.3, 4.4 (patched version too)

'normal_html.cgi' doesn't filter user-supplied input. The well-known 
directory transversal
and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in Happymall 
(patched version too).

The impact is that attackers can read files on the system and use XSS 
tricks to steal
cookies and other informations.

An example: /shop/normal_html.cgi?file=../../../../../../etc/issue%00
	    /shop/normal_html.cgi?file=&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS")&lt;/script&gt;

Even happycgi.com is vulnerable to these bugs.

Solution: I have contacted CERTCC-KR.
