Subject: [Drug and Zip] Buffer Overflow




====================================
- > Product: Drag and Zip
- > Version: 3.0
- > Offsite: http://www.canyonsw.com
- > Authors: Canyon Software
- > Problem: Buffer Overflow
====================================

** General Description **
The vulnerability found by me in this product, does not represent the big 
danger but to describe and declare it(her) all the same I has found 
necessary. Overflow of the buffer, occurs because of very big name of a 
file which we try to pack. If it is long a file exceeds 255 symbols, the 
window with the message on overflow drops out. As well as it is necessary 
to expect, the program falls, in result and not having packed a file. 

** Exploit **
Zip Filename:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

or

Zip filename:
256 Symbols of any dust

** Solution **
What decision erasing this problem independently, without intervention of 
authors of the program, me it was found not.

** Note **
At overflow values eax and edx so in given by a case introduction of an 
any code can be possible vary.
