Subject: Re: CSS found in Movable Type


I just tried it on an installed 2.63 MT and was unable to get the XSS to
work.  Tried the javascript samples in Name, email, homepage, and comment
field, all with no success.  MT properly elminated < > tags and left the
&lt; as &lt, not allowing any execution.
