Subject: Nessus 2.0.6 has been released


Nessus 2.0.6 has been released. It fixes a potential security vulnerability in
libnasl as well as some other buglets.

There are some flaws in libnasl which might let a script break out of its
sandboxed environment and execute arbitrary commands on the nessusd host.
To exploit these flaws, an attacker would need to have a valid Nessus account
as well as the ability to upload arbitrary Nessus plugins in the Nessus
server (this option is disabled by default).

Not that these issues can NOT be exploited by a tested host to crash nessusd
remotely.

. Solution

Upgrade to Nessus 2.0.6 available at :
	http://ftp.nessus.org/nessus/nessus-2.0.6/
	ftp://ftp.nessus.org/pub/nessus/nessus-2.0.6/

. Workaround

Make sure the option 'plugins_upload' is set to 'no' in nessusd.conf

. Thanks

"Sir Mordred" <mordred@...ail.com> discovered some ways to crash NASL scripts
by sending bad parameters to insstr(), ftp_log_in(), and other functions.
Upon investigation, we fixed similar issues in other nasl functions as well
as in libnessus.
