Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Apache httpd auth remote

CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0189 CAN-2003-0245
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
freely-available Web server.

A bug in Apache 2.0 through 2.0.45 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service, and may allow execution of arbitrary code.  This bug
affects both Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0245 to
this issue.

A build system problem in Apache 2.0 through 2.0.45 allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of access to authenticated content when a threaded
server is used.   This bug affects only Red Hat Linux 9 when the threaded
server "httpd.worker" has been configured, which is not the default.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2003-0189 to this issue.

All users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the
applicable errata packages, which contain back-ported fixes correcting
these issues, and applied to Apache version 2.0.40.

After the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running
the following command:

/sbin/service httpd restart

Red Hat would like to thank iDefense who initially discovered CAN-2003-0245
and John Hughes for CAN-2003-0189.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

88575 - Byte Range implementation fix
89170 - fullstatus segfaults apachectl
89179 - mod_proxy (forward proxy) inserts empty line before header

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available at http://www.redhat.com/solutions/security/news/publickey/

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
