Subject: [RHSA-2003:145-01] Updated kernel fixes security vulnerabilities and updates drivers


---------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated kernel fixes security vulnerabilities and updates drivers
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:145-01
Issue date:        2003-05-27
Updated on:        2003-05-27
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Keywords:          ptrace x450
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0127 CAN-2003-0244
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

These updated kernel packages address security vulnerabilites, including a
potential data corruption scenario.  In addition, a number of drivers have
been updated, bugs have been resolved, and support for the IBM x450 platform
and the Madison processor have been added.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS (Advanced Server) version 2.1 - ia64
Red Hat Linux Advanced Workstation 2.1 - ia64

3. Problem description:

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

A ptrace-related vulnerability has been discovered that could allow a local
user to gain elevated (root) privileges without authorization.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0127 to this issue.

A flaw has been discovered that could potentially lead to data corruption.
 The scenario only occurs while performing memory mapped file I/O, where
the file is simultaneously unlinked and the corresponding file blocks
reallocated.  Furthermore, the memory mapped must be to a partial page at
the end of a file on an ext3 file system.  As such, Red Hat considers this
scenario unlikely.

A flaw has been found in several hash table implementations in the kernel
networking code. A remote attacker could send packets with carefully
chosen, forged source addresses in such a way as to make every routing
cache entry get hashed into the same hash chain. The result would be that
the kernel would use a disproportionate amount of processor time to deal
with new packets, resulting in a remote denial of service attack. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name CAN-2003-0244 to this issue.

In addition, the following drivers have been updated to the version indicated:

- e1000: 4.4.19-k1
- e100: 2.1.29-k2
- ips: 6.00.26
- qla2100, qla2200, qla2300: v6.04.01
- tg3 driver to 1.4c
- cciss driver to 2.4.44
- mpt fusion: 2.05.00
- aic7xxx to 6.2.32
- aic79xx to 1.3.6

If the system is configured to use alternate drivers, we recommend applying
the kudzu errata RHEA-2003:132 prior to updating the kernel.

The updated kernel also adds support for the IBM x450 platform and the
Madison processor, and incorporates improved support for the hugetlb file
system.  This file system makes efficient use of the large page size
support that the Itanium architecture provides.   

All users should upgrade to these errata packages, which address these issues.

4. Solution:

Release notes, driver notes, and driver disks for this update are available
at the following URL:

http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/rhel/

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied, especially the additional
packages from RHSA-2002:205 and RHSA-2002:206 respectively.

The procedure for upgrading the kernel manually is documented at:

http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/howto/kernel-upgrade/

Please read the directions for your architecture carefully before
proceeding with the kernel upgrade.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this to be an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat
Network, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system. Note that you need to select the kernel
explicitly on default configurations of up2date.

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

81349 - Machine with QLogic card hung during RAC QA
81794 - IPF: AS2.1 Errata 2: spare lun patch for VA and XP storage arrays
88301 - RHEL AS2.1 IPF: Seeing MCAs on system while testing Tulip driver
81803 - AS2.1 Errata 2: Fix to serial driver
