Subject: Re: CORE-2003-0403: Axis Network Camera HTTP Authentication Bypass


While you are fixing the vulnerability in your Axis video camera. 
Please also stop to check and make sure that you have turned off (or 
properly configured) it's ability to send snapshots via email.  If 
you turn on the function without configuring the addresses, older 
cameras will default to sending email to mail@...ewhere.com "from" 
olga@...ewhere.com.  We get on the order of ten to fifteen thousand 
of these every day.  On occasions when we've bothered to look, we've 
seen things ranging from computer rooms to jewelry store security 
cameras.  Probably not the kind of thing you'd want to be sending to 
strangers.

I'm not sure which upsets me more: that people are so unwilling to accept
responsibility for their own actions, or that they are so eager to regulate
everyone else's.
