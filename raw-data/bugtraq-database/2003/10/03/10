Subject: Is it safe yet?


Hello Bugtraq members.
  I've been watching with keen interest the recent developments
concerning SSL vulnerabilities, most notably involving remote
compromises in SSH.  When the first note came through about the remote
SSH vulnerabilities, I quickly plugged up port 22 in my company's
firewall.  Unfortunately, that of course greatly reduces my work-at-home
abilities as I can no longer log in to our servers from outside..  

What I would like to have suggested to me is:
--Is it safe yet?  It seems that first vuln kicked off a swarm of
subsequently-discovered problems in SSL.  I'm really itching to open
that port back up so I can work from home ("sleep late").
-- Would it be a better idea to open the port only to my home IP?  My IP
is, for all intents and purposes, static; however, it is not guaranteed
to be..  I have this sinking feeling that as soon as I open services
dependent on my home IP, it will start changing every 3 days.

I appreciate the attention and suggestions you'll this little sprout in
the garden of network security.

Cheers,
~Brian
