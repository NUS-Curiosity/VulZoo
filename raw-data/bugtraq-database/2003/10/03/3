I tested the patch against the current release version of wordpress 
(v0.71). Although I couldn't notice any harm with the provided example 
for the blog I run with this wordpress version, I applied the patch and 
couldn't see any negative impact.

Actually, chances are good that I don't make use of the part of 
Wordpress that would have been compromised by the provided exploit 
example. If anyone could provide another working (and non-destructive 
;)) exploit I'd be willing to test it against both, the release version 
any "my" patched version, in order to verify that the provided patch 
works for 0.71. Or let me know which feature needs to be turned on in 
order to test the effect of the exploit (please be patient with me, I'm 
a Wordpress newbie ;)).

Bye, Mike
