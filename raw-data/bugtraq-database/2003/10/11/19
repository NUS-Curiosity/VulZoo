Subject: Testing my codes in www.nsrg-security.com , important notes


I have tested the last codes i sent and i have important notes that i must
tell about:

First: The code must be included but not copyed directly to the
lib-security.php file ( this is a note for Geeklog users )
Second: use as include ("toban.php"); fior write the BANED.TXT in
/www/htdocs ( useful for access from the web and know if you are banned )
Tirth: instead of copy the code of banip.php ( the banner ) ot including it
into lib-security.php , use as a extra code for webpages you want to
protect.
         There is no warranty of fully working things by adding code
directly to the lib-security.php .
Fourth: Of course , a little knowledge is needed for install the scripts.

Please , note that those files are completely un-official patches for
products such as Geeklog , etc.
Do not send me messages with the subject of " i expected a working install
but...." , they are completely easy to code scripts.

I need more eXPerience to design fully warranted scripts .
I'm working in some advisories in important websites and i will use as
examples these codes and my own xss exploitation codes.

OFF-TOPIC NOTE: am i the most young person in Full-Disclosure ?
