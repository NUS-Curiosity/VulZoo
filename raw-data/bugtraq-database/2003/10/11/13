Subject: Concern about Checkpoint and SSL Vulnerability


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Found the following in Checkpoint

libcpopenssl.so
>ASN.1 part of OpenSSL 0.9.6c 21 dec 2001
>asn1_lib.c

This is from Solaris. Friends have confirmed
similar in other *nix and M$. Nearly all
executables link to these libraries.

Nothing on Checkpoint website.

NISCC test suite is not publicly available.

Looking to (non-destructively) test my systems ASAP.

TIA for polite suggestions
