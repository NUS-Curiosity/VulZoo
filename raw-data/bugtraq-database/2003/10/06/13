This isn't a security hole but more of a scripting mistake.  You don't gain any additional access, you don't r00t the box, you don't even steal another users session.  Common best practices would tell anyone worth their wage to enable SSL and not allow access to TCP 444 (the control panel interface default port) to the outside anyways.
 
I fail to see how there is anything exploitable here.
