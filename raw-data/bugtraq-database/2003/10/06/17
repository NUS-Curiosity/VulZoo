Subject: Access Runner DSL Console vulnerability update




While doing some more testing I have found that some Access Runner's are actually "immune" to this type of attack. I do not know just yet why some are immune and some are not. Still trying to get in contact with Conexant on this but have yet to find any contact info. 

Please do take note that this does not change the original status as they are still able to be exploited. If anyone else could please confirm this I would appreciate it.
