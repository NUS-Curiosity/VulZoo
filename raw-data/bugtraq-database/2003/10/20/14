Subject: Unpatched Internet Explorer Bugs




general essay on unpatched& published IE bugs - verified, up-to-date, organized, referenced and digested :

http://continue.to/trie
OR
http://www.safecenter.net/UMBRELLAWEBV4/DirSvc/security/trie/index.html

(trie = TRick Internet Explorer)

the original list
http://www.pivx.com/larholm/unpatched/
was changed to a mailing list, which means the general public won't be able to get the up-to-date& complete buglist.
so i made this.
