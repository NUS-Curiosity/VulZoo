Package:             ircd
Vulnerability:       remote denial of service vulnerability
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= ircd-2.10.3p3-20030725   >= ircd-2.10.3p4-20031012
OpenPKG 1.3          <= ircd-2.10.3p3-1.3.0      >= ircd-2.10.3p3-1.3.1
OpenPKG 1.2          <= ircd-2.10.3p3-1.2.0      >= ircd-2.10.3p3-1.2.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a report from Piotr Kucharski [0] a buffer overflow
  vulnerability exists in ircd [1] that allows a remote attacker to
  crash the ircd server, thus causing a denial of service condition.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2003-0864 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  ircd". If you have the "ircd" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary
  RPM [4]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get ircd-2.10.3p3-1.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig ircd-2.10.3p3-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild ircd-2.10.3p3-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/ircd-2.10.3p3-1.3.1.*.rpm
