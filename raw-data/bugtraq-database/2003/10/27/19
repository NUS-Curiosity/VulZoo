Subject: Libnids <= 1.17 buffer overflow


Hello,
	Libnids is a library which implements the functionality of NIDS
E-component. Libnids provides IP defragmentation, TCP stream reassembly and
port scan detection.
	Robert Watson <rwatson@...eBSD.org> has found a bug in the part of 
libnids code responsible for TCP reassembly. The flaw probably allows for 
remote code execution. This vulnerability has been assigned a CVE name 
CAN-2003-0850.
	Applications not using libnids tcp reassembly (like scanlogd) are not 
vulnerable; others, like dsniff, are potentially vulnerable.
	All libnids versions <= 1.17 are vulnerable. Libnids 1.18, which fixes 
this issue, is available at http://libnids.sourceforge.net.

Save yourself,
Nergal
