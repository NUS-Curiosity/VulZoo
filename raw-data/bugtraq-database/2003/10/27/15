Mozilla user's profile path will have a randomly named directory. See 
below (this on Windows 2000 and XP):

C:\Documents and Settings\<Windows username>\Application 
Data\Mozilla\Profiles\<profile name, usually default>\<random 8 
characters>.slt\

Older Mozilla installations may have slightly different path, but they 
should all still contain that "salted" directory name.
