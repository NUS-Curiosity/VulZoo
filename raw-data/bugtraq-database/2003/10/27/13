[Details]
A remote user can reportedly send request to cause the system
to display an error message that indicates the installation path.
It's possible to make a malformed http request for many files in
Dansie Shopping Cart and in doing so trigger an error.
The resulting error message will disclose potentially sensitive installation
path information to the remote attacker.


[Proof of Concept]

[Suggestions]
Filter all files.
