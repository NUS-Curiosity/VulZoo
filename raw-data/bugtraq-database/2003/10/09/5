Because when you're storing something you don't want to be visibly seen
to be storing (typically something that's strong evidence of nefarious
activities - a simple example might be stolen credit card numbers) you
want a form of storage that disappears with few-to-no traces pointing
to you when law enforcement rolls through and seizes your computer.
