Just because you and I don't have a use for this doesn't make it useless.

This technique has one advantage that I can see being very useful -- it is
easy to delete large amounts of data quickly.   Imagine you hear the feds
knocking on your door -- you just unplug your fiber, and let all the light
(aka your data) fly out into the room.   Your data is gone, permanently.
If the latency is a minute, then it only takes a minute to delete everything
-- all 6.5 GB of data according to your calculations.   Show me another
method that can delete 6.5 GB a data in a completely unrecoverable manner
that quickly.   Hard drives need to be overwritten many times, but even then
they can still likely be recovered with enough money put toward it.

  Rick
