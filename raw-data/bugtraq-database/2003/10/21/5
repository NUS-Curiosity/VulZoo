This is of course true - JAP have won a great moral victory.
Unfortunately, they may have acheived the moral high ground in court, but
the fact still remains that they
a) DID trojan their own anonymity service and
b) the German police *did* (admittedly by raiding homes once they knew the
data record existed) obtain the captured information.
so - presumably they are really, really sorry they deliberately (and
secretly) compromised their own service and gave the records to the police,
and we should all forgive them for that?
