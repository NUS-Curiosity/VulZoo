Subject: Re: [PAPER] Juggling with packets: floating data storage


You know, this topic is quickly getting out of hand, but I can't help but
wonder what you were doing spewing 6.5 gigabytes of incriminating data
around on a link with a minute of latency, just so you wouldn't have to
store it locally... Or perhaps you meant that you have a ~11 million mile
long reel of fiber in your basement?
