Subject: Re: Re: I have fixes for the Geeklog vulnerabilities


Hi jelmer,
you are completely right , MySQL versions 4.x are affected directly but ,
there are sufficient commands and codes to design successful queries in
other versions.
And again i must say that Dirk was lying saying that i reported false
vulnerabilities , a good example of this that somebody accessed a
non-protected part of my server database ( using mysql 3.53.) and changed
funny the layout 8 a good reason to design the fix , non-official ) .
I installed a mysql 4. server in a server of my home netowrk and i could t
drop one table of the database.
And jelmer , your exploit its amazing , is the future of exploits python ?
;-)
if you want i will add your exploit in the group website.
Murphy must add the rocket science bible ;-) all of use will understand it !
cxondo.

I'm happy when i know that there are good people and real professionals in
this world.
Another thing that i don't like is that those developers such as Dirk , the
Gator staff , say: oh! he is only 14 years old ! he doesn't know what things
he say...
it is stupid , the age does not matter , only experience and i'm not very
old in this , only 2-3 years reporting this kind of issues , when i was 7 i
started here in Spain to learn computers , at 2001-02 i reported my first
vulnerability , i had more bad english but never i want to waste peoples
time , the life is gold, the time is gold but the responsability is the
double.
and , Bill Gates and M$ developers are really more nold than me but they
design really insecure products , is not the same but it is an example.

another thing that it is a bit silly is that , if someone reports a
vulnerability in a product such as Geeklog , and this product is used by
lots of people , why you don't want to patch it ? lots of users are
vulnerable , and , in the case of XSS attacks + SQL Injections , its really
simple , script kiddies that only think in FUCK people and DESCOJONAR ( esto
para los compis de espa√±a, abit word of spanenglish ;- ) will disturb people
using Geeklog , and , the reason of  " only versions 4.1 of mysql are
vulnerable and it is not used" , do you know ,Dirk , all the people using
Geeklog ? users of webhosting services that use those versions are
vulnerable , is their responsability ? it is stupid to think it , in
addition other versions are affected.

Another point , you said " non exist version of..." is tru , i was using an
old report for make it , i replaced the contents with the geeklog report and
i made a mistake with versions , it is human to make errors but the real
important thing is to recognize them.

of course i don't want to tell my life in this post , [ Full-Disclosure NO
es una verduleria chaval ! a ver si perdemos menos aceite eh... ] ( the last
phrase is a typical expression for this times . Full Disclosure is not a
list for post agressive things .


Thanks to jelmer for the last post and his exploit in python.

Thanks to all Full-Disclosure fantastic people for be patient with these
last weeks and the Geeklog issues.
