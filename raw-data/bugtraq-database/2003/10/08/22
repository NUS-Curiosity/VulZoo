There's a considerable mileage of GBit/s (3 bit/m) fiber present, with
10 GBit/s (30 bit/m) consumer-grade networking in the pipeline, and ~TBit/s
(3 kBit/m) data rates feasible.

Fiber is perfect FIFO for packets in photonically switched networks.
That way you avoid costly photon-electron-photon conversion, and
can even achieve relativistic cut-through routing/switching with
proper header layout.
