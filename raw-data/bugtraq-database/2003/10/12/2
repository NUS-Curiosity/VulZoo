Subject: buffer overflow in IRCD software



A buffer overflow bug allowing to crash the server has been
discovered. It is exploitable only by local users and affects
all versions of IRCnet IRCD from 2.10 series, up to 2.10.3p3. 

New release has been made, irc2.10.3p4, and is available from
ftp://ftp.irc.org/irc/server/irc2.10.3p4.tgz

Alternatively, one may apply the fix only:
http://akson.sgh.waw.pl/~chopin/ircd/patches/m_join.diff

It is advised to upgrade ASAP, as there are already exploits
in the wild.
