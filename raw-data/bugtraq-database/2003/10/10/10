The image is self explanatory...

--- [Description] ---
When you click to "any" close, maximize or minimize
button's in windows Xp, [No matter whether it's IE or
a WordPad] surprisingly there is 100% CPU use at the
instant and it continues............ until you release
the button! Moreover, we've noticed if you
continuously click the button for a long time [... not
release it and hold ON ] we've seen gradual/slow rise
in page-file use too...!!!

--- [Conclusion] ---
Hell... local DoS! That could be used by employees
working at different terminal..... (O;
