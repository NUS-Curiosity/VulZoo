Subject: RE: Student faces suit over key to CD locks


It has now been drawn to my attention that Peter has 'backed down' from
the lawsuit.

I fear that it is too late for that dear Peter. A an officer of a public
company it is unacceptable to throw around 'willy-nilly' lawsuits at
whim.  This affects not only the integrity of the company that you steer
but also causes grave concern to the editors of leading internet publications.
I am some articles ABOUT your proposed lawsuit are now only propagating
through the media wires.  To have you suddenly reverse this within hours
is most selfish and all reporters will now have to scramble to fix the
miss your whim has created.

My suggestion now is two-fold - 1. you relenquish your stewardship immediately,
 you are not fit to run the ship any longer - 2. failing that we shall
endeavour to purchase sufficient shares in the operation to toss you
'willy-nilly' by your ear, out the door.

This is not the way we conduct corporate busines in this day and age,
 you have sullied your company's already less than glistening reputation
and made a mockery of both the security industry and the judicial system
to which we only turn to as a last resort.

My decision is final.
