You may write to "prez" of SunnNNNcoMMMMM Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled peppers here: peter@...ncomm.com or view his gibberish under
a woefully insecure flash infested website here:

http://www.sunncomm.com/asktheprez/asktheprez.asp

Peter has addressed a carefully selected question about "hacking" and
answered it like security is a barbie doll, a "plaything". Perhaps Peter
should not be in the security field judging by his childlike attitude,
 the miserably cartoonish website of his company and the simple fact
that his entursted chore of creating copy-protection mechansims can be
defeated by simply holding down a "KEY". I would suggest whoever has
commissioned or contracted him to produce this farcical product, immediately
penalise not only this pathetic company but also him personally as an
officer pathetic company.

Peter - you have insulted the entire security community with such a ridiculous
product. Kindly refrain from entering this field and stick to something
else.

As a security guru, a multi-billionaire and a fund manager for a top
10 prime bank, I shall be instructing my people to downgrade your stock
as a result of all of this.

I am now even embarrassed to call me peter Peter. Shame on you!

Q: I�ve heard your technology can be hacked. Does that mean it won�t
"work?"  (10/6/2003 7:37:18 PM) 

A: Not at all. People who perform tests on MediaMax and declare it to
be "hackable" don�t understand why it�s there in the first place. Let
me tell you why:

1. All technology can be "hacked" by people wishing to make illegal and
unauthorized use of the content owners� property. Prior to MediaMax,
there was no alternative to the illegal copying and re-copying of music
by users. Now with MediaMax on the CD, honest people have a way of honoring
the artist�s wishes regarding how and where the music property can be
copied and shared.

2. MediaMax was designed to put a structure on the CD, itself, that empowers
consumers to make licensed, legal and yes, limited copies of the music.
The world has never seen anything like it before.

3. Thieves attempting to circumvent the technology for the purpose of
re-distributing the music are breaking the law. Nothing will ever stop
these thieves. They�ve rationalized the theft and they will always be
looking for ways to cheat the system.

4. The goal of MediaMax was not to invent the "holy grail" (since one
does not exist). The idea was to provide users with a way to legally
use the CD, whether that be for copying or sharing the music. The difference
between using our implanted technology or ripping the music for re-distribution
is the difference between withdrawing money from your bank or robbing
it.

5. If you owned technology that allowed you to transport the money from
your local bank to your living room, doesn�t give you the right to do
it. Music is much the same. As a consumer, you purchase the "listening
rights" to the music on the CD, not the duplication rights. 

6. No matter how much stealing (called "sharing" to make thieves feel
better about themselves)goes on, it�s still taking the copyrighted property
of others and converting it to one�s own use.

7. The current version of MediaMax is like any software technology in
Version 1. The next version will make it tougher and tougher to circumvent.
We have to start somewhere and progressive record companies like BMG
and others understand this.

8. Meanwhile, honest people, may, for the first time, enjoy the pleasurable
experience of legal and licensed copying and sharing of their music -
 that�s about 95% of us. That�s who we designed MediaMax for.

9. So-called "experts" who grandstand by publishing MediaMax hacks don�t
"get it." They seem to born out of some Messiah complex hell-bent on
saving the world from any technological attempt to protect artists and
their property. It�s as though they think that music is different from
other real property. It isn�t, and the people who subvert the protection
that is afforded by MediaMax, no matter how trivial they deem that protection
to be, are conspiring to commit theft against the wishes of the artists
who created the musical property. 

10. With MediaMax, we have a technology that plays on virtually every
device and allows both copying and sharing, yet some think our technology
is worthless based on how easy or hard it is to steal and convert the
music property. It�s as though they think that honest people will always
steal if there�s a way to get away with it.

Hackers think circumventing protection technologies is a game. It�s not.
It�s a crime. I�m going to predict they�ve all got a wake-up call coming.

This is how we, a bunch of musicians and artists (and, yes, business
people) at SunnComm feel about what we do.

Thanks for writing,

Peter
