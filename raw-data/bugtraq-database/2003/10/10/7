                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
________________________________________________________________________

Package name:           sane
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:099
Date:                   October 9th, 2003

Affected versions:	9.0, Corporate Server 2.1
________________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the saned daemon, a part of
 the sane package, which allows for a scanner to be used remotely.  The
 IP address of the remote host is only checked after the first
 communication occurs, which causes the saned.conf restrictions to be
 ignored for the first connection.  As well, a connection that is
 dropped early can cause Denial of Service issues due to a number of
 differing factors.  Finally, a lack of error checking can cause various
 other unfavourable actions.
 
 The provided packages have been patched to correct the issues.  sane,
 as distributed in Mandrake Linux 9.1 and higher, have versions where
 the fixes were applied upstream.
