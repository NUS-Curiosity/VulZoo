We started to see traffic at 7:00 AM PST this morning. So the time is
varying. Interestingly enough it wasn't probing all machines on our network,
but only a significant number of them all on the same subnet so propagation
of this worm hasn't peaked yet.

At approx 4:35 EST this afternoon, we started detecting a new variant of
the Nachi worm infecting machines not patched with MS03-039. No details
are available yet, but (as of right now) none of the major virus authors
are posting info.

Does anyone have a copy of this worm already?
