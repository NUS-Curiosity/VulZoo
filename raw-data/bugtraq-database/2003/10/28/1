Subject: Nachi/Welchia/LovSan.D version 2 appears to be spreading



At approx 4:35 EST this afternoon, we started detecting a new variant of
the Nachi worm infecting machines not patched with MS03-039. No details
are available yet, but (as of right now) none of the major virus authors
are posting info.

Does anyone have a copy of this worm already?
