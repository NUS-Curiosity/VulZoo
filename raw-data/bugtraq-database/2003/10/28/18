Subject: FirstClass 7.1 HTTP Server: Remote Directory Listing


FirstClass 7.1 HTTP Server allow the listing of all files under the web
root directory and user web directories. This can be achieved by appending
"/Search" to the URL. The browser will present a file searching form. If
all check boxes (search options) are selected, and the filename text box
is left blank, all files will be shown in the results and can be viewed
through the browser.

This vulnerability can disclose a huge amount of information about the
servers setup which will aid attackers in exploiting further holes in the
server.

Exploits:
http://SERVER/Search
http://SERVER/~Account%20Name/Search

Regards,
	Richard Maudsley
