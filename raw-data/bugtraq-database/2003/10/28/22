Subject: Re: Mac OS X vulnerabilities


I couldn't find any security contacts on apple.com that didn't look fee-based so
I am asking here in response to these latest disclosures of security
vulnerabilities in Mac OS X.

When most vendors are notified of security vulnerabilities in their products,
they produce a patch for the affected versions of the software and distribute it
for free. Does Apple plan to distribute a free patch for these security
vulnerabilities to Mac OS X 10.2, or will my clients have to spend $129 per
workstation (the single user upgrade price) to have their Apple computer stay
secure?
