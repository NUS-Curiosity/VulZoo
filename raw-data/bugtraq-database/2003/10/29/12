All this issue depends on how suspicious you are really.

One could say that @stake waited till Panther 10.3 came out to release
the Security alert and therefore push the sales of the new system. Or
you could argue that it was an unlucky coincidence that with the new
release there were quite a few security bugs apearing.

So apple might have had to make a decision as to how the path work has
to be done, and in all the hectic some things must have gone "wrong"
e.g. no mentions about fixing 10.2 and so on.

Anyway, I do hope that Apple is going to patch 10.2 and I think they
will, they went the *nix/"OpenSource" way so now they have to walk the
route and adapt the philosophy that comes with it.

Greets,

Steve Clement
