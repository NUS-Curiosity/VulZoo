Subject: Re: Root Directory Listing on RH default apache


You can fix it by changing the line to:
<LocationMatch "^/*$>

On the other hand, if youc an guess the name of any directory without
it's own index.html file, you'll still get a listing.  If you're worried
about people seeing your directories, you should turn off the feature
entirely.
