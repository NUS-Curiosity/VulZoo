Subject: NINCOMPOOPERY OF MICROSOFT


"Hackers are criminals" Most, he notes, release their malicious code
after patches for Microsoft software have been released, meaning that
they are simply reverse engineering to exploit security weaknesses or
holes in software. - Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer 

'ninkum`poop [n]  a stupid foolish person See Also: simple, simpleton


Microsoft has claimed that the majority of the security bugs reported
by the company�s software users have been traced back to the code provided
by the third party software vendors

Almost 90 per cent of the problems, that are reported by the users as
part of our automated feedback system, come from the code that is not
provided by Microsoft.� - Chief Technology Officer Craig Mundie
