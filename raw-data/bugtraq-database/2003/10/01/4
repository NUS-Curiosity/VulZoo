GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200309-19

� � � � � PACKAGE : openssl
� � � � � SUMMARY : vulnerabilities in ASN.1 parsing
� � � � � � �DATE : 2003-10-01 14:48 UTC
� � � � � EXPLOIT : remote
     GENTOO BUG # : 30001
� � � � � � � CVE : CAN-2003-0545 CAN-2003-0543 CAN-2003-0544

DESCRIPTION

quote from OpenSSL advisory:

"1. Certain ASN.1 encodings that are rejected as invalid by the parser
can trigger a bug in the deallocation of the corresponding data
structure, corrupting the stack. This can be used as a denial of service
attack. It is currently unknown whether this can be exploited to run
malicious code. This issue does not affect OpenSSL 0.9.6.

2. Unusual ASN.1 tag values can cause an out of bounds read under
certain circumstances, resulting in a denial of service vulnerability.

3. A malformed public key in a certificate will crash the verify code if
it is set to ignore public key decoding errors. Public key decode errors
are not normally ignored, except for debugging purposes, so this is
unlikely to affect production code. Exploitation of an affected
application would result in a denial of service vulnerability.

4. Due to an error in the SSL/TLS protocol handling, a server will parse
a client certificate when one is not specifically requested. This by
itself is not strictly speaking a vulnerability but it does mean that
*all* SSL/TLS servers that use OpenSSL can be attacked using
vulnerabilities 1, 2 and 3 even if they don't enable client authentication."

SOLUTION

it is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
dev-libs/openssl upgrade to a fixed version.

make sure that the version to be installed is atleast 0.9.6k(stable)
or 0.9.7c(masked).

emerge sync
emerge openssl -p
emerge openssl
emerge clean
