			SCO Security Advisory

Subject:		OpenServer 5.0.7 : OpenSSH: multiple buffer handling problems
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-SCO.24
Issue date: 		2003 October 1
Cross reference: 	sr884749 fz528324 erg712436 CERT VU#33362 CERT VU#602204 CAN-2003-0693  CAN-2003-0786 CAN-2003-0695 CAN-2003-0682
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	 Several buffer management errors and memory bugs are
	 corrected by this patch. 
	 
	 The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project 
	 (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the following
	 names to these issues. CAN-2003-0693, CAN-2003-0695,
	 CAN-2003-0682, CAN-2003-0786. 
	 
	 The CERT Coordination Center has assigned the following 
	 names VU#333628, and VU#602204.

	 CERT VU#333628 / CAN-2003-0693: A "buffer management error"
	 in buffer_append_space of buffer.c for OpenSSH before 3.7
	 may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
	 causing an incorrect amount of memory to be freed and
	 corrupting the heap, a different vulnerability than
	 CAN-2003-0695 
	 
	 CAN-2003-0695: Multiple "buffer management errors" in 
	 OpenSSH before 3.7.1 may allow attackers to cause a denial 
	 of service or execute arbitrary code using (1) buffer_init 
	 in buffer.c, (2) buffer_free in buffer.c, or (3) a separate 
	 function in channels.c, a different vulnerability than 
	 CAN-2003-0693. 
	 
	 CAN-2003-0682: "Memory bugs" in OpenSSH 3.7.1 and earlier, 
	 with unknown impact, a different set of vulnerabilities 
	 than CAN-2003-0693 and CAN-2003-0695. 
	 
	 CERT VU#602204 / CAN-2003-0786: Portable OpenSSH versions 
	 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1 contain multiple vulnerabilities in the 
	 new PAM code. At least one of these bugs is remotely 
	 exploitable (under a non-standard configuration, with 
	 privsep disabled). OpenServer is not configured to use PAM, 
	 so is not vulnerable.


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions
