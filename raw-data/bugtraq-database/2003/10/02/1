 Vunerability(s):
 ----------------
 1. reverse tracerouting

 fingerprinting / discovery vunerability
 allowing intranet ( LAN ) mapping by way
 of Visualroute servers being
 accessed from the internet ( WAN )

 Description of product:
 -----------------------
 VisualRoute Server adds Web server functionality so that  multiple users
 can easily access the server via a Web browser,  regardless of their
 location.
 Traces originate from the VisualRoute Server system
  and may be run back to the end-user location or to
  any other IP address or Web server.



 VUNERABILITY / EXPLOIT
 ======================
 the core issue here is that by specififying an internal ip
 such as 192.168.0.*, 10.*.*.*, or 172.18.18.*
 or any other reserved ( private ) address you are
 able to map the internal lan structure via an external
 ( WAN ) address from the internet.


 standard trace route example:
 ------------------------------

 standard traceroute server request

 requesting a trace to from exploitlabs.com
 to a Visualroute Server we may see..

 output..

 12.230.0.205 ( exploitlabs.com )
 12.244.x.5 - isp router
 24.x.200.x - target isp router
 24.x.240.2 - target

 destination reached in bla seconds - complete
 packet loss 0%

 now on a Visualroute Server the originating
 trace begins at the target server, traces through
 routers to dest.

 so for example asking a server running Visualroute Server
 the same request we get

 24.x.240.2 - target ip
 24.x.200.x - target isp router
 12.244.x.5 - isp router
 12.230.0.205 ( exploitlabs.com )

 let us now assume the same target/Visualroute Server
  is behind a router/switch with port forwarding to the  Visualroute
 Server daemon

 192.168.0.2 - target originating system
 192.168.0.1 - target router / switch
 24.x.200.x  - target ip
 24.x.240.2  - target isp router
 12.244.x.5  - isp router
 12.230.0.205 ( exploitlabs.com )

 now we can discover the lan topology
  the traceroure was initiated from,
  as the origin of the trace is internal
  to the originating Visualroute Server


 Local:
 ------
