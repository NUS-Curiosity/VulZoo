Subject: NASA WebSites Multiple Vulnerabilities ADVISORY opened to public access ( NASA websites Patched )


Hello friends,
I'm happy and sad in the same time.
The NASA websites are patched but they didn't contacted me after i sent the
access instructions to advisories, so,
i have now the advisory open and a complete action-mail/advisory log for
probe and provide the communication
between NASA staff and me.
__ ACCESS INFORMATION __

__ <<<EOF __

That's all , about one week of work and a very short and strange
communication between NASA staff and me.
NOTE: not all the things are patched but i think that the most important ,
it's very possible that
the NASA staff will ignore some security holes....
Best regards to all people of Full-Disclosure , Nasa staff ( John ! ) ;-) ,
every body...
