			SCO Security Advisory

Subject:		OpenLinux: wget: Buffer overflow 
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2003-025.0
Issue date: 		2003 October 03
Cross reference: 	sr883607 fz528216 erg712410 CAN-2003-1565
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	wget is a freely available network utility to retrieve files
	using HTTP and FTP. 

	Stefano Zacchirol found a buffer overflow vulnerability in the 
	code that handles URLs in wget. An attacker can create a long 
	(more than 256 characters), specially crafted URL that when 
	parsed by wget can cause the execution of arbitrary code or 
	program misbehavior. The packages included in this update fix 
	the problem by unconditionally terminating long URLs
	in all cases. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
	has assigned the name CAN-2003-1565 to this issue.


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Package
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	OpenLinux 3.1.1 Server		prior to wget-1.8.2-1.i386.rpm
	OpenLinux 3.1.1 Workstation	prior to wget-1.8.2-1.i386.rpm


3. Solution

	The proper solution is to install the latest packages. Many
	customers find it easier to use the Caldera System Updater, called
	cupdate (or kcupdate under the KDE environment), to update these
	packages rather than downloading and installing them by hand.
