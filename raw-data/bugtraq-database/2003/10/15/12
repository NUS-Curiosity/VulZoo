Subject: Microsoft got it wrong


Only last month in USA Today, Microsoft was claiming that Windows Messenger
didn't represent a security hazard:

   Pop-ups assail through Windows
   http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-09-24-popups_x.htm

   Microsoft views pop-up boxes as a benign nuisance 
   that does "not pose a security risk," says Greg Sullivan, 
   product manager for Windows. 

Looks like Microsoft crystal ball is pretty fuzzy.  Windows Messsenger is
just the sort of seldom-used feature that should be turned off by default in
Windows XP.
