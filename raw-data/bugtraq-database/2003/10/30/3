Subject: Re: Shortcut...... may cause 100% cpu use!!!


hi,
well, dude... Its a similar bug but not the same!!! do you consider every bufferoverflow exploit the same???


see... you didn't read the shit clearly !!! WELL, here [in this discovery] the shortcut is pointing to itself........ 

[ not to a different file...... as you inicated in.......http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/315151] ya..... IF YOU MAKE A TWO SHORTCUT THAT POINT TO EACHOTHER, <at the moment i am using winxp> nothing happens......[ i feel its patched]


BUT THE POINT HERE IS....... THE SHORTCUT IS POINTING TO ITSELF  WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A DOS!!!

PLEASE READ IT BEFORE YOU POST!!!
