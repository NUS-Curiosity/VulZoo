This vulnerability is much ado about nothing
It was caused by developers of shareware using third party installers 
which changed the permissions on certain
directories of MacOS X.

Problem largely solved with the increased use of Apple's installer

AND

problem is easily fixed by adding this command to a root cron job.

diskutil repairpermissions /

Above command can be run every day for your paranoia protection ;-)
