As I mentioned to Thor in my previous e-mail (and got rejected by list admin 
because he thought I missed exactly that point), we should expect Apple 
patching 10.2 as well, because it still hasn't reached its EOL. I don't think 
Apple wouldn't release a patch for 10.2 but instead tell their customers to 
upgrade to 10.3. Such step is something that even  Microsoft would fear of 
doing. It means simply rejecting huge userbase, essentially telling them to 
upgrade or be damned. No one with sane mind would do that, for it would lead 
to migrating to other platforms, and there's nothing on the server side that 
Mac OS X can give and Linux or BSD can't (expect the price and some other 
restrictions). 
But, as you said, Apple is still new in this U*x business (but Steve isn't! 
Remember NeXT!), but I'm sure they'll follow the business line of everyone 
else. Their user base is too precious to them to be lost because of 
arrogance.
