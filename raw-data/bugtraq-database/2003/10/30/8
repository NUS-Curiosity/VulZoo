Subject: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Led-Forums




Product: Led-Forums 
Versions: Beta 1 
Vulnerability: XSS- and redirection-Bug 
Date: October 30, 2003 
Discovered by: ProXy <proxy@...luded.org> 

1. - XSS-Bug 

The Welcome-Message of the Led-Forums software could be changed by everybody. 
Normal Text, HTML and Javascript it's all allowed! :) 

eg: 
  http://host/~path/index.php?top_message=&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt; 
  http://host/~path/index.php?top_message=<h1>OWNED?%20*g*</h1> 

--
2. - Redirection-Bug 

HTML-tags are allowed in topic-names as well as Javascript. 
So if anybody insert the following JS-code in the topic-field of a new thread 
the complete forum-category would be redirected to the adress the attacker indicates. 

&lt;script&gt;window.location='http://www.excluded.org'&lt;/script&gt;
