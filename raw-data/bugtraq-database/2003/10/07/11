Synopsis:          Updated SANE packages fix remote vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:278-01
Issue date:        2003-10-07
Updated on:        2003-10-07
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:

Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0773 CAN-2003-0774 CAN-2003-0775 CAN-2003-0776 CAN-2003-0777 CAN-2003-0778

1. Topic:

Updated SANE packages that resolve a number of vulnerabilities with the
saned daemon are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.1 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.1 for iSeries (64 bit) - ppc
Red Hat Linux 7.1 for pSeries (64 bit) - ppc
Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386, ia64
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

SANE is a package for using document scanners.

Sane includes a daemon program (called saned) that enables a single machine
connected to a scanner to be used remotely.  This program contains several
vulnerabilities.

NOTE: Although the SANE packages include this program, it is not used by
default under Red Hat Linux.

The IP address of the remote host is only checked after the first
communication occurs, causing saned.conf restrictions to be ineffective for
the first communication.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0773 to this issue.

A connection that is dropped early causes one of several problems.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the names CAN-2003-0774, CAN-2003-0775, and CAN-2003-0777 to these issues.

Lack of error checking can cause various other unfavorable consequences. 
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names CAN-2003-0776 and CAN-2003-0778 to these issues.

Additionally, the updated packages for Red Hat Linux 8.0 include a fix for
a bug that could cause hardware damage to Epson 1260 scanners.  Releases
prior to Red Hat Linux 8.0 are unaffected by this issue.  Red Hat Linux 9
is affected by this, but will be covered by a separate advisory.

Users of SANE (particularly those that use saned for remote scanner access)
should upgrade to these errata packages, which resolve these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:
