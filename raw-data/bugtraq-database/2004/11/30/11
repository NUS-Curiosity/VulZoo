Subject: Re: Privilege escalation flaw in MDaemon 7.2.


When I tested things it was on MDaemon 6.8

Excuse me... they did respond and it was LESS than a year ago. =]. Here 
is how it went:

Hello!

I have sent this on to the developers.

However, the issue you describe would require a user to have a valid
login and physical access to the machine.  With both of those, they can
login to the server and access the MDaemon GUI, which can also be
further secured with a password.  I'm not dismissing your submission,
just providing feedback.

If you have any questions, please let us know.  Thanks!

Thanks much... any time estimate on the fix? It sounds as if it may have 
a low priority since its being added to a list.
