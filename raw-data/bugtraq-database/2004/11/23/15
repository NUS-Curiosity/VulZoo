Subject: IPFront - Release


Hi people,

I'm releasing today a small tool named IPFront which enables users to
generate IPSec rules easily. It really speeds-up the process of
hardening Windows 2000/2003 in Bastion Host Environment.

Additionally, it allows to set-up IPSec exceptions, and enables a
couple of TCP/IP Stack protections against DoSes.

So, IPFront is nothing more than a small Frontend/GUI that writes
small scripts that one can later execute from within IPFront, or
externally, as simple script files, in other servers, to apply a same
set of parameters to a pool... or whatever you want to use that for.

It was developed as a HTA application, so you need at least MSIE 5.5
SP1 to run it. (Sorry).

Give it a try, I hope you will enjoy and find it useful.

Get it at:
