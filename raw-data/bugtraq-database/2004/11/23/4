You do realize that some people consider investigation and research to 
be connected and that, if there is any implication of a problem (whether 
the all-knowing creationist agrees or not) that that problem should be 
"looked into" (does that better suit your vocabulary?)....

So, what you're really saying is that you're not willing to back an 
investigation until an investigation is done which shows that an 
investigation is warranted, correct?

Well, of course you'd believe that!  It's politically expediant for you.  :)
