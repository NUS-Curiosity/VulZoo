Can some BugTraq-er help me here please: give an example where triggering
an automount has security implications? [Can a security compromise of the
mountee compromise the security of the automount machine? Does it make a
difference if the automount is triggered by a "plain" user access or a
rootly one, or are there ever mountpoints that only root has access to?]

What do you mean by automounts being an optimization? I would have thought
that permanent mounts are less resource-demanding than active mounting and
expiring; I thought that automounts were a convenience when the mountee may
not be permanently available.

Would find triggering automounts impact performance? Would it cause delays
or blocks if the mountee was not online?
