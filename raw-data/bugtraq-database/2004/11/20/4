Rot 13 may not be strong but rot12 is. I once posted a string that I 
only rotated 12 chars to my blog and it took a month before anyone 
figured it out.... that probably says more about the iq of the people 
reading my blog than the security of rot13.


Adam

Where is it written in the Constitution, in what article or section is 
it contained, that you may take children from their parents and parents 
from their children, and compel them to fight the battles of any war in 
which the folly and wickedness of the government may engage itself? 
Under what concealment has this power lain hidden, which now for the 
first time comes forth, with a tremendous and baleful aspect, to 
trample down and destroy the dearest right of personal liberty? Who 
will show me any Constitutional injunction which makes it the duty of 
the American people to surrender everything valuable in life, and even 
life, itself, whenever the purposes of an ambitious and mischievous 
government may require it? . . . A free government with an uncontrolled 
power of military conscription is the most ridiculous and abominable 
contradiction and nonsense that ever entered into the heads of men.
-Daniel Webster
