Subject: [ECL] WCI TC-IDE embedded linux vulnerabilities


		[	ECL Security R&D	]
  Privilege escalation vulnerabilities in W-Channel embedded linux
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

Type: Local
Impact: Critical
Affected versions: all versions below v1.54


Product description:
-------------------+

Read http://www.tc-ide.com/eng/tcs-index.htm


Summary:
-------+

Local user input handling vulnerabilities exist in WCI's
TC-IDE Embedded Linux that allow local users with access to the
tools provided with the system to spawn a root console,
gaining full control over the running Linux operating system.
In corporate environments where this product is being used,
such vulnerabilities could cause disastrous effects, all users
are encouraged to update to the latest firmware ASAP.


Details:
-------+

We've found three methods of exploitation, explained below:

1) In the Net Tools dialog, type ";crxvt&" (without the quotes),
and click on Discover. A root shell within a virtual terminal
should appear.
	
2) In the PPPoE dailer GUI, type the same as above in the
username field, and click connect.

3) In Opera, click on Menu, then Preferences. In E-mail,
mark the "Use specific e-mail client" radio button,
and type "/bin/dillo" (without the quotes) in the textbox below.
Apply the settings, and close this menu. In the main window,
click on Mail, then Compose. The dillo browser window should
now be launched. Point it to the following address:
"http://localhost/cgi-bin/mycomputer.cgi". Go to the Control Panel,
then User Desktop. Enable "My Computer", then restart your desktop.
You should now have Adminitrator access to most of the settings.
