Paul, do you really feel that as long as the (potentially) fraudulent 
votes did not change the outcome (as far as we know...knowing absolutely 
nothing for certain at this point) it's perfectly ok that a method for 
fixing the e-votes exists and is in use...hypothetically?  I'm just trying 
to understand where you are coming from on this...does it only stop 
becoming an acedemic excersize if the shoe is on the other foot?
