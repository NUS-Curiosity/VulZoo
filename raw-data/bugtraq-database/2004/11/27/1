Not only that ... some of the vendors even try to make you pay for a 
support contract before you can report a security vulnerability. As a 
researcher I can certainly understand his frustration with trying to 
report a bug... sometimes it just gets to ya and you just don't give a 
flying whoot.

Vendors want the researchers to be the scape goat when a vulnerability 
is found... standard procedure is: 1. Brush under the rug. 2. Try to 
make the researcher look like a horrible person. 3. Downplay the 
vulnerability.

Stop trying to kill the messenger. Start holding your vendors 
accountable! Give guys like Skylined a break... hes doing you a favor.

GOBBLE, GOBBLE. Happy Turkey Day!
