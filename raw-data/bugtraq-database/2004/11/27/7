You won't be losing anonymity - just create a Bugzilla account on Yahoo! 
or some other free email service and use that for Bugzilla mail.

Your post also pointed out the benefits of requiring registration, and I 
think they far outweigh the possibility of some bug going unnoticed 
since it was not reported. If you receive a bug report but can't 
reproduce it, and you can't communicate with the reporter, you can't do 
anything but ignore that report.

And if it was not important enough for anyone to register and file the 
bug, then maybe it wasn't important enough to fix.

But still, having said all this, the Mozilla Foundation is working on 
finding alternative ways for people to file bug reports, and make it easier.
