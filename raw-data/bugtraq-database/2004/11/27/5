Oddly enough this is a full disclosure list, your entitled to your
opinion and I'm entitled to mine.  Skylined released something, if he
didn't do it, someone else would have come along.  Since he did
release it, it's out in the open and the claims that this is no big
issue are of course proven wrong.  You can sit in your comfy herman
miller chair and make assumptions about young talented fellas who have
no direction and think the world owe them something. At the end of the
day what it comes down to is a talented guy released information that
helped educate people.  Sure that information can be used for negative
purposes, thats life, deal with it.  After all isn't that why your in
YOUR profession as you quoted in earlier emails is all about.  Perhaps
Skylined released something that may actually make you do some work...
 ?

And yeah yeah yeah, virus this, virus that!  That's why security
professional get paychecks.


Welcome to the playground..  Quack Quack..
