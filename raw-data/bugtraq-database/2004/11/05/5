               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated foomatic package fixes security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:2076
Issue date:        2004-11-05
Product:           Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=2076
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0801
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated foomatic packages that fix an arbitrary command execution
vulnerability are now available.

Foomatic is a comprehensive, spooler-independent database of printers,
printer drivers, and driver descriptions.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Sebastian Krahmer reported a bug in the cupsomatic and foomatic-rip
print filters, used by the CUPS print spooler. An attacker who has
printing access could send a carefully named file to the print server
causing arbitrary commands to be executed as root. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0801 to this issue.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

5. Bug IDs fixed:

http://bugzilla.fedora.us - 2076 - CAN-2004-0801 - cupsomatic, foomatic
arbitrary command execution

6. RPMs required:

Fedora Core 1:

SRPM:
http://download.fedoralegacy.org/fedora/1/updates/SRPMS/foomatic-3.0.0-21.5.legacy.src.rpm

i386:
http://download.fedoralegacy.org/fedora/1/updates/i386/foomatic-3.0.0-21.5.legacy.i386.rpm

7. Verification:

SHA1 sum                                 Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
