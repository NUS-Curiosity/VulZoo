THREAT ALERT   from the ENERGY ISAC
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Record 1 of 1
Hacker Group back again, this time claiming to have source code to Cisco PIX firewall

Advisory ID:    2004-11-018

Date/Time Reported (GMT):    11/4/2004 9:45 PM

Title:    Hacker Group back again, this time claiming to have source code to Cisco PIX firewall (https://www1.energyisac.com/?requestUrl=..%2fcontent%2fview.aspx%3fPageID%3di6084%26Id%3d369816)

Risk:    2

Type of Threat:    Piracy of Software

Business Impact:    N/A

Summary:    
The Source Code Club (SCC) is reportedly back in business.  Last July the anonymous hacker group began peddling proprietary source code to an older version of Enterasys Network's Dragon IDS software (refer to ISAC Advisory ID 2004-07-061).  SCC appears to have resurfaced, this time claiming to have a copy of the source code for a recent version of Cisco System's PIX firewall.

A member of the SCC posted a message to the alt.gaps.international.sales Usenet newsgroup on Monday, November 2nd, stating that the group is now selling the code for the PIX 6.3.1 firewall firmware for $24,000.  Cisco released the latest version (6.3.4) of the firmware this summer.

Technology:    

Description:    
The following text was extracted from the SCC members (aka Larry Hobbles) posting:

SCC is proud to announce the general availability of Cisco Pix 6.3.1 source
code.  This release is significant because pix is vital to the security
of many ultra-secure networks.

With the ubiquity of pix devices these days, we see a huge market for such
code.  Many intelligence agencies/government organizations will want to
know if those 1's and 0's in the pix image really are doing what was
advertised.  You must ask yourself how well you trust the pix images you
download to your appliance from cisco.com.

After reading the code, you may build the source code with one of the many
Makefiles provided in the distribution to create your own in-house pix images.
Sleep well at night knowing exactly what is sitting in your pix device's
memory.  Scroll down to the Buy section below for more information.

The price of Enterasys IDS and Napster has been raised.

SCC is a dynamic entity, always evolving and trying out new ways of doing
things.  We have made a few changes in the way we operate, all for the 
better.

We are now offering some buyer incentives.  After you purchase one full
source from SCC, you become a private member.  Private members get access
to lists of sources that are not available to the general public.  This
list may contain sources that have been deemed to sensitive to put up 
for public buying, or it may contain sources that we plan on releasing
in the future to public buyers.  Private members not only get many months
advance buying power to the sources, but will also pay less for sources
than non-members.

The source you purchase to become a private member can be any source, no
matter how cheap or expensive.  This means you will purchase every 'part'
of the source before becoming a private member.

We keep track of who is a private member by your PGP public key.  This way
a customer may always approach us from any anonymous place, and we can 
always verify he/she is a member by the public key.  So do not destroy those
PGP keys!
