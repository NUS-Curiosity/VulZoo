I wouldn't trust anything coming out of Bezerkley without confirmation from 
competent researchers elsewhere.  Furthermore, their more esteemed 
colleagues at CalTech already disagree with them.

Even *if* they are correct (which is at least debateable) the 130,000 vote 
discrepancy they argue for won't overcome Bush's lead of 380,000, so this 
is, at best, an academic exercise.
