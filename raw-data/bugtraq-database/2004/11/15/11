I don't know how your club works. 

Do you report to MS as well or just within your club that you charge people
to be part of? Has MS responded to you if you did report it? What was their
response that makes WINS a classic example?

That's a good question for your Microsoft sales rep. If you want technical
details, Immunity has a working and reliable Wins exploit in the
Vulnerability Sharing Club version of CANVAS. I think there's an interesting
difference between how the Linux community handled the recent kernel bugs,
and how Microsoft and other commercial vendors handle all bugs.
