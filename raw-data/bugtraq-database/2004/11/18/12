Subject: EXEC exploit in phpBB - fix


Following additional information supplied to us by a party other than
"howdark.com" we can confirm the existence of a serious exploit in phpBB, in
all versions below 2.0.11.

We will not post concept of proof information given the seriousness of this
issue. Unfortunately howdark.com group have chosen to as a personal vendetta
against phpbb.com.

We are preparing full, changed files and patch based releases which fix this
issue (and several other bugs/issues). While we are testing this we urge all
phpBB users to implement the fix given in the following announcement at
phpbb.com:

http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=240513

Please spread this information far and wide, all hosting providers if
possible please inform your users. Anyone copying the howdark.com exploit
_please_ ensure you also include details of the fix noted in the above post!

PS: Thanks to the bugtraq moderators for moderating out a previous post of
mine, ta muchly for that :)
