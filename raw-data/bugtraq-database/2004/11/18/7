Surely you're joking, Mr. Gangstuck.  You can't seriously be telling us
you sat on this for no less than 18 months, without telling anybody about
it.

Actually, I somewhat doubt you even discovered this yourself --- what with
this very bug having been posted to cscope's bugtracker on 2004-11-09.

Actually, we've been notified 11 days ago, and apparently not by you.

[... there doesn't seem to be a "second", to that first...]

Anyway, you're right, the vulnerability is there.  Unfortunately your
patch is not quite sufficient to close it, because you overlooked 
that temp2, one of the two predictable filenames, is also used to
construct an output redirection for a shell command run by cscope.

Even if all the snow were burnt, ashes would remain.
