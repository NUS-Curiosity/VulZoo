He he, there's about as much chance of that as there is the voting
machines getting their 'specs' published.

Maybe it'll get leaked on the net and we'll find out they use a hard
coded DES key that I could crack with my casio watch ;)

But of course it isn't going to stop, and the security vendor with the best technology is as likely to win contracts in transportation security as in any other industry. (Not)
