Subject: Re: Evidence Mounts that the Vote Was Hacked


I am positive the fraud has been going on for quite some time, likely all 
along.  As the amount of detailed data available in electronic format 
increases so does the ability to quickly and easily analyze, allowing for 
better cause to effect correlation.  When elections are not close few take 
the time to analyze the data and if they do they are likely to report their 
results in obscure locations long after the event.  In this particular case 
the reported results did not match up well with the latest polls which 
encouraged even more scrutiny.  If this additional focus is bringing to 
light inconsistencies that have been going on for decades, why should they 
be dismissed just because they have been happening all along?  With better 
information and motivated researchers (not _all_ are partisan) perhaps 
there will be enough interest to finally shed some light in this dark and 
murky process.  I can at least hope and pray that it will be so.
