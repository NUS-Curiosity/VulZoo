Why would anyone place any credibility in exit polls? They were wildly
inaccurate in 2000 as well, and they didn't have a great reputation
before that. In blue states too.

It seems to me that whats being postulated is that somehow the
Republicans rigged the result in Florida and that the evidence for this
are discrepencies between exit polls and the final result. But you are
saying the Republicans exit polls matched the final result.

I wonder what William of Occam would make of this?
