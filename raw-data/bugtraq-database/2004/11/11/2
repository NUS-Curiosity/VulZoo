The exit poll discrepancies had nothing to do with the voting process
whatsoever.  The exit poll problems were due to a new methodology
designed to discern how the polled person voted.

If you look at other exit polls, such as the private ones that the
Dems and Pubs used with their own pollsters in all the battleground
states using traditional methods from previous elections, both were
dead on accurate.  In fact, Repubs leaked their exit poll numbers
early for Florida and Ohio before the counts had come in and they were
extremely accurate.
