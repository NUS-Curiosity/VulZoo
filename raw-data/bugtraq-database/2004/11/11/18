If you follow the links in the story there are plenty of anomolies that 
would be statistically impossible if there wasn't rigging.  The Florida 
numbers indicate rigging because you can directly correlate pattern 
differences between the expected vote and the actual counted vote in 
each county.  The variable used to correlate this is the type of voting 
machine.

Since the counties are distributed throughout Florida, there is no other 
explanation for the numbers coming out the way that they did.  The 
implication, of course, is that someone cracked into the Op-Scan central 
tabulator and modified the numbers. 

This isn't reaching, it's what's actually there.  Feel free to check the 
numbers yourself.

The point is that there are questions tied to this.  Election legitimacy 
is important - at least to progressives it is.  Why is that so hard for 
you to understand?

Election legitimacy is a non-partisan issue.  Unless you want to argue 
otherwise, you have no point to make.

p.s.  I find it interesting that you attack others for being partisan 
when you're so clearly partisan you'd have to be blind not to see it.
