We are?

At least some of the machines used had active wireless on them - and I'm
pretty sure that they were *not* on the lookout for somebody out in the
parking lot (or *inside* the next building over) with a laptop and
a Pringle's can.

And how, pray tell, do you get "paranoid enough to watch access" to mean
*anything* when we allow the hacker *physical* *access* *AND* be unsupervised
due to the design of the polling booth?
