Hash: SHA1

Subject:	Potential Remote Denial of Service
CVE #:		CAN-2004-0930
Affected
Versions:	Samba 3.0.x <= 3.0.7

Summary:	A remote attacker could cause and smbd process
		to consume abnormal amounts of system resources
		due to an input validation error when matching
		filenames containing wildcard characters.


Patch Availability
- ------------------

A patch for Samba 3.0.7 (samba-3.0.7-CAN-2004-0930.patch) is
available from http://www.samba.org/samba/ftp/patches/security/.
The patch has been signed with the "Samba Distribution Verification
Key"  (ID F17F9772).


Description
- -----------

A bug in the input validation routines used to match
filename strings containing wildcard characters may allow
a user to consume more than normal amounts of CPU cycles
thus impacting the performance and response of the server.
In some circumstances the server can become entirely
unresponsive.


Protecting Unpatched Servers
- ----------------------------

The Samba Team always encourages users to run the latest stable
release as a defense of against attacks.  However, under certain
circumstances it may not be possible to immediately upgrade
important installations.  In such cases, administrators should
read the "Server Security" documentation found at
http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/server_security.html.
