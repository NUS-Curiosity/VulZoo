The really insidious thing is how they always attempt to claim that 
their version of disclosure policy is "commonly accepted" when nothing 
could be further from the truth. The security community, including most 
security consulting companies, follows a wide range of policies. Most of 
these policies have very little in common with Microsoft's policy, which 
they call "Responsible Disclosure (tm)." Of course, they themselves do 
not practice responsible disclosure to their customers. If they did, 
then EVERY vulnerability they discovered internally would be in an 
advisory. This is how it is done in organizations that truly do want to 
protect their customers, such as the Linux community.

This is another reason why studies comparing Microsoft's security to 
Open Source security are always bizzare. They compare the entire set of 
Linux vulnerabilities to a tiny subset of the bugs Microsoft knows 
about, but pretends other people don't. WINS is a classic example.
