Subject: Retina Vuln Scanner Problems.


Anyone having issues with Retina Vulnerability Scanner 5.0.20.1140 w/ 250 IP
pack?  We are trying to troubleshoot a potential bug and are wondering if
anyone else is experiencing issues. We've never had any problems before with
previous versions.

It appears that it locked all of our user accounts even though it was not
configured to break the passwords.  Our event logs confirmed that the
workstation we were running retina on, tried to access the accounts 10 times
(obviously locking them all at our threshold).
