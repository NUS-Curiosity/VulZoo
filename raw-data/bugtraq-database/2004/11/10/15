Or we can realize that in Windows NT, XP, and above, all "characters" are
two-byte-wide UNICODE characters, and that we're not seeing "[NULs]
inserted between characters" but simply UNICODE characters with very low
ordinals.

It's probably worth pointing out that a large fraction of the 16-bit
UNICODE space is taken up with Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.

In fact, UNICODE codepoint 0x9090 happens to be the Chinese character for
[li3], "winding" or "meandering".  Chinese poetry shellcode, anybody?
