Obviously this can't be fixed by changing the client
software.  The full advisory makes it clear that an
attacker willing to reverse engineer the proprietary
hash used to obscure usernames in Nortel's software
could still exploit this vulnerability.

Interestingly, the advisory claims that the leakage is
inherent in the aggressive IKE protocol.  Does that
mean all other VPN servers using aggressive IKE leak
too?
