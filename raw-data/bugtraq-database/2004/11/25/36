Hi y'all,

to clear some rumours about Opera 7.54:

The opera guys use their own binding from javascript to java, which does not
conform to the java plug-in. Moreover they expliclity allowed access to the
sun.* packages in the default security configuration, so there is no need
for a magic exploit.  I reported that misery to opera on the 1st of
september, so they should be aware of their java problems.

Remember that java 1.4.2_04 (and less) driven applets also allow covert
channels between applets from different sites. This is exploitable by a
second order attack where a shared public variable in the XSLT processor can
be used by a passive attacker. He is able to inject a piece of sleeping java
code in the JVM which gets executed when the XSLT processor is invoked.
There is an Sun advisory out there that came out in august, that warns
about the issue.

Java 1.4.2_05 also has a vulnerability in the serialization APIs (used by
RMI) that allows to overload a remote JVM [and drive uptime loads
to the 100s]. I reported that to Sun on the 11th of April.
It is fixed in 1.4.2_06, too.

P.S.: Have phun with java, but maybe you should consider
python for productivity.
