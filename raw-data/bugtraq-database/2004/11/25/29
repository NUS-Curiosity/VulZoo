So instead you unleash it upon kiddie and spammer world? That's lovely.

Next you will come by again and say: "I'm still hoping I get to see the 
guy who wrote those MyDoom worms in court, he violated the GPL and 
spread millions(?) of copies of my (modified) source)."

So, you release it like you did and, expect what?

Some people are advocates of this or that disclosure mechanism, and 
believe they are right. I can bite.
You just say: "I'm so cool. I will release this, get a ton of attention 
and then say 'hey! They violated GPL! How dare they?!'"

Full disclosure. Responsible disclosure (according to whoever). 
Non-disclosure. Fine. What are you doing?

	Gadi.
