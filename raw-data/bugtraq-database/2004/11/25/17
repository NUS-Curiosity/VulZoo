Subject: Re: Sun Java Plugin arbitrary package access vulnerability


After installing a new version of the JRE on two machines, IE and
Firefox both report the plug-in as 1.4.2_06.  For browsing to unknown
sites, it would appear that there is no need to uninstall the older
versions, unless there is a way for the javascript code to call a
lower version of the JRE.   Hopefully, that's not possible.
