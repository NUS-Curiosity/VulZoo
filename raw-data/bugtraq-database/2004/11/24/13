But PATH_MAX is limited and the number of file descriptors is perhaps
not.

(On Solaris, PATH_MAX is 1024 so you require at most 512 file
descriptors to keep the stack of directories: 512 is less than the
default hard limit of 65536 file descriptors per process [S9, S8
and before used 1024, still >> 512)
