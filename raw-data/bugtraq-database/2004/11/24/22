I am surprised nobody seems to care about the load balancer which 
allegedly was compromised to redirect the users to the infected site.

Your site quotes the load balancer in question to be of "type FLB02/CP",
but I can find no information of load balancers of the type on the web.

Do you have some information about this load balancer and the exploit
used to attack it?
