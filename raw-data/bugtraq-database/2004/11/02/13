Subject: Medium Risk Vulnerability in WinRAR


Peter Winter-Smith of NGSSoftware has discovered a medium risk
vulnerability within the 'Repair Archive' feature in WinRAR.

WinRAR versions 3.40 and older are vulnerable to this issue.

This vulnerability has now been fixed by RARLabs in WinRAR version 3.41,
and a fix can be downloaded from the official WinRAR website:

http://www.rarlabs.com/

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about this flaw for three
months. Full details will be published on the 2nd of February 2005. This
three month window will allow users of WinRAR the time needed to download
the updated version before the details are released to the general public.
This reflects NGSSoftware's new approach to responsible disclosure.

This vulnerability can be detected by Typhon III - NGSSoftware's advanced
vulnerability scanner.  Typhon III will rapidly detect hosts on your
network susceptible to this vulnerability and enable your organisation to
manage risk. For existing Typhon III customers, please use the Typhon III
update option to include the new vulnerability check.

I (Peter Winter-Smith) would like to personally give thanks and
recognition to the developers of WinRAR for the speed of their delivery
of a fix for this vulnerability.
