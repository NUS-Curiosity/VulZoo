The Debian audit people are not the same as the official Debian 
security team, which is the one in charge of preparing security 
advisories and fixing security bugs in the stable release.
Please read: http://www.debian.org/security/faq

The first group is an internal project that is reviewing parts of 
Debian and submitting bugs to the stable and unstable release, the 
second group fixes only the former, while the later is fixed by the 
package maintainers themselves.
http://www.debian.org/security/audit/

As to this vulnerability, CA-2002-12 is referenced as CAN-2002-0702 
[1], that, based on the page that lists lists vulnerabilities that do 
not affect the current Debian stable release [2] does not apply to the 
dhcp3-server packages. And, indeed, reviewing the comon/print.c file 
in dhcp3-server's source code you can see:

         if (errorp)
                 log_error ("%s", obuf);
         else
                 log_info ("%s", obuf);

instead of the (vulnerable):

         if (errorp)
                 log_error (obuf);
         else
                 log_info (obuf);

Which fixes the issue (see [3]). The code is _not_ present in the dhcp 
packages (version 2.0pl5-11), so they aren't vulnerable to _this_ 
issue either.

That grep line brings a lot of code, some of it might be vulnerable to 
format string attacks, but it's not related to the CERT advisory at 
all. For those not having the code at hand:

$ grep -B 2 -A 2  -rn syslog * | grep -v \"
(...)
common/errwarn.c-73-#ifndef DEBUG
common/errwarn.c:74:  syslog (log_priority | LOG_ERR, mbuf);
common/errwarn.c-75-#endif

Which could be easily fixed to prevent a format string attack (but is 
not and is indeed vulnerable). Maybe this bug is related to 
CAN-2001-0181 (BID-2215). I don't have access to Caldera's code so I 
can review that...
