Subject: zlib 1.2.2 released


(List moderators -- in the previous version of this email I sent you, I 
forgot to include a link to the vulnerability, corrected below.)

Security guardians,

zlib 1.2.2 has been released, which remedies a vulnerability to a 
denial-of-service attack ( http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/238678 ).  
You can get the latest release here:

     http://www.zlib.net/

Note that the "canonical" zlib site at http://www.zlib.org/ has yet to 
be updated by the owner, Jean-loup Gailly, and still shows zlib 1.2.1.  
You should go to the above site for the latest release.  My gpg 
signature on the zlib-1.2.2.tar.gz is attached below.
