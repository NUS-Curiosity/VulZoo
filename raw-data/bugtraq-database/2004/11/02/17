Subject: zlib 1.2.2 released


Security guardians,

zlib 1.2.2 has been released, which remedies a vulnerability to a 
denial-of-service attack ( ).  You can get the latest release here:

     http://www.zlib.net/

Note that the "canonical" zlib site at http://www.zlib.org/ has yet to 
be updated by the owner, Jean-loup Gailly, and still shows zlib 1.2.1.  
You should go to the above site for the latest release.  My gpg 
signature on the zlib-1.2.2.tar.gz is attached below.
