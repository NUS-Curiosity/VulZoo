Subject: Rv: [Full-Disclosure] MSIE <IFRAME> and <FRAME> tag NAME property bufferoverflow PoC exploit (was: python does mangleme (with IE bugs!))


Good job, the xploit works on both my :

IE 6.0.2800.1106 ENGLISH with SHDOCVW.DLL version 6.0.2800.1400
IE 6.0.2800.1106 ITALIAN with SHDOCVW.DLL version 6.0.2800.1584

Tested on both Win XP Professional - SP1 with
latest October patch installed.

The overflow occurs in this point of SHDOCVW.DLL (with EAX = 0D0D0D0D)

7178E69E   8B40 34          MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+34]
7178E6A1   85C0             TEST EAX,EAX
7178E6A3   74 21            JE SHORT SHDOCVW.7178E6C6
7178E6A5   8B75 0C          MOV ESI,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+C]
...
...

EF

PS: after testing the xploit, Windows increased the swap
file dimension sayin' VM memory too low, is this a side-effect of
exploit?
