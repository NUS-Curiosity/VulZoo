Subject: Re: Security flaw in ALCATEL/THOMSON Speed Touch Pro ADSL modems


Dear Gregory Duchemin,

In case of the product like ADSL modem is, it's not a bug, but a leak of
feature  to  secure  DHCP and/or dynamic DNS updates, because it's a way
DHCP  and DNS are supposed to work and it's impossible to fix it without
implementing  protocol  extensions.  This products are targeted for SOHO
(any corporate user already have DNS/DHCP server implemented) where this
kind of attack does not lead to any serious threats.
