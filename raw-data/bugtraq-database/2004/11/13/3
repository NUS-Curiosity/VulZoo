Well.. OK. You have me here.  *THIS* particular model cited below was only on
*display* in our county (apparently, we've bought them, but not in time to
deploy them county-wide - the polling place I personally voted at had 1 of
these in demo mode, and 2 old lever-mechanical machines doing the real work).
However, I'd be most surprised if *none* were actually deployed in this
election in any precincts nationwide....

So I have to conclude that if the manufacturer's documentation on how to
fire the system up *SAYS* it hunts on a wireless network, that if *any* of
these were used in the election, that people were voting on machines that
had wireless on them.

Also, go back and look at the scandal that Diebold got into when they posted
partial results before the polls closed, courtesy of a wireless uplink in
the machines - *THAT* was one of the things they were trying to suppress in
their "copyright of memos" legal battle a ways back.  Were *all* of that model
either pulled from service or had the wireless disabled?

So there you go - at least 2 examples of voting machines that had wireless
on them.

If you can jigger the thing that inputs the votes, you don't need access
to the tabulator, because then you're feeding the tabulator bad things to count.
