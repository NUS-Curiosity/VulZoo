Subject: Multiple XSS holes in TheFaceBook




Authors:    Alex Lanstein, Ivo Parashkevov
Date:       November 12, 2004

 
Affected Software:           TheFaceBook - All Versions
Software URL:                http://www.thefacebook.com
 
TheFaceBook, a popular college networking (social, not technological) tool is vulnerable to many XSS holes in it's search and editing methods.  

In 'Advanced Search', the following fields are vulnerable vi search.php: 
Phone Number,Birthday, Address, Enjoy.
POC
search.php?do_search=1&advanced=1&name=&email=&status=&sex=&year=&house=&room=&mailbox=&phone=<code here>
&Birthday=<code here>
&Address=<code here>
&Enjoy=<code here>

'Group Search' is vulnerable, also through the search.php module
POC
search.php?all_fields=0&do_search=1&advanced=1&group=<code here>

'HighSchool Search' is vulnerable through the global.php module
POC
global.php?do_search=1&high_school=1&state=1&city=2&hsid=1&changed=1&advanced=1&high_school=1&name=<codehere>&hsyear=

The whole profile is also vulnerable.  The automailer may be vulnerable to a sql injection as well ;-)
