Package:             imapd
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= imapd-2.2.9-20041123     >= imapd-2.2.10-20041124
OpenPKG 2.2          <= imapd-2.2.8-2.2.0        >= imapd-2.2.8-2.2.1
OpenPKG 2.1          <= imapd-2.2.6-2.1.0        >= imapd-2.2.6-2.1.1

Affected Releases:   Dependent Packages: none

Description:
  According to a security advisory from Stefan Esser [0], several
  vulnerabilities exist in Cyrus imapd. The updated OpenPKG packages fix
  all these problems.

  When the option "IMAPMAGICPLUS" is activated on a server, the
  "PROXY" and "LOGIN" commands suffer a standard stack overflow,
  because the username is not checked against a maximum length. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-1011 [2] to the problem.

  Due to a bug within the argument parser of the "PARTIAL" command
  buffer positions outside the allocated memory buffer may be accessed.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-1012 [3] to the problem.

  The argument parser of the "FETCH" command suffers a similar bug. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-1013 [4] to the problem.

  Under memory allocation failure conditions the "cmd_append" handler
  supporting "MULTIAPPENDS" may enter code paths doing post increments
  whose behavior is undefined in ANSI C. The same function also suffers
  from a integer wrap. No CVE id.
  
  Another "IMAPMAGICPLUS" overflow was later discovered by Thomas
  Klaeger in proxyd.c "proxyd_canon_user" function. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-1015 [5] to the problem.
  
  Sebastian Krahmer mentioned a missing NUL-termination in global.c and
  provided a patch. No CVE id.
  
  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q imapd". If you have the "imapd" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it [6][7].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [8][9], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [10][11] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [12], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [6] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [7]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.2/UPD
  ftp> get imapd-2.2.8-2.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig imapd-2.2.8-2.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild imapd-2.2.8-2.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/imapd-2.2.8-2.2.1.*.rpm

  Additionally, we recommend that you rebuild and reinstall
  all dependent packages (see above), if any, too [6][7].
