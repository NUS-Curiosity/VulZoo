[snip the rest of useful info on how to post good, healthy, actionable bug
reports]

requiring someone to register to post a bug is harmful in the sense that
you wind up turning off peopl ewho simply can't be bothered to fill out
that info or wish to remain anonymous. while i definitely see the benefit
of forcing registration or even wanting it, i bet you'e losing more bug
reports than you care to imagine this way.

benefits of forcing/encouraging registration include:
	- garaunteed line of followup
	- reduced spam quantities in bugzilla
	- at leasta cutofof "i care enough to ..."

still, you're losing more than you may expect. i know i've failed to file
bug reports (non-security related) for mozilla products due to this "speed
bump". the security@ route is useful, and i'm glad you pointed it out.
this point should be considered by anyone who runs a bug reporting page
for open submissions, you may be doing more harm than benefit.
