Subject: Winamp - Buffer Overflow In IN_CDDA.dll [Unpatched]


========================================================================
= Winamp - Buffer Overflow In IN_CDDA.dll
=
= Affected Software:
=       Winamp 5.05, 5.06
=
= Public disclosure on November 24, 2004
========================================================================

== Overview ==

Hate to be the bearer of bad news.

It appears that the 'patched' version 5.05 does NOT fix the buffer overflow
issue that we notified Nullsoft about. This is obviously not good. 

As we wrote in our advisory we were notified by email that the issue had
been fixed and an update posted to the website. 

We have sent Nullsoft a copy of this email, and hope that they can remedy
this problem quickly. Unfortunately, this may not be the case as was
pointed out to me by somebody.

== Solutions ==

- Disassociate .cda and .m3u extensions from winamp
- Wait for an update
