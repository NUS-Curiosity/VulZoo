Just to note, this bug only affects ZWiki version after Zwiki 0.10.0rc1.

Also, the fix is pretty trivial, apply the following patch to 
standard_error_message in all ZWiki folders (and on disk, so you don't 
have to do it again ;-):

--- standard_error_message.dtml.original        Fri Nov 26 09:17:22 2004
+++ standard_error_message.dtml Fri Nov 26 09:17:55 2004

Sadly, I see I broke the bug tracker, 'cos it's also a ZWiki, and has 
MUCH bigger problems than the above :-S (execution of any DTML in the 
context of (hopefully!) the user that created it along with a total lack 
of html quoting in the page :-(

In short, only use ZWiki if you know what you're doing, and preferably 
only if it's not anonymously accessible...

*sigh*
