Subject: Re: MSIE flaws: nested array sort() loop Stack overflow exception


I don't think this flaw is exploitable.In MSIE, any loop can lead to exception.Just like:

<IFRAME SRC=?>

save it as a html file, open it in IE, in about 30 seconds, it will cause a stack_overflow exception and exit. Because IE will not stop allocating stack buffer, until there is not enough stack space.  

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

>Normally I would see if it's exploitable but I figure I'm not MS's pet bug finder/analyser... So, I've CC'ed this message to Microsoft. I'm sure they know their own product better then I do and can analyse the problem much faster. So if you want to know the impact of this vulnerability, ask them: I'm sure they will be more then willing to help you. I'm sure they will even reply to this message with technical details and a patch tomorrow.
