Yet another? No. You can't be serious.

I'm sure they know their own product better then I do and can analyse the problem much faster. So if you want to know the impact of this vulnerability, ask them: I'm sure they will be more then willing to help you. I'm sure they will even reply to this message with technical details and a patch tomorrow.

Ahh, don't you mean normally you'd get paid for it but somebody decided 
you are too much of a "risk" to work with? Just guessing here. Or maybe 
you release this just to show us you have nothing against Mozilla?

As to "and a patch tomorrow." - who are you kidding? Ever heard if Thor 
Larholm and his mailing list, Unpatched?
If we are lucky, they will patch it secretly in a couple of releases. If 
not, wait 6 months.

As it is IE.. well now, don't say they "violated" GPL when they use your 
stuff again for some virus.

There is more to come? I guess you've been saving up. Is this all about 
teaching us all a lesson?

I appreciate your work, and I appreciate your wishes. I really don't 
appreciate you or how you do things.

It's a shame really.

	Gadi.
