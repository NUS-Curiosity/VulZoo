Not that it's necessarily the case for you, but frequently patching is the
one time when reboots are almost bound to occur - as a result, an awful lot
of bugs are discovered after the patch, but not necessarily because of the
patch.  General advice is to try uninstalling the patch and see if the
problem still exists, before deciding which way to debug - not very easy if
you have all your CPU locked up!

As to the "system process" taking up 99-100% of the CPU, there is a "System
Idle Process" that is _supposed_ to do that.  I hope your coworker hasn't
misconstrued :-)

Try calling PSS (you know, tech support?), and see if they have any ideas.
