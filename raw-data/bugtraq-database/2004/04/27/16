Subject: Re: Apache - all versions vulnerability in OLD procesors.




Hello

    In OLD procesors (i mean like x286 and some version x386) when the sizeof (unsigned long) == sizeof (unsgined int) there is bug becouse it's 2 bytes and... 2*16=32 but i don't have in this time box with that procesors for research this situactions and this is only theory that bug becouse i don't know whether apache we can run on this OLD procesors. Second question is what about new and not standard procesor like 64 bits or alpha, risc and etc. (in this time it's no in standard uses in box). Some calls for functions to copied bytes is given argument like sizeof (sha_info->data) and that write 8*16-64=64 bytes more and not control what can start some conflict in farther run that server.

Best regards Adam Zabrocki (pi3 - pi3ki31ny).
