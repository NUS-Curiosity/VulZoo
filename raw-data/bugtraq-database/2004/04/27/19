And now for the Python Community,

"There exists an exploit in C and Perl, so why do we need another one?!?"

I started with it on Friday, and there were no exploits on Bugtraq. Now it's ready, so why don't publish it :)

Here you can find it  
http://anyplay.tznetz.com/exploits/disconn_py.html

it is IMHO fast, and supports multiple ports too.
