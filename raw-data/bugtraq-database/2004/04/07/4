Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in the way sysstat handles symlinks may allow
an attacker to execute arbitrary code or overwrite arbitrary files

Background
==========

sysstat is a package containing a number of performance monitoring
utilities for Linux, including sar, mpstat, iostat and sa tools

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /   Vulnerable   /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     app-admin/sysstat        < 5.0.2                         >= 5.0.2

Description
===========

There are two vulnerabilities in the way sysstat handles symlinks:

1. The isag utility, which displays sysstat data in a graphical
   format, creates a temporary file in an insecure manner.

2. Two scripts in the sysstat package, post and trigger, create
   temporary files in an insecure manner.

Impact
======

Both vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files
under the permissions of the user executing any of the affected 
utilities.

Workaround
==========

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

Resolution
==========

Systat users should upgrade to version 4.2 or later:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=app-admin/sysstat-5.0.2"
    # emerge ">=app-admin/sysstat-5.0.2"
