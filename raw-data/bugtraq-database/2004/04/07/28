Indeed, the following code crashes IE6 6.0.2800.1106 128bit SP1 when you
load it locally.  Pulled from a webserver, however, it does not.  Tags
mangled intentionally

[HTML]
[BODY][IFRAME src="?"] [/IFRAME]
[/BODY][/HTML]

Locally, it brings up a recursive IFRAME that locks up IE, and it eventually
just stops and closes without any error.
