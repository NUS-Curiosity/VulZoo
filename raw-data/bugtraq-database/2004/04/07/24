Subject: Metasploit Framework 2.0 Released!


The Metasploit Framework is an advanced open-source platform for 
developing, testing, and using exploit code. After nearly six months of 
development, version 2.0 is being released to the public.

This release includes 18 exploits and 27 payloads; many of these exploits 
are either the only ones publicly available or just much more reliable 
than anything else out there.

The Framework will run on any modern system that has a working Perl 
interpreter, the Windows installer includes a slimmed-down version of the 
Cygwin environment. 

Some highlights in this release:
  - Three UI's: CLI, Console, Web
  - Solid multi-stage payload implementation
  - Infinitely chainable proxies (http, socks4)
  - Integrated support for InlineEgg payloads
  - Integrated support for Impurity executables
  - Includes the msfpescan opcode scanner
  - Includes standalone payload generator
  - Includes standalone payload encoder
