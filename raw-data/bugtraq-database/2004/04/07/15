Synopsis
========

The login program included in util-linux could leak sensitive
information under certain conditions.

Background
==========

Util-linux is a suite of essential system utilites, including login,
agetty, fdisk.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     sys-apps/util-linux        <= 2.11                        >= 2.12

Description
===========

In some situations the login program could leak sensitive data due to
an incorrect usage of a reallocated pointer.

NOTE: Only users who have PAM support disabled on their	systems (i.e. -PAM in
their USE variable) will be affected by this vulnerability. By default, this
USE flag is enabled on all architectures. Users with PAM support on their
system receive login binaries as part of the pam-login package, which remains
unaffected.	

Impact
======

A remote attacker may obtain sensitive data.

Workaround
==========

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are advised to
upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.	

Resolution
==========

All util-linux users should upgrade to version 2.12 or later:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=sys-apps/util-linux-2.12"
    # emerge ">=sys-apps/util-linux-2.12"
