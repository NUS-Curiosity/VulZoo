- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It has been reported thru various channel that there are several
security issues affecting ftpd on IRIX.

 * win2k -> irix ftpd hangs indefinitely on link failure (SGI BUG 893718)
 * ftpd DoS possible involving PORT mode                 (SGI BUG 899364)
 * ftpd's ftp_syslog() doesn't work with anonymous FTP   (SGI BUG 909172)

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
resolving this issue.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures
be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.  This issue has been
corrected in future releases of IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.21f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.21f" in
this case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name
is the "version" we refer to throughout this document.


- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.23, or install the appropriate
patches.
