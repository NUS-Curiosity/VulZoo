     I should have been more explicit.  The assumption of guilt
before innocense is a part of French law and has been since Napoleonic
times I believe.  You'll find that Napoleonic law and that which is
derived from it (including Louisiana law) is a very different creature
than that which is derived from English Common Law.  The wording of
the French law doesn't surprise me at all.
