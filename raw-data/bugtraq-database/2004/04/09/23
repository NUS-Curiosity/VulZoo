Subject: ANNOUNCE: SecLegal mailing list


There's often a lot of discussions on security mailing lists about the
legality of security research, proof-of-concept exploits, penetration
testing, war-driwing, reverse engineering, lack of vendor notification,
patent issues, copy protection circumvention and much more. 

Currently, France it outlawing any kind of security research:

Back in January, the WebAppSec mailing list had a discussion about a
patent from Sanctum that claimed to cover all forms of web application
penetration testing:

If you feel like discussiong the legal issues surrounding security
research, I created a mailing list back then called SecLegal for this
very purpose. To subscribe, either visit
