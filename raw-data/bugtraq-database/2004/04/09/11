It does not implement the inter-server portions of the IRC protocol,
and is meant for use by a small workgroup, preferably behind a
firewall."

2. The bug:
------------

The program is unable to manage a lot of not regular strings, in fact
it crashes.

The problem is in the function: hash_strcmp() of hash.c, in which
the program try to manage an unallocated sector of memory.

3. The code:
-------------

To test the vulnerability try to send to the irc server some big and
unregular strings or more simply you can use:

nc [host] 6667 < /dev/urandom
