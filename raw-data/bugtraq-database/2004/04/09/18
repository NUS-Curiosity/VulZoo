Excuse me but I have made an error here (lines 155 and 156) the close()
naturally must be located before the "continue;":

153    {
154        printf ("RSniff Server: Authentication failed!\n");
155        close (new_sockfd);  /* PATCH */
156        continue;
157    }


Sorry again and thanx to Rich to have showed me the error.


BYEZ
