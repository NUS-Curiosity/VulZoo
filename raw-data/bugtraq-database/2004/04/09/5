Synopsis
========

Scorched 3D is vulnerable to a format string attack in the chat box
that leads to Denial of Service on the game server and possibly allows
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Scorched 3D is a game based loosely on the classic DOS game "Scorched
Earth". Scorched 3D adds amongst other new features a 3D island
environment and LAN and internet play. Scorched 3D is totally free and
is available for multiple operating systems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                    /   Vulnerable   /          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     games-strategy/scorched3d         < 37                      >= 37

Description
===========

Scorched 3D (build 36.2 and before) does not properly check the text
entered in the Chat box (T key). Using format string characters, you
can generate a heap overflow. This and several other unchecked buffers
have been corrected in the build 37 release.

Impact
======

This vulnerability can be easily exploited to remotely crash the
Scorched 3D server, disconnecting all clients. It could also
theorically be used to execute arbitrary code on the server with the
rights of the user running the server.

Workaround
==========

A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

Resolution
==========

Scorched 3D users should upgrade to version 37 or later:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=games-strategy/scorched3d-37"
    # emerge ">=games-strategy/scorched3d-37"

============
