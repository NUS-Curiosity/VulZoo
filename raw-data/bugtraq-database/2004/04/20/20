The problem was solved yesterday, the ActiveX control was updated. In
order to 
apply the update, a user has to access the scan online webpage (on 
bitdefender.com or partner sites) and allow the update.

Btw... it would have been really nice not to expose users to this 
vulnerability and let us know prior to making it public.
