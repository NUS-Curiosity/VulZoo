Synopsis:          Updated Subversion packages fix security vulnerability in neon
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:159-01
Issue date:        2004-04-15
Updated on:        2004-04-15
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0179
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated Subversion packages that fix a vulnerability in neon, exploitable by
a malicious DAV server, are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Subversion is a concurrent version control system that uses inbuilt code
from neon, an HTTP and WebDAV client library.

Versions of the neon client library up to and including 0.24.4 have been
found to contain a number of format string bugs.  An attacker could create
a malicious WebDAV server in such a way as to allow arbitrary code
execution on the client should a user connect to it using subversion.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name CAN-2004-0179 to this issue.

This update includes a patch to correct this issue, and an upgrade to
Subversion 0.27.0, the last version which is compatible with the database
schema used by Subversion 0.17.0.  Users of Subversion are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/subversion-0.27.0-2.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/subversion-0.27.0-2.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/subversion-devel-0.27.0-2.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

690c5d22e0f2baaf19f554f3466981b9 9/en/os/SRPMS/subversion-0.27.0-2.src.rpm
2a20d39d786e5ca72617a0719266e01d 9/en/os/i386/subversion-0.27.0-2.i386.rpm
c811a52c5b714e5700afc394f48b4c52 9/en/os/i386/subversion-devel-0.27.0-2.i386.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/team/key.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
