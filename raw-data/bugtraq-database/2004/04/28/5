Vendor's Description:

"DiGi WWW Server is a webserver. It is easy-to-use but also supports
access control, virtual folders and multiple ports. You can use plugin
dll's to add extra functionality. The server can run as a GUI
application and as an NT service."

2. The bug:
------------

The program has a procedure that makes a conversion, it parses the
request strings replacing all the occurrences of slash with backslash.

So if you send to the webserver a crafted big request full of '/',
the server will be freezed by consuming a lot of CPU resources.


Furthermore it's also possible to freeze the server by sending to it a
long http request.

3. The code:
-------------

To test the vulnerability, send to the webserver an http request like:


GET /// [ 660 kb of / ] /// HTTP/1.1
