Eh?

Yes, you are talking about 16-bit processors, where the word size was 16
bits (two bytes), and sizeof(int) == 2.  However, I can't remember any C
compilers for Intel x86 processors where sizeof(long) != 4.  Yes, 'int' was
a 16-bit type, but IIRC, 'long' has always been a 32-bit type (a so-called
DWORD back then) - just as the C standard requires, as others mentioned.

It's not just a matter of processors.  You have to have OS support for
sockets and stuff.  Yes, this can be done under Windows in 16-bit mode or
MS-DOS with the appropriate socket library, like WATTCP -

Still, see above for the reasons this will NOT be a problem even then.
sizeof(long) >= 4, and that's that.

G'luck,
Peter
