Package:             mc
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= mc-4.6.0-20040207        >= mc-4.6.0-20040405
OpenPKG 2.0          <= mc-4.6.0-2.0.0           >= mc-4.6.0-2.0.1
OpenPKG 1.3          <= mc-4.6.0-1.3.0           >= mc-4.6.0-1.3.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a message from Ilya Teterin posted on Bugtraq [0], the
  Midnight Commander application [1] uses a uninitialized buffer to
  handle symlinks in VFS. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary
  code during symlink conversion. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-1023 [2] to the
  problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q mc". If you have the "mc" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get mc-4.6.0-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig mc-4.6.0-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild mc-4.6.0-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/mc-4.6.0-2.0.1.*.rpm
