No, but the RST problem is ovr blown. See below for notes on the SYN related
problem.

I specifically was replying to the RST issue, hence the no comment about
SYN.

The thing to remember about the SYN issue is:

1) most systems/networks/etc have Syn flood protection in place since the
good old days of syn flooding started
2) if you can send several thousand or tens of thousands of Syn packets to
someone you can simply flood the BGP port on one end and have much the same
effect, without the need to guess the client end's port and a sequence
number. As the Cisco guy pointed out if you can generate this volume of
traffic you can pretty much DoS anything without the need to find the magic
sliding window.
