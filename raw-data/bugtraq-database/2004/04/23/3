Subject: Re: [VulnWatch] TCP Reset Attacks: Paper and Code Now Availble


Please note:

According to the Cisco presentation afterwards, Cisco's RST behavior makes
it non vulnerable as there is a wait period after a certain number of bad
RST packets are recieved. Thus Cisco IOS is basically not affected.
