The goals should be categorized, too, as the departing points are.
Preferably, these goals should be modularized out, so you end up with a
set of atomic sub-goals, which can be in turn combined in real
super-goals.  This way, you get just one huge graph, instead of many
(inevitably overlapping) graphs.
