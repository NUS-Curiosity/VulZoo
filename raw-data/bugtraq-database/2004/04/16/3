   Note:  This  issue  affects  systems  with  Outlook Express installed.
   Outlook  Express  is installed by default on most (if not all) current
   versions of Microsoft Windows.


  Security Bulletin MS04-014: Vulnerability in the Microsoft Jet Database
   Engine Could Allow Code Execution (837001)

   This  bulletin  addresses a vulnerability affecting the systems listed
   below.  There  is  a  buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft's Jet
   Database  Engine (Jet). An attacker could take control of a vulnerable
   system,  including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting
   data;  or  creating  new  accounts  that  have  full  privileges. This
   vulnerability has been assigned VU#740716 and CAN-2004-0197.

   Impact

     Remote attackers could execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.

   Systems affected

     * Windows NT Workstation 4.0
     * Windows NT Server 4.0
     * Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
     * Windows 2000
     * Windows XP
     * Windows Server 2003


Update to TA04-099A

   Microsoft  has  released  a  patch  that  addresses  the  cross-domain
   vulnerability  discussed  in  TA04-099A:  "Vulnerability  in  Internet
   Explorer  ITS  Protocol  Handler".  US-CERT  is tracking this issue as
   VU#323070.   This   reference  number  corresponds  to  CVE  candidate
   CAN-2004-0380.

   The  patches  and  further  information  about  the  vulnerability are
   available  in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-013. MS04-013 is titled
   "Cumulative  Security  Update for Outlook Express". Since most (if not
   all)  current  Windows  systems  have  Outlook  Express  installed  by
   default, and the MHTML protocol handler is part of the Outlook Express
   software  package,  most  (if  not  all)  Windows  systems  should  be
   considered vulnerable.

   TA04-099A and VU#323070 focused on the ITS protocol handlers; however,
   the latent vulnerability appears to be in the MHTML handler shipped as
   part of Outlook Express. These documents have been updated.

II. Impact

   Several  of  the issues identified by Microsoft have been described as
   "Critical" in nature.Each bulletin contains at least one vulnerability
   which may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
   systems. The privileges gained would depend on the security context of
   the software and vulnerability exploited.

III. Solution

Apply an appropriate set of updates from Microsoft

   Please  see  the following site for more information about appropriate
   remediation.
