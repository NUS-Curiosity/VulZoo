Subject: After Ms patches last Wed ...






Hi ..

Is anyone else having time problems on their networks?

Yesterday (Thu) I had approx 50% of my users unable to login because "the
time on the client and server are different" and I could not figure out a
way to solve it.  Some people managed to login but could not get access to
shared resources; others could not login at all.  I tried syncing the time
but that didn't work and several other things I tried didn't seem to work.
Having said that, I managed to get them operational after lots of cursing
but I can't say what it was that I did that solved it.  I thought about the
new patches from MS and read all there is about them to see if they affect
logins/Kerberos/time service but it doesn't seem to be the case.

This morning, I found a MS white paper
(http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/docs/_Toc528382509) which explains
how an "Access is denied" message can appear if RPC fails to authenticate
and I started thinking about those patches again.  Can anyone help shed
some light on this?  I fail to believe that I'm the only one on the planet
who got negatively affected by these patches, so either I'm the first to
mention it or I'm the only one with a skewed set of network settings!

Thanks
