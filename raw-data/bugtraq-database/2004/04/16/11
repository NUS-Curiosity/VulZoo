DK> Hello!

DK> I think, I discover some kind of security hole in ZoneAlaram - any version.
DK> The problem is hidding in E-mail Protection. Because I'm form Slovenia (not

DK> extension of course). I think that can be security threat. From this reason
DK> I write to you. If this is mistake, I'm sorry to steal your time with this
DK> e-mail. And sorry for my bad english :)

DK> I write to ZA Labs too, but no answer.
