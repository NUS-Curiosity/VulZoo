What's the propagation method?  Is it through email?

Concerning the new worm type infection spreading around today (6:15am EST)

the file is called ndemon.exe (.99k) and it puts itself into c:\winnt and
c:winnt\system32. Registry entries
HKLM\Software|Microsoft|CurrentVersion\Run and
HKLM\Software|Microsoft|CurrentVersion\RunServices (Think it creates that
one).

At first look:
it then tries to propagate itself via MS ports 135, and 139 VIA known
flaws and password guessing. It also listens for other infected machines
on port 1025 and scans for MS IIS boxes on port 80 (to try known exploits
as well)

The infected machines were win2k SP4 (fully Patched) Running Symantec AV v8.6

Just a heads up
