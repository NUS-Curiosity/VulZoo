Subject: RE: Microsoft's Explorer and Internet Explorer long share name buffer overflow.


Then you probably didnt doit right, me and others such as the secunia people
(www.secunia.com) have tested this
Vulnerability and proved that the systems are vulnerable. Even microsoft
says that the vulnerability was not patched
Until w2k sp4.

I tested this vulnerability in the following full patched systems:

Windows 98            (Vulnerable)
Windows Me            (Vulnerable)
Windows NT (All)      (Vulnerable)
Windows 2k (All)      (Vulnerable)
Windows XP (All)      (Vulnerable)
Windows 2003 server   (Not Vulnerable)

Remember that if you want to test the vulnerability, first you must know how
samba works.   Its not just to paste the example
Config in a smb.conf file, you must create the directory that is pointed in
the share and perhaps have a valid user.

Regards


Rodrigo.-

buffer overflow.

Well, i have tested it in W2k with sp3 and explorer didnt get crashed!!!!!!!

Well, i cant get into the share because a message appears saying "share name
not found"!!!!

But, explorer is OK.
