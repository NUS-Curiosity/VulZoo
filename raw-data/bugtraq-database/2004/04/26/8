In ANSI C the basic types are not defined in terms of bits, however
there is a minimum magnitude required.  An unsigned long is supposed to
hold at least 4294967295, which is 2^32-1.  On most normal platforms,
that means an unsigned long must be at least 32 bits.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
