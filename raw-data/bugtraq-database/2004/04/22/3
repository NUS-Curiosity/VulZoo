Affected software description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

phprofession 2.5
by Aidan Peiser
Recruitment module for PN.712
www.phpsolutions.co.uk	    
https://sourceforge.net/projects/profession/

Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. Full path disclosure:

If we make http request like this:

http://localhost/postnuke0726/modules/phprofession/upload.php

we will provoke php error messages:

Warning: main(header.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in D:\apache_wwwroot\postnuke0726\modules\phprofession\upload.php on line 19
Warning: main(): Failed opening 'header.php' for inclusion (include_path='.;c:\php4\pear') in D:\apache_wwwroot\postnuke0726\modules\phprofession\upload.php on line 19
...


B. Cross-site scripting aka XSS:

Unsanitaized variable "jcode" will open  a way to exploit the XSS in phprofession:

http://localhost/postnuke0726/modules.php?op=modload&name=phprofession&file=upload&jcode=[xss code here]

Remark: successful exploiting of the XSS on PostNuke is possible only, if special measures to evade the
XSS filters are used. 



C. Sql injection:


Typical sql injection case, where injection occurs after ORDER BY keywords. This time the "weak point"
is the vaiable "offset", but i have seen many scripts, where unsanitaized "limit" variable gets
passed to sql query too. Good thing for webmasters (and bad for attackers) is, that in case of MySql
version <= 4.0 there is no practical way to exploit this sql injection, other than failing it. 
Reason is, that after the "ORDER BY" keywords we can't use "UNION" and any other "useful" things.
But in near future, when MySql version 4.1 will be in use, new feature will be present - 
subselects. And then can be possible using of the  "half-blind" and "blind" methods to pull out
any information from database, and that's WITHOUT "union" keyword.
  What's the point? Point is, that this sql injection is in this moment non-critical, but it's
needed to fix as soon as possible.

http://localhost/postnuke0726/modules.php?op=modload&name=phprofession&file=index&offset=foobar

Error in query:
SELECT phpro_joblisting.designation, phpro_joblisting.jcode, phpro_joblocation.location,
phpro_jobsalary.salary, phpro_joblisting.posted
from
phpro_joblisting, phpro_joblocation, phpro_jobsalary
WHERE phpro_joblisting.checked= 1 
AND phpro_joblocation.id = phpro_joblisting.fk_location 
AND phpro_jobsalary.id = phpro_joblisting.fk_salary 
AND DATE_ADD(posted, INTERVAL 80 DAY) > now()
order by posted desc limit foobar,20. 
You have an error in your SQL syntax. Check the manual that corresponds to your 
MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'foobar,20' at line 13
