Subject: Smart Card


Hello,

  A bank I am working with provides a Smart Card which is used on our
clients PC to authorise him to the bank website ... the card stores a
certificate, and also, i think, a private key.

  I am trying to discover if, in the case my clients machine is compromised
(the machine the Smart Card is connected to), what are the possibilities
of observing the smart card data as it is transferred ?

  I think that if the smart card reader (scr) and the client program
(cp) establish a ssl-type connection then the only opportunity to observe
the private key, certificate, is by inspecting the memory of cp. However
I don't believe that this (or any?) smart cards to this ...

  Really appreciate any info anyone has.

Thanks
 -- Michael
