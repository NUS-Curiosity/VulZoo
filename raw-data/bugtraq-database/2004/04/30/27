PLEASE in future notify us before posting bug reports so we can ensure
a fix is in place... The 1.4.3 release which will be out shortly will
fix this issue, along with a number of other XSS issues. While we had
been notified of the issue, we were holding off on announcing the
issue until a fix was in place.
