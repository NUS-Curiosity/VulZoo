For those of you that had problems with the MS Patch...

Microsoft (Quote, Chart) confirmed that disruptive bugs in a recently
issued Windows security patch could cause systems to freeze or lead to
system usage overload.

The buggy patch, issued earlier this month to plug numerous "critical"
vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system, has caused problems for
IT admins because of conflicts with installed drivers.

"[It] causes Microsoft Windows 2000 to try repeatedly to load drivers
that do not load successfully," the software giant said Wednesday,
identifying the drivers as Ipsecw2k.sys, Imcide.sys and Dlttape.sys...

Don't know if this is duplicate info from another message, but there are
two different issues with the KB835732 update. Specifically on Windows
2000 machines. 



The first issue involves cached data in RAM. If a machine is rebooted
immediately after applying the update there is a chance that the BSOD
will come up. The STOP error is described as
DRIVER_IRQ_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. A hard reboot will eliminate this
transient error.



The second issue involves problems with the IPSec Policy Agent Service.
This is enabled to start automatically with the update and it can lead
to the CPU pegging. Stopping the service and disabling it will elimiate
this issue.



Can't say that Microsoft can claim these issues were the result of
updates being rushed to market. Most of the vulnerabilities were brought
to their attention 6 months ago. At least the issues aren't as bad as
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6. That broke the TCP/IP stack and really
had me scrambling back then resuscitating my servers!
