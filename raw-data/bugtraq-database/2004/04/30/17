Package:             proftpd
Vulnerability:       privilege escalation
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= proftpd-1.2.9-20040207 >= proftpd-1.2.10rc1-20040429
OpenPKG 2.0          <= proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.0    >= proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.1
OpenPKG 1.3          N.A.                      none

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  A portability workaround was applied in version 1.2.9 of the FTP
  server ProFTPD [1]. As a side-effect, CIDR based (aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/NN)
  ACL entries in "Allow" and "Deny" directives act like an "AllowAll"
  directive and so FTP clients are granted access to files and
  directories although the server configuration might explicitly deny
  this [2].

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  proftpd". If you have the "proftpd" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) [3][4].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [6] or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [7], build a corresponding binary RPM from it
  [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM
  [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/proftpd-1.2.9-2.0.1.*.rpm
