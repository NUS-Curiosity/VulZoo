Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2004-0024

Package name:      rsync
Summary:           remote file write attack
Date:              2004-04-29
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 1.5
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.0
                   Trustix Secure Linux 2.1
                   Trustix Secure Enterprise Linux 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  Rsync uses a quick and reliable algorithm to very quickly bring
  remote and host files into sync.  Rsync is fast because it just
  sends the differences in the files over the network (instead of
  sending the complete files). Rsync is often used as a very powerful
  mirroring process or just as a more capable replacement for the
  rcp command.

Problem description:
  From the rsync homepage:
  There is a security fix included in 2.6.1 that affects only people
  running a read/write daemon WITHOUT using chroot. If the user privs
  that such an rsync daemon is using is anything above "nobody", you are
  at risk of someone crafting an attack that could write a file outside
  of the module's "path". Please either enable chroot or upgrade to 2.6.1.
  People not running a daemon, running a read-only daemon, or running a
  chrooted daemon are totally unaffected.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-0426 to this issue.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.
