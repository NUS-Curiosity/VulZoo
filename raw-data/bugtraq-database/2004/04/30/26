Updated on:        2004-04-30
Product:           Red Hat Linux

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated mc packages that resolve several buffer overflow vulnerabilities,
one format string vulnerability and several temporary file creation
vulnerabilities are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Midnight Commander (mc) is a visual shell much like a file manager.

Several buffer overflows, several temporary file creation vulnerabilities,
and one format string vulnerability have been discovered in Midnight
Commander.  These vulnerabilities were discovered mostly by Andrew V.
Samoilov and Pavel Roskin.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-0226,
CAN-2004-0231, and CAN-2004-0232 to these issues.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/mc-4.6.0-14.9.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/mc-4.6.0-14.9.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/team/key.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
