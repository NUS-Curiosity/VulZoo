                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          An updated LHA package fixes security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:179-01
Issue date:        2004-04-30
Updated on:        2004-04-30
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0234 CAN-2004-0235
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

An updated LHA package that fixes several security vulnerabilities is now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

LHA is an archiving and compression utility for LHarc format archives.

Ulf Harnhammar discovered two stack buffer overflows and two directory
traversal flaws in LHA.  An attacker could exploit the buffer overflows by
creating a carefully crafted LHA archive in such a way that arbitrary code
would be executed when the archive is tested or extracted by a victim.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0234 to this issue.  An attacker could exploit
the directory traversal issues to create files as the victim outside of the
expected directory.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0235 to this issue.

Users of LHA should update to this updated packages which contain
backported patches not vulnerable to these issues.

Red Hat would like to thank Ulf Harnhammar for disclosing and providing
test cases and patches for these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/lha-1.14i-9.1.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/lha-1.14i-9.1.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

6738322691139ccbc6c1efc1709482d7 9/en/os/SRPMS/lha-1.14i-9.1.src.rpm
90f5d19557e3f99eb949b88240f2d495 9/en/os/i386/lha-1.14i-9.1.i386.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/team/key.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
