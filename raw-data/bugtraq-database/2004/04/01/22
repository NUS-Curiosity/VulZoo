Subject: Releasing full source code of WinBlox


Releasing full source code of WinBlox:
http://umbrella.name/winblox/
there is detailed information on how to build and description on files.

WinBlox is a small tool monitoring(spy/kill) file operation and commandline execution.
pattern matching is done by PCRE.
api hooking is done by DETOURS.
the source code of monitor DLL can be directly read at:
http://umbrella.name/winblox/
there are about 600 lines of CPP.

BTW,
"Oliver Lavery" = (oliver.lavery_at_sympatico.ca):
found a vuln in WinBlox within 24 hours, and concluded it's "dangerous"
and said 
"he'd release the code. So let the games begin ;) "

http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2004/Mar/0349.html

i hope other guys can also join this "game" - find bugs!

at last, let me repeat:
it's totally a new tool and not for operational uses.
