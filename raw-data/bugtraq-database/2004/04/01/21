Subject: Pikachu -Turn on WEP !




Hi,

I have just released a little toy program called Pikachu to sniff JPEG images from wireless/wired ethernet networks.

Pikachu can be used to  sniff JPEG images from wireless/wired Ethernet networks. This will help you give a general idea of traffic flowing through your network.

Run it on your local wireless networks to check out the security implemented by your WISP. It will give you an idea of how secure your wireless network is.

Pikachu will not be able to sniff images from secure networks traffic, i.e SSL, or over VPN.However, most people do not enable any kind of security on there network. They will not use any kind of VPN, and will not turn on WEP on there APs.

Pikachu has arrived people. Turn on WEP ! 

Features yet to be implemented (if i get the time) :

1. GUI
2. Decode GIF
3. Sniff URL
4. Sniff incoming and outgoing mail

Pikachu is a free program.You can download it from here:
