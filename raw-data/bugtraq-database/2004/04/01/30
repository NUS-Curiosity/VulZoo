Package:             squid
Vulnerability:       URL concealement
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= squid-2.5.4-20040116     >= squid-2.5.5-20040301
OpenPKG 2.0          <= squid-2.5.4-2.0.0        >= squid-2.5.4-2.0.1
OpenPKG 1.3          <= squid-2.5.3-1.3.0        >= squid-2.5.3-1.3.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a security advisory [0] from the vendor, a vulnerability
  exists in the URL unescaping logic of the Squid Web Proxy Cache
  [1]. This bug could allow an attacker to bypass certain access
  controls by inserting a NUL character into decoded URLs. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0189 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q squid". If you have the "squid" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade
  it (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get squid-2.5.4-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig squid-2.5.4-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild squid-2.5.4-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/squid-2.5.4-2.0.1.*.rpm
