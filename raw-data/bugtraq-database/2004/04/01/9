Subject: Google using Expired Cert and SSLv2


http://www.cryptonomicon.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=729

Don't know how apropos it is to bugtraq, but I suppose it's relevant to the web
application security community. It's fairly well known amongst people who use
SSL to secure portions of their web application that SSL version 2 is "bad."
It's so bad that a bunch of really smart people went out and created SSL version
3. So I was pretty surprised today when I noticed that https://www.google.com/
is using an expired certificate and SSLv2.

Guess the moral of the story is: "even the big guys can get it wrong."
