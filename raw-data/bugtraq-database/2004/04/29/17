Subject: RE:  New Worm??? - High level of activity on port 445


This maybe a clue,

There was a new variant of the AGOBOT worm that we "uncovered".  
In Safe Mode run regedt32
goto\HKLM\software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and RunServices
Look for any Symantec entries (it will look official but since we do not
use Symantec NAV, it brought up red flags).  Delete.

In CLI, go to Winnt\System32
Search for a navpaw32.exe or a navpxaw32.exe
Remove all permission to prevent this file from being run

Restart PC.  On your firewall check for port scanning.  This worm will
attempt to propagate.

Hope this helps.

BTW...Trend Micro release a new pattern because of us.

Subject: New Worm??? - High level of activity on port 445

Since late yesterday 4/28/04 afternoon around 4pm our firewall started
throwing alarms on netprobes. We are seeing a large amount of probes
coming from one machine that is probing random IPs on port 445. The
source port is random as well. We traced it back to a Japanese Win2K
machine w/SP4 installed. No idea if it's fully patched or not, I have no
desire to put it back on my network to patch it until I get this figured
out. I scanned the machine in safe mode as well as booting normally
using SAV 8.1 with 4/28/04 Rev 38 defs and came up with nothing.

Is anyone else seeing anything like this?
