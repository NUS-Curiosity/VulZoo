In France, presumption of innocence is the rule, expect for hacking. In
this case, the fact of manipulating tools is enough :

* you* now have to provide a *legitimate reason* in order to "hold,
offer, yield, place at the disposal [tools] conceived or especially
adapted to make the facts envisaged by articles 323-1 to 323-3",
articles 323-1 to 323-3 being the classical French anti-hacking laws.
