                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated CVS packages fix security issue
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:154-01
Issue date:        2004-04-14
Updated on:        2004-04-14
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2004:003
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0180
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated cvs packages that fix a client vulnerability that could be
exploited by a malicious server are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

CVS is a version control system frequently used to manage source code
repositories.  

Sebastian Krahmer discovered a flaw in CVS clients where rcs diff files can
create files with absolute pathnames.  An attacker could create a fake
malicious CVS server that would cause arbitrary files to be created or
overwritten when a victim connects to it.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0180 to
this issue.

Users of CVS are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain a patch correcting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/cvs-1.11.2-17.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/cvs-1.11.2-17.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

44ad2349b6b00275273280eac1a52e20 9/en/os/SRPMS/cvs-1.11.2-17.src.rpm
586d676137b75f940baa90ee28fd33ce 9/en/os/i386/cvs-1.11.2-17.i386.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/team/key.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
