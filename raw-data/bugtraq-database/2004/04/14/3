Topic:  DoS Vulnerability in Microsoft Windows SPNEGO Protocol Decoding

Release Date: 2004-04-14

CVE CAN ID: CAN-2004-0119

http://www.nsfocus.com/english/homepage/research/0401.htm

Affected Software and Systems:
===================
- - Microsoft Windows XP
- - Microsoft Windows 2000
- - Microsoft Windows 2003

Unaffected Software and Systems:
===================
- - Microsoft Windows 9x
- - Microsoft Windows NT

Summary:
=========

NSFOCUS Security Team has found there is a remote DoS vulnerability in the
SPNEGO protocol decoding function of Microsoft Windows system. Exploiting
the vulnerability remote attackers could cause Windows system to crash or
malfunction.

Description:
============

Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) protocol is used
to negotiate which security mechanism should be adopted. Windows system
 allows various authentication mechanisms, it also uses SPNEGO protocol to
 implement the authentication mechanism negotiation between the clients and
 servers.

There is a security vulnerability when Windows system handles SPNEGO protocol
codes, which allows attackers to launch DoS attacks.

When a carefully crafted SPNEGO NegTokenInit request is sent, a null pointer
reference error might occur in LSASRV.DLL, resulting in LSASS.EXE crash. This
will make all the operations related to system authentication (such as
remote access to SMB share, or interactive local login) unavailable. For
Windows 2003, it will result in automatic shutting off or bluescreen.

Attackers can launch attacks through any service that uses SPNEGO, such as
TCP port 139, 445. By default IIS also negotiates which authentication
protocol  (for example, NTLM, Kerberos, etc)should be adopted by SPNEGO,
therefore, it's possible for attackers to launch attacks through IIS.

- From vendor's response the same type of malformed request could still
have triggered a buffer overflow issue in the subsequent code, if they were
to have only fixed the DoS issue.
Vendor's patch fixes both the DoS and buffer overflow issues.


Workaround:
=============

* Restrict access to the following ports from untrusted IPs at the firewall:

    445/UDP
    139/TCP
    445/TCP

 * For the system that is providing WEB service through IIS, either of the
   following methods can be used to mitigate the threat:

    1. Disable "Integrated windows authentication" in IIS service

    2. Disable authentication negotiation. Only allow authentication
       through NTLM by the following command:

       cscript adsutil.vbs set w3svc/NTAuthenticationProviders "NTLM"

       adsutil.vbs can be found in the adminscripts directory of IIS.
