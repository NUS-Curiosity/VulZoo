Subject: 4 new Microsoft patches to close 20 vulnerabilities


4 new Microsoft patches to close 20 vulnerabilities

It's patch Tuesday in Redmond and this April we have seen the release of
MS04-011, MS04-012, MS04-013 and MS04-014. Microsoft has given all of
these patches an impact of "Remote Code Execution" and the affected
software ranges from Windows 98 to Windows 2003 64-Bit Edition. 

If you use Windows you will have to patch, preferable today. This week
will see a wide range of vulnerability advisories and exploit releases.
The documented functionality changes are few and minor.

Currently, these patches are not available on Windows Update (11:25AM
pacific time), but I can only imagine that it is a matter of hours. They
can be retrieved with MBSA, SMS and a wide range of patch management
applications.

The broad summary can be found at

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/winapr04.mspx

Most of these vulnerabilities are new, but some of them are already
known - as an example MS04-013 patches the massively exploited MHTML/CHM
related vulnerabilities that was used by Ibiza, Bugbear.e and a wide
range of trojans.

In all, these 4 patches fix 20 vulnerabilities and replace 19 existing
patches.
