************************************************************************************
Netwosix Linux Security Advisory #2004-0011 <http://www.netwosix.org>
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package name:    cvs
Summary:          client and server vulnerabilities
Date:                 2004-04-18
Affected versions:  Netwosix 1.0
                      Netwosix 1.1
************************************************************************************

- - -> Package description:
- - ------------------------
CVS is the Concurrent Versions System, the dominant open-source 
network-transparent version control system.  CVS is useful for everyone from 
individual developers to large, distributed teams:

    * Its client-server access method lets developers access the latest code 
from anywhere there's an Internet connection.
    * Its unreserved check-out model to version control avoids artificial 
conflicts common with the exclusive check-out model.
    * Its client tools are available on most platforms.


- - -> Problem description:
- - ------------------------

SERVER SECURITY ISSUES

* Piped checkouts of paths above $CVSROOT no longer work.  Previously, clients
  could have requested the contents of RCS archive files anywhere on a CVS
  server.

CLIENT SECURITY ISSUES

* Clients now check paths from the server to verify that they are within one 
of  the sandboxes the user requested be updated.  Previously, a trojan server
  could have written or overwritten files anywhere the user had access,
  presenting a serious security risk.

- - -> About Linux Netwosix:
- - ---------------------------------
Linux Netwosix is a powerful and optimized Linux distribution for servers
and Network Security related jobs.  It can also be used for special operations
such as penetration testing with its big collection of security oriented
software and sources. It's a light distribution created for the requirements
of every SysAdmin and it's very portable and highly configurable. Our
philosophy is to give greater liberty for  configuration to the SysAdmin.
Only in this way can he/she configure a powerful and stable server machine.
Linux Netwosix also has a powerful ports system (Nepote) similar to the xBSD
systems but more flexible and usable.
