You would think windows update would keep MS Office up to date but it does not.  Run office update here http://office.microsoft.com/ click the check for update pic upper right.  You will need to install sr1, sr3 and more patches.  Have your office cd handy to install these.  Since you are doing the work I would also recommend running MSBSA v1.2 available here: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsahome.mspx It will check settings and make sure patches applied.
