Were you able to see what process(es) were driving up CPU usage?
Reinstalling windows probably would fix it but that doesn't tell what is
hanging.

A consulting client of mine had the same complaint.  He was only able
to fix it by re-installing Windows.  You may want to mention it on
NTBugTraq, they often discuss and sort out things like this.
