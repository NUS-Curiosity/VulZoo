the same, but this starts _before_ the big patch-process...and on
Friday after the big patching it happened again, and at the next
boot i got:

INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE

install CD in, boot, repair...it was written that O.K., and rebooted,
but during the boot process the PC was frozen and some coloured
rectangles appeared on the screen...there were some letters deleted
from the text on the screen and this "feature" can be reproduced at
the next boot.

my paranoia let me think to a virus, which was included in the patch
or before it, and the patch activated it...well, i know, it sounds
strange, so forget it, maybe it is a driver problem (no HW problem,
because the Linux disk/partition works without problem :-))
