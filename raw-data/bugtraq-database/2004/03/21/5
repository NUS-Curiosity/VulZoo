Hmm, seems a little hypocritical to call for only the
author to announce the paper (so as not to be the
Information Minister). But are you then the Secretary
of State, defending the poor author that cannot defend
their own rights?

It is my impression that if the OP and readers would
find the link useful, it belongs here, and waiting for
the author to announce it is not very helpful. Would
you have preferred an announcement that an undisclosed
location holds more information pending authors approval?

WTF?

But much worse, your tirade contradicts the philosophy
you purport to uphold. Stick up for your own writings
and let the author make his own complaints or not as
they choose.

As far as your last line ...' then...', my question
to you is 'then What'?
