Certainly there is nothing like an 'early warning HUMAN system' 
but really, how about letting the author's of their own work 
make these announcements. There appears to be a new trend of 
coat-tail riders hanging in the rafters ready to leap down on 
any and everything any one of any consequence does. And claim 
their fame to being the first to pass on the information of same.

Come one, if one wants to be the 'Minister of Information' -- 
the first guy on the block, the commentator of other's work like 
that that thor charactar from Denmark who also sits in ambush 
ready to leap out and grab other's works for their own 
glorification, create another security mailing list. Security 
personel worth there salt are well aware of what's going on when 
and where. If they aren't and if they need such a 'Minister of 
Information' then....
