Just be thankfull the guy didn't take the time to find a 0day xss issues in
webbased e-mail services like hotmail/yahoo/etc... I still wonder why these
have not been exploited by email virii: They're not that hard to find (check
your archives) and it's just too easy to code a small worm in javascript for
these sites (I know from experience). The only propagation limiting problem
is that all trafic goes through centralized servers which can be easily
updated (check your archives for site-specific responds times). But if you
combine it with your regular e-mail worm techniques, you can be sure
propagation continues after that fix.

Cheers,
