Subject: NetSky.q Virus. Looking for more detailed information on how the DOS will be performed.


Hi, 

I work for one of the companies about to be hit with the dDOS attack 7-12 from the NetSky.Q virus. 
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.netsky.q@mm.html

I am looking for more detailed information on exactly how the dDOS attack will be performed, ports used, request
type, packet size, etc. In hopes of getting enough information to work with our providers for an adequate defense.

The online AV sites concentrate on the end user response (how to clean, what it does to their PC etc).



Does anyone have this information?
paul
