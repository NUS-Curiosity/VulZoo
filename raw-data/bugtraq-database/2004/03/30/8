Subject: RE: Addressing Cisco Security Issues


Really, your gripe is with Alltel which refused to provide it to you.

Maybe a non-Alltel e-mail account is a red flag, but they certainly should
have been willing to provide it to the contact address they have on your
account.  Whether electronically or via snail mail - I'm SURE they have an
address for you so you can be billed, right???

In Cisco's defense, there are 1000s (10000s? 100000s?) of these units out
there and most of them have ISP specific configurations.  If you apply
generic firmware, you are going to wipe the settings - and Cisco has no way
of knowing how the unit was configured.

Still, it would be best practices for Cisco to provide the generic firmware,
with a document showing how to save and restore the settings.  However, they
may not be contractually able to do so...
