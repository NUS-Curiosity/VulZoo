Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2004-0015

Package name:      tcpdump, libpcap
Summary:           New upstream
Date:              2004-03-30
Affected versions: Trustix 1.5 2.0 2.1

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  Tcpdump is a command-line tool for monitoring network traffic.  Tcpdump can
  capture and display the packet headers on a particular network interface or
  on all interfaces.  Tcpdump can display all of the packet headers, or just
  the ones that match particular criteria.

  Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network monitoring.
  Libpcap can provide network statistics collection, security monitoring and
  network debugging. Since almost every system vendor provides a different
  interface for packet capture, the libpcap authors created this
  system-independent API to ease in porting and to alleviate the need for
  several system-dependent packet capture modules in each application.Install
  libpcap if you need to do low-level network traffic monitoring on your
  network

Problem description:
  The new upstream version of tcpdump fixes several bugs, some security
  related. Amongst others: CAN-2004-0183 and CAN-2004-0184
