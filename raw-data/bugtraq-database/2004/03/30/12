Subject: Re: Addressing Cisco Security Issues


   Cisco is going through convulsions right now due to counterfeiting
issues.

   Previously you could purchase a service contract with either advanced
hardware replacement(CON-AR-PKGxx) or advanced replacement with software
support (CON-SNT-PKGxx). The advance replacement (much cheaper) dried up
a while ago for smaller systems and now they're requiring that service
packages be processed through a Cisco reseller rather than via the old
web registration for anyone with a browser & contract. This makes it
much harder to register volumes of used equipment and it might just be
stemming the tide of counterfeits a bit, too.

   I've seen counterfeit Cisco 1721s with internal deformities (no
MOD1700 slot), I've got a couple examples of WICs in a drawer here that
*almost* work, and I hear the whole 1721/2600-XM line and all the
related NMs, WICs, VICs, etc are available as well as some of the
Catalyst line.

   The big tip off for counterfeits? They've got a valid Cisco serial
number, but if you try to put the device on contract it'll already be in
the Cisco contracts system registered to someone else. Leaking
destruction and manufacturing facilities have plagued Cisco for years,
now portions of the product support database have slipped out as well. I
hear tell of a strong correlation between the bogus part serial numbers
and one of the big three stocking distributors of Cisco equipment, but
I'm too shy to name names :-)



  Soooo ... if you're having trouble getting Cisco's attention on a code
security issue just understand that this is a distant second to floods
of gear that they didn't build but for which they're liable for support
and market perception of quality.
