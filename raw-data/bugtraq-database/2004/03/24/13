I wonder why you even bother publishing this; at the time the document
claims to have been written, half the listed Solaris revisions had already
patches out for them; Solaris 10, which technically doesn't exist yet, had
the bug already fixed in its most recent Solaris Express builds.

But thanks for including the reference to the Sun Alert; that should 
prevent this from being to large a blip on the SunService radar screen.
