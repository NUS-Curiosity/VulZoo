Subject: Immunity Advisory: Solaris local kernel root


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Immunity Research has released an Advisory from the Vulnerability
Sharing Club into the public domain. This advisory can be found at
http://www.immunitysec.com/downloads/solaris_kernel_vfs.sxw.pdf

Technical Summary: There is a vulnerability in Solaris that allows
local users to load kernel modules without being root. This is handy
for getting around things like Argus Pitbull (if it still existed) or
Okena or Entercept or anything like that, or simply for just taking
root. An exploit for this was released as part of the Shellcoder's
Handbook.

There is a Solaris patch that appears to make this exploit ineffective.
