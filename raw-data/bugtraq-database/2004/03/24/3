Hi,

Matt Murphy sent me the HTML file as an attachment after I offered to put it
online here.
I hope our server can withstand it :) ...

!!! I'd like you to download the ZIPped file if possible ...!!!

http://ftp.erm.tu-cottbus.de/security/witty-analysis.zip
ftp://ftp.erm.tu-cottbus.de/security/witty-analysis.zip

If not, choose the HTML, but only via HTTP because the content is then sent
GZIPped.
http://ftp.erm.tu-cottbus.de/security/witty-analysis.html

Possibly the first few persons could also put it online somewhere else to
balance the load.

Oliver

PS: Nope, I cannot provide it via some P2P network.
