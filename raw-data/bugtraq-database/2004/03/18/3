1. Topic:

Updated Mozilla packages that fix vulnerabilities in S/MIME parsing as well
as other issues and bugs are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Mozilla is a Web browser and mail reader, designed for standards
compliance, performance and portability.  Network Security Services (NSS)
is a set of libraries designed to support cross-platform development of
security-enabled server applications. 

NISCC testing of implementations of the S/MIME protocol uncovered a number
of bugs in NSS versions prior to 3.9.   The parsing of unexpected ASN.1
constructs within S/MIME data could cause Mozilla to crash or consume large
amounts of memory.  A remote attacker could potentially trigger these bugs
by sending a carefully-crafted S/MIME message to a victim.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0564 to this issue. 

Andreas Sandblad discovered a cross-site scripting issue that affects
various versions of Mozilla.  When linking to a new page it is still
possible to interact with the old page before the new page has been
successfully loaded. Any Javascript events will be invoked in the context
of the new page, making cross-site scripting possible if the different
pages belong to different domains.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0191 to
this issue. 

Flaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web
browsers and servers. The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server
supplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin
server to which the cookie applies. Web servers such as Apache do not
filter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back
cookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.
However, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character
encoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a
path outside of the originally-specified subset.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0594 to this issue. 

Users of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain Mozilla version 1.4.2 and are not vulnerable to these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:
