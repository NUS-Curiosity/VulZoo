Why did you goto google when i said securemac.com? Anyways its not google's fault you didnt give it the right keywords. I was able to find it easily, it was the 4th result.

http://www.securemac.com/macosencryption.php 

http://www.google.com/search?q=appletalk+encryption+site:securemac.com&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8

> SecureMac.com has a article on this if anyone is interested. 
  
 Is that so?  Google didn't seem to find much...
