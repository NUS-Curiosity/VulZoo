Subject: IBM DB2 Remote Command Execution Privilege Upgrade (#NISR09032004)


NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: IBM DB2 Remote Command Execution Privilege Upgrade
Systems Affected: DB2 8.1 Enterprise Edition on Windows
Severity: High/Low depending on environment
Vendor URL: http://www.ibm.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ david@...software.com ]
Date Vendor Notified:    6th September 2003
Date of Public Advisory: 9th March 2004
Advisory number: #NISR09032004
Advisory URL: http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/db2rmtcmd.txt

Description
***********
IBM's DB2 is the market share leader for database server software. One of 
the components, the Remote Command Server, contains a vulnerability that can 
allow attackers to gain administrative privileges on the server running DB2.

Details
*******
DB2 with the Remote Command Server, DB2RCMD.EXE, listens on a named pipe 
DB2REMOTECMD and executes commands sent through it. When a connection is 
made to the pipe a new process is created, namely db2rcmdc.exe, and this 
executes the command. Whilst a valid Windows user id and password are 
required the command executes with the privileges of the "db2admin" account 
which is an administrator.

This essentially means that even a low privileged "Guest" account can run 
commands remotely with administrative privileges. This can lead to a 
compromise of the server running DB2.
