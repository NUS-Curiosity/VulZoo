An intermediate solution could be HDD password locking. Password is
check within HDD embeded controler so remains even if drive is mounted
on another system. To get rid of it, you bearly have to reflash
controler or change electronics.

Encrypted volumes remains to me the best solution, and it is quite easy
to achieve.
