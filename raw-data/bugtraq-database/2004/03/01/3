Well that would probably not be in line with the new EU regulation 
1820bla and definetly against all privacy laws. Cause even the bad guys 
have the right to not be spied on while stealing goods.

Fair enough but I guess nowadays especially in big cities your "petty" 
crime is run by organizations that have quite good "runners" :) So them 
students should team up with the sports department to make you a better 
runner.
The good thing is you know immediatly that it's gone so might leave you 
a chance to catch the thief.
Strong Crypto and regular backups will save you a lot of trouble even 
when your laptop gets stolen...

till then,

Steve Clement
