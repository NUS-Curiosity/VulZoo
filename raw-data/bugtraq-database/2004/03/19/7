Subject: Re: mac osx- admin service buffer overflow

>From Panther (10.3.3) /etc/services, 

mac-srvr-admin  660/udp     # MacOS Server Admin
mac-srvr-admin  660/tcp     # MacOS Server Admin

It's the GUI admin tool for OS X server (think webmin or the like, but OS X).  Google
for MacOS Server Admin for details on it, or take a look at the "getting started"
pdf under http://www.apple.com/server/documentation/
