there appears to be a new CVE number corresponding to this issue.  that 
either means that 1) the issue is really new to CVE and most people weren't 
aware of it and should be made so, regardless of whether a fix was slipped 
in long ago or 2) the CVE number is a dupe and should be marked as such.

do you know which case we have?

if the former, the OpenSSL folks have a duty to advise their users of the 
newly discovered vulnerability.  as the NISCC advisory states the issue 
would "affect vendors that ship older versions of OpenSSL with backported 
security patches".  if the latter, then the NISCC folks need to clear 
things up in their advisory.

cheers,
