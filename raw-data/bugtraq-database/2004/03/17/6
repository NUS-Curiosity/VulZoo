according to NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 224012 ( 
http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/224012/index.htm ), there is also a 
third potential DoS that was found with this testing sweep: CVE 
CAN-2004-0081.  quoting from the NISCC advisory:
==
NISCC/224012/3 [OpenSSL 0.9.6]
CAN-2004-0081 http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0081
Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool 
uncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 that can lead to a 
Denial of Service attack (infinite loop). This issue was traced to a fix 
that was added to OpenSSL 0.9.6d some time ago. This issue will affect 
vendors that ship older versions of OpenSSL with backported security patches.
