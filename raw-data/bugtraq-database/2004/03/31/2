Paul,
If the virus is started on one of the mentioned dates and the host is 
connected to the Internet, the following steps will be taken by the 
virus:

1) The hostnames of the sites to attack are decrypted and the IP 
addresses resolved.

2) 80 threads are created for the attack - each thread picks from one of 
the five victim hostnames at random. The following steps are performed 
in each thread:

3) A connection is made on port 80 and only the following content is 
sent (formatted for your site here and CR/LF escaped):

GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.edonkey2000.com\r\n\r\n

4) The thread sleeps for 250 milliseconds.

5) The process repeats from step 3 until the virus exits.

-Joe
