Synopsis
========

Fetchmail versions 6.2.4 and earlier can be crashed by sending a
specially-crafted email to a fetchmail user.

Background
==========

Fetchmail is a utility that retrieves and forwards mail from remote
systems using IMAP, POP, and other protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     net-mail/fetchmail       <= 6.2.4                        >= 6.2.5

Description
===========

Fetchmail versions 6.2.4 and earlier can be crashed by sending a
specially-crafted email to a fetchmail user. This problem occurs
because Fetchmail does not properly allocate memory for long lines in
an incoming email.

Impact
======

Fetchmail users who receive a malicious email may have their fetchmail
program crash.

Workaround
==========

While a workaround is not currently known for this issue, all users are
advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.

Resolution
==========

Fetchmail users should upgrade to version 6.2.5 or later:

    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv ">=net-mail/fetchmail-6.2.5"
    # emerge ">=net-mail/fetchmail-6.2.5"
