Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow has been discovered in libxml2 versions prior to
2.6.6 which may be exploited by an attacker allowing the execution of
arbitrary code.

Description
===========

Yuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml2 versions prior to 2.6.6.
When the libxml2 library fetches a remote resource via FTP or HTTP,
libxml2 uses parsing routines that can overflow a buffer caused by
improper bounds checking if they are passed a URL longer than 4096
bytes.

Impact
======

If an attacker is able to exploit an application using libxml2 that
parses remote resources, then this flaw could be used to execute
arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

No workaround is available; users are urged to upgrade libxml2 to
2.6.6.

Resolution
==========

All users are recommended to upgrade their libxml2 installation:

~    # emerge sync
~    # emerge -pv ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.6.6"
~    # emerge ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.6.6"
