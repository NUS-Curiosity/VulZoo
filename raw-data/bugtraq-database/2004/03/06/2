> During a 'manual scan' of a folder, if Norton Antivirus (NAV) encounters a
file /folder name with 'some'  ASCII characters ( 1-31) NAV can't further
proceed the manual scan and its front-end 'NAVW32.exe' crashes! This Bug has
no impact in the NAV Auto-Protect Engine.

No troubleshooting found in NAV-2003-Pro ed. on win2000pro. ascii dir
created and scanned.
NAVW32.exe seems to work fine.
