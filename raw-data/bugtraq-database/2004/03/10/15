This is a user configuration issue, NOT A BUG. If the user enables the option 'Directory browsing', then any folder that does not have an index files can be viewed. This is by design.

From our testing this is a false vulnerability. We have been unable to replicate this issue. We have sent an e-mail to Rafel Ivgi for more information, but Rafel has not supplied us verifiable proof.
