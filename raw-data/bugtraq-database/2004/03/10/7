Subject: MDKSA-2004:021 - Updated mozilla packages fix multiple vulnerabilities

                 Mandrakelinux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           mozilla
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2004:021
 Date:                   March 10th, 2004

 Affected versions:	 9.2
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A number of vulnerabilities were discovered in Mozilla 1.4:
 
 A malicious website could gain access to a user's authentication
 credentials to a proxy server.
 
 Script.prototype.freeze/thaw could allow an attacker to run
 arbitrary code on your computer.
 
 A vulnerability was also discovered in the NSS security suite which
 ships with Mozilla.  The S/MIME implementation would allow remote
 attackers to cause a Denial of Service and possibly execute arbitrary
 code via an S/MIME email message containing certain unexpected ASN.1
 constructs, which was demonstrated using the NISCC test suite.  NSS
 version 3.9 corrects these problems and has been included in this
 package (which shipped with NSS 3.8).
 
 Finally, Corsaire discovered that a number of HTTP user agents
 contained a flaw in how they handle cookies.  This flaw could
 allow an attacker to avoid the path restrictions specified by a
 cookie's originator.  According to their advisory:
 
 "The cookie specifications detail a path argument that can be used to
 restrict the areas of a host that will be exposed to a cookie.  By
 using standard traversal techniques this functionality can be
 subverted, potentially exposing the cookie to scrutiny and use in
 further attacks."
 
 As well, a bug with Mozilla and Finnish keyboards has been corrected.
 
 The updated packages are patched to correct these vulnerabilities.
