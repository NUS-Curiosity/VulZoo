Subject: With regards to the Adobe Acrobat Reader advisory (#NISR03022004)


Hello all,
I've been inundated with e-mails asking whether operating systems other than 
Windows are affected by XFDF overflow. Whilst I did not state that Windows 
is the only OS affected, and I should have done, I thought it was clear, 
incorrectly, that Adobe Acrobat Reader for Windows was indeed the only one 
and not Mac, *nix, etc.

>From the original advisory:

When the xfdf file is parsed an unsafe call to sprintf is made in
preparation for outputting a debug message using OutputDebugString.

OutputDebugString is a Win32 API function, exported by kernel32.dll. 
Conseqently, the vulnerable code path will exist only in the Windows version 
of Adobe Acrobat Reader.

I hope this clears up any confusion.

Cheers,
David Litchfield
