Subject: Antivir for Freebsd doesn't work on 5.X




Antivir ( http://www.antivir.de/ ) - a popular antivirus scanner
doesn't work on local file system in Freebsd 5.X


The result from FreeBSD 4.9 system:
root@...ething:~$antivir -s  /var/log/
AntiVir / FreeBSD Version 2.1.0-9

Thank you for using AntiVir.

Thank you for using AntiVir.

Files are 0 and it seems that antivir doesn't recognize the files in the file system.I'v noticed this behaviour since the early 5.0 distribution. 

The strange thing about all this stuff is that antivir is working fine
on mounted file system, even it is FreeBSD 5.X on it, but still refuse to scan files mounted on /
