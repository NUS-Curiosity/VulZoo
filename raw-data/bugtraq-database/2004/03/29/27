Subject: Re: Addressing Cisco Security Issues


I have had a similar run-around with AT&T Broadband and Sprint a while back, pertaining to a DoS
attack my organization was experiencing. Not to dive into details, to resolve the issue, I got
them both on the line in a 3-way conversation, and it was taken care of in less then 5 minutes.
They didn't seem to eager to shrug off the responsibility to someone else, when that someone else
was right there on the phone.
