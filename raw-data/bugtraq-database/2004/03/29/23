Betreff: [Full-Disclosure] new internet explorer exploit (was new worm)


The code used by this worm to exploit it's users at least partly  is (i
think) new , the vulnerability it abused has afaik not been published on
eighter bugtraq or full-disclosure. possibly making it (one of?) the first
worm to totally catch people offguard.

It allows a mallicious person to take any action on an unsuspecting user who
view's a specially prepared page's pc

The known ingredient it uses is :
http://www.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Full-Disclosure/2003-08/1758.html
that has gone unpatched for over 5 months now

The remainder of the exploit manages to confuse this same adodb.stream
object enough to make it think it's being run from a local location

You can protect yourself against it by running
http://ip3e83566f.speed.planet.nl/hacked-by-chinese/fix.reg


I attached sample code myself to illustrate the problem, because
http-equiv's was messy :)
This one should be more straightforward to use

Instructions :

1. unzip
2. overwrite exploit.exe with the executable you wish to run, or leave it
untoched if you want to see some nice texturemapped rotation
3. upload the files to a webserver
4. view exploit.htm

Tested on winxp pro all patches

for the lazy ones among you can also view a demonstration here :
