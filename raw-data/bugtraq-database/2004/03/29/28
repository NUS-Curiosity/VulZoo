Subject: Re: new internet explorer exploit  (was new worm)


Just wanted to add that Norton Anti-Virus 2004 will detect this exploit and 
pop up a warning, but also fails to halt its execution or protect the user 
in any way.

Here is what it thinks it is:

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/bloodhound.exploit.6.html

So there is some measure of warning, but no real protection.
