               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated util-linux resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1256
Issue date:        2004-03-04
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1256
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0080
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------


- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated util-linux packages that fix an information leak in the login
program are now available.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386

3. Problem description:
The util-linux package contains a large variety of low-level system
utilities that are necessary for a Linux system to function.

In some situations, the login program could use a pointer that had been
freed and reallocated. This could cause unintentional data leakage.

Note: Red Hat Linux releases newer than 7.2 are not vulnerable to this 
issue.

It is recommended that all users upgrade to these updated packages, which
are not vulnerable to this issue.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Matthew Lee of Fleming College for 
finding and reporting this issue, and Jesse Keating for providing a 
backported patch for Red Hat Linux 7.2.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which 
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note 
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory 
*only* contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the 
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you 
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. 
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/download for directions on how 
to configure yum and apt-get.

6. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 7.2:

SRPM:
http://download.fedoralegacy.org/redhat/7.2/updates/SRPMS/util-linux-2.11f-19.7.2.legacy.src.rpm

i386:
http://download.fedoralegacy.org/redhat/7.2/updates/i386/util-linux-2.11f-19.7.2.legacy.i386.rpm


7. Verification:

SHA1 sum                                 Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
