Impact: Possible theft of user credentials and remote script execution.

Affected Products: NetScreen IVE running version 3.0 to 3.3.1.

Summary:
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered during an
external security audit of release 3.3 Patch 1 of the IVE.  This
vulnerability affects customers using all versions of the IVE Platform
since 3.0.  At this time there have been no reports of customers
compromised due to this IVE vulnerability.

credentials such as session cookies and allow hostile client-side
scripts to run with unintended access privileges. The scope of the
