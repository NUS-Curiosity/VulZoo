Description
***********
SLWebMail is a web based e-mail solution designed for the small to medium 
enterprise. SLWebMail runs atop Microsoft's Internet Information Server and 
is implemented as a set of ISAPI applications. SLWebMail suffers from 
multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

Details
*******
SLWebMail is installed with SLMail Pro. Implemented as a set of ISAPI 
applications, many suffer from stack based buffer overflow vulnerabilities. 
Known to be vulnerable are user.dll, loadpageadmin.dll and loadpageuser.dll. 
Even though these ISAPI applications are loaded into dllhost, which runs in 
the security context of the IWAM account and not the local system account, 
the risk should still be considered as high and customers should install the 
patch as soon as is possible.

Fix Information
***************
SLMail have made available a patch to resolve these issues: 
http://216.26.170.92/Products/SLMailPro/Utilities.asp . Customers are urged 
to update as soon as is possible.
