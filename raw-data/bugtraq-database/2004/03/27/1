By "anything but Outlook 2003" I assume you also mean Outlook Express; as
(IIRC) since IE6 SP1, it's as simple as Tools->Options->Read and check the
"Read all messages in plain text" box as this will also prevent any web bugs
and other HTML nonsense, regardless of how you view it.   Granted that you
don't get to enjoy the shi^H^H^H wonderful experience that is HTML email,
but I can live with that ;-)

Cheers.
