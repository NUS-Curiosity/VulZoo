Subject: bblog 0.7.2 cross site scripting




Introduction:
Bblog, a blogging system scripted in PHP does not perform sufficient filtering when submitting a blog name. The severity of this flaw however, is low as the required privileges to access the administration panel for bblog is superuser.

The problem:
The flaw lies in bblog/index.php?b=options, where an *evil* attacker can quite possibly hijack a session. Submitting the blog name with the value of "< script >alert(document.cookie);< / script >" will insert this into the title of the blog, which in turn, speaks for itself.

Fix:
Filter the value of the blog name to disallow any html insertion.

Kind Regards,
