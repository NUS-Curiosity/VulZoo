Subject: RE: MS Word - password protection vulnerabilty


So, if I patch, then I cannot bypass the password mechanisms. But if I do 
not patch, then I still can... Or does a patched application allow for the 
creation of a document in which the security controls cannot be bypassed 
using an unpatched MS Word? Can a document from an unpatched application 
still be bypassed in a patched MS Word?

It would be interesting to know the depth of patching in this situation.

Kind regards,
Carolyn
