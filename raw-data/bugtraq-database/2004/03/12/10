It works in Lynx. If you look at the page source, all the content is there. 
The problem is this tag just before the technical description:

<div id="s3l1-4" style="display:none">

I've been playing around with custom stylesheets but I can't seem to find a 
way to override that.

In the meantime, I'd recommend people go here:
