 2. DETAILS

 -- Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection vulnerability

 An SQL Injection vulnerability has been found in the index.cfm script. 
User
supplied input parameters named 'category_id', 'product_id' and 
'feature_id' is
not filtered before being used in a SQL query. Consequently, query 
modification
using malformed input is possible.

 Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can enable an attacker to 
execute
commands in the system (via MS SQL xp_cmdshell function).

 -- Vulnerability 2: Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in 'index.cfm'

 By injecting specially crafted javascript code in URL and tricking a 
user to visit
it a remote attacker can steal user session id and gain access to user's 
personal data.

 3. FIX INFORMATION

 S-Quadra alerted CFWebstore development team on these issues on 04 Mar 
2004.
Dogpatch Software response:
 "The 5.0.1 version of CFWebstore has been released which addresses all the
security issues previously mentioned. We recoded the validation we were 
using to
a more standard method and added additional validations for some areas 
that had
not been mentioned, due to our use of the Fusebox methodology, which 
allows a
user with knowledge of the application to tap into areas other than through
typical URL variables."
