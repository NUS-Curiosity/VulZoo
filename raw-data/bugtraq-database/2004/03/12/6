###Description###

cPanel & WebHost Manager (WHM) is a next generation web hosting control panel system. Both cPanel & WHM are extremely feature rich as well as include an easy to use web based interface.

###vulnerability Description###

Authenticated users are able to run cross-site scripting attacks. I noticed this vulnerability when trying to password protect a dictory. Here is an example of how you could run script on the cpanel server

http://targetserver.com:2082/frontend/x/htaccess/dohtaccess.html?dir=>&lt;script&gt;alert(0x29A Crew)&lt;/script&gt;

You are able to run all sorts of HTML on the target server, iframes, ect.
