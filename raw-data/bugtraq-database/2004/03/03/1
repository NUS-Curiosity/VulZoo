Subject: Re: Authentication flaw in Web Wiz forum


Yet again!! Alexander aka. Pig Killer and Michael have posted an incorrect 
security bug report without first fully testing there findings first.

The security flaw reported below is incorrect as they state that the user 
code stored in a cookie is not changed when the password for an account is 
changed, this is incorrect as the user code is changed often including when 
the user changes his/her password, unless the forum admin changes the 
password then the user code is not changed so the user doesn't have to log 
back in if they request a new password from the forum admin. This maybe be 
changed in the next version so even if the admin change a password the user 
code is updated.
