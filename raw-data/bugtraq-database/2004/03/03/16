Subject: RE: New Internet Explorer Cross Zone/Site Scripting Vulnerability


This is not a new vulnerability but was covered on Bugtraq in September
by jelmer and Liu Die Yu.

Jelmer highlighted the Media Bar Ressource Injection vulnerability in
his exploit published on September 11, 2003 at

http://securityfocus.com/archive/1/337285

Which followed Liu Die Yus post on September 10 about a Search Pane
Injection vulnerability at

http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/336931

However, both failed to elaborate that the _media and _search injections
are possible through not only the FILE protocol but also the HTTP
protocol. Your proof-of-concept is a good demonstration on how to extend
these 2 related vulnerabilities to also cover arbitrary webpages such as
Google or Passport.
