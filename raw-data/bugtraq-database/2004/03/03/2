Yet again!! Alexander aka. Pig Killer and Michael have found there report 
to be incorrect and have tried to retract it but not fully with another 
incorrect bug report.

The Forgotten Password feature requires the user to enter details about 
themselves including user name, email address, etc. that they used when 
registering. Only once this data is entered correctly is a new password 
emailed to the users emails address.

So the security flaw mentioned by Alexander aka. Pig Killer and Michael is 
incorrect as it is not applicable when using this feature.

If you are using Web Wiz Forums then please ignore all bug reports by 
Alexander aka. Pig Killer and Michael as they are incorrect (and not for 
the first time!!) so you do not need to worry or email the site for a new 
version.
