16 days after my post regarding the Firewall/VPN Appliance vuln
and 1 month more my TELEPHONE notice to Symantec support,
Symantec released a new version of firmware for their appliance.
But the problem it`s not the time.
The problem is that they told me it was "not a vulnerability",
after 1 month they released the new firmare to patch the "Cached Password
Vulnerability" (as they called it), and just telling
"Symantec is aware of a potential administrator password leakage 
vulnerability reported in 
<http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2004/Feb/1009069.html>." 

... 

This is what I received..I don`t want money
but I think an ufficial "thank you" is the minimum... or not?
Am I telling something of MAD?! 

the new firmware is avaiable here:

pn_appliance/updates/vpn200_161_app.zip
