Vendor's Description:

"MyProxy is a privacy-enhancing personal HTTP 1.1 proxy.
Arbitrary URLs can be blocked by regular expression patterns and
optionally replaced by transparent GIFs. 
Cookies can be controlled based on server/domain name.
The "Referer", "User-Agent", and "From" HTTP headers can be dealt
with in various ways. All user settings are configured through an
HTML user interface."
