Synopsis
========

A specially-crafted MIME file (.mim, .uue, .uu, .b64, .bhx, .hqx, and
.xxe extensions) may cause UUDeview to crash or execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

UUDeview is a program which is used to transmit binary files over the
Internet in a text-only format. It is commonly used for email and Usenet
attachments. It supports multiple encoding formats, including Base64,
BinHex and UUEncoding.

Description
===========

By decoding a MIME archive with excessively long strings for various
parameters, it is possible to crash UUDeview, or cause it to execute
arbitrary code.

This vulnerability was originally reported by iDEFENSE as part of a
WinZip advisory [ Reference: 1 ].

Impact
======

An attacker could create a specially-crafted MIME file and send it via
email. When recipient decodes the file, UUDeview may execute arbitrary
code which is embedded in the MIME file, thus granting the attacker
access to the recipient's account.

Workaround
==========

All users should upgrade to UUDeview 0.5.20:

~    # emerge sync
~    # emerge -pv ">=app-text/uudeview-0.5.20"
~    # emerge ">=app-text/uudeview-0.5.20"
