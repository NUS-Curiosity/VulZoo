By our math, January 22nd, 2004 is after December 2003, which is when 
this exploit was first made available to Vulnerability Sharing Club 
members. At that point there were no patches for any Solaris, as far as 
we were aware. We would like to think that the additional information we 
provided, including a working exploit, was valuable to many members of 
the information security community.
