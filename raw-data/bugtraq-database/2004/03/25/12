   VizibleSoft Security Advisory #2004/01                       25th Mar 2004

   Product:     eSignal 7.6, 7.5 (maybe earlier)
                http://www.esignal.com

   Systems:     Windows (all versions)

   Problem:     Stack-based buffer overflow

   Severity:    Remote code execution

   Risk:        High
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Product description:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   "eSignal is the nation's leading provider of real-time financial and
   market information. eSignal is a popular platform for institutional
   and professional traders. eSignal is a market data solution bundled
   for best value for small to mid-size institutional investors that
   also includes additional optional services..."


   Vulnerability:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   eSignal main application "WinSig.exe" listens for incoming data
   requests on tcp port 80.

   While parsing requests, it suffers from classic stack-based buffer
   overflow, when parameter string is about 1040 characters long:

   C:\>telnet localhost 80
   <STREAMQUOTE>
   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA....... x 1040
   </STREAMQUOTE>

    ... bang!

   Overflow occurs in Specs.dll and EIP is fully controllable, as
   the function return address on the stack is completelly overwritten.


   Exploitation:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Pretty trivial, except that overflow string can not contain NULL-bytes
   and all lower-case characters are converted to upper-case.

   As we overwrite stack with return address and code, we use standard
   "JMP ESP" technique to direct execution back to us.

   "jmp esp" opcode was found in MFC71.dll, which is distributed in eSignal
   package and loads from program folder, thus making exploit to be eSignal
   version specific instead of OS (Windoze) specific.

   While I was working on advisory, eSignal released v7.6 which is
   vulnerable as well and even more "overflow-friendly", as previous
   was compiled with debug bits for ESP value checking at the end of each
   procedure. But in both cases it's almost similar.


   Proof of concept code:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Exploit written in Perl, which downloads and executes file from
   the specified URL available here:

   http://viziblesoft.com/insect/sploits/vz-eSignal76.pl


   Solution:
   ~~~~~~~~~
   Vendor's technical support ignored my request for company's security
   contacts. I wasn't surprised, as the most support staff these days is
   zombified and can't figure out doing something they were not programmed
   to. Plus, company falls into category of "those who does not care"
   moneymakers, so after two weeks time I realized there won't be
   any answer.

   Thus, solution is obvious:

   Close tcp 80 to outside world with your favorite firewall.
