The Solaris 7 patch was released December 1st;
the Solaris 8 patch was released November 25th;
the Solaris 9 patch was released December 23rd;

the delay in the Sun Alert notication was probably due to
the late release date of the Solaris 9/Intel patch.


Had you notified Sun, which you should have done, we would
have given you this information.

You see, I am very suspicious about people independently "discovering"
bugs after we've posted patches or filed them to our internal
bugtracking system.  Or people sitting on discovered security vulnerabilities
for many years.  The latter people are part of the problem, not of
the solution.
