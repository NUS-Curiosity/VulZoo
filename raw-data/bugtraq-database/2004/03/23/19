Ok everybody let's send our LM Hashes and email addresses to this group of
complete strangers. Sounds like a great idea. 

Not that the concept isn't cool and I am sure the program is great but one
would have to be an idiot to do it.

Hi all,

I've generated with some friends 18Gb of rainbow tables for the "instant"
decryption of LanManager password hashes. Now we are offering a free
on-line cracking service for Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 passwords.
It should be useful in a lot of situations, expecially during penetration
testing activities.

If you are interested, visit: http://sarcaprj.wayreth.eu.org/

Best regards,
