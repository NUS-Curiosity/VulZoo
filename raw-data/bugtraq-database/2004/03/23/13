Subject: Sarca rainbow tables on-line cracking service



Hi all,

I've generated with some friends 18Gb of rainbow tables for the "instant"
decryption of LanManager password hashes. Now we are offering a free
on-line cracking service for Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 passwords.
It should be useful in a lot of situations, expecially during penetration
testing activities.

If you are interested, visit: http://sarcaprj.wayreth.eu.org/

Best regards,

Inode
