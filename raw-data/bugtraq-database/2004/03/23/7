Description: Injected code is rendered in the context of the vulnerable

Exploit:

It may be possible to steal cookies from users who are logged into the

It is likely that other pages are also vulnerable.

As usual, OpenText will not follow up this report, and it can be filed away
with numerous other unpatched FirstClass bugs, hacks and exploits:
