Subject: ISS 'Witty' Worm Analyzed


Dear Lists,

I have completed an analysis of the 'Witty' worm that impacts multiple ISS
products.  The worm is spreading via a very simple UDP propagation
algorithm.  The unique nature of this worm made it a fascinating piece of
code to analyze.  The analysis gets into the details of the worm's
propagation mechanism, and is designed for a more technical reader, but
does include a basic description of the worm, and the list of products
vulnerable to it (as published by ISS).

I've submitted this to several of the SecurityFocus lists; I feel that each
was on-topic, and wanted to make sure that this information reached all
those who wished to receive it.  Due to its size (approx. 28K), I have not
attached the analysis.  It is available at:

http://techie.hopto.org/witty-analysis.html

My research proves that others were right about the incredibly destructive
nature of the worm's payload.  Perhaps this will be what will make it
memorable, but with any luck, should also bring about its premature demise.

Best Regards,
Matthew Murphy
