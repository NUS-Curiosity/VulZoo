Subject: Invision Gallery SQL Injection Vulnerabilities




Vendor  : Invision Power Services
URL     : http://www.invisiongallery.com
Version : Invision Gallery 1.0.1
Risk    : SQL Injection Vulnerabilities



Description:
Invision Gallery is a fully featured, powerful gallery system 
that is easy and fun to use! It plugs right into your existing 
Invision Power Board to create a seamless browsing experience 
for the users of your forum. We've taken many of the most popular 
feature requests from our customers and integrated them into this 
product. 



SQL Injection Vulnerability:
Invision Gallery seems to come up very short concerning validation
of user supplied input. It is vulnerable to a number of SQL Injection
vulnerabilities. Also, because Invision Gallery is integrated into
Invision power Board it is VERY much possible for an attacker to use
the vulnerabilities in Invision Gallery to affect the Invision Power
Board which it resides on. Most of the non validated input that allow
for the injections take place right in the middle of a WHERE statement
making them that much easier to exploit. Lets look at an example error.

-----[ Start Error ]---------------------------------------------

mySQL query error: SELECT * FROM ibf_gallery_categories WHERE 
id=[Evil_Query]

mySQL error: You have an error in your SQL syntax.  Check the manual 
that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to 
use near '[Evil_Query]' at line 1

mySQL error code: 
Date: Sunday 21st of March 2004 11:28:18 AM

-----[ /Ends Error ]---------------------------------------------

As we can see from this it would be of little difficulty for any
attacker to execute arbitrary requests. For example pulling the
admin hash and/or possibly taking admin control over an affected
Invision Gallery or Invision Power Board installation. Here are
some example urls that could be exploited by an attacker.

index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=si&img=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=editimg&img=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=ecard&img=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=moveimg&img=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=delimg&img=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=post&cat=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=sc&op=user&sort_key=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=sc&op=user&sort_key=date&order_key=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=favs&op=add&img=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=slideshow&cat=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=user&user=[SQL]&op=view_album&album=1
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=user&user=[SQL]
index.php?act=module&module=gallery&cmd=user&user=1&op=view_album&album=[SQL]

Some of these are easier to exploit than others obviously, but the
large number of SQL Injection possibilities definitely makes it that
much easier for an attacker to get results from these issues.


Solution:
The Invision Power Services team were contacted immediately and
hopefully a fix will be available soon since this is an application
that cost users money to use. The original advisory can be found
