Two important points of clarification are needed.

Firstly, the vulnerability as described should refer specifically to the MIMEsweeper for Web product. It does not apply to the MAILsweeper for SMTP product.

Secondly, this vulneraility was fixed at MIMEsweeper for Web v. 5.0.4 in Feb. 2004. The current version is 5.0.5. The vulnerability reported by Pierre Kroma was found on a copy of v.5.0.1 (a year old).

Solution: Upgrade to 5.0.5 (17 June 2004)
