Subject: Re: Driver for display goes to a infinite loop by viewing a html!


I am running Win2k with all of the latest patches, SP 4 and running
Mozilla 1.7.  While it did take a while to load and scrolling was
deathly slow.. It did not crash my system or Mozilla.    Since this is
my work machine, it's only a 733Mhz with an older video card.  I am
perplexed as to why a newer video card would crash Windows with a
fatal error.

Regards,
Anthony Petito
