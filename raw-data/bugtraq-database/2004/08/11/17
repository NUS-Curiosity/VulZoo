Gives the following:
Really sluggish performance redrawing in Mozilla until the page exits.
Scrolling works but is slowed by the redraw performance. System still 
running. Focus switches to/from Mozillar are also really slow.

ATI driver version: 6.14.10.6374. Since this has the ring of being a 
display driver accelleration bug.
