 Description
 -----------

    rsync [0] is a program for synchronizing files over a network.

    A vulnerability [1] has been reported in rsync, which potentially can be 
    exploited by malicious users to read or write arbitrary files on a 
    vulnerable system.

    The vulnerability is caused due to an input validation error within the 
    "sanitize_path()" function of the "util.c" file.

    Successful exploitation requires that the rsync daemon isn't running 
    chrooted.

    The vulnerability affects version 2.6.2 and prior.    

 Resolution
 ----------

    The rsync package has been updated to address this vulnerability.
