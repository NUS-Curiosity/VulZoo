Well i would not blame this on terminal emulators.
And the escape sequences in the poc exploit i wrote are not related with 
  ANSI escape code "exploit".
They are features of terminal emulators.


echo -e "\e]2;;ls;\a\e[21t\abash-2.05b$\e[8m;"
You can try this one in xterm.You will see bash-2.05b$ , if you type 
some command and hit enter, "ls" command in the escape sequence will be 
executed too. (thanks to bloofar for the hint)

You can read more on  "TERMINAL EMULATOR SECURITY ISSUES" paper written 
by H D Moore. The paper also covers old vulnerabilities in terminal 
emulators.
