Hi,

I've seen theses emails since last Friday, and my gateway has since
received around 200 of them. KAV and ClamAV detect them as 
"TrojanDropper.VBS.Zerolin"

It appears that a small Jscript.Encoded code is hidden at the botton of
a false (true ?) spam. After several redirections, un ss.exe file is
downloaded. This file is detected as following :

KAV : Trojan.Win32.Genme.c
Trend : not detected
ClamAV : Trojan.Xebiz.A
F-Prot : W32/Xebiz.A
NAI : not detected

>From the Symantec website :

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/backdoor.xebiz.html
A large scale spamming of messages contained a link to a Web page
hosting the backdoor. Following the link downloads the file Links.HTA,
which in turn downloads and executes the Trojan as ss.exe
