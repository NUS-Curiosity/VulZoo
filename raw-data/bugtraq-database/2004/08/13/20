Subject: Re: NETGEAR DG834G SPECIAL FEATURES


The Zebra issue is simply a default password/default configuration 
issue.  The documentation _clearly_ states that is should be changed and 
than an 'enable password' be applied.  In neither case does this allow 
any "exploit" to take place, as you're restricted to the Zebra process 
and not the OS.

It's no more of an exploit than Oracle's system/manager, 
sys/change_on_install, or scott/tiger username/password combinations 
that are installed by default.
