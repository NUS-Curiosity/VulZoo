"The security implications of 
this trick were considered as early as 1999 in Mozilla Bug 22183
(http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22183).  However, the 
Mozilla Foundation has kept the Bug confidential until recently, 
when a researcher noted the problem and published a 
particularly-effective demonstration, spoofing a "PayPal" login 
site (see http://www.nd.edu/~jsmith30/xul/test/spoof.html)."

5 Years to fix a vuln? I am not sure if even Microsoft has been that slow to confront a security flaw. Has anyone heard an explanation as to why this was kept confidential and swept under the rug until now?


BTW: Thank you Mr. Smith for an excellent page.
