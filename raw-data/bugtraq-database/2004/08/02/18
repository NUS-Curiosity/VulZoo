Tools -> Options -> Web Features -> Advanced button by Java/Javascript 
check boxes. I'll bet you have "Hide the status bar" unchecked.

This caught me for a moment, too, then I remembered I always disable 
everything in the Advanced JavaScript Options box, and that's one of 
them. So users actually have a defence right now, but they have to 
specifically set it themselves.
