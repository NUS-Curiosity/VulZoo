I have added SpoofStick (http://www.corestreet.com/spoofstick/) to both IE
and Firefox. With the Firefox spoof shown on the cited page, SpoofStick gets
moved and shows blank for "You're On". Not an outstanding warning, but
useful if you are watching.

The latest version of Firefox is 0.9.2.

This appears to be the case with 0.9.2.
The spoofed PayPal site (from
http://www.nd.edu/~jsmith30/xul/test/spoof.html) cannot hide FireFox's
status bar - so you get 2 status bars displayed.

Even so, the site is incredibly convincing, and I suspect the average user
would be understandably fooled.

Since the CERT recommendation, Mozilla browsers are gaining ground.  Firefox
is now the browser of choice throughout the company I work for.

I suspect the best defence will be to block all xul on the proxy.
