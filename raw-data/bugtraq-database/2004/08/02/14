Before downloading there is a Warning "You are about to export sensitive 
information in plaintext format. Continue?". So the firmware tells you, 
what you are doing.

The shared secret is not included in the standard report. You have to tag 
"VPN Keys" before generating the report.
But sure, the Tech Support Report includes other sensitive information (IP 
networks connected, routing tables, mail addresses etc).

I would not send this report by plain mail. Normally the TechSupport 
Report should be added to a https protected customer portal site at 
sonicwall. I had never been asked by sonicwall tech support to send a 
report by mail.
