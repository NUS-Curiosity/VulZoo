On my system (Linux with fvwm2 window manager) the window has just the
right size to show the fake status bar but hide the real status bar. The
missing bottom window border is the only indication that there may be
something wrong (and that's not a big indication, since windows that
don't fit entirely on the screen aren't that uncommon).

A quote from <URL:http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22183#c77>:

It looks like firefox doesn't "put a dark inset border around untrusted
chrome". Is there a similar exploit for Mozilla 1.7, to see whetehr that
border would be noticable (the URLs in the bug don't work).

Anyway, there are a few more things that Mozilla (suite or firefox)
could do:

* allow user to disable hiding of chrome (like disabling popups, etc.)

* add a UI to the "allow javascript only from trusted sites" feature. 
  (few people know that mozilla can do that, and even for those, editing
  user.js is tedious).
