Welcome to the world of Malware. There are many IE flaws that allow for the installation of spy/mal/ad :ware.

Either disable install on demand, apply XP SP2, or switch them to Mozilla to prevent future installs of this type.

Making HKLM\Software|Microsoft|Windows|CurrentVersion|Run read only via regedt32 will help as well.

Also install spybot (freeware from security.kolla.de, downloadable from download.com) version 1.3 _with_ tea timer, which will protect your system settings and notify you if one is changed. Convince the user that No is his favorite button to click on as well :)
