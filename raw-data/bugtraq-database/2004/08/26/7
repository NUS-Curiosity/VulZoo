Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold is a Microsoft Windows based network monitoring
application. More information is available at:

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Ipswitch
Inc.'s WhatsUp Gold allows attackers to execute arbitrary code under the
privileges of the user that instantiated the application.

The problem specifically exists in the _maincfgret.cgi script accessible
through the web server installed by WhatsUp Gold. By posting a long
string for the value of 'instancename', a buffer overflow occurs
allowing an attacker to redirect the flow of control and eventually
execute arbitrary code.

code under the privileges of the user that instantiated the application.
The WhatsUp Gold web server is not enabled by default.
