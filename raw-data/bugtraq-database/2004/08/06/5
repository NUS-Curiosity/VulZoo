Subject: RE: Clear text password exposure in Datakey's tokens and smartcards


Simply by exposing "another" vulnerability in a "secure" system allows judgement to be made on what type of hardware is necessary for the "secure system" (i.e. will this system serve as a public kiosk, or will this system be at the user's bidding?). Vulnerabilities should be kept to a minimum and narrow the choice of attack vectors an attacker may choose from when attempting to compromise a target system. Once a system is compromised and rooted there is little that can prevent the attacker from collecting what they are searching for (be it pins, passwords, source code, etc) before they vanish into the darkness.

Surely if the user is entering a passphrase then the same problem exists -  
that of effectively eavesdropping that communication from the keyboard?

Ignoring the initial expense for a moment, wouldn't it have made a lot of  
sense to include the keypad actually on the cards?  Obviously, card  
readers would need to be contructed such that the keypad part of the card  
would be exposed during use.  The keypad security could then rely on the  
tamper resistant properties of the rest of the card.

 From a costs perspective, I would guess that the actual per-card cost  
increase would be minimal if hundreds of millions of these cards were  
produced.
