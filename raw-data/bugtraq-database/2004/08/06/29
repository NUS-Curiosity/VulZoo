Subject: Re: [Full-Disclosure] Clear text password exposure in Datakey's tokens and smartcards


Not unless the card is stolen and the owner either doesn't notice  
immediately or doesn't report it immediately.  How many people will turn  
up at work (for instance) claiming to have 'forgotton' their card rather  
than report it lost, on the off chance they have actually misplaced it?   
If the keys give access to money, reputation, authority or the like then  
perhaps the size of the exposure window is important?
