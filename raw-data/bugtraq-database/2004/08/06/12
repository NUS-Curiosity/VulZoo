I found this vulnerability (or class of them) in July 2003 and 
described it on several security lists on March 9th, 2004. For examples 
(actual exploitable vulnerabilities), you can try Google search for 
"argument injection vulnerability" or read my messages on this list 
about Outlook mailto: URL vulnerability, Windows Help and Support 
Center HCP: URL vulnerability, or Lotus Notes notes: URL vulnerability.

Thanks,
