Well.. it may be a problem if you can convince root (or somebody else not
yourself) to go to an 'info' page and enter 'f' and 225 bytes and hit return,
or to convince root to run a 'info --restore=' command.  Barring that,
I'm failing to see how it's a "grave" severity - unless there's a way to leverage
it or social-engineer it that I'm missing, if this is "grave" then *every* bug that
results in a SIGSEGV is grave.....
