Subject: Security aspects of time synchronization infrastructure


Hello bugtraq,

  I    published   whitepaper   called   "Security   aspects   of   time
  synchronization  infrastructure".  It  describes  some observations on
  very  common  security  flaws  in  time synchronization infrastructure
  design, including (but not limited to) MS Windows Active Directory.

  Any comments are very appreciated.
