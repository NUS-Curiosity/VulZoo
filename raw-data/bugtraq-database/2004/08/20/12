Subject: Microsoft Windows XP SP2




Let's commence by giving credit where credit is due. The 
thinking is that the manufacturer of Windows XP has done a 
splendid job in patching their little operating system with 300 
million dollar's worth of fixes. This is not exactly 'pocket 
change'.

But this is:

1. trivial scripting in the local zone
2. notepad icon regardless of file in XP's little zip thing

many other 'bits and pieces' to be had but overall a splendid 
effort on the manufacturer's part [for now]. Not quite sure 
where all that money went though.


End Call
