POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:    Remote arbitrary code execution

SOURCE:    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:    CAN-2004-0488

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX
running Apache where a buffer overflow could be exploited remotely
to execute arbitrary code.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.04 with Virtualvault 4.7, Virtualvault 4.6, or
Virtualvault 4.5.

BACKGROUND:
A potential security vulnerability has been reported in the
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
< http://cve.mitre.org/> on mod_ssl module of Apache
HTTP server.  It has been assigned the candidate number
CAN-2004-0488 and is described as below.

Stack-based buffer overflow in the ssl_util_uuencode_binary
function in ssl_util.c for Apache mod_ssl, when mod_ssl is
configured to trust the issuing CA, and "FakeBasicAuth" is
being used, may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a client certificate with a long subject DN.
(CVE CAN-2004-0488).
