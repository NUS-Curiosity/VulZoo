I am currently having the same experience with IBM. Our team has
discovered a crippling vulnerability (in a product in the Tivoli suite)
and for months our IBM contacts have tried passing the buck if they
respond at all. We plan on disclosing the vulnerability before long but
we want to be sure that we run through the normal process before
releasing the information to bugtraq.

  For AIX-releated flaws, the contact is security-alert@...tin.ibm.com
  
  For other products... good luck. I also have a vulnerability in an IBM
product but I wasn't able to get in touch with anyone.

  Online forms told me to call a number that is unreachable outside USA.
  
  The AIX security officer told me he would find the right contact but I
never got anything else since.
