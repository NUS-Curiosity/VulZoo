                potential data corruption

 as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:    08 August 2004



POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:    Data file corruption

SOURCE:    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:    n/a

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP
Process Resource Manager on all OS versions running
PRM C.02.01[.01] and prior.  HP PRM is also used in Workload
Manager, so affects WLM version A.02.01 and prior as well.

This vulnerability could potentially be exploited to corrupt data
on a system running PRM.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
PRM C.02.01[.01] and prior WLM A.02.01 and prior.

BACKGROUND:
A vulnerability exists in PRM for versions up to and including
C.02.01[.01].   Non-root users can potentially cause data file
corruption on a system with PRM installed.  Because HP-UX Workload
Manager (WLM) uses PRM to control resources, the vulnerability
also exists for this software.


AFFECTED VERSIONS

     Note: To determine if a system has an affected version,
           search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
           for an affected fileset.  Then determine if the
           recommended patch or update is installed.

      HP-UX B.11.00
      HP-UX B.11.11
      HP-UX B.11.23
      =============

      Proc-Resrc-Mgr.PRM-RUN

      PRM-Sw-Lib.PRM-LIB

      action: install revision C.02.02 or subsequent

      WLM-Monitor

      Workload-Mgr

      action: install revision A.02.02 or subsequent

      END AFFECTED VERSIONS



NOTE:  Although this security vulnerability is completely solved
       by upgrading the product, there are patches available for
       PRM C.02.02 and WLM A.02.02 that fix various other
       non-security issues.  HP recommends installing these
       patches corresponding to the applicable OS:

HP-UX B.11.00/B.11.11 PRM C.02.02/ WLM A.02.02      PHSS_30985
HP-UX B.11.23         PRM C.02.02/ WLM A.02.02      PHSS_30986


RESOLUTION:
Upgrading to the appropriate PRM and WLM revisions completely
solves this problem:

HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11, B.11.23         PRM C.02.02   WLM A.02.02

PRM C.02.02 can be installed from the March 2004 HP-UX Application
Release media.  To determine which version of PRM is installed,
use the command "what /usr/bin/prmconfig".

NOTE: Customers who have HP-UX Workload Manager (WLM) installed
      should upgrade their WLM version to A.02.02 as well.
      WLM A.02.02 is also part of the March 2004 HP-UX Application
      Release media.  To determine which version of WLM is
      installed, use the command "/opt/wlm/bin/wlmd -V".



MANUAL ACTIONS:  Yes - Update
Upgrading to the appropriate PRM or WLM revisions from the list
below completely solves this problem:

HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11, B.11.23          PRM C.02.02  WLM A.02.02
