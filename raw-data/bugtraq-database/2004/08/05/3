Subject: Re: Clear text password exposure in Datakey's tokens and smartcards


Surely if the user is entering a passphrase then the same problem exists -  
that of effectively eavesdropping that communication from the keyboard?

Ignoring the initial expense for a moment, wouldn't it have made a lot of  
sense to include the keypad actually on the cards?  Obviously, card  
readers would need to be contructed such that the keypad part of the card  
would be exposed during use.  The keypad security could then rely on the  
tamper resistant properties of the rest of the card.

 From a costs perspective, I would guess that the actual per-card cost  
increase would be minimal if hundreds of millions of these cards were  
produced.
