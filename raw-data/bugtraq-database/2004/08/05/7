  This update fixed the following security vulnerabilities:

  handling transparency chunk data, which could be exploited to cause
  arbitrary code to be executed when a specially crafted PNG image is
  processed

  CAN-2004-0598 - Multiple NULL pointer dereferences in
  png_handle_iCPP() and elsewhere could be exploited to cause an
  application to crash when a specially crafted PNG image is processed

  CAN-2004-0599 - Multiple integer overflows in png_handle_sPLT(),
  png_read_png() nctions and elsewhere could be exploited to cause an
  application to crash, or potentially arbitrary code to be executed,
  when a specially crafted PNG image is processed

  CAN-2004-0768 - A buffer overflow could be caused by incorrect
  calculation of buffer offsets, possibly leading to the execution of
  arbitrary code
