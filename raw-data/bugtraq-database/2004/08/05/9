Subject: MS04-025 - Ignorance is truly bliss....


Over the weekend I began writing an information paper on Microsoft
Security Bulletin MS04-025 and the three Internet Explorer issues it
addressed.  The paper slowly went sideways and turned into a large rant
low on technical information but relevant  about MS04-025, CERT, and other
random things in regards to Internet Explorer and in specific the handling
of these three vulnerabilities.

The paper is a bit large to be posted here so you can find it at;

Feel free to email me directly with any comments or flames as I am not
subscribed to any of the lists I am posting this to.
