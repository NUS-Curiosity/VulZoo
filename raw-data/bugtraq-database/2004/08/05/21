Actually, you're looking at the wrong description for McAfee. They also have
exe, txt.exe, htm.exe, txt.scr, zip
McAfee: http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_127175.htm

According to Trend: htm.exe, txt.exe, txt.scr

According to McAfee: EXE, COM, SCR, PIF, BAT, CMD

According to Symantec: exe, txt.exe, htm.exe, txt.scr, zip


Hmm, I wonder who is right...
