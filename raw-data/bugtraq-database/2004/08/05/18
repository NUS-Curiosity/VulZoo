Subject: Re: New MyDoom variant


I actually captured the new variant (*a* new one, anyway) a few days ago
that no AV picked up and forwarded it to Trend and Symantc (I think the SF
guys already had it).  The original attachment was a .zip file with the
contents being  a .doc.exe extension.

The zip was named after my own domain, as in "domain.com.zip" and the file
itself was "domain.com.doc                .exe" with the .exe spaced way out
like the older versions did.

The text of the email was:

"Dear user user@...ain.com, mail system administrator of domain.com would
like to let you know that:
We have found that your account was used to send a large amount of spam
during the last week. Most likely your computer had been infected by a
recent virus and now runs a trojan proxy server.

Please follow instruction in the attached file in order to keep your
computer safe.

Have a nice day,

domain.com user support team."
