Just tried it, it seems that it allows you just to make changes that are 
allowed to unprivileged user; modules that require authentication will 
fail at some point (writing to /etc, installing or removing software, 
enabling/disabling services...). I have tested online update, add/remove 
software, Samba and firewall and they all failed. It does pose some risk, 
however, for it might allow unprivileged user to take a look at some data 
that should be hidden from the user (for example, you can look at firewall 
settings but can't make changes). 

On the other hand, you can start yast from console with -firewall switch 
and have a peek at the settings (still can't make changes), so this isn't 
KDE fault but flaw in yast itself. It would be wise to add some paranoia 
to yast so it won't show sensitive data to unprivileged user.
