Subject: Re: New google's top query?

It's also worth noting that the vast majority of the cards supplied via 
this method, even when it isn't riddled with "hey look what google can 
do!" messages, are test card numbers that are used only for testing online 
payment software, and won't work on live sites.

Also, most of the cards I found when I tested it came with no expiry, and 
9 times out of 10, online merchants also require the 3 digit verification 
code on the back of cards aswell.

Lastly, I'd like to point out, there's a good chance that if the card has 
made it into the public domain, someone else has probably already 
exploited it, and any attempt to use it yourself would be nothing more 
than blatant stupidity, as the card is likely already been cancelled, and 
being monitored for more fradulent activity.

Google is doing nothing, and doesn't need to change anything.  If they do, 
what would be next, they have to locate people's names and scratch them 
off because they might be under the witness protection program?

Justin Wheeler
