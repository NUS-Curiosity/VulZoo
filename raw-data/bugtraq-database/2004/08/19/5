Cacti does not ship PHP. This option is related to PHP configuration,
not to Cacti, that should not rely on any PHP specific option unless
clearly mentionned (e.g. "Cacti must have magic_quotes_gpc set to On"),
would it be default or not.
I just checked available PHP distros, i.e. 4.3.8 and 5.0.1. They are
shipped with two php.ini files, php.ini-distand php.ini-recommanded. The
first one has magic_quotes_gpc set to On, but it is set to Off in the
second one...

True. And it is not mentionned to have it On either.

Cacti should not rely on specific PHP configuration to escape characters
using magic quotes in order to prevent command/code/SQL/whatever
injection, or any security stuff, but its own code to validate user
input.
