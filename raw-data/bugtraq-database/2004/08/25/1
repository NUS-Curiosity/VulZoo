Subject: RE: Microsoft updates documentation on Windows time synchronization


Cisco routers support only MD5 authentication for NTP
(http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hardcisco/chapter/ch10.html).

I have found documentation to update ntp clients on unix systems using this
MD5 authentication but not the equivalent for Windows 2000/2003 ntp client.
Does someone knows if it is feasible and how?

Thanks,

Nicolas.
