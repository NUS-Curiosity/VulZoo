Description:
Easy File Sharing Web Server is a file sharing software 
that allows visitors to upload/download files easily 
through a Web Browser (IE,Netscape,Opera etc.). It can help 
you share files with your friends and colleagues. They can 
download files from your computer or upload files from 
theirs. They will not be required to install this software 
or any other software because an internet browser is enough. 
Easy File Sharing Web Server also provides a Bulletin Board 
System (Forum). It allows remote users to post messages and 
files to the forum.



Unauthorized System Access:
The authorization function used by EFS Webserver is supposed
to keep just anyone from being able to access your files. But
this is not the case and an attacker has read access to the 
entire hard drive by default.

http://127.0.0.1/disk_c

This url will give an attacker read access to the entire C
drive. The issue is exploited by requesting the name of a
virtual folder on the server. (disk_c is there by default)



Denial of Service:
Easy File Sharing Web Server can be DoS'ed and even remotely
crashed by sending a number of large HTTP requests to the web
server. The CPU usage goes up to 99% and in some cases crash.
Attached is a Proof Of Concept script for this issue.



Solution:
The developers were contacted but never responded to my emails
