Subject: A new website to search & submit  win exploits




Hello everyone,

  I made a new search(http://search.dav1d.org)beta on my website.It includes hundreds of exploits under windows. If you want to find some exploits, please try it. For example: input keywords like "MS03-026"&#65292;"RPC DCOM",etc.
  
  And if you have a new exploit, or have good ideas, please also tell me. Thanks very much. Sorry for my bad English. :)
