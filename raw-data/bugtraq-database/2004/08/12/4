Subject: Re: ISS BlackIce Server Protect Unprivileged User
 Attack



The fact that the .ini files are Everyone Full control was pointed out 
by us when we released SRT2004-01-17-0227 
-http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2004-January/016290.html

ISS said something along the lines of Windows is not commonly deployed 
as a multi-user system and ... thus it is not a problem... (this of 
course was in regards to the local overflow that was able to be 
triggered because of the fact that their .ini files were world writable.

I have heard that since then BlackICE now incorperates .ini file 
encryption... I am not sure if they ever corrected the permissions though.
