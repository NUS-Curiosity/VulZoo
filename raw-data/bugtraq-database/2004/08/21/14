FWIW, this has been dealt with in Openwall GNU/*/Linux (Owl) before our
project was first announced to the public 3+ years ago.  ALT Linux is
another (or the other?) distribution vendor which also dealt with this
roughly 3 years ago.

Our patch sets and replacements for the various packages are available
for consideration and possible re-use by other distributions.  The
patches are easy to get without having to download the entire system -
as a small tarball (only 1.5 MB gzipped) available on our FTP mirrors
or from our public anoncvs and CVSweb servers:
