This has been well documented. I remember a tool from 2002 that would
decrypt the hash from command line.  

printf ("IMail Password Decryptor\n");
printf ("Usage: %s <account name> <encrypted string>\n", name);
printf ("E.g., %s crypto CCE5DFE5E2\n
^^^^^^^^^^---CAPITAL LETTERS\n\n", name);
printf ("This information is found in the registry at:\n
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Ipswitch\\IMail\\Domains\n");

Password Decryption

Hi fellaz,

IpSwitch IMail Server version up to 8.1 uses weak encryption algorithm
to 
encrypt its user passwords. Have a look at attached proof of concept
tool, 
which will decrypt user password from local machine instantly.
