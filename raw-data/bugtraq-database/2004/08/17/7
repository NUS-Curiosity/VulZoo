Synopsis
========

glibc contains an information leak vulnerability allowing the debugging
of SUID binaries.

Background
==========

The GNU C library defines various Unix-like "system calls" and other
basic facilities needed for a standard POSIX-like application to
operate.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /      Vulnerable      /               Unaffected

  2  sys-libs/glibc      <= 2.3.3.20040420        >= 2.3.3.20040420-r1

  4  sys-libs/glibc      <= 2.3.4.20040619        >= 2.3.4.20040619-r1
  5  sys-libs/glibc        <= 2.3.2-r10                    Vulnerable!
  6  sys-libs/glibc      <= 2.3.4.20040605                 Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     # Package 1 only applies to ALPHA, ARM, HPPA, IA64 and SPARC
       users.
     # Package 2 only applies to x86 and PPC users.
     # Package 3 only applies to MIPS users.
     # Package 4 only applies to AMD64 users.
     # Package 5 only applies to S390 users.
     # Package 6 only applies to PPC64 users.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     6 affected packages; please see the notes above...

Description
===========

Silvio Cesare discovered a potential information leak in glibc. It
allows LD_DEBUG on SUID binaries where it should not be allowed. This
has various security implications, which may be used to gain
confidentional information.

Impact
======

An attacker can gain the list of symbols a SUID application uses and
their locations and can then use a trojaned library taking precendence
over those symbols to gain information or perform further exploitation.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to the latest available version of glibc.

Resolution
==========

All glibc users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv your_version
    # emerge your_version

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:

Concerns?
=========

confidentiality and security of our users machines is of utmost
importance to us. Any security concerns should be addressed to
