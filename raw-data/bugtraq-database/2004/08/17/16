Netwosix Linux Security Advisory #2004-0017 <http://www.netwosix.org>
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package name:      rsync
Summary:              Exposure of System Information
Date:                    2004-08-17
Affected versions:  Netwosix 1.0  Netwosix 1.1
************************************************************************************

- -> Package description:
- ------------------------
rsync is an open source utility that provides fast incremental file transfer. 
rsync is freely available under the GNU General Public License version 2

- -> Problem description:
- ------------------------

There is a path-sanitizing bug that affects daemon mode in all recent rsync 
versions (including 2.6.2) but only if chroot is disabled. It does NOT affect 
the normal send/receive filenames that specify what files should be 
transferred (this is because these names happen to get sanitized twice, and 
thus the second call removes any lingering leading slash(es) that the first 
call left behind). It does affect certain option paths that cause auxilliary 
files to be read or written.


- -> Action:
- ------------------------
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.

- ---------------------------------
Linux Netwosix is a powerful and optimized Linux distribution for servers
and Network Security related jobs.  It can also be used for special operations
such as penetration testing with its big collection of security oriented
software and sources. It's a light distribution created for the requirements
