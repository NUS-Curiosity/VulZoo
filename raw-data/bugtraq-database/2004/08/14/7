Subject: Re: Re: [ GLSA 200408-10 ] gv: Exploitable
	Buffer Overflow

Anyone stupid enough to run the code in question should have been left
to it, they deserved it.

If you can't read the code kids, DON'T run it!!

Hugo himself was amazed how effective his prank was, keep it up Hugo I
for one can't get enough of it :), it beats the hell out of the Politics
and XPSP2 posts we've been wading through recently.
If someone spots an on-topic post be sure to alert me. Thanks. :-P
