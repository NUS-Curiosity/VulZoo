  For AIX-releated flaws, the contact is security-alert@...tin.ibm.com
  
  For other products... good luck. I also have a vulnerability in an IBM
product but I wasn't able to get in touch with anyone.

  Online forms told me to call a number that is unreachable outside USA.
  
  The AIX security officer told me he would find the right contact but I
never got anything else since.
