With 1.12 CVS can (and that seems to be the default) use system
authentication methods like PAM and does setuid etc before doing any cvs 
operations, which takes places as the respective user. It won't even let
me add users in CVSROOT/passwd. It does allow me to set a different password
for CVS acess though.

But also 1.11 did setuid etc before doing CVS operations.
