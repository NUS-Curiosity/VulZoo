Package        : squirrelmail
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CAN-2004-0519 CAN-2004-0520 CAN-2004-0521 CAN-2004-0639

Four vulnerabilities were discovered in squirrelmail:

 CAN-2004-0519 - Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
 in SquirrelMail 1.4.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 script as other users and possibly steal authentication information
 via multiple attack vectors, including the mailbox parameter in
 compose.php.

 CAN-2004-0520 - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mime.php
 for SquirrelMail before 1.4.3 allows remote attackers to insert
 arbitrary HTML and script via the content-type mail header, as
 demonstrated using read_body.php.

 CAN-2004-0521 - SQL injection vulnerability in SquirrelMail before
 1.4.3 RC1 allows remote attackers to execute unauthorized SQL
 statements, with unknown impact, probably via abook_database.php.

 CAN-2004-0639 - Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
 in Squirrelmail 1.2.10 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject
 arbitrary HTML or script via (1) the $mailer variable in
 read_body.php, (2) the $senderNames_part variable in
 mailbox_display.php, and possibly other vectors including (3) the
 $event_title variable or (4) the $event_text variable.

For the current stable distribution (woody), these problems have been
fixed in version 1:1.2.6-1.4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
2:1.4.3a-0.1 and earlier versions.

We recommend that you update your squirrelmail package.
