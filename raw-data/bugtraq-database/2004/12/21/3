Subject: Re: Windows Explorer TGA Crash is a DoS bug in
	Internet Explorer.


Tested on win2ksp4, IE6.0sp1 fully patched (hmmm... not really "fully" obviously ;))

It's a DoS, nothing exploitable. Explorer let's IE do the rendering in "thumbnail" previes mode. IE creates a HTML page and crashes while creating or rendering it. Same bug can be triggered easier with following HTML code:

<HTLM><BODY><IFRAME src="file://þ:/filename"></BODY></HTML>

CharLowerA doesn't handle the 0xFE byte very well since it is converted to a signed int (0xFFFFFFFE). It then scans memory at 0xFFFFFFFE which causes an exception.
