You still need a local account: the one used by the user coaxed into 
assembling the code.  The fact that the source of the code in your example 
was from a network user does not make it a remote exploit; one could just as 
easily write the code on a bubble gum wrapper and have the user type it in, 
then assemble it.  Your example simply bypasses this logic by providing 
circumstances where the attacker need not possess the local account 
credentials, though a local account is most certainly needed to exploit the 
vulnerability.

I doubt seriously that many will read this statement and interpret it 
magnanimously. The "you're lucky we didn't use it for criminal purposes" 
position doesn't exactly leave one all warm and fuzzy.  To me, there are 
many other aspects of the "full-disclosure" debate that should be considered 
within the context of how the community is affected before the "well, I 
could have done this as an individual" statements are made.
