Subject: Xprobe 0.2.1 Released


The xprobe2 development team is pleased to announce the immediate 
availability of Xprobe2 v0.2.1. Xprobe2 is a remote active operating 
system fingerprinting tool which uses advanced techniques, some which 
where first to be introduced with Xprobe2, such as the usage of 
statistical analysis ('fuzzy logic') to match between probe response(s) 
to its signature database and others, in order to provide with accurate 
results regarding the underlying operating system of a probed 
element(s).

Version 0.2.1 fixes a number of bugs and introduces more features:

- Port scanning is now available through the usage of the -T (TCP) and 
-U (UDP) command line options
- Added the -B command line option ('blind port guess') used for 
searching an open TCP port among the following ports: 80, 21, 25, 22, 
139
- Fixed timeouts and made pcap_next() nonblocking, as it was causing 
problems on linux
- Fixed problem that occurs when localhost does not resolve (set_dst() 
in IP::IP(const char*))
- Include XSD schema with distribution and make our XML comply with 
that XSD
- patricklang@...l.utexas.edu's fixes that would port Xprobe2 to MacOSX 
(destructors, endiannes, config.* stuff)
- moved SHA1 into xplib/ will be needed by burst module
- loopback (lo) is now supported
- dump select() in sniffpack() as it is not portable
- Fixed terminating " error that we were getting w/ gcc 3.x
- Fixed error handling in xp_get_src_addr()
