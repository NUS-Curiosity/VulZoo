There's no such thing.

As has already been pointed out, a user from the network could send me a
shell script containing "rm -rf ~". I'd be mad not to inspect a random
unsolicited shell script before I ran it. I'd be mad not to inspect a
similarly unsolicited NASM file before I assembled it; ditto input to
csv2xml, abcm2ps, or many of the other "vulnerable" programs.

This is not to belittle the effort that went into finding these bugs.
Just to say that labelling them all as "remotely exploitable" is rather
overstating the case.
