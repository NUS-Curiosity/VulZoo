Was it your intention not to give _users_ of their programs an extra
time of not being _widely_ attacked?  While you certainly cannot offer
them alternative software for their tasks - of your own programs only
ezmlm with third-party patches is more than proof of concept.  We need
software that does the work, not only one that demonstrates that the
work can be done in principle.
