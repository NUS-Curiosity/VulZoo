MPlayer MMST Streaming Stack Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.16.04
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=167
December 16, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

MPlayer is a movie player for Linux that also runs on many other Unices, 
and non- x86 CPUs. It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO, 
ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, YUV4MPEG, FILM, RoQ, PVA 
files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can 
watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5 and other formats. 

More information is available at http://mplayerhq.hu/.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack overflow vulnerability in MPlayer could 
allow remote users to gain access to the computer.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to a lack of bounds checking 
in /libmpdemux/asf_mmst_straming.c. If a specially crafted file 
specifies a large value for the length field, the overflow is triggered 
in get_data(). The vulnerable code follows: 

static int get_media_packet (int s, int padding, streaming_ctrl_t *stream_ctrl) {
  unsigned char  pre_header[8];
  char           data[BUF_SIZE];
  
[...]
    packet_len = get_32 ((unsigned char*)&packet_len, 0) + 4;

[!]    if (!get_data (s, data, packet_len)) {
      printf ("command data read failed\n");
      return 0;
    }
[...] 

Once the get_data function overwrites stack memory, the saved return 
address can be controlled, thus allowing for execution of arbitrary 
code.

III. ANALYSIS

If remote exploitation is successful, the attacker would be able to gain 
access with the privileges of the user who attempted to view the stream.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed that MPlayer version 1.0pre5 is vulnerable.

The following distributions of Linux include MPlayer:
	
	Debian Linux 
	Fedora Linux 
	Gentoo Linux

V. WORKAROUND

Users must be careful when accepting and opening media from untrusted 
sources. Do not accept media from those you do not trust. Do not stream 
media from servers you do not trust.
