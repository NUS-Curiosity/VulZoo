Subject: [SAMBA] CAN-2004-1154 : Integer overflow could lead to remote code
 execution in Samba 2.x,  3.0.x <= 3.0.9


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

==========================================================
==
== Subject:	Possible remote code execution
== CVE ID#: 	CAN-2004-1154
==
== Versions:	Samba 2.x & 3.0.x <= 3.0.9
==
== Summary: 	A potential integer overflow when
==		unmarshalling specific MS-RPC requests
==		from clients could lead to heap
==		corruption and remote code execution.
==
==========================================================


===========
Description
===========

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability
in the smbd daemon included in Samba 2.0.x, Samba 2.2.x,
and Samba 3.0.x prior to and including 3.0.9 could
allow an attacker to cause controllable heap corruption,
leading to execution of arbitrary commands with root
privileges.

Successful remote exploitation allows an attacker to
gain root privileges on a vulnerable system. In order
to exploit this vulnerability an attacker must possess
credentials that allow access to a share on the Samba server.
Unsuccessful exploitation attempts will cause the process
serving the request to crash with signal 11, and may leave
evidence of an attack in logs.


==================
Patch Availability
==================

A patch for Samba 3.0.9 (samba-3.0.9-CAN-2004-1154.patch)
can be downloaded from

Protecting Unpatched Servers
=============================

The Samba Team always encourages users to run the latest
stable release as a defense against attacks.  However,
under certain circumstances it may not be possible to
immediately upgrade important installations.  In such
cases, administrators should read the "Server Security"
documentation found at

http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/server_security.html.
