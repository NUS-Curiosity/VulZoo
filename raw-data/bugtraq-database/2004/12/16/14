Subject: DJB's students release 44 *nix software vulnerability advisories


Widely deployed open source software is commonly believed to contain
fewer security vulnerabilities than similar closed source software due
to the possibility of unrestricted third party source code auditing.
Predictably, most users of open source software do not invest a
significant amount of time to audit the applications they use and now a
class of 25 students has discovered 44 vulnerabilities during a CS
course.

This small group of students highlights how individuals outside the
security industry without special security prerequisites can still
manage to outperform the average Bugtraq poster in sheer quantity of
discoveries. This adequately validates the typical estimate of between 5
and 15 errors in every thousand lines of code.

D.J. Bernstein (http://cr.yp.to/djb.html) is lecturing a course this
fall at the University of Illinois at Chicago called "MCS 494: Unix
Security Holes" (http://cr.yp.to/2004-494.html). One of the requirements
to pass the course was to find and exploit 10 previously undiscovered
security holes in currently deployed Unix software. 

With a class of 25 students discovering 44 vulnerabilities most students
now expect to fail the course
(http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/15/2113202).

The 44 security advisories have been published at
