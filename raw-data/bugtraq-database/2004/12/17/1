Subject: OpenText FirstClass 8.0 HTTP Daemon /Search
	Remote DoS Vulnerability


13.12.04
OpenText FirstClass 8.0 HTTP Daemon /Search Remote DoS Vulnerability

The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the handling of large
requests. This can e.g. be exploited to potentially cause a vulnerable
server to stop responding or function correctly by sending a large
amount of POST requests to "/Search" over multiple connections.

The vulnerability has been reported in version 7.1 and 8.0. Other
versions may also be affected.
