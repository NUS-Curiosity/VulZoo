1. Systems affected:

        All versions of KDE up to KDE 3.3.2 inclusive. 


2. Overview:

        The Konqueror webbrowser allows websites to load webpages into
        a window or tab currently used by another website.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2004-1158 to this issue.

        This vulnerability is similar to the Konqueror Frame Injection
        Vulnerability reported on 2004-08-11 but the solution offered
        as part of that advisory did not cover the window case.

3. Impact:

        A malicious website could abuse Konquer to load its own content
        into a window or tab that was opened by a trusted website or
        it could trick a trusted website into loading content into an
        existing window or tab. This may be abused to confuse the user
        about the origin of a certain webpage. As a result the user may
        unknowingly send confidential information intended for the trusted
        website to the malicious website.
                

4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
