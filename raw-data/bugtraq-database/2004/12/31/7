Subject: Bluetooth: BlueSnarf and BlueBug Full Disclusore


BlueSnarf, BlueBug & HeloMoto Full Disclosure, December 2004
------------------------------------------------------------

In November 2003, various vulnerabilities on Bluetooth enabled mobile 
phones emerged, as published here:

   http://www.thebunker.net/security/bluetooth.htm

Details of the attacks were disclosed at the Chaos Computer Club's 
annual congress in Berlin - 21C3:

   http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/fahrplan/event/66.en.html

Slides from the talk can be found here:

   http://trifinite.org/Downloads/21c3_Bluetooth_Hacking.pdf

Video of the talk will be on the CCC site in due course.

It was felt, as the industry had been given a full 13 months to react to 
the original threat discovery, and responsible manufacturers had 
engineered and released firmware upgrades, that the time had come for 
full disclosure.  This became increasingly urgent as it was clear that 
the techniques used were becoming realtively widely known within the 
security community, and it could therefore be assumed that the same was 
true for criminal and/or malicious users.

Vendor Responses
----------------

Nokia's response page is here:

   http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,56221,0.html

It emerged at the conference that Nokia have created a special warranty 
code for the Bluetooth security issues, and any affected phone, 
regardless of age or origin, can be upgraded under that code free of 
charge. This was stated by a member of the audience during the 
presentation, and has not yet been verified.

Known affected devices: 6310, 6310i, 8910, 8910i

Sony Ericsson have not responded directly to the author, but have stated 
publicly that the problem has been fixed in all affected phones. This 
has not been verified, and availability of firmware upgrades is unknown.

Known affected devices: T68, T68i, R520m, T610, Z1010, Z600

Motorola stated that they are committed to fixing the problem, but 
further details are unknown.

Known affected devices: V80, V5xx, V6xx and E398.

I hope this is useful, and I wish you all a safe, happy and secure New Year!

cheers,
Adam
