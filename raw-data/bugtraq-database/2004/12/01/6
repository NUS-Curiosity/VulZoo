Hello,

In my opinion the bug can't be exploited. I analized it in the debugger and found out that the address of the malicious code that is supposed to be executed has a NULL character. That means, that when we create the infected string in the .m3u file with the NULL char the malicious code won't be copied to the buffer as it would reside after the NULL char and the string would be cut.

In the proof of concept I found on the internet the shellcode address had no zeros and it is very strange for me.

I performed this check on WinXP SP1.

>= Public disclosure on November 23, 2004

>In this time of responsible vulnerability disclosure, it's a little

>This advisory is a little late, the update was posted to the vendor
>website last week. The only reason I know this, is because I asked and
>received a response.
