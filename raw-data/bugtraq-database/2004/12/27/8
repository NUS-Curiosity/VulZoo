Subject: Re: Re: Microsoft Windows LoadImage API Integer
	Buffer overflow


I don't see why one would need a script to exploit the hole.

In any event, I'd like to shim the API to catch this bug, since the fat and sassy millionaire
monopolists at Microsoft are unlikely to get off their derrieres to fix the bug during
Christmas. Unfortunately, it's part of a big system DLL with tons of entry points. How best to 
shim it?
