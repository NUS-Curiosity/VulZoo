Subject: Oracle clear text passwords (#NISR2122004D)



NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Oracle 10g clear text passwords
Systems Affected: Oracle 10g on all operating systems	
Severity: Medium Risk
Vendor URL: http://www.oracle.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ davidl at ngssoftware.com ]
Relates to: http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/oracle-01.txt
Date of Public Advisory: 23rd December 2004
Advisory number: #NISR2122004D
Advisory URL: http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/oracle23122004D.txt

Description
***********
The 10g Oracle database server may have passwords in clear text in world
readable files.

Details
*******
The password for the SYSMAN account (a DBA) can be found in
$ORACLE_HOME/hostname_sid/sysman/config/emoms.properties. This file is world
readable.

Also, on installing Oracle 10g if the installer supplies the same password
for the SYS, SYSTEM, DBSNMP and SYSMAN accounts and that password has an
exclamation mark in it (e.g. f00bar!!) then an error occurs in the DB
install when the passwords are set for SYSMAN and DBSNMP. This error is
logged to the "postDBCreation.log" logging the password. 

alter user SYSMAN identified by f00bar!! account unlock
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00922: missing or invalid option

alter user DBSNMP identified by f00bar!! account unlock
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00922: missing or invalid option

This file is world readable giving attackers access to what the passwords
are for these powerful accounts. Please note that no error is generated for
SYS or SYSTEM and these accounts are assigned the password f00bar!!. The
other accounts are given their default passwords.

Fix Information
***************
A patch (#68) was released for this problem by Oracle. See
http://metalink.oracle.com/ for more details. NGSSQuirreL for Oracle
(http://www.nextgenss.com/squirrelora.htm), can be used to assess whether
your Oracle servers are vulnerable to this.
