Lets do the math. The vulnerable code has been around for a year. A 
vulnerability is discovered. The software provider wants 2 weeks. Lets 
say (generously) that there are 10 times as many SOHO users defending 
against A as there are critical infrastructure users defending against B.

    * If we do A (responsible disclosure) then we expose (say) X users
      to 2/50 additional weeks of time in which an el33t hax0r has a
      private 0day against them that might be deployed, so you get
      X*0.04 of time/risk exposure.
    * If we do B (full disclosure), then we save the critical
      infrastructure people that X*0.04 risk days, and instead we get
      the 10X of SOHO users exposed to 2 weeks in which there is no
      patch available. Assume that the software had another year of
      lifespan before it was obsoleted, so again there is a factor of
      2/50 or 0.04 on the risk days, but there are 10X users, so the
      total risk factor is X*0.4.

Netted out, the risk/benefit is roughly the same but multiplied by the 
size of the respective communities, and the SOHO community is much, much 
larger.

I further submit that not all critical infrastructure people agree with 
you, and some would rather see responsible disclosure of 
vulnerabilities. You can tell by the number of enterprises subscribing 
to early warning services for responsible disclosure for big $$$.

Neither is a colloquial ad homenim approach to describing your opponents 
pie in the sky position :)

Indeed. Another approach is to deploy intrusion prevention technologies 
such as Immunix <http://immunix.com/technology/> that can block 0-day 
attacks without needing any specific knowledge of whatever DJB's class 
will come up with next time.

More precisely, if you are talking about a service that can be *taken 
down* while waiting for a fix or a work-around, then full disclosure is 
an advantage. If the service cannot (or will not) be taken down and will 
be just left to run the risk of compromise, then responsible disclosure 
helps. I submit that most enterprise systems are of the "damn the 
torpedoes" school of thought.

This does not make me feel better about full disclosure :)

Big fat caveat: All of the above assumes that the investigator is 
actually well-intentioned. Actual black hats will do whatever they want, 
and what we all advocate is of no matter, so defenders have to be able 
to withstand 0-days anyway.
