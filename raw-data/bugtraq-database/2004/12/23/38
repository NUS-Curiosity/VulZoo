Description:
PsychoStats is a statistics generator for games. Currently there is support 
for a handful of Half-Life "MODs" including Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, 
and Natural Selection. PsychoStats gathers statistics from the log files
that 
game servers create by reading through the logs and then calculating
detailed 
statistics for players, maps, weapons and clans. These detailed statistics 
are  stored in a MySQL database which are then viewed online from your
website 
using  a set of PHP web pages. 




Cross Site Scripting:
Cross site scripting exists in Jason Morriss PsychoStats. This vulnerability

exists due to user supplied input not being checked properly. Below is an
example.

 http://www.example.com/stats/login.php?login=[XSS]

This vulnerability could be used to steal cookie based authentication 
credentials within the scope of the current domain, or render hostile code 
in a victim's browser.




Solution:
The vendor was contacted, responded very promptly and said he will be
addressing the
issue soon and has released an updated version of the software.
