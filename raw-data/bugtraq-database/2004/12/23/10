Fortunately, it is quite easy to configure Webmin to defend against this kind
of brute-force password guessing attack. Just do the following :

 - Go to the Webmin Configuration module.

 - Click on the Authentication icon.

 - Select 'Enable password timeouts'.

 - Click on the 'Save' button at the bottom of the page.

Future releases will enable this by default.
