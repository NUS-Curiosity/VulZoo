Subject: Oracle ISQLPlus file access vulnerability (#NISR2122004E)



NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Oracle ISQL*Plus load.uix file access
Systems Affected: Oracle 10g AS on all operating systems	
Severity: Medium
Vendor URL: http://www.oracle.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ davidl at ngssoftware.com ]
Relates to: http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/oracle-01.txt
Date of Public Advisory: 23rd December 2004
Advisory number: #NISR2122004E
Advisory URL: http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/oracle23122004E.txt

Description
***********
The 10g Oracle Application Server installs ISQL*Plus. Once logged in, an
attacker can use load.uix to read files on the server.

Details
*******
From isqlplus it is possible to load a script and execute it. On navigating
to http://server:5560/isqlplus/load.uix two input boxes are displayed - one
called "URL" and the other "File". By entering in a full path an attacker
can load and read any file that the oracle user can read. For example
"/etc/passwd" on Linux or "C:\boot.ini" on windows. An attacker can read the
the files mentioned in #NISR2122004D to gain the privileges of SYSMAN.

Fix Information
***************
A patch (#68) was released for this problem by Oracle. See
http://metalink.oracle.com/ for more details. NGSSQuirreL for Oracle
(http://www.nextgenss.com/squirrelora.htm), can be used to assess whether
your Oracle servers are vulnerable to this.
