Subject: Re: WebWorm using PHPBB vulnerability in the wild!


This is something that I've wondered about for a while: Given the issues 
with it, why do the authors of nearly every webapp persist in putting 
the full version number at the bottom of each page? This, coupled with 
search engines indexing the pages provides a nice easy directory of 
sites to hack, or in this case, to exploit with a worm.

Has there been an advisory to this effect?
