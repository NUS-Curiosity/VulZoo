Subject: Re: MD5 To Be Considered Harmful Someday


For what it is worth, I have an ANSI standard C++ implementation of the 
sha-160/224/256/384/512 bit algorithms that auto-detects endian-ness and 
adjusts accordingly (tested on Wintel, Lintel and Solaris).  It can be 
found at http://sol-biotech.com/code/sha2/ (it comes with a test suite that 
was developed by Aaron D. Gifford who did the C implementation I based it 
on).  For some reason the default directory display does not list the 
README File, it is here: http://sol-biotech.com/code/sha2/README.  I 
created a simple password class for creating and managing passwords based 
on my sha* implementation, it can be found here: 
http://sol-biotech.com/code/SimplePass/.  I would love to have constructive 
feedback.
