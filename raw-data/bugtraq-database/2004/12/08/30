SHA-1 is truncatable to 128 bits for applications that have limited 
space available for hashes.  This limits the birthday paradox attack to 
a 2^64 effort, but MD5 isn't anywhere close to that anymore.  
(Incidentally, the output of birthday attack is an unchosen collision, 
just like Wang's.)

SHA-1 isn't perfect, but we haven't known its been broken for a decade 
like we have for MD5.
