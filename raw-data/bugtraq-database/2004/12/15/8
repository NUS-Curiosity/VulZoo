well, i was also examining the igmp exploit you posted earlier, that one 
was relatively easy to disable, by setting the following sysctl vars:

net.ipv4.igmp_max_msf = 0
net.ipv4.igmp_max_memberships = 0
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1

since i dont really need igmp support on that server=)

its just that scm_send thing, that i didnt find any config option for...
so i guess that means either waiting till someone of the kernel 
maintainers release a patch, or get one of my friends, that is better on 
programming tasks, to fix that one...
all at all makes for quite a risky day for a shell provider...
