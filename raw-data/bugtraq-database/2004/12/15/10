Description:
phpGroupWare (formerly known as webdistro) is a multi-user 
groupware suite written in PHP. It provides a Web-based calendar, 
todo-list, addressbook, email, news headlines, and a file manager. 
The calendar supports repeating events. The email system supports 
inline graphics and file attachments. The system as a whole supports 
user preferences, themes, user permissions, multi-language support, 
an advanced API, and user groups. phpGroupWare is included with some 
Linux distributions.



Path Disclosure:
phpGroupWare allows for full path disclosure. This issue can take 
place in more than one way. One example that will trigger the path 
disclosure is by appending junk (such as metacharacters) to the end 
of a session id. Below are two other examples

http://host/phpgroupware/preferences/preferences.php?appname=blah
http://host/phpgroupware/index.php?menuaction=blah

This will reveal the full physical path of the web directory, and 
could possibly aid a would be attacker. The other example of path
disclosure can be triggered by specifying an invalid menu item.



Cross Site Scripting:
Cross Site Scripting takes place in multiple places in phpGroupWare.
Below are some examples.

t=1&order=1&start=0
http://host/phpgroupware/tts/viewticket_details.php?ticket_id=338%22%3E%3Cif
rame%3E

These Cross Site Scripting issues could allow an attacker to possibly 
gather sensitive information from a victim, and execute arbitrary client 
side code in the context of the victim's browser.



SQL Injection:
phpGrouWare has several SQL Injection holes. Some are not bad, some are 
a bit unorthadox, and a few are dangerous. One example of a kinda unorthadox

SQL Injection is in the Trouble Ticket system. If an attacker requests a url

like this:

http://host/phpgroupware/tts/viewticket_details.php?ticket_id=355[SQL_QUERY]

nothing will happen, but as soon as you save the ticket you are allowed to 
influence a SELECT query which could be very bad. Some more examples of the 
not so dangerous SQL Injection issues are:

http://host/phpgroupware/index.php?menuaction=todo.ui.show_list&order=[SQL_Q
UERY]&sort=ASC&filter=&qfield=&start=&query=
http://host/phpgroupware/index.php?menuaction=projects.uiprojects.list_proje
cts&order=[SQL_QUERY]&sort=ASC&filter=&qfield=&start=&query=&pro_main=&actio
n=mains

It should be noted that other parts of this query can be tampered with also,

such as the sort fields etc. Now for some examples of the more dangerous 
issues that let you influence the query right in the middle of a SELECT
statement.

http://host/phpgroupware/index.php?menuaction=projects.uiprojects.edit_proje
ct&pro_main=31&action=subs&project_id=32[SQL_QUERY]
http://host/phpgroupware/index.php?menuaction=projects.uiprojects.edit_proje
ct&pro_main=31[SQL_QUERY]&action=subs&project_id=32
http://host/phpgroupware/index.php?menuaction=projects.uiprojects.view_proje
ct&pro_main=31&action=subs&project_id=32[SQL_QUERY]&domain=default
http://host/phpgroupware/index.php?menuaction=projects.uiprojects.view_proje
ct&pro_main=31[SQL_QUERY]&action=subs&project_id=32&domain=default&494fbb
http://host/phpgroupware/index.php?menuaction=projects.uiprojecthours.view_h
ours&project_id=32&pro_parent=&action=subs&hours_id=26[SQL_QUERY]&domain=def
ault

You can use these particular examples to UNION select info from the database
with
little effort required. This can be bad when password hashes start getting
pulled
by an attacker, or other sensitive data. I will release my proof of concepts
for
phpGroupWare once the updated version is available.



Notes:
All of the example url's had the session id, click history, and kp3
variables 
removed except where they were part of one of the examples. I also wrapped a
few of the above examples for readability.



Solution:
I was able to speak to one of the lead developers via IRC on September 25th,
2004. I made the developer aware of the vulnerabilities, and held off on 
publishing my findings for a couple of months. I have not been able to get
in
touch with any developers for some weeks now, so I publish my finding in
hopes 
that the community will present a fix :)
