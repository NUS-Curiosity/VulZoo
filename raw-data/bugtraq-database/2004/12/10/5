Subject: HOW TO BREAK XP SP2 POPUP BLOCKER: kick it in the nut !




Friday, December 10, 2004

Internet Explorer 6 on the gadget commonly known as Windows XP SP2 enjoys  
a fairly robust "popup blocker".  

This little 'thing' has been a major irritation to date. Nothing gets past 
it until now.  Chatter exists that some sites have defeated it on the 
causal default setting. We only deal in the high settings here !

Our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Liu Die Yu takes the sledgehammer and cracks 
open this bothersome little nut like so:

Notes:

1. Nothing like a bit of irritation to get constructive
2. Additional popup blocker from MSN is also killed, may may Die ! too
3. Get editive before it's too late: http://www.editive.com
4. None

End Call
