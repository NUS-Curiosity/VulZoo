Subject: CleanCache v2.19: False Sense of Security




This is a similar (if not exact) problem that I found with the program Window Washer 5.x by Web Root:

Publisher: ButtUglySoftware
Program Description: CleanCache v.2.19 will clean up your Windows computer, such as IE cache, cookies and temp directories to name a few.

The program description also states:
"Secure file deletion using single, DoD and NSA wiping algorithms"

This statement is simply untrue and fails to properly delete any of the targeted data.

I was easily able to restore %100 of the "wiped" data, after running CleanCache. Files were in fact deleted but using common freeware recovery tools, the "wiped" data was recovered.

Conclusion: This program, in the area of security, does not perform as advertised.

Vendor was contacted, no reply as of yet.
