Subject: Re: Cross-Site Scripting - an industry-wide problem


quite commom, funny because xss can be used in PHISHING attacks.
instead of <alert blah> try some html redirects to a hosted site with a fake
login
spoofing the original content ( a login page ) and capture username/password
then pass them to the real login page.
or better yet... xss dos attacks, like.
[script]
alert("oh no")
;window.close()
[/script]

but i guess xss is just kiddi play... or is it?

m.w
