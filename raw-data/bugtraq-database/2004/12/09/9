Except you can't do this, since the appended data needs to be identical 
between the two files.  That's why I used the encrypted payload -- it 
ties the semantic meaning of the embedded commands to posession of 
vec1's series of bits, which is of course what a cipher is meant to do.

Your payloads differ but the above line is incorrect.  Your actual 
appended files:

$ cat msg1
[terminal garbage]I agree to sell you my horse ^Fita^, its saddle and 
harness for price   1 000 dollars. Signed Bara

$ cat msg2
[slightly different terminal garbage]I agree to sell you my horse 
^Fita^, its saddle and harness for price   1 000 dollars. Signed Bara
