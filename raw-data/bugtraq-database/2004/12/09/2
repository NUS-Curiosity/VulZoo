I was talking about limiting the input, not the output. I assumed it would
be more difficult to find a collision when there are less degrees of freedom
in the input.

What I realised after my mail though, is that it is probably pretty easy to
prebuild a dictionary of all 8 character combinations and their MD5 sums.
