Package description:
  The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and
  related tools, which provides a much higher level of performance than the
  traditional Linux NFS server used by most users.


Problem description:
  SGI developers discovered a remote Denial of Service in the NFS statd
  server where it did not ignore the "SIGPIPE" signal.  This could cause
  the server to shut down if a client terminates prematurely.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-1014 to this issue.

  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
