Subject: WebWorm using PHPBB vulnerability in the wild!

There have been reports of WebWorm exploting PHPBB's urldecode 
vulnerability.
The worm uses this to create a perl script on the server and start it.
After the perl script starts it wipes itself out, then begans to search
via google.com/advanced_search for exploitable viewtopic.php files part from 
the vulnerable PHPBB distributions.
Then the worm replicates itself by using the vulnerability, and also 
overwrites any files on the disk that it has permission to.
Machines running the worm script will have perl process with name 'm1ho2of' 
running.
But this likely will change when the people start to notice it.
The possible solution is to patch or disable the vulnerable PHPBB 
installations.
