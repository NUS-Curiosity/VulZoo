The word "authenticated" already has the meaning of what I think you were 
trying to express with "credentialed"; "authenticated" means that a user 
has already presented credentials of some kind (username, password, PIN, 
key, cert, token, etc.), that those credentials were accepted and that the 
user enjoyed a different level of privilege than mere "anonymous" users.

The term "credentialed" suggests that a user has been issued credentials of 
some kind, but that he/she may or may not have used them to authenticate to 
a restricted resource.  (The term "credentialed" is similar to the word 
"ticketed".)

So...I'd stick with "anonymous" or "authenticated" when describing attacks 
on servers.
