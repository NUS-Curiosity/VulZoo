If you cannot fix it (virtual servers) fast for all your clients you could 
also try with something like this:

         RewriteEngine On
         RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(.*)echr(.*) [OR]
         RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(.*)esystem(.*)
         RewriteRule ^.*$                                -               [F]

We had some vhosts where this worked just fine. On our systems we didnt 
see any valid request with echr and esystem, just be gentle with it, it 
works for me, it could work for you ;)

Bye,
Raymond.
