Good day,

after my bug report in april 2004 Sun fixed an issue with
remote and local object serialisation. If getting
a bad object package your server may become unresponsive and does not
accept further requests but it does not crash. A PoC exploit
showed that with a little lower socket work RMI communication
is affected, too.

In my opinion it is a deep concept bug (antipattern) in JDK serialisation
semantics, but JDK 1.4.2_06 is only a detail fix.
So chances are high that there are more bugs like this in your JDK
or your application, even after an upgrade to JDK 1.4.2_06.

Below is the relevant snippet from:

Happy Xmas and a great 2005 to all
Marc
