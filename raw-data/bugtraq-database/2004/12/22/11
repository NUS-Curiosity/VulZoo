By that logic, *no* exploit can ever be considered local. A truly remote
exploit doesn't rely on manual interaction from a local user on the
system.

When you're trying to argue that your actions were ethical and moral,
pointing out that you could have committed crimes isn't the way to do
it.

No, it's the absolute minimum level of ethical behavior one expects from
serious security researchers. Nothing nice about it.

One day, when you are writing software for distribution, someone will
find an error in your code. When that day comes, remember this attitude.
While those who discover those bugs and exploits in your software have
no obligation to give you advanced warning of your bugs, I'm certain
you'd be grateful to have that warning so you have time to fix the bug
before word goes public.
