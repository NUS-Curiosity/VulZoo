===========================================================================
                           DETAILED INFORMATION


I.  Description
===============

A vulnerability was discovered in the paginit command that allows a local
user to gain root privileges. Exploits for this vulnerability are publicly
available.

The command affected by this issue ships as part of the bos.rte.security
fileset. This fileset is installed as part of the Base Operating System
Installation.


II. Impact
==========
Any local user can exploit this buffer overflow vulnerability to gain root
privileges.


III.  Solutions
===============

A. Official Fix

IBM provides the following fixes:

      APAR number for AIX 5.2.0: IY64522 (available)
      APAR number for AIX 5.3.0: IY64312 (available)


NOTE: Affected customers are urged to upgrade to 5.2.0 or 5.3.0 at the
latest maintenance level. Although a related AIX 5.1 APAR is available,
this issue is not exploitable on AIX 5.1 since the paginit command
is not available on 5.1.

B. Workaround

Setting the file mode bits to 500 will allow only the root user to execute
the paginit command. This can be done by executing the following command 
as
root:

# chmod 500 /usr/bin/paginit

Verify that the file mode bits have been changed to 500:

# ls -la /usr/bin/paginit
- -r-x------  1 root security 7354 2002-09-15 20:39 /usr/bin/paginit
