Multiple Vendor Xine version 0.99.2 PNM Handler PNA_TAG Heap Overflow
Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.21.04
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=176&type=vulnerabilities
December 21, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

Xine is a multimedia player which runs on multiple platforms.
More information is available at:

   http://xinehq.de/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow in version 0.99.2 of xine could

allow execution of arbitrary code.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the PNA_TAG handling code of 
the pnm_get_chunk() function. The function does not check the if the 
length of an input to be stored in a fixed size buffer is larger than 
the buffer size.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code 
with the privileges of the targeted user.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to 
convince the targeted user to open a connection to a malicious PNM 
server with xine, using a pnm://address/ URL. Depending on configuration

options, this may be exploitable simply by clicking on a link, or it may

require the user to launch the application, specifically requesting the 
malicious content.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE Labs has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in xine 
version 0.99.2. It is suspected that earlier versions of xine also 
contain this vulnerability.

This vulnerability also affects MPlayer prior to MPlayer 1.0pre5try2.

V. WORKAROUND
iDEFENSE is currently unaware of any effective workarounds for this 
issue.
