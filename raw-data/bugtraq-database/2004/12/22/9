Subject: Script Injection in Google Groups Beta


Script injection in Google Groups Beta. If a user views a thread
carefully crafted by a malicious user, then the script executes,
instead of the thread.

Concept:
http://groups-beta.google.com/group/n3td3v/browse_thread/thread/2379f18f5986c985

All users are vulnerable.
