And so we have a distinction without meaning.

I could take a machine with no external connectivity beyond a single
keyboard and monitor and by typing in a listing from a piece of paper
use a command to reformat the system and lose all data.  Remote exploit?
By your usage of the term it is.

In your example, a local user MUST take action in order to perform
the exploit, therefore the exploit is local.  Your "FROM THE NETWORK"
is meaningless; it could be sent on floppy or printout or via psychic
rays and get the same result.

And thus years of discussion on this, and other, lists about responsibility
and concern goes out of the window.  But that's a matter between you and
your conscience.  Be happy!
