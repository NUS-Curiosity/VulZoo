Actually, I think this would make for a fascinating course. If I were teaching it, I don't know that I would have insisted on each student finding 10 holes, that does seem too optimistic. Rather, I would think requiring students to document their efforts at attempting to find holes, and assign extra credit for those who actually discover them. That would allow all students an equal chance at a grade, without penalizing those who aren't fortunate enough (as it were) to run across a vulnerability.

This sort of course is well outside what those in academia think of as the normal CS curriculum (see http://www.computer.org/cspress/CATALOG/cs01499.htm). Instead of criticism, I would think that we in the software industry (and especially those of us who also teach CS) should champion inventive (and currently quite relevant) courses such as this. It is hard to convince those who make such decisions to allow such courses, especially in light of insufficient precedence (the bureaucratic inertia of academia rivals that of other government offices).

Arguing over how to classify an exploit seems to be fair game for this list, but you folks often forget just how 'l33t you are. You forget how long it took you to know what you know. College students are probably more over-worked than you are. If I were the instructor of this class, I would probably caution my students on submitting their work to lists like Bugtraq, and if they chose to, to be well aware of the flames that may result. Arguing over full disclosure or whether something is remotely exploitable or not misses the point of the class, near as I can tell.

Happy Holidays to all.
