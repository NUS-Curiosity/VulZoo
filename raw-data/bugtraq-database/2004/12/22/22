What you really have is a local exploit that you can sometimes trick a
person into executing for you.  Not the same thing as a remote
exploit.  You as a remote user have no way of compomising the system
without first penetrating the system in some other way.  Just because
there is a social engineering method to achieve this penetration does
not make this a remote exploit.

I might add that if a person is assembling an untrusted piece of
assembly code, there is a decent chance that he is planning on
executing it.

Yeah, you know, if the choice is between criminal activity and this
kind of announcement, you did ok, but I think we all assume that people
in the security community want to actually protect users from security
problems.  Assuming that this is your goal, I think you can do better.
