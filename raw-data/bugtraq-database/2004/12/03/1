"New"?

There is nothing new about this.  It has been standard MS policy for 
many years now to only support the two most recent "releases" of an OS, 
thus when Gold and SP1 are the only versions, "all versions" are 
supported, but once SP2 ships, the Gold release for that OS drops off 
the supported list.

There is nothing new about this at all.
