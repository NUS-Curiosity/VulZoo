Subject: Re: NetWare Screensaver Authentication Bypass From The Local Console



As we all know security comes in layers. The only way this exploit will
work is if someone is standing at the server's console. In this way
all servers are subject to vulnerability and I have discovered this 
method of hacking servers. Ok, not really. But I can tell you that if I
have access to the server console then I can get access to the box.

This vulnerability is not new, I had to legitimately hack the password
for a couple of my NetWare servers and I did it 3-4 years ago using
this same hack. Preferrably I would rather Novell NOT fix this. It's
a great "just in case" tool.

I think this is a waste of bandwidth.
