Symantec 
                          AntiVirus for Handhelds Corporate Edition
v3.0)


Operating System(s):  
**********************************************************************
********
	- Win32


Notice:
**********************************************************************
********
The full technical details of this vulnerability can be found at:
http://www.secnetops.com under the research section. 


Basic Explanation:
**********************************************************************
********
High Level Description  : LiveUpdate allows local users to become
SYSTEM
What to do              : run LiveUpdate and apply latest patches. 


Proof Of Concept Status:  
**********************************************************************
********
Functional, Contact SNO for details. 


Short Description:
**********************************************************************
********
Symantec Automatic LiveUpdate, a functionality included with many
Symantec 
retail products as well as on Symantec AntiVirus for Handhelds Corp
v3.0, is 
launched by the system scheduler on system startup and then
periodically after 
startup.  Symantec  LiveUpdate can automatically check for available
updates 
to any supported Symantec products installed on the system using a
scheduled 
task call NetDetect.  

Vulnerable versions of the Symantec Automatic LiveUpdate are
initially 
launched at startup and were being assigned Local System privileges. 
During 
the period when an interactive LiveUpdate session is available, and
only during 
this session, a non-privileged user could potentially manipulate
portions of 
the LiveUpdate GUI Internet options configuration functionality to
gain elevated
privilege on the local host.  For example, the non-privileged user
could gain
privileges to search and edit all system files, assume full
permission for directories 
and files on the host, or create new user accounts on the local
system.


Additional Information:
**********************************************************************
********
If exploited effectively this issue would permit a non-privileged
user to gain 
privileged access on the local host. Symantec has produced a list of 
mitigating circumstances that reduce the risk of exploitation in the
Automatic
LiveUpdate feature. 

Symantec Automatic LiveUpdate is only implemented in retail versions
of 
Symantec products with the exception of Symantec AntiVirus for
Handhelds 
Corporate Edition v3.0. This version uses Symantec Automatic
LiveUpdate to 
check for essential updates when connected to the network. 

The system is vulnerable only when the interactive LiveUpdate
capability is 
activated and configured with the option to notify the user when
updates are 
available. Single user systems are not a the same risk factor as
multi-user 
systems in shared environments. Shared computers in university or
office type
environments with restricted or non-privileged user access are at
high risk.


Vendor Status: 
**********************************************************************
********
Symantec was notified of the vulnerability and fixes are available
via 
LiveUpdate. Secure Network Operations thanks Symantec for being
friendly
and approachable during this advisory research and release process.
