Subject: iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.13.04: Adobe Reader 6.0 .ETD File Format String Vulnerability


Adobe Reader 6.0 .ETD File Format String Vulnerability 

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 12.13.04
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=163&type=vulnerabilities
December 14, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Acrobat Reader is a program for viewing Portable Document Format
(PDF) documents. More information is available at the following site:

   http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a format string vulnerability in version 6.0.2 
of Adobe's Reader could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.

The problem specifically exists in the parsing of .etd files used in 
eBook transactions. A .etd file containing a format string in the 
'title' or 'baseurl' fields can cause an invalid memory access:

<title>|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|</title>
<baseurl>|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|</baseurl>

This may allow for the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code 
under the privileges of the local user. Remote exploitation is possible 
by sending a specially crafted e-mail and attaching either the 
maliciously crafted PDF document or a link to it.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed that Adobe Reader version 6.0.2 is vulnerable. 
It is suspected that earlier versions of Adobe Reader 6 are also 
vulnerable. Adobe Acrobat may also be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Deleting the following file will prevent exploitation of this 
vulnerability:

"C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 6.0\Reader\plug_ins\eBook.api"

This will not impact reading .PDF files.

Removing this file prevents Adobe Reader from handling eBooks. When a 
file handled by this plugin is detected, an error dialog box will
appear, offering to take the user to Adobe's website for information.
