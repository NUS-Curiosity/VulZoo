Guest Articles Call for Papers

The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) is seeking contributed

defenses, best practices and lessons learned relevant to the field of web

The importance of web application security has greatly increased in

layer of the network. To properly protect systems from application-level 
attacks, the understanding of today's issues has never been more critical. 
It's imperative the industry work together by sharing first-hand experiences 
to combat the growing number of issues. Your contributed articles will assist 
in the advancement of the field of web application security and the education 
of the issues we all face.

Contributed articles may include industry best practices, technical 
information about current issues, innovative defense techniques, etc. 
NO VENDOR PITCHES OR MARKETING GIMMICKS PLEASE. We are only soliciting 
concrete information from the experts on the front lines of the web application 
security field.
