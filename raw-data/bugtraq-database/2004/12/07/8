Great.

But this means, somebody (from mozilla) checked the urgency and decided,
that it can wait. It would have been nice and a minimal effort to inform
the initial reporter about that.

I do not see Niek claiming to be a security researcher. He stumbled
into something, that might be a security problem and wanted to make sure,
it is treated the right way. He first reported it to bugzilla and after
not getting a response, published the information he gathered.

What should he (or your mother) do, if mozilla is crashing on a
particular web site? Shut up? Learn how to write a buffer overflow
exploit before reporting it?
