Subject: Tool Announcement:  AIRT -- the Advanced Incident Response Tool (linux)

hey all,
	
	I'm proud to announce that the AIRT 0.2 is now available:
	http://159.226.5.93/projects/airt.htm


	AIRT (Advanced incident response tool) is a set of incident response assistant tools on linux platform. It's useful when you want to know what evil kernel backdoor is resident on your broken system and what it is. It consists of 5 tools now:

mod_hunter: looks for hidden module on the suspect system.

process_hunter: looks for hidden process from kernel on the suspect system.

sock_hunter: looks for hidden port from kernel on the suspect system.

modumper: dumps the hidden module into file.

dismod: trys to analyze the dumped module.


Note: it only supports 2.6 kernel now, will support 2.4 kernel later.

We will be very happy to get any suggestion and bug report ;-P
