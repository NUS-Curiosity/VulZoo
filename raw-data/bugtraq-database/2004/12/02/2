Subject: Official IFRAME patch - make sure it installs correctly


The IFRAME vulnerability has been patched, see http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-040.mspx

*** Make sure you are patched after installing ***
I installed it using "Automatic Updates" (on Win2ksp4), rebooted and loaded my InternetExploiter.html: IT STILL WORKED!!
Even though both "Automatic Updates" and "http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com" reported that I was patched!?!
I manually downloaded the exe and ran it, rebooted and now I'm finally truely patched.

It might just have been a glitch on my system, but you might wanna check anyway: InternetExploiter.html can still be downloaded from my website.
