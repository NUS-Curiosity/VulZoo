David Harris, author of both Merucry Mail server and Pegasus Mail has aknowledge 
the problem this morning on the Mercury Mailing list. He announced that he was 
working on a fix which should be available by tomorrow (Thusday Dec 2) evening 
(take the timing as you wish, David is in NZ)

Reed, there are words of being able to run an application on the Mercury machine. 
Can you confirm that? If so, please be sure to advise David Harris.
