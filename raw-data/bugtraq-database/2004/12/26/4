My friend Suzi from http://spywarewarrior.com who runs Wordpress found 
this:

http://wordpress.org/support/7/19285

Within five minutes I've logged over 600 attempts on my server.

For those using mod_security, I'm implemented a nice 406 in the meantime, 
it is Christmas after all, I'm sure we want to elsewhere:

[code]
SecFilter "visualcoders\.net/spy\.gif\?\&cmd"
SecFilter ":/"
[/code]

Just in case the URL changes, the latter should still get all sorts of:

http://
ftp://

Naturally, the latter also filters on 

%3a%2f
