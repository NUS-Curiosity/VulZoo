Subject: Windows Explorer TGA Crash

I've found a TGA file that crashes Windows Explorer when Explorer tries 
to generate a preview for it. I'm not expert in this area, so I don't 
know if this could be used as a way to run arbitrary code. However I've 
attached the broken TGA, in zip format, in hopes that someone else can 
figure out what this does.
