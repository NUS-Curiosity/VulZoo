You are right, that this is very low risk.

Obviously it is not. I don't think it is even locally exploitable.

The difference between nasm executing arbitrary code and a shell script
causing a shell to execute "rm -rf $HOME/*" is that the first IS NOT
meant to do that, and the second IS meant to do that. So let's not
compare those two.

Actually while the bug in nasm is very low risk, it is such bugs that
make it difficult to build new software using other software as building
blocks - you would need to audit and fix nasm before you could use it in
an web-to-assembler-gateway :-)
