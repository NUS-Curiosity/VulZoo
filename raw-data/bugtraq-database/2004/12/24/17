Subject: IBM DB2 rec2xml buffer overflow vulnerability (#NISR2122004J)


NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: IBM DB2 rec2xml buffer overflow
Systems Affected: DB2 8.1/7.x	
Severity: High risk
Vendor URL: http://www.ibm.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ mark at ngssoftware.com ]
Relates to: http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/db2-01.txt
Date of Public Advisory: 23rd December 2004
Advisory number: #NISR2122004J
Advisory URL: http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/db223122004K.txt

Description
***********
IBM's DB2 database server contains a function, rec2xml, used to format a
string in XML. This function suffers from a stack based buffer overflow
vulnerability.

Details
*******
By passing an overly long 3rd parameter to the rec2xml function a stack
based buffer can be overflowed, overwriting the saved return address on the
stack. This allows an attacker to control the flow of execution and the
opportunity to execute arbitrary code.

Fix Information
***************
IBM has written a patch and can be obtained with the latest fixpak.

NGSSQuirreL for DB2 (http://www.nextgenss.com/db2.htm) can be used to assess
whether your DB2 server is vulnerable to this.
