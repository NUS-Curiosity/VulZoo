HPSBTU01077     REVISION: 0

SSRT4696 rev.0 - HP Tru64 UNIX TCP Stack
                 Remote Denial of Service (DoS)

NOTICE:
There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
provided that it remains complete and intact.

The information in this Security bulletin should be acted upon
as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:
22 December 2004

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:
Remote Denial of Service (DoS)

SOURCE:
HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:
NISCC Advisory 236929, CVE CAN-2004-0230

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
    A potential security vulnerability has been identified in the
    Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on HP Tru64 UNIX systems.
    The potential vulnerability could be remotely exploitable,
    resulting in denial of service (DoS).

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
        HP Tru64 UNIX  V5.1B PK4
        HP Tru64 UNIX  V5.1B PK3
        HP Tru64 UNIX  V5.1A PK6
        HP Tru64 UNIX  V4.0G PK4
        HP Tru64 UNIX  V4.0F PK8

BACKGROUND:
  Special Instructions:

  The industry standard TCP specification (RFC793) has a
  vulnerability whereby established TCP connections can be
  reset by an attacker.

  TCP sessions, including Telnet, SSH, SFTP and HTTP may be
  disconnected without warning. TCP sessions that have been
  disconnected can be re-established.

  HP Tru64 UNIX has addressed this potential vulnerability, called
  a TCP reset attack, by providing a new kernel tunable variable,
  tcp_rst_win (TCP reset window).

  The tcp_rst_win variable mitigates the TCP reset attack by
  reducing the window size in which a TCP reset packet will be
  accepted by the Tru64 system.

  Set the tunable as follows:

  tcp_rst_win = -1 (default)

    Retains existing TCP behavior.

  tcp_rst_win = 2048

  Provides a level of protection which will significantly reduce
  the size of the TCP reset window while allowing for common TCP
  client/server sequence number variations. This will allow a
  reset packet to be accepted by the Tru64 system when the remote
  machine has unacknowledged outstanding packets of up to a total
  of 2048 bytes.


  tcp_rst_win = 0

   Provides maximum security against the potential DoS condition.

   Setting tcp_rst_win to "0" provides the highest level of
   protection without migrating to an IPSec environment. This
   setting restricts the acceptance of a reset packet to the
   current sequence number and may result in the rejection of
   valid reset packets where sent data packets have not been
   acknowledged.

   Customers who are extremely sensitive to this security threat
   should implement IPSec, available in HP Tru64 UNIX 5.1A and
   5.1B. Tru64 UNIX V4.0F and V4.0G can receive maximum available
   protection with tcp_rst_win to "0".


  The TCP reset window variable (tcp_rst_win) may be adjusted
  using the "sysconfig" and "sysconfigdb" commands:

  # sysconfig -q inet tcp_rst_win
  inet:
  tcp_rst_win = -1

  # sysconfig -r inet tcp_rst_win=2048
  tcp_rst_win: reconfigured

  # sysconfig -q inet tcp_rst_win
  inet:
  tcp_rst_win = 2048

  # sysconfig -q inet tcp_rst_win > /tmp/tcp_rst_win_merge

  # sysconfigdb -m -f /tmp/tcp_rst_win_merge inet

  # sysconfigdb -l inet

  inet:
        tcp_rst_win = 2048

    The fixes contained in the ERP kits are scheduled to be
    available in the following mainstream patch kits:

    HP Tru64 UNIX V5.1B PK 5
    HP Tru64 UNIX V5.1A PK 7

RESOLUTION:
    Until the corrections are available in  mainstream release
    patch kits, HP is releasing the following Early Release Patch
   (ERP) kits publicly for use by any customer.

    The ERP kits use dupatch to install and will not install over
    any installed Customer Specific Patches (CSPs) that have file
    intersections with the ERPs.  Contact your service provider
    for assistance if the installation of the ERPs is blocked by
    any of your installed CSPs.
