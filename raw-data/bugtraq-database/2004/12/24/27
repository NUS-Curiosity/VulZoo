You are right, it is circumstantial evidence. But it is mighty strong 
circumstantial evidence. Brown et al only study three vulnerabilities, 
but it is not an uncommon result. Reportedly a primary reason that 
Microsoft switched to monthly disclosures is that they were seeing a 
bloom of malware attacks following every single disclosure, and they 
wanted to batch them up to get control of those blooms.

That you can find instances of something other than full disclosure 
causing a bloom of attacks does not invalidate the inference that full 
and *abrupt* disclosure can cause a bloom of attacks. It just means that 
full disclosure is not the *only* cause of a bloom. The above logic is 
obviously faulty, even if it does include Latin words :)

However, if I may offer a different criticism of my own claim, there is 
a question of the evidence of positive benefits of responsible 
disclosure. Rescola presents data 
http://www.usenix.org/events/sec03/tech/rescorla.html that even with a 
well-timed responsible disclosure of a major vulnerability (OpenSSL 
chunking bug) many many people just never bothered to patch. However, 
this study concerns only a single vulnerability, and it is possible that 
OpenSSL was not widely patched because it is reputed to be a difficult 
upgrade to perform correctly.

Forcible disclosure with a time like as specified in the RFPolicy 
http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html would seem to have nearly 
identical long-term effects with much less damaging short-term effects. 
Is it your contention that a "patch up or else" disclosure policy like 
the RFPolicy does *not* cause programmers to clean up their act? Can you 
justify how abrupt disclosure encourages any better behavior than timed 
disclosure at the discretion of the bug-finder?

But I *do not* think that hiding security information keeps us safe. 
Rather, I think that disclosing vulnerability information has impact on 
attackers and defenders, and the *timing* of that disclosure, especially 
with respect to the availability of a patch, has critical impact on who 
it impacts and how much.
