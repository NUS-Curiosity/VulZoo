As this is FD, I feel like answering.

I'm your brother's cousin's uncle's ex-room mate. (I hope I got the

I have had few communications with you in the past, but unlike other 
people who can ignore, decline or laugh, you get all "my p?n*s* is 
bigger" and act plain rude. What if I told you I have a dog? Can you 
bark louder?

Besides, FD is open for any discussion or anything else. Like you can 
send your flames, I can send whatever I want. I usually refrain from 
doing it unless I see something on-topic which I feel is important, but 
hey... Who am I to dare tell you that you act like an asshole baby who 
didn't get his milk for lunch?

I appreciate any hard work, and I appreciate Jelmer's work which I 
commented on. I also said that most of his post is about his hate 
towards Thor Larholm (which he admits to). That is not professional.
I did ask for clarifications on the 0-day.

But hey, you know what? You know best.

He said he did.

Can I have some chocolate too?
