Well, there are a LOT of crummy A/V approaches out there, and I've received 
more than one bounce based on something flagging a message as a virus 
because there's some keyphrase in it.  In fact, this is why most of the A/V 
notification lists ceased providing descriptions of viruses and instead 
just provide a link to their website where you can get detail -- because 
far too many cheezeball "virus" solutions triggered off of simple keyword 
phrases.

The same folks who write the overzealous spam filtering generally break a 
number of RFCs anyway.  Sending their notifications replies to the From: 
address instead of the envelope sender for instance.  Or rejecting messages 
from a contact which has regularly correspondend with their user.  Sending 
messages forged to be FROM the intended recipient (or, in some cases, 
forged to be from the original message author).

Well, you're causing the sending/relaying host to generate the DSN.  Quite 
possibly back to some sod who has been joe-jobbed.

On the surface, SPF seems really nifty, but it poses a significant 
implementation issue for listserves and forwarding services alike.

You're back to the problem that the Anti-Spam solutions are often 
implemented post-SMTP, so those using them have the option of either 
ditching the message or generating an (often undesired) DSN.  The anti-spam 
and virus solutions which are integrated at the SMTP level pose DOS issues 
for the mailhost because the message MUST be identified as spam or not spam 
right then and there.
