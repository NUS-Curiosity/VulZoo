|| You and your friend provide nothing. Never have.
|| Never will. You and he ought remain in the peanut
|| gallery and let doer's do. Sit back keep your
|| mouth shut and learn from people who do.

provide what to who? all you are doing yourself is providing exploits
that any 12 year old kiddie can use and making html pages that help phishers
defraud innocent people.

do what? all you are doing is helping the bad guys and increasing my
insecurity.

you are like a burglar complaining about the handcuff company helping
out cops.

|| You should be on your knees thanking Jelmer for
|| explaining it, no one else can and no one else
|| has. Because its not so easy.

what are you talking about? the only reason jelner is even looking at
these vulnerabilities are because rafel ivgi posted about them on NtBugtraQ
and even said they were affecting patched users.

why cant you just step forward and show your true colors? you are not
trying to be security researchers, you are just having fun finding vulnerabilities
and pissing on everybody else. no shame in that, just admit it. its fun
to exploit people and kick microsoft in the crotch but it has nothing
to do with helping anyone.
