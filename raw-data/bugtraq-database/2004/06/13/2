Package:             apache
Vulnerability:       denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= apache-1.3.31-20040608   >= apache-1.3.31-20040611
OpenPKG 2.0          <= apache-1.3.29-2.0.2      >= apache-1.3.29-2.0.3
OpenPKG 1.3          <= apache-1.3.28-1.3.4      >= apache-1.3.28-1.3.5

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a security advisory from Georgi Guninski [0] there
  is a buffer overflow in Apache's [1] mod_proxy module. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0492 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  apache". If you have the "apache" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) [3][4].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get apache-1.3.29-2.0.3.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig apache-1.3.29-2.0.3.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild apache-1.3.29-2.0.3.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/apache-1.3.29-2.0.3.*.rpm
