These are the recent findings, Please participate in
the discussion.

* KAV successfully passes the test! [Confirmed]

Well I find, both norton antivirus 2002 & norton  2003
first try to extract the zip file..... [note: each ~.*
is a compressed 12 GB file] fo it will [.....you
guessed it..... DoS] Norton Antivirustakes
considerable amount of time to scan .cab files.

I tried.......
http://www.ravantivirus.com/scan/indexn.php
It took for ever.... [I stopped or i might have
crassed the server]

I've tried to scan those .bz2 files with Mcafee, it
does choak for a while but it went through.

If you have Autometically 'quarentine/delete' option
set for your AV scanner and it detects a virus "ercata
test virus" inside the rar file. The AV will suffer a
DoS while extracting the .rar files.

-> Has any one tried it for trojan/spyware scanners
that scan inside compressed files???

 
-----------------------------
* Winxp default zip manager just report the 12Gb zip
file to be 121 Mb!???
* Winrar [3.20] can show the size of .bz2 files and
winrar just report bipin.zip is 128 Mb but it start
filling up the hdd. to 12 Gb if you try to extract the
file.
*If we try to extract the 12 Gb [Standalone] file in
Fat32 tries to extract the 12 Gb file and terminate
extraction after 4Gb [fat32 limit] I wounder, why in
the 1'st place would Winrar allow to extract a 4+ Gb
[single] file in Fat 32.
