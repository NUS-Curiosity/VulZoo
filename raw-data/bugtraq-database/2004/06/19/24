I haven't been able to get it to work on Win2K or XP,
and the OP doesn't seem to have specified the
manufacturer and model of the device used.

"Should" work?  

The OP also mentions using a Reg file to modify the
NoDriveTypeAutorun Registry key, which by default, is
already configured (0x095, or 149) to NOT allow this
type of thing to work.

Unfortunately, that's not really the case.  A lot of
things are said and claims are made...but not a lot of
questions are answered.
