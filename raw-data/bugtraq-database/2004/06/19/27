Note *very* carefully the fact that the statement "you can't load a LKM" is not
totally identical to "you can't cause an LKM to be in the kernel".

Hunt down the Phrack article on loading an LKM into a Linux kernel *that
doesn't even have module support*, and ask yourself if you're quite as sure
that there is *zero* vulnerability there....
