Just wondering if anyone else has seen this come through their mail portal.
Something has caused our McAfee Webshield SMTP to seriously eat processor
time... to the point that it will no longer forward scanned mail.  I've had
to temporarily bypass it until I figure out what it's choking on.  I saw
several other posts that said this sent processors into some kind of loop
and this is exactly what appears to be happening with our portal.
