Subject: RE: Is predictable spam filtering a vulnerability?


I think spam filters arn't the solution to the spam problem. If someone gets 
200 spam emails aday then what use is a spam filter telling them the email 
was rejected? The user will end up not looking at the list of rejected 
emails because it's sooo big.

Filtering certain works is also bad aswell eg "penis", "viagra".
It can easyly be evoided:
Email "Free penis enlargement pills" - Would be filterd
Email "Free pen is enlargement pills" - Wouldn't be filtered

So in order to be effective it has to look for variations on the works
For example "penis" it could look for "P E N I S", "peni$" etc...

This is when the problems start. I get sent 200 spam emails the rejected 
emails log is huge, i can't be bothed to look through it, it'll take tooo 
long, but it has removed an important email.

Email "Dear Andiroo, I have found your pen, it was under my desk. You PEN IS 
now in the top draw of your desk".

Ok i lost my sepcial pen, my friend has found it but look "PEN IS" is like 
"PENIS" so it's been taken by the spam filter.

My solution for spam:
I think there should be a huge database on spam emails, just like an anti 
virus scanner but for spam. I think it is that simple have an anti-virus but 
for spam, i am sure that if i get a spam email someone else will have 
exactly the same email so if i can submit it to the database and it's added 
to it quickly so everyone can get the updates then there would be no 
problem, but there is soooo much spam out there we would for ever have to 
update or ever growing in size databases.

I think this would eliminate alot of spam, I have ran out of ideas for 
preventing spam emails, so what other effective solutions already out there?
