If I recall, it is possible to disable the offending "bonus" data track by
writing over it with a black marker.  This is all in theory, of course.

Well I truly regret actually purchasing a copy of the new Beastie Boys album
to support them.

It seems that Capitol Records has some sort of new copy protection system,
that automatically, silently, installs "helpful" copy protection software on

MacOS and Windows as soon as you insert the CD into default systems.
I'm not sure exactly what it does yet, but I am sure regreting actually
purchasing said media now... they don't deserve my money if they choose
to pull stupid stunts like this. Installing software without your permission
sounds like viral malware behaviour to me. I certainly hope the AV companies
put signatures into their products for this crap.

They include some sort of uninstaller buried on there for Windows, but 
I see no such thing for MacOS. If anyone has disassembled the
aforementioned malware already and can save us some time with 
instructions on how to remove it... thanks in advance.

caveat emptor,
