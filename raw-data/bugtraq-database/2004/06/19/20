Subject: USB risks - working autorun example (fwd from pen-test)

Okay, just to put this point at ease, autorun.inf usage on USB drives is 
possible. My concerns are of a different type, a BOF or a backdoor in an 
SDK. Even simple usage of USB for different operational criminal needs...
Still, if the simplest solution (autorun) works (and it does...)... why 
over-complicate like we in the security field tend to do?

Attached is a proof-of-concept as made available by mak_pen@...mail.com 
for using autorun with USB.

This should work. As it was already released, I see nothing wrong with 
relaying it again (with due credit) here.

I'd strongly suggest to people to read the (different) threads on the 
subject on the pen-test list, a lot of questions were answered there.
