I use no host header and munged ones all the time, using custom
clients and servers for testing. No one has a problem with this,
not Apache, nor IIS, anyway. (I won't get on the subject of RFC
compliancy except to say it is something quite often ignored...)

I believe the bitlance solution this morning is correct. It is a magic
dns
issue. "whatevercraphere.com.yourmagicdnssite.com" being allowed
is the problem.

Very amusing situation in an academic kind of way...
