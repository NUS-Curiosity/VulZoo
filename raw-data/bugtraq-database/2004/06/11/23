OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project

OpenPKG-SA-2004.028                                          11-Jun-2004

Package:             subversion
Vulnerability:       denial of service, arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:           Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= subversion-1.0.4-20040522 >= subversion-1.0.5-20040611
OpenPKG 2.0          <= subversion-1.0.0-2.0.2    >= subversion-1.0.0-2.0.3
OpenPKG 1.3          N.A.                         N.A.

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Subversion [1] versions up to and including 1.0.4 have a potential
  Denial of Service and Heap Overflow issue related to the parsing of
  strings in the 'svn://' family of access protocols. This affects only
  sites running svnserve. It does not affect 'http://' access. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2004-0413 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  subversion". If you have the "subversion" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [3][4].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [6] or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [7], build a corresponding binary RPM from it
  [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM
  [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get subversion-1.0.0-2.0.3.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig subversion-1.0.0-2.0.3.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild subversion-1.0.0-2.0.3.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/subversion-1.0.0-2.0.3.*.rpm
