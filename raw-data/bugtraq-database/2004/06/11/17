By crafting a malformed .RA, .RM, .RV or .RMJ file it possible to cause heap
corruption that can lead to execution of arbitrary code.  By forcing a
browser or enticing a user to a website containing such a file, arbitrary
attacker supplied code could be executed on the target machine. This code
will run in the security context of the logged on user. Another attacker
vector is via an e-mail attachment. NGSResearchers have created reliable
exploits to take advantage of these issues. Due to the ease of exploitation
these vulnerabilities should be considered as high risk and customers are
urged to update their players as soon as is possible.
