Would you go to your mechanic and say "Fix my car, it's broken", or would
you give them more info?

Step 1)  Please tell us what the exact error you got when importing, and
what source/keyserver/etc you were using to import.

Step 2) We'll look at that info and then see if we can get you pointed in
the right direction....
