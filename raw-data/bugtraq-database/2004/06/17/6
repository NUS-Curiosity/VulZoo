while doing security reviews for a client i found code originating from
http://webauction.de.vu (v2_1) to be severely lacking. e.g. several parts
(del,del_views) allow deletion of items regardless of userid.
the software seems to be unmaintained by now (no response/updates) but being 
made aware of other people using their code it's probably better for this to be
public.
