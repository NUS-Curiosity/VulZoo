This isn't a DoS as such. The problem occurs because the 4.1.60 scan
engine for McAfee products isn't compatible with the 4367 DATs. In order
to use these DATs you have to update your scan engine, which probably
requires disabling WebShield and running the SuperDAT updater--this is
what I had to do with our Exchange server (running GroupShield)
yesterday morning!
