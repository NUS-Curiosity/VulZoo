Hello All,

Norton CE found five instances of the Eicar_test_file in roughly 8
seconds.  It quarantined the .zip file.





Hello,

Here is what I have from TrendMicro IWSS v1

A virus (Compressed_Huge_File, Eicar_test_file, Eicar_test_file,
Eicar_test_file, Eicar_test_file, Eicar_test_file, Eicar_test_file) was
detected in file SERVER_dwn.zip in http traffic on 6/15/04 3:10:06 PM
with action deleted taken.

CPU on the server was between 80% and 90% for about
1.5 hours.
