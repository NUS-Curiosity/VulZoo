I'm afraid I'm not currently able to use any such time travel technology
for my Debian work, as there is no free software implementation nor free
documentation of this proprietary technology. If you, GOBBLES, could
provide your avantgardist insights into this topic and contribute any
proof-of-concept time travel codez or sniffer logs you may have under a
free license, that would be wonderful.

.. in the meantime. I have no idea where you got this idea from, as a
simple diff of the Debian source packages would have told you otherwise.
The vulnerability you found in 2002 is a different thing, but see below
for the code, which speaks a much clearer language.

(the diff is untested)

super (3.23.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version:
    + fixed format string vulnerability (CAN-2004-0579) 
      found by Max Vozeler <max@...terhof.net>.
  * Added debian/watch file.
