ZoneAlarm Pro 'Mobile Code' Bypass Vulnerability

http://www.kurczaba.com/securityadvisories/0406214.htm
-------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerability ID Number:
0406214

Overview:
A vulnerability has been found in the 'Mobile Code' filter in ZoneAlarm Pro

Vendor:
ZoneLabs (http://www.zonelabs.com)

Affected Systems/Configuration:
This test was done on a Windows XP Professional machine, running ZoneAlarm Pro 5.0.590.015. The Internet Explorer version is 6, with all patches.

Vulnerability/Exploit:
The new version of ZoneAlarm Pro features "Mobile Code" blocking, which blocks potentially dangerous web objects such as ActiveX, Java Applets, and certain MIME objects. The filter blocks out any "application/*" MIME type. The "Mobile Code" filter integrates with Internet Explorer.

Unfortunately, the "Mobile Code" filter does not filter SSL content. A malicious person could lure a ZoneAlarm Pro user to a malicious SSL site with dangerous "Mobile Code" content; and ZoneAlarm Pro would not filter the "Mobile Code".

Workaround:
None so far.

Date Discovered:
June 21, 2004

Severity:
Medium
