Assume a spam filter that's 99.8% accurate.  This is probably a *high*
estimate - we're talking only 2 errors per every thousand mails...

Assume several million messages a day (which is *not* a very large load
by today's standards - we're merely a large university, and even *after*
subtracting spam and virus mail, we're in that range)...

Calculate how many mails get dropped into oblivion each day.

I suspect that you and I have differing definitions of "*perfectly* safe".....
