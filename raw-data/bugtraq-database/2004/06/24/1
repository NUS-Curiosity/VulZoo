Subject: Solution for bugtraq id 10570 (Epic Games Unreal Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability)


Hi everyone,

I have created a simple UnrealScript patch for this vulnerability in Unreal
Tournament v436 and v451(b). As far as I know it does not negatively affect
the functioning of the "\secure\" query or anything else, but it has not
been extensively tested.

You can download the patch at http://www.gdries.com/IpServer.u .

I will attempt to create a UT2003 version of the patch as well if Epic/Atari
doesn't provide one in a few days. 

Regards,
Gerco Dries.
