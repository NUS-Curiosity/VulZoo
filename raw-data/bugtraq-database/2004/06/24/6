This conviction should be a heads-up for anyone who is considering
similar techniques to distribute their junk email.  Victims of junk
emailers might want to consider what options they have in cases of
stolen identities, hacker breakins, and other such problems.

ENFORCEMENT:  SPAMMER GOES TO JAIL

A New York state man who sent out millions of "spam" e-mails has been 
sentenced to three and a half to seven years in prison.   This according 
to a May 27th news release from that states Attorney General's office 
which said that Howard Carmack, known as the "Buffalo Spammer," received 
the maximum sentence for 14 counts of identity theft and forgery.

A spokesman for New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said that 
Carmack sent out hundreds of millions of bulk e-mail messages.  That he 
flooded inboxes and saddled Internet providers with millions of dollars 
in costs. But it was his use of stolen identities and forged addresses 
that caused action by state prosecutors.  New York has no state laws 
specifically dealing with spam.  Carmack was found guilty of violating 
state forgery and identity-theft laws in April.

Internet provider EarthLink Inc. won a $16.5 million judgment against 
Carmack last year, and EarthLink officials testified in the criminal 
trial as well.  (Published news reports)
