Well, this is an predictable, but interesting quote from IDefense...

[IDefense linked the malicious attacks to a group by a different name
called the hangUP team, also from Russia and also believed to be
responsible for the recent string of Korgo worms, Dunham said.

"These are hackers for hire and they commoditize every piece of
information they capture. This was a very complicated and sophisticated
attack," he said.

Security experts were still trying to determine Friday how IIS servers
were compromised and whether applying the latest patches for IIS and
Internet Explorer would protect users from the attacks.

"My gut feeling is (patching) doesn't protect you," Dunham said. "If I
were a home user, I'd consider using another Web browser, like Mozilla,
until a patch comes out," he said.]  (nwfusion - 06/25/2004)

Well, of course.  By why go back to IE unless someone wrote apps that
only run on IE and what's the point of that.  Might as well write them
in VB.
