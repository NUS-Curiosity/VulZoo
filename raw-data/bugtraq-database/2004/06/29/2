Subject: RE: Microsoft and Security


There are lots of sites written only for IE or clones of IE like 
Opera.  Some large sites are written only for late model IEs.  Many are 
from large companies.  Big business thinks MS is the state of the art and 
the only way to go for business.  You have a choice do it their way or 
don't get the benefits of their web site.  They play to the user who has 
AOL, uses only IE and Outlook with all the defaults on because if MS does 
it it must be right and they really have no interest in changing things or 
knowing about them.  People believe they are protected by big companies 
like MS.  They are fools but then like a friend of mine always says 
"business people are stupid".

They believe that the US government should protect them from hackers and 
spam.  That cannot be done but they don't understand that  and neither do 
the US legislators.
