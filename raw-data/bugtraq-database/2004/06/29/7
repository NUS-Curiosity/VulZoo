Which can leave you with a lonely web-browsing experience.  I recall a
well known security researcher/expert not too long ago in the past
givening up on his stance of avoiding security related sites that relied
upon content that was potentially unsafe.  He soon found there were few
security sites he could actually browse.

There are a number  of applications that are IE centric as well,
applications that often end up in corprate evn's...

Thanks,
