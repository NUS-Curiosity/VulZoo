Subject: Re: Java applet crashing with native assertion


This also crashes Firefox 0.8 with j2re 1.4.2_04 on RH9/x86 with the following:

java_vm: ../../../src/share/native/sun/awt/font/fontmanager/fontobjects/fontObject.cpp:418: const void * fileFontObject::ReadChunk(UInt32, UInt32, void * = 0): Assertion `offset < fFileSize' failed.
INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: Pipe closed during read? State may be corrupt
System error?:: Success

Of course the whole idea is that Java apps will behave the same on all
supported platforms, right? :)
