Um, no.  I work in the banking industry and we are federally regulated and audited for security.  I've never worked in the medical industry but I'd be surprised if their requirements are more stringent than ours.

I've heard this type of comment about using MS products in banking.  It is my understanding (and I am *not* an expert) that if an entity (banking, medical, whatever) reasonably attempts to keep up with security patches, AV updates and the like, that they are compliant with federal requirements.

IANAL, and I don't work with the compliance team, this is just my understanding through casual conversation.
