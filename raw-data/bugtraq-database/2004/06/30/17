 provided that it remains complete and intact.

 The information in this Security bulletin should be acted upon as
 soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:    28 June 2004



POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:    remote unauthorized access

SOURCE:    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
                HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:    None

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
A potential vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX running
ObAM 5.0 with the WebAdmin capability enabled.  This vulnerability
could be exploited remotely to allow unauthorized access.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.11 running ObAM 5.0

BACKGROUND:
The version of the Apache web server delivered with ObAM 5.0 has
potential security vulnerabilities.  The Apache web server is used
to implement the WebAdmin feature, which is disabled by default.
The WebAdmin feature is used by  Service Control Manager 1.0 and
by Partition Manager 1.0.

    AFFECTED VERSIONS

     Note: To determine if a system has an affected version,
           search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
           for an affected fileset.  Then determine if the
           recommended patch or update is installed.


     HP-UX B.11.11
     =============
     OBAM.OBAM-WEB
     action:  disable the OBAM web administration interface

     END AFFECTED VERSIONS

RESOLUTION:
Check the /etc/rc.config.d/webadmin file.   If  the defaul value
("WEBADMIN= 0" ) has been changed,  edit the file to set
"WEBADMIN=0",  and run the following run the following as root to
stop the Apache server if it had been running:

      /usr/obam/server/bin/apachectl stop


The steps above will disable the WebAdmin feature.   Service
Control Manager 1.0  and  Partition Manager 1.0 must then be
executed  locally  and displayed to an X11 server to provide
remote administration.  HP Systems Insight Manager can installed
and used instead of Service Control Manager to provide remote
administration via a web browser.


MANUAL ACTIONS:  Yes - NonUpdate

Disable OBAM web administration interface.
