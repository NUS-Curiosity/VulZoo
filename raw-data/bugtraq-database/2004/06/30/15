Subject: RE: Microsoft technologies. By default, non-HIPAA compliant?


I'm no Microsoft apologist, but let's not go off the deep end.

HIPAA has very few direct requirements.  A lot of what needs to be done
depends on the environment.  For example, if I have a closed environment
with no Internet connections (yes, this happens in some places) and
sufficient controls to protect servers against insiders, then the latest IE
problems are of no concern at all.  So saying that ipso facto you're not
HIPAA compliant if you use Microsoft products is clearly wrong.

A slightly less draconian configuration might have a filtering router that
only allows users to visit particular sites; in that case also, the IE
problems would be of no concern (since the redirect to the Russian and
Estonian sites could be prevented).  Again, this may not be the average
network configuration, but I suspect these are used in places like call
centers to avoid having people off web surfing.  And it's certainly the case
that some libraries limit sites that can be visited, in the (misplaced) aim
of preventing web surfing porno sites.

Some might say that any use of passwords for authentication (as opposed to
something stronger like a SecureID or a biometric) is in violation of the
spirit of HIPAA.  But I'd disagree with them too: it's all about looking at
the total risk environment.

The latest set of attacks demonstrate some pretty bad problems, and
Microsoft deserves a lot of criticism.  But let's not go overboard.
