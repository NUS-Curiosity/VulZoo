The current "bug" should be as follows:

Starting nmap V. 2.54BETA31 ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Interesting ports on xxx.adelphia.net (67.23.xxx.xxx):
(The 1553 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
Port       State       Service
443/tcp    open        https


Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 40 seconds


I logged into it via my web-browser, Opera, which said the router was WRT54G. I went into Admistration -> Remote Configuration. The box for remote configuration was unchecked, however it allowed me to access https over the Internet.

Firmware Version:	v1.42.2

Thanks,
