There are several other firmwares for this product.
I use OpenWRT this is realy great.
I don't know, if the other firmware makes it possible to external event log,
but you could make nfs-mounts so you could write the eventlog on a
network-share.

To the issue:
I tested the original firmware before flashing.
And I also wasn't able to access the webinterface from the wan-port.
I've got hardware revision 2.
