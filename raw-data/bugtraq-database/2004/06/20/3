Typically, when an application is being installed in Mac OS X (assuming 
X?), if it requires system file modification it will require an 
administrative level password to continue. While it is true that I 
haven't purchased said malware, this is the usual case. If this 
'helpful drm software' is being installed AND does modify system files 
w/o requiring administrative level authorization this would smack of an 
exploit against OS X and perhaps should be outed to Apple? Remember the 
media that would break CDROM units that Mac users suffered through in 
recent memory? DRM, while it's the buzzword du jour, should not 
supplant content creators and suppliers due diligence when implementing 
their policies. I am, for one, appalled by the manner in which Capitol 
has reportedly acted in this respect. Thank-you for bringing this to my 
attention.
