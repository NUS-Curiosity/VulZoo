Subject: Re: Is predictable spam filtering a vulnerability?



This is nothing new to spam filtering.  Any dynamic/proactive filter mechanism is subject to the sam shenanigans.

This has been a "feature" of IntrusionPreventionSystems since they came out.  Spoof an attack from an IP you want to be denied, and the IDS updates the ruleset on the firewall (what a IPS really is, an IDS talking to a firewall) and that third party can't get past that perimeter.
