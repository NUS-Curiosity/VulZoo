Sorry, but...if I'm to take anyone and anything on this list seriously, and
I've been on this list for many years now...the LEAST any subscriber could do 
is keep their freaking time constant. There's no excuse for people in our 
profession to be 4 days behind as far as their computer's clock is concerned.

More to the point, having their email come in with a seriously incorrect 
timestamp.

It's called NTP, and I suggest people adhere to it. The rest of the world does.

Thank you.

I am learning that criticism is not nearly as effective as sabotage.
