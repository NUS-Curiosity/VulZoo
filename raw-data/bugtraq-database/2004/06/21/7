SNS Advisory No.73
Usermin Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability

Problem first discovered on: Sun, 11 Apr 2004
Published on: Fri, 11 Jun 2004
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
---------
  The web mail functionality of Usermin is prone to a cross-site
  scripting vulnerability. 


Problem Description:
--------------------
  Usermin is a web interface that allows all users on a Unix system to 
  easily receive mails and to perform SSH and mail forwarding configuration.

  A cross-site scripting vulnerability may occur because the web mail
  module used by Usermin doesn't sanitize scripts embedded in received
  emails. Attackers will be able to steal web cookies and gain unauthorized
  access to the Usermin system.


Tested Versions:
----------------
  Usermin Version 1.070


Solution:
---------
  This problem can be eliminated by upgrading to Usermin version 1.080, 
  which is available at:
