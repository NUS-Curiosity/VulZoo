These files are similar to those that I found when posting a message to Bugtraq regarding unpatched MSIE vulnerabilities. I doubt that Ad-Aware itself is creating these files. They are probably being pulled or scanned from a Temporary Internet Files folder. That's where I found mine after testing out a malicious site. The site installed spyware and these handful of temporary files you refer to were left in the Temporary Internet Files folder.
