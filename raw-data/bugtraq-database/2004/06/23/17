Please check McAfees site if you are running an outdated engine,

The 4.1.60 Engine is Out of Date and No Longer Supported
The notice below addresses two separate issues tracked and brought to
resolution by McAfee AVERT and Support as they pertain to the 4.1.60 and
4.3.20 Engines
Scenario 1
The 4.1.60 Engine was officially EOL (End of Life) at the end of August 2003
and is no longer supported. With the release of the 4367 DATs, on Wednesday
June 16, 2004, customers began to notify AVERT and Network Associates
Support of machines failing to initialize after installing or updating to
the 4367/4.1.60 configuration. The two components are not compatible and the
4.1.60 engine needs to be removed and an update needs to take place to the
4.3.20 engine.

This has been documented and you can get more information by reading our
Primus Articles listed below.

We had this same problem with the DAT 4367. Returning to
DAT 4366 it worked again.
