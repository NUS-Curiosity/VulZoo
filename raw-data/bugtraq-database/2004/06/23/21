It's not all that hard to make a better filter with regex. The following would 
catch everything you suggested.

'p.?[eé].?n.?[|ííiil1].?[s$]'

It would also catch p.e.n.i.s and p e-ni-s, etc.

Yes, it's possible that it would stop "Your pen is in your top drawer". I 
whitelist the people I know. They never see the filter.

After administering a bunch of Mailman lists, I had to automate or spend hours 
thumbing through the reject list. Now, I can automatically kill 95+% of the 
messages on hold that are spam and look through what's left. List members 
never see the filter as long as they post in plain text. (I hold for mime 
headers, too)
