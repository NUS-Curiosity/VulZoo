Not only do I not have this cache folder in my installation of (the latest)
Ad-Aware, I'm not able to recreate the described activity.  Furthermore, a quick
Google on the IP address in the script source turns up a number of hits on an IE
exploit with some relevant information, including a couple of links back to this
very list where it was discussed a few weeks ago.  I'd say your box has been
compromised by something other than Ad-Aware.
