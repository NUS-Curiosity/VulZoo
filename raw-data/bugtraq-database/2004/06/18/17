Subject: Re: Unprivilegued settings for FreeBSD kernel variables


Please have a look at my post in response to the original message, as there
is some misunderstanding here.

If an attacker compromises a machine running at security level 3, then they
cannot lower the securelevel sysctl. The "technique" used in the original
post involved loading an arbitrary kernel module while the system was still
running at security level -1, which basically introduced a backdoor into
the kernel that would allow an attacker to lower it afterwards.

As DES explains, the attacker would require unrestricted access (at
security level < 1) in order to implement this "attack". It's not a
vulnerability.
