Yes, IPB trusts that header more than it should.  It's not so much a bug
but rather an extremely poor design decision.  One one hand it means
that *some* cases of someone using a proxy will be revealed, but on the
other hand it means that anyone with the appropriate knowledge can stick
anything in that field, rendering the logs completely worthless and
untrustable.  For example:

wget --header="X-Forwarded-For: 0.0.0.0"
http://example.com/board/index.php

The end user can insert any IP address he wishes into the IPB logs for
all of his actions, and IPB dutifully records it.  People seem to forget
that all HTTP headers are user-supplied data.
