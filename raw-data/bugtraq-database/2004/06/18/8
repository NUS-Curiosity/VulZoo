Package description:
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.

Problem description:
  During checks of the Linux 2.6 source using an automated tool called sparse,
  several issues were discovered.  Some of these were discovered to also
  apply to the 2.4 series of the Linux kernel.  See CAN-2004-0495 at 
  http://cve.mitre.org/ for more information on this issue.

  The patches used were provided by Alexander Viro and fix issues in the
  following drivers: aironet, asus_acpi, decnet, mpu401, msnd, and pss.
