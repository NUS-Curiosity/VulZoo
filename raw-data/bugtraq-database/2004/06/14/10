Upgraded to WRT54G 2.02.8, it solves the problem. I updated the firmware remotely through the "security problem". After the firmware completed, I was disconnected. I nmap'd the router and everything looks great. Linksys' site is poor on navigation. I thought firmware would be under Support, or technical support, but isn't. I had to go to the Products section, picked the WRT54G out and firmware was on the right hand side.
