This could be induced by a bad grounding of the main console.  It happened to me
a few times when I've touched on of the panels.  You get a slight jolt and then
a few error messages when the hard drive unit is activated.  This is slightly
annoying but doesn't lead to a real security problem for the PDP-11. 
In my case Apache crashes, but I didn't find any proofs of any files tempered
with.
