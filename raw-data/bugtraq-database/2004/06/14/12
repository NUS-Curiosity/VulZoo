Subject: RE: Linksys WRT54G - Advice for european users


The readme on the v2.07 US firmware (for v2 hardware) carries no such
warning...  Apparently they pay more attention to things like this in
Europe!  :)

Actually, since my initial problems a few months back - just last week in
fact - they released another version of 2.07 for the v1.1 hardware...  The
readme in _that_ zip file mentions that you must be running 1.09.1 on v1.0 /
v1.1 hardware or the install won't work.  But, if you get the other 2.07
firmware - the one that has been available for some time now - all you get
is the claim that it supports all versions of the WAP54G hardware, and no
other warnings:

Version 2.07, April 28, 2004
- Adds Linksys Wireless Guard support
Note:WPA does not work in Wireless Bridge/Repeater mode in this release

Version 2.06, December 16, 2003 (ver.2 initial release)
- Updated User Interface format and layout
- Updated wireless driver to support all versions of WAP54G hardware
- Adds AP Client Mode
- Adds Wireless Repeater Mode for WAP54G and WRT54G (requires fw 2.02.2 or
above)
Note:WPA does not work in Wireless Bridge/Repeater mode in this release

But thank you to everyone who pointed out this document -

definitely was information that helped...

upgrading the firmware to 1.09.1 prior to upgrade, you may damage the Access
