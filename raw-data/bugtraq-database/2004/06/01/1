This is an administration issue rather than a security vulnerability.
In order to use this attack the attacker requires access to:

1.  Another site on the victim's server
2.  A sufficiently poorly administered server on which (s)he can:
    a.  Create a symlink 
    or
    b.  Specify an absolute path for includes

Those hosting multiple PHP sites ought to be using PHP's open_basedir
directive to limit the files that can be opened by PHP.  If this isn't
being used they are plenty of other easy attacks open to anyone with an
account on the same server.
