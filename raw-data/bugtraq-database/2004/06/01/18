The latest Stable is itself quite old. Debian does not release very
often. But security bugs are fixed when they become known. I have not
found any bug report concerning XSS in the Debian bugs database. Please
be so kind and file bugs if you are running Debian. If not, please mail
the Debian Security Team as described in
  http://www.de.debian.org/security/faq#contact

Thank you,
