Perhaps that'd be a better argument, if there weren't countless patches
from MS in the past that broke other things..
(http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/OF6CB1254D.22B27464-ON85256E89.004FB
436-85256E89.0050E58D@...a.com/2004-06-25/2004-07-01/0 for example).

And I'd also be more likely to believe that if there weren't MS patches out
there that fix one particular bug, but completely ignore other ones that are
nearly IDENTICAL to it.
