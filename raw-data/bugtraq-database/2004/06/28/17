Subject: Scob infection statistics, etc..


If anyone is interested we have some information on the Scob Trojan
"released" last week.

* we saw customers visiting the Russian URL's starting June 22. All the
sites are down but here is a list of the sites visited with frequency
counters.

* as of Sunday we have identified more than 130 unique domains that are
still infected.
* all sites infected are running IIS 5.0 and SSL 
* all sites are infected on both HTTP and HTTPS URL's
* sites IP addresses are located in USA (mostly web hosting ISP's),
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Spain, UK, and Norway). At least
that is what arin, apnic, and ripe are reporting.
* appears as though no sites certificates have been tampered
* none of the sites still infected would be consider "top rated"
websites
* we have seen no unusual/increase in traffic in any of our honeypots

Due to the number of sites infected, this leads me to believe that there
is either a poorly written worm or that the source of the webserver
exploit is out there. Does anyone have information on the exploit ? It
would be interesting to see and then report on the number of webservers
that are vulnerable to this type of attack. Also, has anyone seen any
new versions yet ?

Thanks
