Subject: Linksys WRT54G - Advice for european users


As a follow-up to the WRT54G issue...

For those of you who are looking for european firmware updates for the 
WRT54G, a word of warning might be in order:

The european firmware download pages on Linksys' homepage lists three 
separate downloads for the v1, v1.1 and v2 hardware revisions. The 
firmware downloads linked to by the v1 and v1.1 links are NOT up to date!

According to Linksys support, the v2 firmware is what you want, 
regardless of what hardware revision you have. Very confusing, but 
obviously there used to be separate images for the different hardware 
revisions, but now, a single image supports all three revisions, and the 
v1 and v1.1 links were never updated to reflect this fact.

I have only checked the european sites, but other "international" sites 
possibly have the same problem. The U.S. site is OK, though, but doesn't 
have the european version of the firmware.

Linksys support told me that they haven't had the time to fix the site 
yet, but given that the unified firmware was released in february, they 
apparantly haven't been working very hard on it.

Hopefully, they will get around to fix this when they make the update 
for the remote admin problem available. The beta posted on the U.S. 
site, by the way, doesn't seem to be available in a european version yet...
