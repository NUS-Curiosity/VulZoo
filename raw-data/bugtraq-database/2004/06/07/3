Subject: RE: Internet explorer 6 execution of arbitrary code (An analysis of the 180 Solutions Trojan)


When run remotely:

Line: 1
Char: 1
Error: Access is denied.
Code: 0
URL: http://62.131.86.111/security/idiots/repro/installer.htm

When run locally, software installation is blocked. 

Using IE 6.0.2900.2096 SP2, WinXP SP2

I've gotta say that SP2 has some VERY nice protection builtin.  On the downside, I still havn't figured out how to turn it off ;)
