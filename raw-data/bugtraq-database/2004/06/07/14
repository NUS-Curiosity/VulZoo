Subject: MS ISA SP2 out last month


Without so much as whisper MS have released SP2 for their nice and tidy
firewall / proxy Internet Acceleration Server 2000 last month!  I'm on
every MS security mailing list, or I thought I was, and I didn't see
this at all, only came by it on the MS site looking for something else.
