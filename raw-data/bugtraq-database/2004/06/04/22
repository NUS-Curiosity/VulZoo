Subject: The Linksys WRT54G "security problem" doesn't exist

I think the "Independent consultant" quoted in InternetWeek is wrong.  I 
think he either has a defective router or his cables are plugged into the 
wrong end of the thing.

This clearly works properly on my Linksys WRT54G.  No access of 
administrative site on the WAN side when it's turned off.  Period.

Comments and questions:

1) No one has been able to confirm this problem.  Isn't that right?

2) The "Independent consultant" did not say he tried with more than one 
router,  and it appears that he did not ask anyone else if they would 
check this out on their routers before he decided the sky was falling.

3) Thousands and thousands of these things have been sold for months an no 
one has reported this error before.

4) Certainly such an aggregious error would have been discovered before 
now, as hackers routinely bang away at IP addresses and find this stuff.

5) Does he really think that Cisco/Linksys would not test such a basic 
basic basic aspect of this router's security?

6) How did this get on to InternetWeek?  Does anyone actually check these 
things out before publishing them?

Please, prove me wrong on all points.  Can anyone reproduce this?

Dave
