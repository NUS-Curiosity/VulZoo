Agreed, but I think that, in this case, the real problem would be an 
insecure configuration of the underlying webserver: any security-aware 
administrator should configure it to NOT follow symlinks or, at last, 
follow them if and only if the destination file belongs to the same 
user (SymLinksIfOwnerMatch directive in Apache).

Did you know that, if you play a Windows 2000 CD backwards,
you will hear the voice of Satan? That's nothing!
If you play it forward, it will install Windows 2000!!!
