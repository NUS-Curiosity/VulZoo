New York City Security Shindig 2

Security Shindigs are ways for technical people in the Information
Security
industry to get together, view an informative technical presentation, and
otherwise have a good time.

Date/Time: Monday June 14th, 6pm
Location: Two Boots "Den of Cin" http://www.twoboots.com/theden/
44 Avenue A (at E 3rd Street) underneath Two Boots Video.

Speaker/Topic: Jamie Butler. Kernel Rootkits. I've seen the slidepack,
and it
was extremely interesting if you're interested in kernel rootkits,
which you should be. It focuses on Win32, but touches on Linux. Jamie
teaches a class on the
subject that has gotten nothing but good reviews, so you should
welcome this fre
e chance to see what he's got going on. I've been told there will be
demonstrati
ons and other excitement.

Extras: Free Soda and Pizza (toppings extra). Cash bar. Potential book
raffle!
Sponsor: Immunity, Inc. (www.immunitysec.com)
