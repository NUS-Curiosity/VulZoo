Oracle E-Business Suite - Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
June 3, 2004
______________________________________________________________________
 
Summary:
 
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the Oracle E-Business Suite
11i and Oracle Applications 11.0.  These vulnerabilities can be remotely
exploited simply using a browser and sending a specially crafted URL to the
web server.  A mandatory patch from Oracle is required to solve these
security issues.
 
Product:    Oracle E-Business Suite
Versions:   11.0.x, 11.5.1 - 11.5.8
Platforms:  All platforms
Risk Level: Critical
_____________________________________________________________________
 
Description:
 
Integrigy has discovered multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in almost
all supported versions of Oracle Applications (11.0 and 11i).  Because
Oracle Applications 11i installs code for all product modules, all Oracle
Applications 11i customers are vulnerable to these SQL injection issues.
 
A SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute SQL statements
or database functions by inserting SQL code fragments into input fields of a
web page.  Due to the design of Oracle Applications, a SQL injection attack
can easily and effectively compromise the entire database and application.
 
Customers with Internet facing application servers are most vulnerable since
these vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely using a browser.  Since
attacks can be specially crafted for Oracle Applications and an attack may
only be a single HTTP Get or Post, successful attacks can be easily designed
that will evade most intrusion detection and prevention systems.
 
Solution:
 
Oracle has released a patch for Oracle Applications 11.0 and the Oracle
E-Business Suite 11i to correct these vulnerabilities.
 
The following Oracle patches must be applied --
 
      Version     Patch
      -------     -----
      11i         3644626     (11.5.1 - 11.5.8)
      11.0        3648066     (all versions) 
 
The patch availability matrix is available in Oracle Metalink Note ID
274375.1.
 
Oracle Applications 11i customers that have applied both the Report Manager
Mini-pack B (11i.FRM.B) or greater AND Marketing Suite Family Pack B
(11i.MKT_PF.B) do NOT need to apply a patch for these vulnerabilities -
these patch levels are included in 11.5.9.
 
All Oracle Applications customers should consider this vulnerability
extremely high risk and apply the above patch at the earliest possible
opportunity.  Customers with Internet facing application servers should
apply the patch immediately.
 
Appropriate testing and backups should be always performed before applying
any patches.
