Subject: RE: PING: Outlook 2003 Spam


Hello,

A coworker and I spent much of the day yesterday trying to replicate
this behavior and we were not able to do so.  The only time we can get
Outlook 2003 to pull anything from our server with this code is when we
send the email within our own MS Exchange.  We've tried multiple
clients, multiple SMTP servers, and many variations of the code below
and have not been successful, other than emails sent between Exchange
users.

I have not seen any other comments on this issue.  Is it possible
Microsoft has already patched Outlook 2003 to only allow this behavior
when dealing with a trusted zone?

Mark

Outlook 2003 the premier mail client from the company called 'Microsoft'
certainly appears to have a lot of security features built into it.
Cursory examination shows excellent thought into 'spam' containment,
'security' consideration and many other little 'things'. So much so the
default rendering of html is in so-called 'restricted zone' which
disallows nearly everything [frames, iframes, objects, scripting etc.].
In addition 'special' spam measures are taken to disallow graphic
downloads from a remote server in html email which can be used to verify
recipients:

The Key Word is: nearly 

Utilising Outlook's own bizarre scheMAH ! which comprises a 'proper'
frame along with an src pointing to our remote server, we are able to
ping the server and confirm our recipient has viewed our email. We don't
require graphics or frames or iframes to do that:

<v:vml frame style="LEFT: 50px; WIDTH: 300px; POSITION: 
relative; TOP: 30px; HEIGHT: 200px" 
src = "http://www.malware.com/duh.txt#malware"></v:vmlframe>

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<STYLE>
v\:* { behavior: url(#default#VML); }
</STYLE>
<XML:NAMESPACE NS="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml" PREFIX="v"/> </HEAD>


Notes:

1. We now commence our examination of the Microsoft Office 2003 suite,
we're a bit late, but it has taken all this time to save up to buy the
thing 2. Quick 72 hour prodding reveals that this 'perceived' premier
device known as Outlook 2003 is in fact riddled with holes 3. Do not
receive or open any emails period.  Use string and tin cans if you must
communicate
