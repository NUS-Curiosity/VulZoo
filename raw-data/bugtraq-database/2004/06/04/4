Synopsis:          Updated cvs resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1620
Issue date:        2004-06-02
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1620

1. Topic:

Updated cvs packages that fix remote denial of service vulnerabilities are 
now available.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9   - i386

3. Problem description:

Sebastian Krahmer discovered a flaw in CVS clients where rcs diff files can 
create files with absolute pathnames An attacker could create a fake 
malicious CVS server that would cause arbitrary files to be created or 
overwritten when a victim connects to it. The Common Vulnerabilities and 
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0180 to 
this issue.  (Note: Red Hat Linux 9 was already patched for this issue)

Derek Price discovered a vulnerability whereby a CVS pserver could be 
abused by a malicious client to view the contents of certain files outside 
of the CVS root directory using relative pathnames containing "../". The 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned 
the name CAN-2004-0405 to this issue. (Note: Red Hat Linux 9 was already 
patched for this issue)

Stefan Esser discovered a flaw in cvs where malformed "Entry" lines could 
cause a heap overflow. An attacker who has access to a CVS server could 
use this flaw to execute arbitrary code under the UID which the CVS server 
is executing. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project 
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0396 to this issue.

Users of CVS are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which 
contain a patch correcting this issue.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank David M. Kaplan for bringing these issues 
to our attention.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata 
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those 
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are 
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you 
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains 
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many 
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate 
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or 
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit 
http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum 
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is 
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or 
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
