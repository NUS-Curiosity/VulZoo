Firstly, good etiquette would have been for you to actually report the bug 
with Debian. I don't see any bugs raised against any of the appropriate 
packages regarding this.

Secondly, the advisory you refer to is only mentioning DHCP 3.0+. The Debian 
package you referred to is 2.0pl5. Perhaps you are referring to:

http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/dhcp3-server

Which is presently at 3.0.1rc9. The CERT advisory refers to 3.01 to 3.01r8 
inclusive.

Are you saying the CERT advisory applies to other versions of DHCP?
