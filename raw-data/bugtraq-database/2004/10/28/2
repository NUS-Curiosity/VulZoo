Subject: EEYE: RealPlayer Zipped Skin File Buffer Overflow


RealPlayer Zipped Skin File Buffer Overflow

Release Date:
October 27, 2004

Date Reported:
October 11, 2004

Severity:
High (Code Execution)

Vendor:
RealNetworks

Systems Affected:
For Microsoft Windows
RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1053 and earlier)
RealPlayer 10
RealOne Player v2
RealOne Player v1

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a vulnerability in RealPlayer that
allows a remote attacker to reliably overwrite the stack with arbitrary
data and execute arbitrary code in the context of the user under which
the player is running.

Technical Details:
A RealPlayer skin file (.rjs extension) can be downloaded and applied
automatically through a web browser without the user's permission. A
skin file is a bundle of graphics and a .ini file, stored together in
ZIP format. DUNZIP32.DLL, which is included with RealPlayer, is used to
extract the contents of the skin file. When an .rjs file containing a
long file name (greater than around 0x8000 bytes) is opened, either in
RealPlayer or through a web browser, a stack based buffer overflow
occurs, allowing an exception handler record to be overwritten and EIP
to be hijacked.

Protection:
Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.

Vendor Status:
RealNetworks has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available via the "Check for Update" menu item under Tools on the
RealPlayer menu bar. "Security Update - Skin File Overflow" Recommended
Player Update: Resolves a security vulnerability when activating a
specifically malformed skins file. Skins files available on RealNetworks
site are examined before being posted. Skins files from other sources
should be treated with caution.
