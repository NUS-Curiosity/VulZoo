SSRT3526 rev.0 Serviceguard potential increase in privilege

NOTICE:
There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
provided that it remains complete and intact.

The information in this Security bulletin should be acted upon
as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:
21 October 2004

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:
Increase in privilege.

SOURCE:
HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:
None

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP
Serviceguard running on HP-UX and Linux that may allow
remote unauthorized privileges.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX
HP Serviceguard                    A.11.13, A.11.14, A.11.15.00,
                                            A.11.16.00
HP Cluster Object Manager   A.01.03, B.01.04, B.02.02.00,
                                          B.03.00.00, B.03.00.01

Linux
HP Serviceguard for Linux    A.11.14.04, A.11.15.04
HP Cluster Object Manager   B.02.01.02, B.02.02.02

BACKGROUND:
Serviceguard was designed to operate within a single security
domain. This includes the following requirements:

1. The root user on any node inside the trusted network must be
trusted by all nodes. Users with appropriate privileges on any
node inside the  trusted network must be trusted by all nodes.
This includes the root user on any Unix computer and any
valid user on a Windows computer.
2. The network must be physically defended against any spoof or
sniff attacks.
3. The network firewalls must be correctly configured to defend
against external attacks.

A defect was discovered which allows non-root users on the
subnet to obtain elevated privileges. The available patches,
together with their special installation instructions, fix that
defect.
Any system on which Serviceguard has been installed (all
configurations using SGeRAC, SGeSAP, Continentalcluster, and
Metrocluster) should be patched, including those which are
not configured in a cluster.

For more information, a white paper entitled "Securing
Serviceguard" has been written and posted at
http://docs.hp.com/hpux/ha

Note: In the listings below on Linux versions, IA32 and
IA64 represent the 32 and 64 bit Intel Architecture CPU's,
while PA represents the Precision Architecure from HP.

The Linux files are packaged as a tar'ed  shar'ed RPM.
Download, unshar and extract the tar package, then run
"sgupdate"  to install the new version.

AFFECTED VERSIONS

Note: To determine if a system has an affected version,
search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset" for
an affected fileset. Then determine if the recommended
patch or update is installed.

  docId=hpuxSecurityMatrix
Or via anonymous ftp:
  ftp://ftp.itrc.hp.com/export/patches/hp-ux_patch_matrix/

The HP-UX Security Patch Matrix, updated daily, categorizes
security patches by platform/OS release, and by Bulletin topic.
The Security Patch Check tool completely automates the process of
reviewing the Security Patch Matrix for HP-UX 11.XX Versions.

NOTE: Installing patches listed in the Security Patch Matrix will
completely implement the RESOLUTION in the Security Bulletin
_only_ if there are no MANUAL ACTIONS included.

The Security Patch Check tool can also verify that a Security
Bulletin RESOLUTION has been implemented on HP-UX 11.XX Versions
provided that no MANUAL ACTIONS were included. The Security Patch
Check tool cannot verify patches implemented via product upgrade.
