             Neoteris IVE changepassword.cgi Authentication Bypass


Date Published: 2004-09-20

Date Discovered: 2004-07-23

Advisory ID: GOSECURE-2004-10

Class: Design Error

Risk: Medium

Vendor: Juniper Networks

Advisory URL:
http://www.gosecure.ca/SecInfo/gosecure-2004-10.txt


Affected System:

Neoteris Instant Virtual Extranet (IVE) OS, Version 3.x
Netories Instant Virtual Extranet (IVE) OS, Version 4.x  

Description:

Neoteris Instant Virtual Extranet (IVE) is a well known "clientless" SSL VPN solution for internal network remote access via standard web browser. It is widely used as an extranet portal for corporate network.

There is a vulnerability in Neoteris IVE password management.

When a valid user tries to authenticate via Neoteris and the password is expired, the user will be directly forwarded to "changepassword.cgi" without asking any form of authentication. The username, authentication server and type will be appended to �changepassword.cgi� URL. Since the "changepassword.cgi" allows the user to try the old password as many times as they want, effectively allowing brute force password attack. By using the trivial information gathering skills to get the valid accounts and launching brute force attack, a remote attacker may take over the password expired accounts and gain unauthorized access to the internal network resource.

This vulnerability only affects the IVE products which are configured with an LDAP or NT domain authentication server. Other type of authentication servers are  not affected.
