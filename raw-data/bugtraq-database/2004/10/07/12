Synopsis
========

Cyrus-SASL contains two vulnerabilities that might allow an attacker to
completely compromise the vulnerable system.

Background
==========

Cyrus-SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/cyrus-sasl     <= 2.1.18-r1                 >= 2.1.18-r2

Description
===========

Cyrus-SASL contains a remote buffer overflow in the digestmda5.c file.
Additionally, under certain conditions it is possible for a local user
to exploit a vulnerability in the way the SASL_PATH environment
variable is honored (CAN-2004-0884).

Impact
======

An attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code with the Effective
ID of the application calling the Cyrus-SASL libraries.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cyrus-SASL users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=dev-libs/cyrus-sasl-2.1.18-r2"
    # emerge ">=dev-libs/cyrus-sasl-2.1.18-r2"
