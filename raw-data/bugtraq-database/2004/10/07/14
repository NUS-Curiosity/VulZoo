1. Topic:

Updated cvs packages that fix a security vulnerabilities are now
available.

CVS is a version control system frequently used to manage source code
repositories.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

While investigating a previously fixed vulnerability, Derek Price
discovered a flaw relating to malformed "Entry" lines which lead to a
missing NULL terminator. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0414 to this issue.

Stefan Esser and Sebastian Krahmer conducted an audit of CVS and fixed a
number of issues that may have had security consequences.

Among the issues deemed likely to be exploitable were:

- a double-free relating to the error_prog_name string (CAN-2004-0416)
- an argument integer overflow (CAN-2004-0417)
- out-of-bounds writes in serv_notify (CAN-2004-0418).

An attacker who has access to a CVS server may be able to execute arbitrary
code under the UID on which the CVS server is executing.

Users of CVS are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains
backported patches correcting these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/ for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
