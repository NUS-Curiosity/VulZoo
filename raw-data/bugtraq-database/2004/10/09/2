1. Topic:

Updated httpd packages that include fixes for security issues are now
available.

The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
freely-available Web server.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Problems that apply to Red Hat Linux 9 only:

A stack buffer overflow was discovered in mod_ssl that could be
triggered if using the FakeBasicAuth option. If mod_ssl was sent a
client certificate with a subject DN field longer than 6000 characters,
a stack overflow occured if FakeBasicAuth had been enabled. In order to
exploit this issue the carefully crafted malicious certificate would
have had to be signed by a Certificate Authority which mod_ssl is
configured to trust. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0488 to this issue.

A remotely triggered memory leak in the Apache HTTP Server earlier than
version 2.0.50 was also discovered. This allowed a remote attacker to
perform a denial of service attack against the server by forcing it to
consume large amounts of memory. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0493 to
this issue.

Problems that apply to Fedora Core 1 only:

An input filter bug in mod_ssl was discovered in Apache httpd version
2.0.50 and earlier. A remote attacker could force an SSL connection to
be aborted in a particular state and cause an Apache child process to
enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0748 to this issue.

Testing using the Codenomicon HTTP Test Tool performed by the Apache
Software Foundation security group and Red Hat uncovered an input
validation issue in the IPv6 URI parsing routines in the apr-util
library. If a remote attacker sent a request including a carefully
crafted URI, an httpd child process could be made to crash. This issue
is not believed to allow arbitrary code execution on this version of
Linux. This issue also does not represent a significant denial of
service attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache
child processes. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0786 to this issue.

Note that these packages do also contain the fix for a regression in
Satisfy handling in the 2.0.51 release (CAN-2004-0811).

Problems that apply to both Red Hat Linux 9 and Fedora Core 1:

The Swedish IT Incident Centre (SITIC) reported a buffer overflow in the
expansion of environment variables during configuration file parsing.
This issue could allow a local user to gain 'apache' privileges if an
httpd process can be forced to parse a carefully crafted .htaccess file
written by a local user. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0747 to this
issue.

An issue was discovered in the mod_ssl module which could be triggered
if the server is configured to allow proxying to a remote SSL server. A
malicious remote SSL server could force an httpd child process to crash
by sending a carefully crafted response header. This issue is not
believed to allow execution of arbitrary code. This issue also does not
represent a significant Denial of Service attack as requests will
continue to be handled by other Apache child processes. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0751 to this issue.

An issue was discovered in the mod_dav module which could be triggered
for a location where WebDAV authoring access has been configured. A
malicious remote client which is authorized to use the LOCK method could
force an httpd child process to crash by sending a particular sequence
of LOCK requests. This issue does not allow execution of arbitrary code.
This issue also does not represent a significant Denial of Service
attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache child
processes. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0809 to this issue.

Users of the Apache HTTP server should upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain patches that address these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
