That's easy for you to say; your country has the population of
California.  It doesn't scale to 10 times that size.  It's error-prone.
It discourages the bed-ridden, the sick, and the disabled from voting.
It requires a lot more people to do the counting, and those people must
either be paid or incompetent, in the numbers needed.

The United States can either have some form of electronic voting, or
dispense with the national popular vote for President entirely again.
