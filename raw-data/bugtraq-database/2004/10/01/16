Subject: Re: Possible GDI Exploit Vector


I tried to put a jpeg in my profile pic and in emotion panel for
testing the same on msn 6 which is created by GDI flaw(remote shell
binding code), but msn 6 complains about the jpeg image.
(The image can't be displayed or resized, Please try again,or select
another image)
thats y I don't thin msn6 uses GDI to render images in display and in emotions. 
But i can send infected image to ppls who are not using updated
Antivirus/patched by file transfers. This is still dangerous.

If so, this could provide an extremely fast way to propagate a worm using the GDI+ flaw. All you would need to do to start it off is set the crafted image as ur profile picture, start conversations wtih people you know have MSN6 installed, and, if by default they display the other users' profile picture,they're machine would process the image and carry out any nasty deeds the image has within it (if the machine's not patched).
