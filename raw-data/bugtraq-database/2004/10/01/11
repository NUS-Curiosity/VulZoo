Package description:
  Samba provides an SMB server which can be used to provide network
  services to SMB (sometimes called "Lan Manager") clients, including
  various versions of MS Windows, OS/2, and other Linux machines. Samba
  uses NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) protocols and does NOT need NetBEUI
  (Microsoft Raw NetBIOS frame) protocol.Samba-2 features an almost
  working NT Domain Control capability and includes the new SWAT (Samba
  Web Administration Tool) that allows samba's smb.conf file to be
  remotely managed using your favourite web browser.

Problem description:
  A security vulnerability has been located in Samba 2.2.x <= 2.2.11 and
  Samba 3.0.x <= 3.0.5. A remote attacker may be able to gain access to
  files which exist outside of the share's defined path. Such files must
  still be readable by the account used for the connection.

  This has been assigned CAN-2004-0815 by the CVE.
