	But surely a paper trail is inferior to a cryptographically secure voting
system? It's easier to verify millions of crptographic signatures than
millions of pieces of paper.

	So long as the mathematical scheme by which the votes were entered and
counted was itself secure, it matters not what the machine does. It will
either produce valid results or obviously invalid results. All you have to
do is devise the scheme so that it is computationally infeasible to produce
invalid, but valid looking, results. This is not a difficult mathematical
problem.

	Doesn't matter. You can't tell what's going on in the chips and disks when
you connect to 'https://www.amazon.com', but you can tell whether you
reached the Amazon server or not (assuming you trust the certificate
issuers). Similary, one can develop voting schemes (it isn't even difficult)
where it is not possible for the chips and disks to produce invalid results
that would pass automated inspections that anyone could do.

	Exactly.

	I think the solution is mathematical. Devise schemes such that it's not
possible for a machine to produce valid-looking, but not valid, results.
This is not only not difficult, but already done. Even apparently
contradictory requirements are not really contradictory. For example, there
are schemes in which a person cannot prove how they voted, yet can prove
that their vote was not counted for the correct candidate if it in fact was
not.
