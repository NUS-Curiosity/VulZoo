                 Mandrakelinux Security Update Advisory
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package name:           gpdf
 Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2004:114
 Date:                   October 21st, 2004

 Affected versions:	 10.0
 ______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Chris Evans discovered numerous vulnerabilities in the xpdf package,
 which also effect software using embedded xpdf code, such as gpdf:
 
 Multiple integer overflow issues affecting xpdf-2.0 and xpdf-3.0.
 Also programs like gpdf which have embedded versions of xpdf.
 These can result in writing an arbitrary byte to an attacker controlled
 location which probably could lead to arbitrary code execution. 
 
 The updated packages are patched to protect against these
 vulnerabilities.
