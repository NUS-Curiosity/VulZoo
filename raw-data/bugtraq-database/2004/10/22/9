Subject: Virus/Trojan trying to connect external:445 and 212.175.149.149.6667


Hi All,

I am seeing some network traffic for some windows host trying to
contact random remote hosts port 445 and these hosts also try to
connect 212.175.149.149.6667

Is this some kind of an IRC bot/trojan?

Anybody aware of it?

We cannot find anything with the virus scanner.
This virus is very chatty, and keeping the network very busy.

Any suggestions?

Best,
Murat
