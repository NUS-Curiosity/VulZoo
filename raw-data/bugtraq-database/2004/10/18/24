Regarding the Trivial example I sent:

>>http://www.SomeLotusSite.com/FormReflectingURLValue?OpenForm&Field=[&lt;script&gt;.....&lt;/script&gt;]

Please replace &lt; with "Less Than" character and &gt; with "greater than" character for this to work, looks like those characters where doble encoded (for obvious security reasons) when posted.

Here is the URL encoded version as well:
http://www.SomeLotusSite.com/FormReflectingURLValue?OpenForm&Field=%5B%3Cscript%3E%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E%3C%2Fscript%3E%5D

&lt; Regards
