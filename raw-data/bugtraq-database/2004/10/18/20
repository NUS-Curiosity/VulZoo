Subject: IBM Lotus Notes/Domino fails to encode Square Brackets ( [  ] )
    in computed field/text, allowing XSS




Software:
IBM Lotus Notes/Domino

Affected Version(s):
Tested in R6 should work in prior versions as well.

Author:
Juan C Calderon

Description:
An attacker can bypass native Lotus Notes HTML encoding in a computed value by adding square brackets to the beginning and end of a field of the following types computed, computed for display, computed when composed or a "computed text" element, Injecting HTML and JavaScript as desired.

NOTE: This won't work in editable fields

Trivial Example:
http://www.SomeLotusSite.com/FormReflectingURLValue?OpenForm&Field=[&lt;script&gt;.....&lt;/script&gt;]

Solution:
Validate user input for square bracket characters ( [ ] )  in data shown directly or indirectly in computed fields/texts
