Update: October 19, 2004

Recent published advisories and media stories are reporting that this attack can kill the Auto-Protect feature of Norton AntiVirus. This is incorrect. 

Investigations into this issue by Symantec have determined this attack terminates the CCApp.exe executable. This leads to the disappearance of the Norton AntiVirus icon in the system tray, and disables notification of Auto-Protect. It does not terminate Auto-Protect itself. The userï¿½s system is still protected.

Protection can be verified by using the EICAR test file (see ww.eicar.com/anti_virus_test_file.htm). When this test file is saved to the system there is no notification by Auto-Protect. The file is prevented from being written to disk by the still functional Auto-Protect. Once CCApp.exe is restarted, Auto-Protect notification resumes and the tray icon reappears.
