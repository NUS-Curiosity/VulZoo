This suggests that it's reasonable for a program to segfault because the
user made a mistake, instead of having some non-fatal form of error
handling.  I don't think that should be acceptable at all, though I agree
it's very common.  If I had a dollar for every time I've lost work because a
segfault or GPF happened before I saved my document...
