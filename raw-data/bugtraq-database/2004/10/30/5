Subject: Re: New URL spoofing bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer


Under IE 6.0.2900.2180, this does not occur as you describe.

If the mouse pointer is pointed to the edge around the link,
"http://www.microsoft.com" is displayed, but when the pointer is
directly over the link, "http://www.google.com" is correctly
displayed.
