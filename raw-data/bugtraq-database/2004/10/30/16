Subject: RE: New URL spoofing bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer


Russ from NTBugTraq helped to clear some of this up. If you hover the
mouse below the actual link to Google - in a very narrow area - the
status bar will show www.microsoft.com, but clicking doesn't do
anything. So it's definitely a stupid error in IE, but the spoofing
angle in SP2 is debatable.

Same version I tested, Larry. (Same results too, for the most part.) Try
looking at my page for another example (as I stated in my previous
emails), as well as a way it might "work" in a sense:
 - http://www.guidoz.com/btstatusurl.html

FYI: It seems my emails from 10/28 may have not made it to the list yet
(?). They are included.
