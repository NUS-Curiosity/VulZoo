Subject: Re: New URL spoofing bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer


Update to my previous email (quoted below) which was in reply to
Benjamin's original email (quoted at bottom).

Using Win XP Pro w/ SP2 (Fully patched according to Windows Update -
IE version: 6.0.2900.2180), his example does NOT work. If you hover
your mouse just above the link (where the table border would be), it
says Microsoft.com, however, going over the actual link inside the
table will properly reveal Google.com. (Maybe Microsoft patched this?
Not sure what is meant by "fully patched" in Benjamin's text. Fully
patched according to what?)

My example still holds true however, as I expected. I wouldn't call it
a bug or an exploit really. It's more like an "abused feature" if
anything. It's not a glitch or an example of bad coding. It's just yet
another deceptive way to fool someone using the resources available.

Comments?
