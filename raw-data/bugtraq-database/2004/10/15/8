OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project

________________________________________________________________________

Package:             apache (option "with_mod_ssl yes" only)
Vulnerability:       information disclosure
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= apache-1.3.31-20041005 >= apache-1.3.31-20041015
OpenPKG 2.1          <= apache-1.3.31-2.1.4    >= apache-1.3.31-2.1.5
OpenPKG 2.0          <= apache-1.3.29-2.0.5    >= apache-1.3.29-2.0.6

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Hartmut Keil discovered [0] an information disclosure vulnerability
  in mod_ssl [1], the SSL/TLS module of the Apache [2] webserver. After
  a renegotiation, affected versions of mod_ssl fail to ensure that the
  requested cipher suite is actually negotiated. In some configurations
  a client may be able to retrieve content using a cipher suite the
  server does not consider strong enough. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2004-0885 [3] to the
  problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  apache" and "<prefix>/bin/rpm -qi apache | grep with_mod_ssl". If you
  have the "apache" package with option "with_mod_ssl" installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade (see Solution) [4][5].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [6][7], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [8][9] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [10], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [4] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary
  RPM [5]. For the current release OpenPKG 2.1, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.1/UPD
  ftp> get apache-1.3.31-2.1.5.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig apache-1.3.31-2.1.5.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild apache-1.3.31-2.1.5.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/apache-1.3.31-2.1.5.*.rpm
