Subject: Clientexec Billing Software




Clientexec is a php billing software with a target audience of webhosts. By
default there is a file called phpinfo.php in the main clientexec directory.
This can be access by anyone with a web browser. I looked through the
documentation and didn't find any reference to it. I then checked several
different companies using this piece of software and all had it in the same
place. I contacted the vendor and he said he would fix it. I know this sounds
silly, but many people that use this software are not familar with issues like
these let alone know what the phpinfo() function does.
