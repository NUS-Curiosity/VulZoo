Subject: [FLSA-2004:2102] Updated samba packages fix security vulnerability
	[updated]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated samba resolves security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       FLSA:2102
Issue date:        2004-10-14
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=2102
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0686, CAN-2004-0815
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

[Updated 14th October to correct broken packages and document further
fixes]

Updated samba packages that fix an input validation vulnerability are now
available.

Samba provides file and printer sharing services to SMB/CIFS clients.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The Samba team discovered a buffer overflow in the code used to support
the 'mangling method = hash' smb.conf option. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0686
to this issue.

Karol Wiesek discovered an input validation issue in Samba prior to 3.0.6.
An authenticated user could send a carefully crafted request to the Samba
server, which would allow access to files outside of the configured file
share. Note: Such files would have to be readable by the account used
for the connection. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0815 to this issue.

Users of Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain an
upgrade to Samba-2.2.12, which is not vulnerable to these issues.

A previous version of this advisory referred to packages which had been
incorrectly built to not include some of the optional features which were
previously enabled.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/ for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
