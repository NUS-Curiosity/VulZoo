ASPR #2004-10-14-1: HTML Injection in JRun Management Console
=========================================================================

Document ID:     ASPR #2004-10-14-1-PUB
Vendor:          Macromedia (http://www.macromedia.com)
Target:          JRun 4 for Windows, Service Pack 1a
Impact:          An HTML injection vulnerability exists in JRun
                 Management Console, enabling attackers to hijack
                 administrative sessions using cross site scripting
Severity:        Medium
Status:          Official patch available, workaround available
Discovered by:   Mitja Kolsek of ACROS Security

Summary
=======

An HTML injection vulnerability exists in JRun 4 Management Console,
allowing the attacker to acquire the session ID of a management session and
subsequently enter that session without administrator noticing it.


Product Coverage
================

- JRun 4 for Windows, Service Pack 1a - affected

All updaters applied, up to and excluding JRun4 Updater 4.
Other versions may also be affected.


Analysis
========

Cross site scripting is a very common problem with web-based applications.
Basically it is present whenever the server is willing to include user's
input data, which contains some client-side script (e.g. JavaScript), back
to the browser unsanitized, somewhere within the generated web page. This
script, when executed, has access to all information within and about the
received web page, including the cookies. 

JRun employs so-called "session cookies" for HTTP session maintenance. After
administrator's login to Management Console, JRun server generates a unique
session identifier (session ID) and sends it to administrator's browser
as a cookie named JSESSIONID. This session ID effectively becomes a static
password for the session, meaning that until the session times out or is
closed by the logged in administrator (by logging off), any browser with
access to port 8000 of JRun server and knowledge of the session ID will have
access to this session, and thereby access to administration of JRun
application servers.


Mitigating Factors
==================

1) Attacker must lure the JRun administrator into visiting a hostile web
site
   while he (admin) has an authenticated session with the JRun Management
   Console.


Solution
========

Macromedia has issued a security bulletin [1] and published JRun4 Updater 4,
which fixes this issue. Affected users can download the updater from
http://www.macromedia.com/support/jrun/updaters.html


Workaround
==========

- Don't allow potential attackers access to port 8000 of JRun server. 
- Don't browse around or read HTML e-mail while administering JRun server. 
- Always close all browser instances/windows before logging in to JRun 
  Management Console.
