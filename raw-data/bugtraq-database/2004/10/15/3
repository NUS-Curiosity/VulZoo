Hi, 
i just found out, that u can also use it remotely against the server without any knowledge of the rcon-password!
just do the following:
type 'name "%n"' (without ') to console and wait until you get killed.
The server will be killed, too!

The other hand side, if you kill an other player, the server wont be affected.
