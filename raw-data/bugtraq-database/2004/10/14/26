ASPR #2004-10-14-3: Unsanitized Session ID Cookie Allows Modifying Server
                    Response
=========================================================================

Document ID:     ASPR #2004-10-14-3-PUB
Vendor:          Macromedia (http://www.macromedia.com)
Target:          JRun 4 for Windows, Service Pack 1a
Impact:          It is possible to have JRun server issue an arbitrary
                 HTTP header or body
Severity:        Medium
Status:          Official patch available
Discovered by:   Mitja Kolsek of ACROS Security

Current version 
   http://www.acrossecurity.com/aspr/ASPR-2004-10-14-3-PUB.txt


Summary
=======

An HTTP response splitting vulnerability (see [1]) exists in JRun
server session management. It allows an attacker to issue an arbitrary
HTTP header (e.g., a session cookie) or HTTP body (e.g., causing a
cross site scripting) to a browser.


Product Coverage
================

- JRun 4 for Windows, Service Pack 1a - affected

All updaters applied, up to and excluding JRun4 Updater 4.
Other versions may also be affected.


Analysis
========

Using HTTP response splitting, it is possible to arbitrarily modify server's
response. This feature can be used very effectively for poisoning HTTP proxy
servers' cache (see [1]), for for session fixation (see [2]) and cross site
scripting attacks.


Solution
========

Macromedia has issued a security bulletin [3] and published JRun4 Updater 4,
which fixes this issue. Affected users can download the updater from
http://www.macromedia.com/support/jrun/updaters.html
