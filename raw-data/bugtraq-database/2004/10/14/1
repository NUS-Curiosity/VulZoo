1. Topic:

Updated lha packages that fix multiple security vulnerabilities
are now available.

LHA is an archiving and compression utility for LHarc format archives.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Ulf Harnhammar discovered two stack buffer overflows and two directory
traversal flaws in LHA.

An attacker could exploit the buffer overflows by creating a carefully
crafted LHA archive in such a way that arbitrary code would be executed
when the archive is tested or extracted by a victim. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0234 to this issue.

An attacker could exploit the directory traversal issues to create files
as the victim outside of the expected directory. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0235 to this issue.

Lukasz Wojtow discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in all versions
of lha up to and including version 1.14. A carefully created archive
could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code when a victim extracts
or tests the archive. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0769 to this issue.

Buffer overflows were discovered in the command line processing of all
versions of lha up to and including version 1.14. If a malicious user
could trick a victim into passing a specially crafted command line to
the lha command, it is possible that arbitrary code could be executed.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names CAN-2004-0771 and CAN-2004-0694 to these issues.

Thomas Biege discovered a shell meta character command execution
vulnerability in all versions of lha up to and including 1.14. An
attacker could create a directory with shell meta characters in its name
which could lead to arbitrary command execution. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0745 to this issue.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
