Subject: EEYE: Windows Shell ZIP File Decompression DUNZIP32.DLL Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


Windows Shell ZIP File Decompression DUNZIP32.DLL Buffer Overflow
Vulnerability

Release Date:
October 12, 2004

Date Reported:
August 2, 2004

Severity:
High (Code Execution)

Vendor:
Microsoft

Systems Affected:
Windows XP (SP1 and earlier)
Windows Me

Overview:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a buffer overflow in DUNZIP32.DLL,
a module that offers support for ZIP compressed folders in the Windows
shell. An exploitable buffer overflow occurs when a user opens a ZIP
folder that contains a long file name.

Technical Details:
This buffer overflow is triggered by an integer overflow. When a ZIP
file containing a long file name (greater than around 0x8000 bytes) is
opened in the Windows shell as a ZIP compressed folder, a stack-based
buffer overflow occurs, allowing an exception handler to be overwritten
and EIP to be hijacked.

Protection:
Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this
vulnerability.

Vendor Status:
Microsoft has released a patch for this vulnerability. The patch is
available at:
