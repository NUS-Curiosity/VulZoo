Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libXpm, which is
included in LessTif, that can potentially lead to remote code
execution.

Background
==========

LessTif is a clone of OSF/Motif, which is the standard user interface
toolkit available on Unix and Linux.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/lesstif      < 0.93.97                        >= 0.93.97

Description
===========

Chris Evans has discovered various integer and stack overflows in
libXpm, which is shipped as a part of the X Window System. LessTif, an
application that includes this library, is susceptible to the same
issues.

Impact
======

A carefully-crafted XPM file could crash applications that are linked
against libXpm, such as LessTif, potentially allowing the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All LessTif users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=x11-libs/lesstif-0.93.97"
    # emerge ">=x11-libs/lesstif-0.93.97"
