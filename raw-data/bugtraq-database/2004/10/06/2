*cut the linux crap ;)*

He didn't said DEBIAN is affected.
He just said it's contained in Debian.
I would take "contained" as example.... not as "only affected".
And he also didn't said something about getting r00t.
Just group privileges... (getting "games"-gid.. w00w00 ;)).

Even Debian dosn't setuid/setguid spider it's include and I'm sure the
author wouldn't report things wich don't work.

So get the "games"-gid with this error and be happy. ;-)
And spend honor to the guys who allow the "games"-group to use adduser. :)
