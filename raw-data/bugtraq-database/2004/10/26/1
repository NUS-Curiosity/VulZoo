This has been a basic pet peeve of mine for years -- even before web
browsers came on the scene. How many times have you seen a word processor
crash due to an unfortunate sequence of commands or opening a corrupted
file, for example?  I think that kind of behavior is just unacceptable.
Software should be able to deal with any input that's thrown at it.
