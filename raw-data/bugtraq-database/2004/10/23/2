Hack Dot AE (Http://www.hack.ae) the region�s first �UAE Web Hacking Challenge�. It is primarily to be played online on a website exclusively developed for the challenge. There are ten levels for HACK Dot AE Contest. Each level has a different problem which will test the candidates hacking capability.

The objective of the contest is to promote security awareness and to educate people about the risks of hacking so that they take due care when releasing applications on the internet.

Hacking is a real security threat that needs to be addressed. Without knowing the techniques that hackers use how can we defend against the threat?

The techniques that will be used in the contest are well documented on the internet, yet most IT professionals, especially programmers are unaware of the dangers.
