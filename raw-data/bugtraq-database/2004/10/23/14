Synopsis:          Updated Tripwire packages fix security flaw
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1719
Issue date:        2004-10-23
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1719
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0536
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated Tripwire packages that fix a format string security
vulnerability are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Tripwire is a system integrity assessment tool.

Paul Herman discovered a format string vulnerability in Tripwire version
2.3.1 and earlier. If Tripwire is configured to send reports via email,
a local user could gain privileges by creating a carefully crafted file.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0536 to this issue.

Users of Tripwire are advised to upgrade to this erratum package which
contains a backported security patch to correct this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata 
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
