Subject: [FLSA-2004:1324] Updated libxml2 resolves security vulnerability

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated libxml2 resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1324
Issue date:        2004-10-04
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1324
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0110
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

[Updated 4th October 2004]
The packages contained in the original release of this advisory were
missing python 2.2 support. These updated packages restore the missing
functionality.

Updated libxml2 packages that fix an overflow when parsing remote
resources are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

libxml2 is a library for manipulating XML files.

Yuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml2 versions prior to 2.6.6.
When fetching a remote resource via FTP or HTTP, libxml2 uses special
parsing routines.  These routines can overflow a buffer if passed a very
long URL.  If an attacker is able to find an application using libxml2
that parses remote resources and allows them to influence the URL, then
this flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name CAN-2004-0110 to this issue.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Johnny Strom for reporting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
