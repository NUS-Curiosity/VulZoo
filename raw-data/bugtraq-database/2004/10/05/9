Hi Marc and all,

I have a question here.

I check the Real Media file format at:
http://home.pcisys.net/~melanson/codecs/rmff.htm

According to what I understand, a data chunk has a
4-byte object_id as "DATA". This makes me a little
confused. What does a VIDORV30 data chunk mean? How do
I differentiate a general data chunk from a VIDORV30
data chunk?

Thank you in advance for any advice.
