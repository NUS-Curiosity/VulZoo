I've tried contacting the person in charge of the debian security audit project
numerous times to try and co-ordinate audits, and he doesn't respond.  I have
better things to do with my time.  I don't provide notice when people disregard
my emails.  If you don't like, I don't care.  My mother already taught me all
the etiquette I need, but thanks for the moral support.  Btw, is it salad fork
left, or dinner fork left?

No, I gave a link to the package I was talking about.

I'm saying, grep -rn syslog * | grep -v \". Soon after I found that, I googled
and found the CERT detailing a format string in logging code.  I assumed it was
the exact same thing I just found.  I spoke with some debian person about this
yesterday, or day before, and they can release an advisory to clear it up.
