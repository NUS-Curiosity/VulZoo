------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated sysstat packages fix security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1372
Issue date:        2004-10-03
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1372
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0107
------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated sysstat packages that fix various bugs and a minor security
issue are now available.

Sysstat is a tool for gathering system statistics. 

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

A bug was found in the Red Hat sysstat package post and trigger scripts,
which used insecure temporary file names. A local attacker could
overwrite system files using carefully-crafted symbolic links in the
/tmp directory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0107 to this issue.

Other issues addressed in this advisory include:

* iostat -x should return all partitions on the system (up to a maximum
of 1024)

* sar should handle network device names with more than 8 characters
properly

Users of sysstat should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

5. Bug IDs fixed:

i386:
http://download.fedoralegacy.org/redhat/7.3/updates/i386/sysstat-4.0.3-4.legacy.i386.rpm

7. Verification:

SHA1 sum                                 Package Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.3/updates/i386/sysstat-4.0.3-4.legacy.i386.rpm

7.3/updates/SRPMS/sysstat-4.0.3-4.legacy.src.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
