Subject: Micronet wireless broadband router SP916BM admin password reset when power off


Product:
	Micronet Wireless Broadband Router, Model No.: SP916BM

Bug:
	When you power off this router, password for user "admin" is set back to 
	default "admin". But to change the password you must know password that was
	set before power off.
	By default you cannot access web interface from outside network, unless
	you enable it.

Solution:
	Update firmware to version 1.9 08/04/2004.
