Description: Fusetalk is a discussion forum solution that provides a
powerful and simple method of web-based collaboration.
 
 
Cross site scripting: The filtering script for the img src= doesnt
filter " if preceeded by a ?. The cross site scripting works because the
<img src=" tag can be closed by a target url with " which then permits
the user to use such oneventhandles as onmouseover.

their &#xx; equivilant.
