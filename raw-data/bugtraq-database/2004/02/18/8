Synopsis:          Updated kernel packages resolve security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:065-01
Issue date:        2004-02-18
Updated on:        2004-02-18
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          VMA privesc
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2003:417

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated kernel packages that fix security vulnerabilities which may allow
local users to gain root privileges are now available.  These packages also
resolve other minor issues.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - athlon, i386, i686

3. Problem description:

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

Paul Starzetz discovered a flaw in return value checking in mremap() in the
Linux kernel versions 2.4.24 and previous that may allow a local attacker
to gain root privileges.  No exploit is currently available; however this
issue is exploitable. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0077 to this issue.

The Vicam USB driver in kernel versions prior to 2.4.25 does not use the
copy_from_user function to access userspace, which crosses security
boundaries.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0075 to this issue.

Arjan van de Ven discovered a flaw in ncp_lookup() in ncpfs that could
allow local privilege escalation.  ncpfs is only used to allow a system to
mount volumes of NetWare servers or print to NetWare printers.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0010 to this issue.

Alan Cox found issues in the R128 Direct Render Infrastructure that could
allow local privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0003 to this issue.

All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain
backported security patches that correct these issues.   

Red Hat would like to thank Paul Starzetz from ISEC for reporting the issue
CAN-2004-0077.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
