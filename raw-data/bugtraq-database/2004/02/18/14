Date:              2004-02-18
Affected versions: Trustix 2.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.

  A hole was discovered in the mremap.  Through this hole, it is possible
  for anyone with a local account on the system to gain root privileges.
  See CAN-2004-0077 for additional details.  This is not the same 
  vulnerability that was previously patched in TSL-2004-0001.

  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
