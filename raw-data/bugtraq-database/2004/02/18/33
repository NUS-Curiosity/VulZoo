According to a Matias Kvaternik at APC (US) today, the bug was discovered 
after the AP9606 was discontinued (we bought some less than one year ago), 
and the engineering team has "no fix in the pipeline". He advises us to 
switch off telnet access.

I would imagine most APC products are installed to last for a good three to 
six years - upgrading power hardware is probably about as practical as 
upgrading a load of networking equipment. I'm surprised, indeed disappointed, 
that APC doesn't appear to provide critical security fixes for these 
discontinued products; although I do only speak from very limited experience 
of APC.
