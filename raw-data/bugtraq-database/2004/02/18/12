Details

******* 


The problems exist due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. A remote attacker may exploit these issues to influence SQL query logic to disclose sensitive information that could be used to gain unauthorized access.

For example try this:

http://address/directory/shop.php?cat=[query]
http://address/directory/more.php?id=[query]
http://address/directory/lite/shop_by_brand.php?cat_manufacturer=[query]
http://address/directory/listing.php?id=[query]
