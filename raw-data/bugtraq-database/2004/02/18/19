[slackware-security]  Kernel security update  (SSA:2004-049-01)

New kernels are available for Slackware 9.1 and -current to fix
a bounds-checking problem in the kernel's mremap() call which
could be used by a local attacker to gain root privileges.
Please note that this is not the same issue as CAN-2003-0985
which was fixed in early January.

The kernels in Slackware 8.1 and 9.0 that were updated in
January are not vulnerable to this new issue because the patch
from Solar Designer that was used to fix the CAN-2003-0985 bugs
also happened to fix the problem that was discovered later.

Sites running Slackware 9.1 or -current should upgrade to a
new kernel.  After installing the new kernel, be sure to run
'lilo'.

More details about this issue may be found in the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:

Here are the details from the Slackware 9.1 ChangeLog:

patches/kernels/:  Recompiled to fix another bounds-checking error in
  the kernel mremap() code.  (this is not the same issue that was fixed

  the new kernel, be sure to run 'lilo'.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
+------------------------+

Use upgradepkg to install the new kernel package.
After installing the kernel-ide package you will need to run lilo ('lilo' at
a command prompt) or create a new system boot disk ('makebootdisk'), and
reboot.

If desired, a kernel from the kernels/ directory may be used instead.  For
example, to use the kernel in kernels/scsi.s/, you would copy it to the
boot directory like this:

cd kernels/scsi.s
cp bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-scsi.s-2.4.24

Create a symbolic link:
ln -sf /boot/vmlinuz-scsi.s-2.4.24 /boot/vmlinuz

Then, run 'lilo' or create a new system boot disk and reboot.
