Subject: bid: 9660 : Microsoft IIS Unspecified Remote Denial Of Service Vu
	lnerability



This is not an unspecified remote DoS.
This is related to the vulnerabilities discovered by EEYE.
The reason the exploit caused a DoS is because the OpenSSL
vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities discovered by EEYE overlap.
They both have a length integer overflow. I actually believe that
EEYE discovered their vulnerabilities right after the OpenSSL
vulnerabilities came out. They ran their PoC code against
IIS and discovered a DoS (just like this bid reports). Then they
dug a bit deeper and now we have those multiple MS ASN.1 vulnerabilities
that everybody is talking about. It was pretty much a no brainer for them.
