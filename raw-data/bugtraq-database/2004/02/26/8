    Release Date: 02/26/2004

          Author: bkbll <bkbll@...onker.net>

Overview: 

    The Serv-U is a ftp daemon runs on windows. Serv-U supports a ftp command "MDTM" for user changing 
file time . There is a  buffer overflow when a user logged in and send a malformed time zone as MDTM argument.
This can be remote exploit and gain SYSTEM privilege.

Exploit:

    When a user logged in, he can send this 
    MDTM 20031111111111+AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA /test.txt
    You must have a valid user account and password to exploit it, and you are not need WRITE or any other privilege.
And even the test.txt,which is the file you request, can not be there. :) 
    So you can put your shellcode as the filename.

     HUC is still alive.
