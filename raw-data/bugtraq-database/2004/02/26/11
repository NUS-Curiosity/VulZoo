Subject: Serv-U "MDTM" buffer overflow PoC DoS exploit


Hello Bugtraq,

I have written a PoC exploit for the MDTM command
buffer overflow found in Serv-U by bkbll.  This
exploit only crashes the Serv-U server, as releasing a
arbitrary code execution exploit when the vendor has
not yet supplied a patch/fix is not a good idea when
certain unruly people might get their hands on it. 
Here it is, test your systems, temporarily disable
Serv-U, and wait for the vendor to release a patch.


---START
/* serv-u-mdtm-expl.c - Serv-U "MDTM" buffer overflow
PoC DoS exploit.
 *
 * This program will send an overly large filename
parameter when calling
 * the Serv-U FTP MDTM command.  Although arbitrary
code execution is
 * possible upon successful execution of this
vulnerability, the vendor has
 * not yet released a patch, so releasing such an
exploit could be disastrous
 * in the hands of script kiddies.  I might release a
full exploit to the
 * public when a patch/fix is issued by the vendor of
Serv-U.  This PoC
 * exploit will simply crash the Serv-U server.
 *
 * This vulnerability was discovered by bkbll, you can
read his advisory on
 * the issue here:
<http://www.cnhonker.com/advisory/serv-u.mdtm.txt>
 *
 * This vulnerability requires a valid login and
password to exploit!  This
 * PoC does not check to see if you supplied a correct
login and password.
 *
 * I do not take responsibility for this code.

I hope you find this useful in some way...


Thank you for your time.
