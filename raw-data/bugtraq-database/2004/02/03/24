Subject: sqwebmail web login



platform:
linux 2.4 i386
pachages: qmail+sqwebmail+qmailadmin+vpopmail-vchkpw-auth. 

When user root try loggin in on the web on http://domain/cgi-bin/sqwebmail, 
if does it with right root password, sqwebmail gives an error "maildir 
doesn't exist or has incorrect ownership or permission". This, ONLY if you 
give right root password, if not, you have error "invalid user or password" 
(as any other wrong password, for any user).
I think this should be a good method for guessing root password, in fact 
failure logging in on the sqewebmail are not logged (generally!).
