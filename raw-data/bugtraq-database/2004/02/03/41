Delivery Status Notification (RFC 1894) has many disadvantages but IMHO it
is still better than Yet Another Idiosyncratic Ad-hoc Format.

Notifications, if they are sent at all, should always include at least the
headers of the original message.

(Anyway, people removing a piece of malware from their computer without
taking any steps to prevent future infections (at least reinfections by
the same kind of malware) *deserve* to be reinfected.)

Infected hosts should be blocked/disconnected immediately. A filter set up
several hours after the fact (I suppose any reasonable "grace period"
would have to be at least several hours long) is pointless because a
typical 21st century fast spreading worm has already had enough time to
attack everyone in its vicinity.
