This fix will not work for the version of libtool that is distributed
with SuSE Linux (checked on SuSE 8.2/9.0). SuSE modified the tempdir
creation to use mktemp if available. As a result the patch mentioned
above would break SuSE's libtool, so don't use it for your SuSE Linux!

Unfortunately, the changes made by SuSE don't fix the vulnerability
(they just make it a bit harder to exploit) so that it is still
necessary to apply a bugfix.
