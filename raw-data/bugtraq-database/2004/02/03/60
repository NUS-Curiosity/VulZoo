Despite what MS's notice says, presumably the primary motive for this 
was to avoid the URL spoofing detailed here 
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-004.asp). 
In fact, that webpage specifically states that it is to fix ``three 
newly-discovered vulnerabilities'' (``newly=discovered'' apparently 
being a relative term), including ``a misrepresentation of the URL in 
the address bar of an Internet Explorer window''.

So the security reasons they cite on the page you link to probably 
aren't that they consider that syntax to be insecure relative to cookies 
or ``Remember My Password'', but that the best way to avoid URL spoofing 
they could come up with (after, apparently, months of effort) was to 
eliminate the feature alltogether.

I can think of another great way to fix the vulnerabilities in Windows. 
It's called fdisk.

Hope that helps!
