NOT with FreeBSD 4.5, kernel GENERIC, sqwebmail 3.3.3, vpopmail 5.2

However, I think it's due to a misconfiguration. Root mailbox does NOT 
exist in default qmail installation: it's just an alias, not a real 
valid user. 

Mail for root is usually handled by the "alias" pseudo-user. 

And with vpopmail you must create such user by hand (or via qmailadmin).

Failures are logged by vpopmail. Check your configuration.
