Antivirus software MAY be configured to send notifications to local senders
and/or recipients, i.e. to domains which are handled by this server.
Antivirus filtering software SHOULD NOT be configured to send out
notifications to senders or recipients other than local, unless it
distinguishes between faked and real addresses.

I know many administrators who do not care of a few thousands antivirus
reports per day. No "warnings" are accepted. I would like to have some RFC
which disallows such behaviour, so I could send them all to RFC-ignorant BL.

It is unfair in relation to other languages. Many users do not read in
English, and Subject is supposed to be human-readable field. This
information could have standard form in other header.

It tends to be non-standard interface, which is very hard to find and use.
