There is no legitimate use of this syntax and never was. Although
RFC 2396 does specify a generic URI syntax allowing

  <user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>

it expressly excludes those URLs whose syntax is specified in RFC 1738:

RFC 1738 clearly says:

| An HTTP URL takes the form:
|
|      http://<host>:<port>/<path>?<searchpart>

So do RFCs 1945 and 2616.
