Subject: blocking gzip encoded files


It has recently come to my attention that most browsers happily
do Accept-encoding: gzip and streaming decompression of
HTML data received with Content-encoding: gzip
 without asking.

This has been in use since sometime in 1998.

Is there a way to configure the run-of-the-mill browser to
block these at the host level ?
