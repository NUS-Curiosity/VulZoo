Subject: RE: Windows XP explorer.exe heap overflow.


Looking at the source... everyone knows where and how..., this piece of code
could be part of the problem...

// read in the header
    if (!Read(&emh, sizeof(emh))) //<--- This will fill up all header
records 
       return;

    _xWid = emh.rclBounds.right - emh.rclBounds.left;
    _yHei = emh.rclBounds.bottom - emh.rclBounds.top;
    
    // Post WHKNOWN
    OnSize(_xWid, _yHei, _lTrans);

    // allocate a buffer to hold metafile
    ulSize = emh.nBytes;		//<---- This value could be any
arbitrary 							value
    pbBuf = (LPBYTE)MemAlloc(Mt(CImgTaskEmfBuf), ulSize);  //<-- Memory
//allocation size is referenced to that arbitrary value.
    if (!pbBuf)
        return;

    // copy the header into the buffer
    memcpy(pbBuf, &emh, sizeof(emh));   <--// Arbitrary buf size receiving
an 							//arbitrary size
header

    // read the metafile into memory after the header
    if (!Read(pbBuf + sizeof(emh), ulSize - sizeof(emh)))
        goto Cleanup;

Just supposed things...

Yep.  I suggested that on Vuln-Dev nearly four years ago [1], but I never
pursued it, and this is the first time since then that I've seen it come up.

In Outlook 2002 (aka Outlook XP, aka Outlook 10) and later, you can disable
the automatic display of any kind of non-text content by forcing Outlook to
render all email as plain text.  This is a huge improvement over normal
Outlook behavior; besides making Outlook much less dangerous, it spares you
annoying markup of all kinds.

Create the Registry key

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\10.0\Outlook\Options\Mail\READASPLAIN

as a DWORD and set it to 1.  Presto - no more HTML, no more RTF, no more
pictures.
