Subject: Apache-SSL security advisory - apache_1.3.28+ssl_1.52 and prior


Apache-SSL optional client certificate vulnerability
----------------------------------------------------

Synopsis
--------

If configured with SSLVerifyClient set to 1 or 3 (client certificates
optional) and SSLFakeBasicAuth, Apache-SSL 1.3.28+1.52 and all earlier
versions would permit a client to use real basic authentication to
forge a client certificate.

All the attacker needed is the "one-line DN" of a valid user, as used
by faked basic auth in Apache-SSL, and the fixed password ("password"
by default).

Fix
---

Install Apache-SSL 1.3.29+1.53 from the usual places (see
http://www.apache-ssl.org/).

Credits

This vulnerability was found and reported by Wietse Venema.

cheers,
Adam
