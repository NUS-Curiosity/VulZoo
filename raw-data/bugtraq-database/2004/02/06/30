Yes, I got this report as well and I agree with you that MyDoom.B was not 
able to spread widely at all. It looks like a mistake to me -- maybe they 
wanted to warn for MyDoom.A instead of MyDoomB.?

At the time of the writing, Trend Micro's online scanner HouseCall has 
found and cleaned more than 900.000 MyDoom.A-infected machines:

However, they only found 7 (seven) MyDoom.B infected PCs world-wide:

At least one av company has send out a wrong alert for MyDoom.B as well 
(they wanted to update their MyDoom.A advisory, but they mixed-up both 
worms descriptions).

A German news about this possible false alert can be found here:
