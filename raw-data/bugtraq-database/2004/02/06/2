Yes; everyone subscribed to the [Carnegie Mellon] CERT/CC list. It's
been swallowed by US-CERT:

http://www.cert.org/advisories/us-cert-announcement.html

however...

"significant changes to CERT Advisories that will not only maintain the
accuracy and fairness that are the hallmarks of CERT Advisories, but
will also provide more information about more topics than before"

and

"We will maintain the same high quality control standards, edit content
for security and privacy, and work to ensure technical accuracy as well
as timeliness."

Thank DoHS for that!
