Subject: OpenBSD IPv6 remote kernel crash


Georgi Guninski posted an advisory on his site about a remote crash in
the OpenBSD kernel caused by connecting with a small IPv6 MTU.

http://www.guninski.com/obsdmtu.html

The error was present in revision 1.81 of /src/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c
and is fixed in revision 1.82 ( 2004/02/04 08:47:41 ), you can see the
colored diffs at

http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/netinet6/ip6_output.c.diff
?r1=text&tr1=1.81&r2=text&tr2=1.82&f=h


OpenBSD administrators should pull the revised code from CVS and
recompile their kernels.
