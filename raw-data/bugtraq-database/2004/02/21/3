Way to go, you seem to be working very hard on making sure that our government
will regulate security research.

There are two kinds of security researchers, those that try to secure
people and those that try to exploit people - you are doing a great job
convincing Congress that we all belong in the last category.

> All these will culminate in yet another STENCH ! exploit sooner or
later.

Why don't you release your exploits on packetstormsecurity or astalavista
instead of Bugtraq? You obviously have no interest in trying to secure
anyone, instead you are deliberately hurting the security of us all.

How are you any different than a virus writer? They are creating malware
and releasing it on their sites, then they claim innocence because they
didn't click the "Send" button. Both of you are intentionally trying
to help blackhats, script kiddies and criminals.

Gigabyte just got arrested for doing this (http://www.techtv.com/news/securityalert/story/0,
24195,3621765,00.html), the only difference I can see is that you are
foolish enough to announce it in advance.
