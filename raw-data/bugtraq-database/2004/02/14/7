DallasCon Network Security Boot Camp- Come to Dallas 4-Days prior to DallasCon 2004 and take part in an intense 4-day hands-on training Boot Camp developed to teach you the ins and outs of securing your Web-Enabled Services and Wireless Networks. In today's world, hacking and cyber attacks are becoming more common as tools to achieve them are more available and easier to use by hackers. Once these tools are used, they can cause numerous problems and considerable damage to your network. Current network-level auditing tools and techniques are incapable of locating security flaws for web-enabled services and wireless networks. Attend the DallasCon Network Security Boot Camp and learn how to actively protect your networks, your business, and your assets- from an intruder's point of view!
