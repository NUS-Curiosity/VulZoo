Subject: RE: Windows2000 who relase the code?


Not to point out the obvious, but we're talking about the source for Win2000
.. so "really old" is actually a noop and the date of the file is accurate
for the tree.  Besides, if 2.5 years is "really old", I must be ancient. ;-)

Kind Regards,

Hi

 if someone have the code and take a look on this file.
./private/security/msv_sspi/core
( its not source code or part of windows , so not ilegal)

gdb -c ./private/security/msv_sspi/core
Core was generated by `vi nlmain.c'.

The file is realy old: Aug  3  2001
