As an answer to the question "Are you sure that you want to... bla,bla ...as 
this may reveal sensitive information?", 99% of the users will click "Yes" as 
they always do.

Even if the question is phrased "...do you wish to abort this action?", most 
users will simply try a few times by clicking "yes" and finally actually read 
the question and the warning before clicking "no".

The problem is that most people do not cultivate the high-grade paranoia that 
most readers of Bugtraq do, and that is what makes security so difficult to 
implement, especially if security is to be retrofitted to a protocol or 
product. People make the choices that is most convenient to their daily use; 
allow everything, don't upgrade, don't patch.

In fact, most people don't even know why they should patch. I've even heard 
the urban legend that running Microsoft Update is dangerous as your computer 
may get infected by computer viruses that way.
