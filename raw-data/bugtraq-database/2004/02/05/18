Keywords:          xss

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated mailman packages that close various cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Mailman is a mailing list manager.

Dirk Mueller discovered a cross-site scripting bug in the admin interface
in versions of Mailman 2.1 before 2.1.4.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0965 to
this issue.

A cross-site scripting bug in the 'create' CGI script affects versions of
Mailman 2.1 before 2.1.3.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0992 to this issue.

Users of Mailman are advised to upgrade to the erratum packages, which
include backported security fixes and are not vulnerable to these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/mailman-2.1.1-5.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/mailman-2.1.1-5.i386.rpm



6. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

40acda00aa52b23dbb068cd0bf48d898 9/en/os/SRPMS/mailman-2.1.1-5.src.rpm
6efb83ea4e0658457ca3dd883f4d533d 9/en/os/i386/mailman-2.1.1-5.i386.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
