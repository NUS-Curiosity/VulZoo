Synopsis:          Updated NetPBM packages fix multiple temporary file vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:030-01
Issue date:        2004-02-05
Updated on:        2004-02-05
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          symlink tmpfile tmp

Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0924
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated NetPBM packages are available that fix a number of temporary file
vulnerabilities in the netpbm libraries.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The netpbm package contains a library of functions that support
programs for handling various graphics file formats, including .pbm
(portable bitmaps), .pgm (portable graymaps), .pnm (portable anymaps),
.ppm (portable pixmaps), and others.

A number of temporary file bugs have been found in versions of NetPBM. 
These could allow a local user the ability to overwrite or create files as
a different user who happens to run one of the the vulnerable utilities. 
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2003-0924 to this issue.


Users are advised to upgrade to the erratum packages, which contain patches
from Debian that correct these bugs.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
