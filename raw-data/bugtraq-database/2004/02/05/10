I reported this some time ago, and was not just about rule 2077 failing, 
but about all rules having the same problem. I search a little more and 
sent a couple of mails to the snort-inline list and finally found 
(thanks to Pieter Claassen) that the problem was that I set stream4 
preprocessor in the config file but that preprocessor is currently not 
supported by snort-inline.

When I commented the lines about stream4 the problem disappeared.
