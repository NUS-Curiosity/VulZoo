I don't acknowledge this.

I tested this with Windows XPsp1 running IE 6.0.2800 with latest
patches.  Running on the latest build of Apache server on the same box.

IE knew the difference between 'web-inf..' And 'web-inf.' and
'web-inf...' (so did apache).  Matter of a fact creating separate pages
with these names resulted in separate loading.

Perhaps your 'claim' can be further substatiated by what 'you' are doing
to IE to cause this.
