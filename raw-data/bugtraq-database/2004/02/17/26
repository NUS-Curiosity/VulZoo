It seems that Beagle variant B is spreading on the internet folks.

It hit our company mailservers today. It seems like its creating port
8866.

Does anyone know if there is a known exploit code using that specific
port?

Any additional details, anyone that might have regarding this warm besides
whats on the Antivirus websites would be very informative.

Thanks
