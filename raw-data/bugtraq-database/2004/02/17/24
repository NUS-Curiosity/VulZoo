Subject: Re: ASN.1 telephony critical infrastructure warning - VOIP



I would say that this is somewhat misleading. First of all not all VoIP 
services use ASN.1 encoding for the protocol. While H.323 does SIP does 
not.

Additionally I suspect that not many of the carrier deployment of H.323 
are using the MS ASN.1 libs as most of them are unix based (many of 
them will be running SPARC/Solaris).

Now that being said if companies are allowing VoIP to the desktop for 
services like netmeeting there could be problems.
