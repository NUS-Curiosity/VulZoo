I note that this code also ocurs in Xvnc,
and that ReadFontAlias is essentially unchanged in XFree86 CVS since 
version 1.1, which has the CVS id string
/* $XConsortium: dirfile.c,v 1.11 94/04/17 20:17:01 gildea Exp $ */

I would expect that X servers from many vendors have the same 
vunerablility.
