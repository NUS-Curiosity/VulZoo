Yes and no. At least on my W2K box here it seems to work only for one
and two additional dots on the cmd commandline, but not three. (Just
to be picky. :-)

Another (some kind of obvious) way to exploit the two-dot directory
"feature" of Windows under Apache is to bypass <Location ...> based
restrictions on directories.

e.g. if you have a directory foo in your DocumentRoot and restrict
access by

<Location "/foo/">
  Order deny,allow
  Deny from all
</Location>

you can easily access it by requesting http://host/foo../ instead of
http://host/foo/, which results in a 403 Forbidden. (It must be a real
directory to work, aliasses won't do the trick.)

Of course you usually won't lock up directories with <Location ...>,
but a there other cases, where you would use <Location ...> in favor
of <Directory ...> or <Files ...>.

            Kind regards, Axel Beckert
