Now which should I believe here:

1) Your proof of why it's not possibly exploitable when you yourself admit you don't
understand it?

2) The possibility that some clever black hat fully understands the challenges
and has found a way around it? (Say, wasn't there another exploit a while ago
that managed to work around that "exception handlers don't use the heap"
problem?)
