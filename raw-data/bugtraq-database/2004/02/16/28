I asked my TAM this very question. Microsoft's response was "This is under
investigation by PSS security. If it is affected, per our support policy, a
patch should be issued. More to come..."  So if there is a problem then
expect a patch. Remember that the Windows 98 support was extended a few
years so it no longer expired last month. I was rather pleased with
Microsoft that they were actively looking in to this, and that a patch would
come if it was needed.
