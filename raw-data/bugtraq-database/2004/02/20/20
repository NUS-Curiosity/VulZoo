Subject: Re: SNMP community string disclosure in Linksys WAP55AG


Simply requiring a valid read-only community string to obtain a read-write
string is not sufficient enough protection.

It is possible to expose a read-only community string through a packet
broadcast on an unpopulated arp table on a switch, thus expose the entire unit
to attack. The owner may not even wish to update any data via SNMP, but simply
walking the table with a read-only string will allow any attacker to do so.

Can anyone confirm if the strings are writable via the read-write community
string? If an attacker was able to change the configuration and then lock-out
the remote administration capabilities it would create quite a nuisance,
especially if the access point is in a remote location.
