			SCO Security Advisory

Subject:		OpenLinux: Fetchmail 6.2.4 and earlier remote dennial of service 
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2004-004.0
Issue date: 		2004 February 19
Cross reference:	sr886097 fz528427 erg712468 CAN-2003-0792
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	Fetchmail 6.2.4 and earlier does not properly allocate memory for
	long lines, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
	service (crash) via a certain email. 

	Fetchmail is a full-featured, robust, well-documented remote-mail 
	retrieval and forwarding utility intended to be used over on-
	demand TCP/IP links (such as SLIP or PPP connections). It supports 
	every remote-mail protocol now in use on the Internet: POP2, POP3, 
	RPOP, APOP, KPOP, all flavors of IMAP, ETRN, and ODMR. It can even 
	support IPv6 and IPSEC. 

	Fetchmail retrieves mail from remote mail servers and forwards it 
	via SMTP, so it can then be read by normal mail user agents such as 
	mutt, elm(1) or BSD Mail. It allows all your system MTA's filtering, 
	forwarding, and aliasing facilities to work just as they would on 
	normal mail. 

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has 
	assigned the name CAN-2003-0792 to this issue.


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Package
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	OpenLinux 3.1.1 Server		prior to fetchmail-6.2.5-1.i386.rpm
					prior to fetchmailconf-6.2.5-1.i386.rpm

	OpenLinux 3.1.1 Workstation	prior to fetchmail-6.2.5-1.i386.rpm
					prior to fetchmailconf-6.2.5-1.i386.rpm


3. Solution

	The proper solution is to install the latest packages. Many
	customers find it easier to use the Caldera System Updater, called
	cupdate (or kcupdate under the KDE environment), to update these
	packages rather than downloading and installing them by hand.
