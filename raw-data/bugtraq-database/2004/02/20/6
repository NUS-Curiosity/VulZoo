			SCO Security Advisory

Subject:		OpenLinux: Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the saned daemon
Advisory number: 	CSSA-2004-005.0
Issue date: 		2004 February 19
Cross reference:	sr886093 fz528425 erg712466 CAN-2003-0773 CAN-2003-0774 CAN-2003-0775 CAN-2003-0776 CAN-2003-0777 CAN-2003-0778
______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

	CAN-2003-0773 saned in sane-backends 1.0.7 and earlier does
	not check the IP address of the connecting host during the
	SANE_NET_INIT RPC call, which allows remote attackers to use that
	call even if they are restricted in saned.conf. 
	
	CAN-2003-0774 saned in sane-backends 1.0.7 and earlier does not quickly
	handle connection drops, which allows remote attackers to
	cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) when invalid
	memory is accessed. 

	CAN-2003-0775 saned in sane-backends 1.0.7
	and earlier calls malloc with an arbitrary size value if a
	connection is dropped before the size value has been sent, which
	allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
	consumption or crash). 

	CAN-2003-0776 saned in sane-backends
	1.0.7 and earlier does not properly "check the validity of
	the RPC numbers it gets before getting the parameters," with
	unknown consequences. 

	CAN-2003-0777 saned in sane-backends 1.0.7
	and earlier, when debug messages are enabled, does not properly
	handle dropped connections, which can prevent strings from being
	null terminated and cause a denial of service (segmentation
	fault). 

	CAN-2003-0778 saned in sane-backends 1.0.7 and earlier,
	and possibly later versions, does not properly allocate memory
	in certain cases, which could allow attackers to cause a denial
	of service (memory consumption).


2. Vulnerable Supported Versions

	System				Package
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	OpenLinux 3.1.1 Server		prior to sane-1.0.13-1.i386.rpm
					prior to sane-devel-1.0.13-1.i386.rpm

	OpenLinux 3.1.1 Workstation	prior to sane-1.0.13-1.i386.rpm
					prior to sane-devel-1.0.13-1.i386.rpm


3. Solution

	The proper solution is to install the latest packages. Many
	customers find it easier to use the Caldera System Updater, called
	cupdate (or kcupdate under the KDE environment), to update these
	packages rather than downloading and installing them by hand.
