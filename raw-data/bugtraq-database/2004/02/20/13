Subject: Hotfix for new mremap vulnerability


Greetings,

	Here (http://wizard.ath.cx/fixmremap2.tar.gz) is small hotfix for newly
discovered mremap() vulnerability. It
doesn't directly change do_mremap() code, it just overwrites syscall
handler with LKM. In my opinion it is enough to fix just mremap() syscall because at
least on x86 there are no other functions which would use do_mremap
directly. But this may not be true on others platforms (for example
ia64)...

The package contains the hotfix and a small proof of concept program which
can be used to see if kernel is vulnerable.

Use at your own risk.

Pavel Palát
