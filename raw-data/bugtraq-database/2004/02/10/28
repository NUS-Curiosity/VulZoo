that's not exactly true; yes, many people don't use resync, but..

char *share_start(Function *global_funcs)
{
....................
   add_hook(HOOK_SHAREIN, (Function) sharein_mod);
   add_hook(HOOK_MINUTELY, (Function) check_expired_tbufs);
^^^^^^^^^
   add_hook(HOOK_READ_USERFILE, (Function) hook_read_userfile);
....................
}

the function, however, is called minutely, so the bug exists also if resync 
is disabled.
As in previous mail has been already said, check_expired_tbufs() first 
check for timed out resync buffers, then, "accomplish to handle userfile 
requests in limbo (that haven't received yet any response from tandem bot)".

>Where did you notify eggheads? I seem to be blind while looking for it.

We've notified you at bugs@...heads.org; in a private e-mail i''ve sent to 
you the response we received.


With respect,
