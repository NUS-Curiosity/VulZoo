Here is my homemade version of an ebuild for the snapshot of yesterday:
http://www.final-frontier.ath.cx/ebuilds/clamav-0.66_pre20040209.ebuild
You also need the following patch, put it in the files directory:
http://www.final-frontier.ath.cx/ebuilds/clamav-0.66_pre20040209.diff

I'm using it since yesterday and it works just fine. If clamd refuses to start
after upgrading wait until freshclam has refreshed your virus-dbs and then
restart clamd.
