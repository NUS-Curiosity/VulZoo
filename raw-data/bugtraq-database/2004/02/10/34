Subject: RE: EEYE: Microsoft ASN.1 Library Length Overflow Heap Corruption


This attack can be performed through various encryption systems such as
Kerberos and almost anything using CERTs... I am not sure about
Microsofts wording in their advisory.

| In the security bulletin published by MS it states, "In the 
| most likely exploitable scenario, an attacker would have to 
| have direct access to the user's network."
| 
| The bulletin published by eEye states "...applications that 
| make use of certificates (SSL, digitally-signed e-mail, 
| signed ActiveX controls, etc.) [are affected]".
| 
| I see a big disconnect there. Can you address this?
| Also, how would this potentially affect sites that are using 
| an MS VPN solution?
