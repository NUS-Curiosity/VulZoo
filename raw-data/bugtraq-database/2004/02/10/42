Multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft ASN.1 Library

   Original issue date: February 10, 2004
   Last revised: --
   Source: US-CERT

   A complete revision history is at the end of this document.

Systems Affected

     * Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
     * Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 TSE
     * Microsoft Windows 2000
     * Microsoft Windows XP
     * Microsoft Windows Server 2003

Overview

   Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Windows
   ASN.1 parser library could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
   to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

Description

   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-007 announces a patch for multiple
   vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Windows ASN.1 library
   (msasn1.dll).  According to information from eEye Digital Security,
   the vulnerabilities involve integer overflows and other flaws in
   integer arithmetic. The latest version of this document can be
   found at

   <http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA04-041A.html>

   Additional information is available in two vulnerability notes:

   VU#216324 - Microsoft ASN.1 Library improperly decodes malformed ASN.1
   length values
   (Other resources: AD20040210, MS04-007, CAN-2003-0818) 

   VU#583108 - Microsoft ASN.1 Library improperly decodes constructed bit
   strings
   (Other resources: AD20040210-2, MS04-007, CAN-2003-0818) 

   eEye has published two detailed advisories on these issues: AD20040210
   and AD20040210-2.

   Any application that loads the ASN.1 library could serve as an attack
   vector. In particular, ASN.1 is used by a number of cryptographic and
   authentication services such as digital certificates (x.509),
   Kerberos, NTLMv2, SSL,and TLS. Both client and server systems are
   affected. The Local Security Authority Subsystem (lsass.exe) and a
   component of the CryptoAPI (crypt32.dll) use the vulnerable ASN.1
   library.

Impact

   An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with
   the privileges of the process using the ASN.1 library. In the case of
   most server and authentication applications, an attacker could gain
   SYSTEM privileges.

Solution

Apply a patch

   Apply the appropriate patch as specified by Microsoft Security
   Bulletin MS04-007.
