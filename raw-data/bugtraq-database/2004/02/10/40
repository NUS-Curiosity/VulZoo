Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-007 >>>>>>> it`s not Microsoft.
         Print
ASN.1 Vulnerability Could Allow Code Execution (828028)

Issued: February 10, 2004 >>>>>> this is not last week .
Version Number: 1.0
Summary   >>>>> all is good

    Who should read this document: Customers who are using Microsoft®
    Windows®

    Impact of vulnerability: Remote Code Execution

    Maximum Severity Rating: Critical

    Recommendation: Systems administrators should apply the update
    immediately.

    Security Update Replacement: None

    Caveats: Windows NT 4.0 (Workstation, Server, and Terminal Server
    Edition) does not install the affected file by default. This file
    is installed as part of the MS03-041 Windows NT 4.0 security update
    and other possible non-security-related hotfixes. If the Windows NT 4.0
     security update for MS03-041 is not installed, this may not be a
     required update. To verify if the affected file is installed,
     search for the file named Msasn1.dll. If this file is present,
     this security update is required. Windows Update, Software Update
      Services, and the Microsoft Security Baseline Analyzer will also
      correctly detect if this update is required.
