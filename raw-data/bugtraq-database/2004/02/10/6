Utter nonsense. Legacy software has to be recompiled to use the new CPU 
instruction set. A new CPU architecture is vastly *more* intrusive than 
a new compiler.

As Theo said, the AMD buffer overflow "protection" is nothing more than 
sensible separation of R and X bits per page, fixing a glaring and 
anomalous defect in the original 386 MMU. Many CPUs before and since had 
this feature, and it was just Intel slop in the early 1980s that 
developed an MMU (and associated instruction set) that mistakenly 
treated R and X per page as one bit.
