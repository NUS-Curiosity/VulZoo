Subject: RE: EEYE: Microsoft ASN.1 Library Length Overflow Heap Corruption


In the security bulletin published by MS it states,
"In the most likely exploitable scenario, an attacker
would have to have direct access to the user's
network."

The bulletin published by eEye states "...applications
that make use of certificates (SSL, digitally-signed
e-mail, signed ActiveX controls, etc.) [are
affected]".

I see a big disconnect there. Can you address this?
Also, how would this potentially affect sites that are
using an MS VPN solution?
