Filtering at the backbone level is contraditory to 3.3, as the provider
would have already sent the data out their Global ( or even National )
Peer so they're already paying for the increased data on the pipes. Also,
the feat of filtering every packet, MD5'ing it, and dropping it would be
an engineering marvel. (De-capsulation and re-encapsulation alone would
require vasts amounts of processing power for that much data. ) Not to
mention the end user resubmitting his request once he realizes that the
recipient never got the message the first time.

There ARE ISP/provider level AV/Filtering products out that alleviate most
of the sources of unwanted incoming and outgoing mail traffic. Of course,
purchasing and implementation is up to the provider...
