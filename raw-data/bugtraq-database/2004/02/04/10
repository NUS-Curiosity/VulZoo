Or, hey, a different on-screen representation? Something like, I dunno,
"http://user:pass@...e/" being turned into "http://site/ (user: user,
password: pass)"?

If you're worried about anything *other* than either the URL bar or the
status bar (like, for instance, the descriptive text of the link),
you're out of luck anyways. People who would still fall for that will
also fall for <a
href="http://www.please-crack-me.ru">http://www.microsoft.com</a>

Seriously, KISS. ("Keep It Simple, Stupid" for those who either aren't
familiar with the jargon or aren't native English speakers ;)
