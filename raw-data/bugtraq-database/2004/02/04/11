Subject: RE: MS to stop allowing passwords in URLs (Summary)


Here's a summary of the responses I've received.

1) RFC2616 does not define the user:password@...t scheme specifically
for HTTP URL's. Though its use has been supported in most if not all
popular browsers until now.
2) Other RFC's do define this scheme in general with the caveat that
using this syntax can be a security risk (RFC2396).
3) The behavior can be disabled by setting appropriate registry keys
(irrelevant to most users).
4) Disabling this syntax will possibly help protect the less
technologically savvy from phishing scams.

Points well taken.

However:
  * If it was up to me, I would have simply fixed IE so that the full
URL is displayed correctly for good or bad. 
  * The phishing scams will continue regardless of this change. The
biggest security hole sits between the keyboard and chair.
  * Using "Remember my password" as a work-around is NOT good security.
  * Using cookies for authentication is problematic. Many people turn
them off and you can't cross domains with them (well you aren't supposed
to be able to).

In general, most responders (on and off the list) agree that this change
will break some apps, but that it is still a good idea.
