Considering that virus scanners still operate using signatures,
it seems logical to include a flag for each specific virus so that
when it is recognized the virus software knows that they shouldn't
bother me.

(A, and yes, it is a lot of fun that those virus scanner vendors sell
*localized* versions of their software so I've now had them tell me in
more languages and character sets than I care to remember how bloody
incompetent they are.)
