Personally, I think it's a reasonable step - these spoofed URLs are a big 
problem for many people.

You can disable the functionality in IE if you wish (the above link has 
details)

I think I'd prefer it if you could override it on a site by site basis (eg 
using the 'trusted sites' functions, or by having the username:password@url 
in your IE 'favourites')

(Although, having said that, having spammers use http://username@url is 
quite a good trigger to put in email anti-spam rules, as I've never seen 
anyone use that format in an email link legitimately..)
