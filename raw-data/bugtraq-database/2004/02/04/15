I gather it never occurred to you to contact PowerBASIC or even to follow up with Mr. Slater. Thank you so much. If I hadn't run across this case on an unrelated web search, PowerBASIC might never have heard of the problem.

Urlcount.cgi was based on the PowerBASIC sample program, EZCount, which is purely introductory in nature: "hello, world!"-type code, not designed or intended for practical use. But, it's a perfectly good idea to put safety first, and we'll have an update out shortly.
