Subject: RE: Second critical mremap() bug found in all Linux kernels


The mremap() fix in the diff file for the 2.4.24-ow1 kernel patch dates
from January 8, 2004 (
http://www.openwall.com/linux/linux-2.4.24-ow1.tar.gz ).

The exact same code fix in the 2.4.23-ow2 kernel patch dates from
December 18, 2003 (
http://www.openwall.com/linux/linux-2.4.23-ow2.tar.gz ).

Kudos to OpenWall Project for discovering this last year, if they had
realized the implications of this bug they would probably have notified
the kernel developers back then. Perhaps it would be wise for the kernel
developers to look at what other potential issues OWP are proactively
protecting against.

I think it's worth noting that those who have been using either the
2.4.23-ow2 or the 2.4.24-ow1 kernel patches from the Openwall Project
are not vulnerable to this latest mremap() bug.
