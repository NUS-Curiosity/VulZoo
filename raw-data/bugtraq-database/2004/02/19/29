1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    Another bug in the Kernel's do_mremap() function, which is unrelated to
    the bug fixed in SuSE-SA:2004:001, was found by Paul Starzetz.
    The do_mremap() function of the Linux Kernel is used to manage
    Virtual Memory Areas (VMAs) which includes moving, removing and
    resizing of memory areas.  To remove old memory areas do_mremap()
    uses the function du_munmap() without checking the return value.
    By forcing do_munmap() to return an error the memory management of
    a process can be tricked into moving page table entries from one VMA
    to another. The destination VMA may be protected by a different ACL
    which enables a local attacker to gain write access to previous read-only
    pages.
    The result will be local root access to the system.

    Additionally to the bug mentioned above some other bugs were fixed
    (depending on architecture) that can cause local denial-of-service
    conditions:
        - Vicam USB driver: CAN-2004-0075
                + denial-of-service due to problem while
                  copying data from user to kernel space
        - Direct Render Infrastructure: CAN-2004-0003
                + denial-of-service due to integer overflow
                + needs r128 card and console to be exploited
        - ncpfs/ncp_lookup: CAN-2004-0010
                + buffer overflow with the probability to
                  gain root
        - execve():
                + malformed elf binaries can lead to a local
                  denial-of-service attack



    SPECIAL INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
    ==============================
    The following paragraphs will guide you through the installation
    process in a step-by-step fashion. The character sequence "****"
    marks the beginning of a new paragraph. In some cases, you decide
    if the paragraph is needed for you or not. Please read through all
    of the steps down to the end. All of the commands that need to be
    executed are required to be run as the superuser (root). Each step
    relies on the steps before to complete successfully.


  **** Step 1: Determine the needed kernel type

    Please use the following command to find the kernel type that is
    installed on your system:

      rpm -qf /boot/vmlinuz

    The following options are possible (disregarding the version and build
    number following the name, separated by the "-" character):

      k_deflt   # default kernel, good for most systems.
      k_i386    # ke for older processors and chipsets
      k_athlon  # kernel made specifically for AMD Athlon(tm) family processors
      k_psmp    # kernel for Pentium-I dual processor systems
      k_smp     # kernel for SMP systems (Pentium-II and above)
      k_smp4G   # kernel for SMP systems which supports a maximum of 4G of RAM

  **** Step 2: Download the package for your system

    Please download the kernel RPM package for your distribution with the
    name starting as indicated by Step 1. The list of all kernel rpm
    packages is appended below. Note: The kernel-source package does not
    contain any binary kernel in bootable form. Instead, it contains the
    sources that the binary kernel rpm packages are made from. It can be
    used by administrators who have decided to build their own kernel.
    Since the kernel-source.rpm is an installable (compiled) package that
    contains sources for the linux kernel, it is not the source RPM for
    the kernel RPM binary packages.

    The kernel RPM binary packages for the distributions can be found at these
    locations below ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/update/.

      8.0/images/
      8.1/rpm/i586
      8.2/rpm/i586
      9.0/rpm/i586

    After downloading the kernel RPM package for your system, you should
    verify the authenticity of the kernel rpm package using the methods as
    listed in section 3) of each SUSE Security Announcement.


  **** Step 3: Installing your kernel rpm package

    Install the rpm package that you have downloaded in Steps 3 or 4 with
    the command
        rpm -Uhv --nodeps --force <K_FILE.RPM>
    where <K_FILE.RPM> is the name of the rpm package that you downloaded.

    Warning: After performing this step, your system will likely not be
             able to boot if the following steps have not been fully
             applied.


    If you run SUSE LINUX 8.1 and haven't applied the previous
    kernel update (SUSE-SA:2003:034), AND use the freeswan package,
    you also need to update the freeswan rpm as a dependency as offered
    by YOU (Yast Online Update). The package can be downloaded from
    ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/update/8.1/rpm/i586/

  **** Step 4: configuring and creating the initrd

    The initrd is a ramdisk that is being loaded into the memory of your
    system together with the kernel boot image by the bootloader. The
    kernel uses the content of this ramdisk to execute commands that must
    be run before the kernel can mount its actual root filesystem. It is
    usually used to initialize scsi drivers or NIC drivers for diskless
    operation.

    The variable INITRD_MODULES in /etc/sysconfig/kernel determines
    which kernel modules will be loaded in the initrd before the kernel
    has mounted its actual root filesystem. The variable should contain
    your scsi adapter (if any) or filesystem driver modules.

    With the installation of the new kernel, the initrd has to be
    re-packed with the update kernel modules. Please run the command

      mk_initrd

    as root to create a new init ramdisk (initrd) for your system.
    On SuSE Linux 8.1 and later, this is done automatically when the
    RPM is installed.


  **** Step 5: bootloader

    If you have a 7.x system, you must now run the command

      lilo

    as root to initialize the lilo bootloader for your system. Then
    proceed to the next step.

    If you run a SUSE LINUX 8.x or a SLES8 system, there are two options:
    Depending on your software configuration, you have the lilo bootloader
    or the grub bootloader installed and initialized on your system.
    The grub bootloader does not require any further actions to be
    performed after the new kernel images have been moved in place by the
    rpm Update command.
    If you have a lilo bootloader installed and initialized, then the lilo
    program must be run as root. Use the command

      grep LOADER_TYPE /etc/sysconfig/bootloader

    to find out which boot loader is configured. If it is lilo, then you
    must run the lilo command as root. If grub is listed, then your system
    does not require any bootloader initialization.

    Warning: An improperly installed bootloader may render your system
             unbootable.

  **** Step 6: reboot

    If all of the steps above have been successfully applied to your
    system, then the new kernel including the kernel modules and the
    initrd should be ready to boot. The system needs to be rebooted for
    the changes to become active. Please make sure that all steps are
    complete, then reboot using the command
        shutdown -r now
    or
        init 6

    Your system should now shut down and reboot with the new kernel.


    Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
    are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

    There is no workaround known.

    Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
    integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
    Then, to apply the update use the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm".
    Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
    are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

    Due to unfinished functional evaluation testing the 8.0 kernel will be
    released within the next few days.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SUSE Distributions and Workarounds:

    - netpbm
    Some tools in the netpbm suite create files in an insecure manner
    that can lead to local privilege escalation.
    New packages are available on our FTP servers.

    - zebra
    Local users can send malicious netlink messages that cause
    denial-of-service conditions in zebra.
    New packages are available on our FTP servers.

    - susehelp
    The susehelp package for SuSE Linux 9.0 contained CGI scripts which
    allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as wwwrun user.
    Additionally, certain ACL entries have been added to deny execution
    of the susehelp CGI scripts from remote.
    If you update your susehelp package manually, you have to invoke
    the SuSEconfig command as root afterwards. You also have to restart
    the HTTP server for the new ACLs to take effect.
    New packages are available on our FTP servers.

    - mod_gzip (apache-contrib)
    The apache module mod_gzip is vulnerable to remote code execution
    while running in debug-mode. We do not ship this module in debug-mode
    but future versions will include the fix.
    Additionally the mod_gzip code was audited to fix more possibly security
    related bugs.
    New packages are available on our FTP servers.

    - mod_auth_shadow (apache-contrib)
    This apache module ignores account expiration dates.
    The update will be released together with mod_gzip.
    New packages are available on our FTP servers.

    - mod_python
    A remote denial-of-service attack can be triggered against the Apache
    web server by sending a specific query string that is processed by
    mod_python.
    New packages will be available soon.

    - mutt
    The popular email client mutt is vulnerable to a remote denial-of-service
    attack and maybe remote command execution. The bug can be triggered by
    malformed messages that overflow an internal buffer.
    New packages will be available soon.

    - mailman
    A remote denial-of-service attack can be triggered in mailman 2.0.x
    (CAN-2003-0991).
    New packages will be available soon.

    - clamav
    A remote denial-of-service attack can be triggered in the anti-virus
    scanner.
    New packages will be available soon.

    - XFree86/xf86
    Several buffer overflows in the font-alias handling code can lead to
    local root access. Packages are built and are being tested at the moment.

    - libxml2
    Two buffer overflows in the URI code can lead to remote system compromise.
    New packages will be available soon.

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SUSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SUSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@...e.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the 
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing 
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all 
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course, 
       package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory 
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SUSE in rpm packages for SUSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SUSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@...e.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .
