   series, ONS 15500 series extended service platform, ONS 15302, ONS 15305,
   ONS 15200 series metro DWDM systems, and the ONS 15190 series IP transport
   concentrator.

   Cisco ONS 15327 hardware running ONS Release 1.x(x) and 3.x(x) and Cisco
   ONS 15454 hardware running ONS Releases 2.x(x) and 3.x(x) are not affected
   by these vulnerabilities.

   No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
   vulnerabilities.

   CTC management software.

Details

   The affected Cisco ONS 15327, ONS 15454, ONS 15454 SDH, and ONS 15600
   hardware is managed through the XTC, TCC+/TCC2, TCCi/TCC2, and TSC control
   cards respectively. These control cards are usually connected to a network
   isolated from the Internet and local to the customer's environment. This
   limits the exposure to the exploitation of the vulnerabilities from the
   Internet.

     * CSCec17308/CSCec19124(tftp)

       The TFTP service on UDP port 69 is enabled by default to allow both
       GET and PUT commands to be executed without any authentication. Using
       a TFTP client, it is possible to connect to the optical device and
       upload or retrieve ONS system files on the current active TCC in the
       /flash0 or /flash1 directories. It is not possible to upload or
       retrieve any user data files.

       Cisco bug ID CSCec17308 documents the issue on the Cisco ONS 15327,
       ONS 15454 and ONS 15454 SDH, and Cisco bug ID CSCec19124 documents the
       issue on the Cisco ONS 15600 hardware.

     * CSCec17406(port 1080)

       The Cisco ONS 15327, ONS 15454 and ONS 15454 SDH hardware is
       susceptible to an ACK Denial of Service (DoS) attack on TCP port 1080.
       TCP port 1080 is used by network management applications to
       communicate with the controller card. The controller card on the
       optical device will reset under such an attack.

       An ACK DoS attack is conducted by not sending the final ACK required
       for a 3-way TCP handshake to complete, and instead sending an invalid
       response to move the connection to an invalid TCP state.

       The Cisco ONS 15600 Multiservice Switching Platform is not affected by
       this vulnerability.

     * CSCec66884/CSCec71157(SU access)

       Telnet access to the underlying VxWorks operating system, by default,
       is restricted to Superusers only. Due to this vulnerability, a
       superuser whose account is locked out, disabled, or suspended is still
       able to login (Telnet) into the VxWorks shell, using their previously
       configured password.

       Cisco bug ID CSCec66884 documents the issue on the Cisco ONS 15327,
       ONS 15454 and ONS 15454 SDH, and Cisco bug ID CSCec71157 documents the
       issue on the Cisco ONS 15600 hardware.

   The Internetworking Terms and Cisco Systems Acronyms online guides can be
   found at http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ .

   These vulnerabilities are documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit (registered
   customers only) as Cisco bug IDs CSCec17308/CSCec19124(tftp),
   CSCec17406(port 1080), and CSCec66884/CSCec71157(SU access). To access
   this tool, you must be a registered user and you must be logged in.

Impact

     * CSCec17308/CSCec19124(tftp) -- This vulnerability could be exploited
       to launch a DoS attack on the optical device if corrupt ONS system
       files were to be uploaded to the controller card.

     * CSCec17406(port 1080) -- This vulnerability could be exploited to
       launch a DoS attack on the optical device.

       The timing for the data channels traversing the switch is provided by
       the control cards.

       On the Cisco ONS 15454, ONS 15327, and ONS 15454 SDH hardware,
       whenever both the active and standby control cards are rebooting at
       the same time, the synchronous data channels traversing the switch
       drop traffic until the card reboots. Asynchronous data channels
       traversing the switch are not impacted. Manageability functions
       provided by the network element using the TCC+/TCC2, XTC, and
       TCCi/TCC2 control cards are not available until the control card
       reboots.

       On the Cisco ONS 15600 hardware, whenever both the active and standby
       control cards are rebooting at the same time, there is no impact to
       the data channels traversing the switch because the TSC does a
       software reset which does not impact the timing being provided by the
       TSC for the data channels.

       Manageability functions provided by the network element through the
       TSC control cards are not available until the control card reboots.

     * CSCec66884/CSCec71157(SU access) -- This vulnerability could be
       exploited to gain unauthorized access to the optical device.

Obtaining Fixed Software

   Cisco is offering free software upgrades to address this vulnerability for
   all affected customers.

   Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets they
   have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or otherwise using
   such software upgrades, Customers agree to be bound by the terms of
   Cisco's software license terms found at
   http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html , or as otherwise set
   forth at the Cisco Connection Online Software Center at
   http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml .

   Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
   regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
   should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
   website at http://www.cisco.com/tacpage/sw-center/sw-optical.shtml . To
   access the software download URL, you must be a registered user and you
   must be logged in.

   Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior or
   existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as Cisco
   Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact that
   support organization for assistance with obtaining the software
   upgrade(s).

   Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
   service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
   but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
   sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
   Assistance Center (TAC) using the contact information listed below. In
   these cases, customers are entitled to obtain an upgrade to a later
   version of the same release or as indicated by the applicable corrected
   software version in the Software Versions and Fixes section (noted above).

   Cisco TAC contacts are as follows:

     * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)

     * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)

     * e-mail: tac@...co.com

   See http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml for
   additional TAC contact information, including special localized telephone
   numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various
   languages.

   Please have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
   notice as evidence of your entitlement to an upgrade. Upgrades for
   non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

   Please do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or
   "security-alert@...co.com" for software upgrades.

Workarounds

   There are mitigation workarounds available for these vulnerabilities. The
   Cisco PSIRT recommends that affected users upgrade to a fixed software
   version of code.

     * CSCec17308/CSCec19124(tftp)

       Use access control lists on routers and firewalls that are installed
       in the network to allow only valid network management workstations to
       gain TFTP access to the XTC, TCC+/TCC2, TCCi/TCC2, or TSC control
       cards.

     * CSCec17406(port 1080)

       Use access control lists on routers and firewalls that are installed
       in the network to allow only valid network management workstations to
       gain TCP port 1080 access to the XTC, TCC+/TCC2, TCCi/TCC2, or TSC
       control cards.

     * CSCec66884/CSCec71157(SU access)

       Use access control lists on routers and firewalls that are installed
       in the network to allow only valid network management workstations to
       gain login (Telnet) access to the XTC, TCC+/TCC2, TCCi/TCC2, or TSC
       control cards.

   Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html for examples on
   how to apply access control lists (ACLs) on Cisco routers.
