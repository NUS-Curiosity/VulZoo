Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

Release of NetBSD 1.6.2 is imminent. This is a reminder
to consider upgrading when they are available, if you are running
anything older than NetBSD 1.6  Many security-related improvements
have been made.

NetBSD 1.6.2 may be considered a binary patch for this advisory.

* Rebuilding from source:

libcrypto and libssl have to be rebuilt.

The following instructions describe how to upgrade your libcrypto and
libssl binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of libcrypto and libssl.

* NetBSD-current:

	NetBSD-current has included the OpenSSL 0.9.7 series since July 24,
	2003, therefore upgrading to sources after July 24, 2003 is required.


* NetBSD 1.6, 1.6.1:

	The binary distributions of NetBSD 1.6 and 1.6.1 are vulnerable.

	Systems running NetBSD 1.6 sources dated from before
	2003-11-07 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.6 sources dated
	2003-11-08 or later.

	NetBSD 1.6.2 will include the fix.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
		crypto/dist/openssl

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libcrypto and libssl:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-6 crypto/dist/openssl

		# cd lib/libcrypto
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
		# cd ../../lib/libssl
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install

* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

	The binary distribution of NetBSD 1.5 to 1.5.3 are vulnerable.   

	Systems running NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, or 1.5.3 sources dated
	from before 2003-11-06 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.5.*
	sources dated 2003-11-07 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
		crypto/dist/openssl

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libcrypto and libssl:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-5 crypto/dist/openssl

		# cd lib/libcrypto
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
		# cd ../../lib/libssl
		# make cleandir dependall
		# make install
