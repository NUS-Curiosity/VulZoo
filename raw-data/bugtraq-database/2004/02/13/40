obviously, you didn't do your research...  I consider Microsoft, C|net,
and KOMO (A Seattle ABC Affiliate) to be accurate news sources, or at
least as accurate as you can get...  did you even consider trying to
google for news articles?

	Personally I believe you've answered you're curiousities,
questions, ^*,
	for yourself, and for everyone else. While I don't intend on
knocking
	'Neowin', but I'm sure if something held substantially here,
news agencies
	all over the world would have covered this situation forming.
Outside of
	the posts on 'forums' there is nothing more than talk. Think
digital Elvis
	sightings here: I've seen, I've heard, someone who knows someone
who knows
	someone /$/*, ...
	
	I wrote a doc a while back on the dangers of forging information
called
	Breaking Point, and although it was not PhD type material, this
is an
	exact situation I described here. What's say I wanted to make
money on the
	stock market, say shorting Microsoft. Get the picture? Unless
some
	CONCRETE information comes of it, anyone who pays attention to
these
	rumors are doing nothing more than adding fuel to the fire.
