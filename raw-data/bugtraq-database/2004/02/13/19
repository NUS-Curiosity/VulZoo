                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated PWLib packages fix protocol security issues
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:048-01
Issue date:        2004-02-13
Updated on:        2004-02-13
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          h323 h225
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0097
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated PWLib packages that contain fixes for security issues found during
protocol testing by the NISCC are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

PWLib is a cross-platform class library designed to support the OpenH323
project.  OpenH323 provides an implementation of the ITU H.323
teleconferencing protocol, used by packages such as Gnome Meeting.

A test suite for the H.225 protocol (part of the H.323 family) provided by
the NISCC uncovered bugs in PWLib prior to version 1.6.0.  An attacker
could trigger these bugs by sending carefully crafted messages to an
application.  The effects of such an attack can vary depending on the
application, but would usually result in a Denial of Service.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0097 to this issue.

Users are advised to upgrade to the erratum packages, which contain
backported security fixes and are not vulnerable to these issues.

Red Hat would like to thank Craig Southeren of the OpenH323 project for
providing the fixes for these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

114309 - CAN-2004-0097 PWlib/OpenH323 vulnerabilities

6. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/pwlib-1.4.7-4.1.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/pwlib-1.4.7-4.1.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/pwlib-devel-1.4.7-4.1.i386.rpm



7. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
