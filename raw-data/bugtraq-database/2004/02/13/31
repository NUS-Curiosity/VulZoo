Does it not appear that the leak could have been done to ensure 
that M$ has a legal argument to abate liability in case they are 
sued?

e.g., "Its not our fault, the leaked source code allowed hackers 
to exploit the operating system and attack machines running some 
versions of Windows which in turn may have caused damage to Mr. 
X. ï¿½ If it wasn't for the leak this would not have likely 
happened."
