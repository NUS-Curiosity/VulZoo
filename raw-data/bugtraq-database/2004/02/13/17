Moshe - This is not a worm.  It's adware. It's really not even
deceptive.  It merely takes advantage of the fact that users do not read
the 'Security Warning' boxes that pop up when installing applications
off of the web.  If you go to the site and read the Terms of Service for
this application, it clearly states that it is free and in exchange for
this free game, they will periodically use your Instant Messenger to
send advertisements to all of the people on your Buddy list.

McAfee detects it as adware with the 4323 DAT file.  They also have
information on how to remove it.

Subject: AIM worm spreading around?

I have had little success in finding information on the AIM worm that
seems to be going around now.

It affects the official AOL Instant Messenger client only, it seems.
Once you click on this link (and there are different endings to the
URL each time, in place of the YUAF):

    http://www.wgutv.com/osama_capture.php?YUAF

and you install the program, it starts sending that link to everyone
else on your buddy list.

I'm not sure if it does any damage.  Does anyone know anything about
this?

Thanks,
Moshe
