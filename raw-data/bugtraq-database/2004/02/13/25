Subject: Re: W2K source "leaked"?


I think they should release the source for NT anyway. They 
are pretty much dropping it, and they say it is so badly 
made they can hardly fix it, well, why not let the REAL 
hackers out there who can make an OS, take a look at it. 
Maybe they are a little nervouse? Maybe people would see it 
was badly made? Wither way I know ALOT of people who STILL 
swear by NT. With proper skill, NT can be made hard. 2,000 
is similar, and I think it would be great if they finally 
said "Ok, fine, here is the source".
