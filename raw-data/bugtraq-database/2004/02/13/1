I wrote a small dependency-checker, and on my win2000 system it showed
that 232 DLLs depended directly or indirectly on the MSASN1.DLL.  It's a
pretty wide range of programs that have this in their address space.

It's a lot harder to find which programs actually *use* it, but checking
Process Explorer shows quite a few applications that have it loaded;

	Quicken 2003
	Yahoo! IM
	AOL IM
	SecureCRT
	Adobe Acrobat
	MusicMatch Jukebox
	Turbo Tax 2003
	JASC PaintShop Pro
	Altova XML Spy

NOTE: this does NOT mean that these applications are vulnerable to
anything (even "potentially"). But it suggests a lot of places to
look for stuff.

kerberos is a prime suspect too: 88/tcp and 88/ucp.
