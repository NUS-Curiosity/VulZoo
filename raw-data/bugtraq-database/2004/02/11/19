Synopsis:          Updated mutt packages fix remotely-triggerable crash
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:051-01
Issue date:        2004-02-11
Updated on:        2004-02-11
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          mutt menu crash
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0078
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

New mutt packages that fix a remotely-triggerable crash in the menu drawing
code are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Mutt is a text-mode mail user agent.

A bug was found in the index menu code in versions of mutt.  A remote
attacker could send a carefully crafted mail message that can cause mutt
to segfault and possibly execute arbitrary code as the victim.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0078 to this issue.

It is recommended that all mutt users upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain a backported security patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.

Red Hat would like to thank Niels Heinen for reporting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

114452 - CAN-2004-0078 Mutt can be remotely crashed

6. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/mutt-1.4.1-3.3.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/mutt-1.4.1-3.3.i386.rpm



7. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

9a76602aa1256360273b58ad7c39b629 9/en/os/SRPMS/mutt-1.4.1-3.3.src.rpm
4d0002ca7394157b33d75c9d1f63aebc 9/en/os/i386/mutt-1.4.1-3.3.i386.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
