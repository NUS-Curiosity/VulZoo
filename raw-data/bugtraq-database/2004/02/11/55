Synopsis
========

A bug in get_real_string() function allows for a Denial of Service
attack to be launched against the webserver.

Background
==========

The Monkey HTTP daemon is a Web server written in C that works under
Linux and is based on the HTTP/1.1 protocol. It aims to develop a fast,
efficient and small web server.

Description
===========

A bug in the URI processing of incoming requests allows for a Denial of
Service to be launched against the webserver, which may cause the server
to crash or behave sporadically.

Impact
======

Although there are no public exploits known for bug, users are
recommended to upgrade to ensure the security of their infrastructure.

Workaround
==========

There is no immediate workaround; a software upgrade is required. The
vulnerable function in the code has been rewritten.

Resolution
==========

All users are recommended to upgrade monkeyd to 0.8.2:

~    # emerge sync
~    # emerge -pv ">=net-www/monkeyd-0.8.2"
~    # emerge ">=net-www/monkeyd-0.8.2"
