The same way you do, of course.  Most likely it pops up a box asking
for it.  Given how boneheaded most users seem to be, and given that
signatures will be needed on most software installs, this will be a
common sight to many users, and they will probably cheerfully type in
whatever is necessary to fetch/decrypt it.  Look at how effective
phishing attacks are.

No, that wouldn't work against me (or, I would hope, you).  But I
wouldn't be running such a thing anyway, and even if I were-- having to
type a passphrase every time I recompiled something would be
intolerable, and if it were automated, malware could automate the
signing just as well as my compiler front-end could.
