Subject: Re: DreamFTP Server 1.02 Buffer Overflow

Hi all,

badpack3t wasn't totally wrong when he called it a BoF because the
formatstring can cause BoFs. Anyway, it's a nice little formatstring to
exploit, with multiple possible attack vectors. I found it easiest to
overwrite the exception handler code (since it's RWE) and then cause an
exception.
The exploit sends about 375 bytes to the target, which causes DreamFTP to
print a string of about 4 million bytes to overwrite the SEH with the right
opcodes, it then causes an exception which transfers control to the SEH
which jumps to our shellcode.

Attached exploit has been tested with Win2k, other windows platforms have
not been tested. If it shouldn't work straight away some minor adjustments
can probably fix that. (Let me know)

Cheers,

SkyLined

I find that hard to believe ;)
