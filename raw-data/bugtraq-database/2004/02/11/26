Most fingerprint systems convert the fingerprint image into what's called
a template.  This is a numeric representation, but comparision between
two templates is not as simple as "==".  Different portions of the
template represent different minutae on the fingerprint, and an actual
feature matching algorithm still needs to be used.  Thus, we cannot hash
these templates because there is no way to perform matching on the
template hashes.

So far nobody has produced an algorithm to reliably extract a symmetric
key from a fingerprint without any side information.  However, with some
extra information it is possible to obscure a private key on a smartcard
such that the key is only recoverable given a fingerprint that matches the
original.  This allows all the biometric processing to happen on a
smartcard (and not on an untrusted terminal) without storing the
fingerprint itself on the smartcard.  An attacker needs both the card and
your fingerprint to recover your key.
