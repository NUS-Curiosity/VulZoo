I think his point is this:

Image you have a user account luser on box foo. You do not have root on
foo. However, you do have root on box bar. If you are allowed to
smbmount stuff on foo as user luser, (which is a BadThing(tm), but
default behaviour on some systems as it seems), and you smbmount a share
on bar, and use that suid shell, you actually have root control on foo!
