This is old news.

NFS is also affected by  this CONFIGURATION PROBLEM (not a bug).  What I
think might be a problem is this:

[...took_from_mount_man...]
OPTIONS
[...]
	nosuid	Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
		bits to take effect.  (This seems safe,  but  is in fact
		rather unsafe if you have suidperl(1) installed.)
[...end_of_cut...]

I have never tried to use suidperl to "exploit" such thing, but my guess
is that suidperl somehow "see" the suid bit and can execute scripts set-
uid-ing the process...  or  maybe  the  man  mount page was just talking
about some old suidperl bug... if someone knows, please tell me.

Best Regards,
Felipe
