Subject: Re: AIX password enumeration possible


Hallo,

I think the privilege escalation risk here is not higher than
remote password brut forcing.

One only gets msg 3004-306 when she supplied the password correctly.
This unique response does not "allow an attacker to determine
the password" but simply states that the password was correct.

Assuming an account is not remote login disabled:
Don't you get a shell prompt when the correct passwd has been entered?
Same here: user enters right passwd --> she gets the right message.

Also, by the time you pick the passwd the AIX admin will have got you
for filling up his root filesystem as each unsuccessful attempt adds
about 650 bytes to /etc/security/failedlogin.
Default AIX rootfs is 2 PP, which is usually 2x16=32 MB, i.e. it won't be
long.

Or should I stop smoking crack?

The only configuration change required to allow this to happen in AIX is to disable remote logins for a given account (via the command "chuser rlogin=false a_userid").  If a remote attacker tries to connect to the vulnerable machine with an incorrect password  (but a known correct account name), the response from AIX will be:
> "3004-007 You entered an invalid login name or password."
> In the case that the correct password is provided, the response is as follows:
