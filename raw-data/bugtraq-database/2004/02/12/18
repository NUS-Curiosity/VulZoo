Very likely, as IKE data is marshaled into ASN.1 format.  The fun part 
about ASN.1 is it's so damn useful you tend to use it *everywhere*.

Is anyone else wondering why MS didn't fix this with the last round of 
ASN.1 decoding overflow vulnerabilities (remember the SNMP hole)?  It's 
basically the same problem.
