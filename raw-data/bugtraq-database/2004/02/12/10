               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated slocate resolves security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1232
Issue date:        2004-02-11
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1232
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0848, CAN-2003-0056
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated slocate packages are now available that fix security 
vulnerabilities which may allow local users to gain "slocate" group 
privileges.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

Slocate is a security-enhanced version of locate, designed to find files on
a system via a central database.

A vulnerability has been found in Slocate versions up to and including 2.7 
where a carefully crafted database could overflow a heap-based buffer. A 
local user could exploit this vulnerability to gain "slocate" group 
privileges and then read the entire slocate database. The Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the 
name CAN-2003-0848 to this issue.

These packages also fix a buffer overflow that affected unpatched versions 
of Slocate prior to 2.7. This vulnerability could also allow a local user 
to gain "slocate" group privileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and 
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0056 to 
this issue.

Users of slocate should update to these update packages, which contain a 
backported security patch that corrects this issue.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Patrik Hornik and Kevin Lindsay fir 
disclosing these issues, as well as Michael Schwendt for providing a 
backported fix for Red Hat Linux 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata 
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those 
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are 
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you 
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains 
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many 
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate 
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or 
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit 
http://www.fedoralegacy.org/download for directions on how to configure 
yum and apt-get.
