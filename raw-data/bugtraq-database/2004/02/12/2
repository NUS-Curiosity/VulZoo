Yes, but...

In order to trigger the ASN.1 vulnerabilities an attacker has to be able
to get the target machine to invoke its BER decoding capabilities.  I
certainly don't know the details -- maybe someone here does? -- but it's
gotta be a little difficult to send a random network packet to get a
desktop machine (that is, not a domain controller or an AD server or
something) and get it to invoke MSASN1.

I can imagine lots of attacks that require user intervention to hit this
one (like opening a hostile SSL-based web site) -- but can this be
triggered without user intervention?

thanks for more info -- tbird
