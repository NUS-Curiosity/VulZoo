It would appear that it is indeed.  The Internet Key Exchange protocol
is defined in RFC 2409, and section 5.2, "Phase 1 Authentication With
Public Key Encryption", states that "RSA encryption MUST be encoded in
PKCS #1 format".  The PKCS #1 standard always uses ASN.1 to encode
the keys and signature schemes used.

G'luck,
Peter
