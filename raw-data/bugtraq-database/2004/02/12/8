Subject: AIM worm spreading around?


I have had little success in finding information on the AIM worm that
seems to be going around now.

It affects the official AOL Instant Messenger client only, it seems.
Once you click on this link (and there are different endings to the
URL each time, in place of the YUAF):

    http://www.wgutv.com/osama_capture.php?YUAF

and you install the program, it starts sending that link to everyone
else on your buddy list.

I'm not sure if it does any damage.  Does anyone know anything about
this?

Thanks,
Moshe
