Subject: FYI: CAIF Format Specification

For Your Information:

a draft on the format specification of the Common Announcement
Interchange Format (CAIF) has been released. 

The project started in 2002 and produced a requirements document, which
was released in January 2003 (it is available from the CAIF homepage).
Based on the requirements document, its discussion, and incorporating
the additional experience gained in the meantime, this draft, specifying
the format of CAIF, has been written.

It is available at:

 http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/projects/caif/draft-goebel-caif-format.txt

From the abstract:
The draft describes an XML-based format for security announcements.  It
defines a basic but comprehensive set of elements that is designed to
describe the main aspects of an issue related to security.  Besides
addressing more than one problem within a single document the format
allows to provide information for more than one target group of readers
as well as multi-lingual textual descriptions.  It can be used to
selectively produce different renderings of an announcement for the
intended target groups, addressing one, a sub-set, or all problems in
one or multiple languages.  The set of pre-defined elements can be
extended to reflect either temporary, exotic or new requirements on a
per-document basis.


The DTD is available as a single file at:
