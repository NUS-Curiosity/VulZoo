Why don't you release your exploits on packetstormsecurity or astalavistainstead of Bugtraq? You obviously have no interest in trying to secureanyone, instead you are deliberately hurting the security of us all. >I totally disagree.  Did you know microsoft sometimes refuses to accept vulnerabilities and dismiss them as "not a vulnerability itself" but in actualityonly need to be combined with other "not a vulnerability itself" exploits and donot understand this.  I would actually THANK bugtraq and Full Disclosure that posts from Http equiv and others actually seem to get a quick patch rate now by Microsoft then in the  past.  Experts seem to be always repeating them selves how this is "a year old vulnerability" and no response fromMicrosoft.  It seems not unless they are SHOWN in proof on concepts arefixes put in the works.How are you any different than a virus writer? They are creating malwareand releasing it on their sites, then they claim innocence because theydidn't click the "Send" button. Both of you are intentionally tryingto help blackhats, script kiddies and criminals. >Did you ever think the wrong someone will think of these things sooner or later?  Researches, if you notice, get anti virus people on top of their game for free.  They already have definitions for this example and others thanks fully to the "security researcher" Mike P.S.   AIM or Buddy Icons no longer required.  IE is just a big hole.
