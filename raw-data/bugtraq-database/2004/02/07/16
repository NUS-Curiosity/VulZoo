On topic, but off the discussion: The Republicans have fired the staffer who read the
Democrat memos and leaked them. See http://www.hillnews.com/news/020504/leak.aspx.

>From the article: "Miranda admitted to the sergeant at arms that he had read Democratic
memos that a Republican staffer on the Judiciary Committee accessed through a glitch on
the panel server. But it is unclear what rules if any Miranda broke. His defenders say
that the files were openly available to Republicans through their desktop computers and
that there is no such thing as a property right to a federal document."
