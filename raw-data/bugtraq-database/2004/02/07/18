You're forgetting a third option:

Find or develop a method of scanning their hosts for the
virus/worm/trojan/foo, and cut off access on the necessary ports when
those hosts are found.

That's what Road Runner, for instance, did in some areas in response to
Code Red and Nimda.

A more extreme position (that I favor) is to put a note in the account's
file that they are infected and causing a problem, then cut off their
access entirely.  When they call tech support, they find out they're
infected.

If ISPs do this (and as I've stated, some do), then reporting infections
to them is vital, because unless they understand that it's a large
number of their users, they won't bother dealing with it.
