Synopsis
========

If the server configuration "php.ini" file has "register_globals = on"
and a request is made to one virtual host (which has "php_admin_flag
register_globals off") and the next request is sent to the another
virtual host (which does not have the setting) through the same apache
child, the setting will persist. This may lead to leaks of global variables.

Background
==========

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Description
===========

If the server configuration "php.ini" file has "register_globals = on"
and a request is made to one virtual host (which has "php_admin_flag
register_globals off") and the next request is sent to the another
virtual host (which does not have the setting) through the same Apache
child, the setting will persist.

Impact
======

Depending on the server and site, an attacker may be able to exploit
global variables to gain access to reserved areas, such as MySQL
passwords, or this vulnerability may simply cause a lack of
functionality. As a result, users are urged to upgrade their PHP
installations.

Gentoo ships PHP with "register_globals" set to "off" by default.

This issue affects both servers running Apache 1.x and servers running
Apache 2.x.

Workaround
==========

No immediate workaround is available; a software upgrade is required.

Resolution
==========

All users are recommended to upgrade their mod_php installation to 4.3.4-r4:

~    # emerge sync
~    # emerge -pv ">=dev-php/mod_php-4.3.4-r4"
~    # emerge ">=dev-php/mod_php-4.3.4-r4"

=========

confidentiality and security of our users machines is of utmost
importance to us. Any security concerns should be addressed to
