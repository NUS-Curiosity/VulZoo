In general, yes.  However, in this case it was a copycat that
got loose *before* the general population got the meme for "this is
bad, don't click on it".  And remember - they need to get a new
meme for each specific instance, as the average user can't seem to
generalize this. (Hmm.. didn't Stephenson's "Snow Crash" talk about
that? ;)
