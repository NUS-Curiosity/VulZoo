Correct.

Not.

Vesser (which a few AV companies have called Deadhat) was discovered 
early in the weekend spreading via Mydoom.A-infected machiens (and 
rpesumably it would also hit the occasional Mydoom,.B out there too).  
What Gadi alerted on as Mydoom.C has been agreed following analysis by 
AV industry experts to be sufficiently different in critical ways from 
Mydoom to be put in a new family and will be called Doomjuice.A by most 
AVs.
