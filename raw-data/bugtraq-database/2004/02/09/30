Imagine one of the resellers want to forbit access to all his directory,
and he want's also to put an special error document. There is no reason
why he should add an special allow to the error file.

If the apache admin wants to disallow access of a reseller directory, he
*MUST* disable overrive also. If he doesn't, the user will still be able
to execute php files with error document. Not in that directory but
perfectly in others, imagine /tmp or something similar.

Maybe a warning could be added to the Deny rule in apache documentation,
indicating that this will not prevent access to files from errordocument
directives or other scripting languages (as PHP) that do not follow
apache deny rules.
