Also Virtual Skipper 3 is vulnerable so the problem is in the game engine
developed by Nadeo (http://www.nadeo.com)

Not exactly garbage data but too long values, in fact the game uses 32bit
numbers to specify the size of the data that follows so this seems the cause
of the server crash.
Another simple test is the modification of the 32bit values in the UDP query
packets used to define the length of some strings.

Due the type of bug probably also the retail version is vulnerable.
Who bet?
