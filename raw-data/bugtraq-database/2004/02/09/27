By definition, anyone running any such system has explicitely decided to
trust all the users of the machine to act in accordance with common
shared goals.

You're confusing security mechanism with security policy; if someone's
security policy allows everyone to have administrator status, then this
is NOT a security problem, as you claim. This is legitimate use of
legitimate privileges.
