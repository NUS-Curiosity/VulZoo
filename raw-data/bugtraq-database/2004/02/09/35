I haven't got a clue what you're trying to accomplish. If you don't want
a setuid execute, DON'T RUN chmod +s! You don't even need samba to
accomplish this:

$ cat > a.c <<EOF
> main()
> {
>         setuid(0);
>         setgid(0);
>         system("/bin/bash");
> }
> EOF
$ make a
cc     a.c   -o a
$ sudo chown root:root a
Password:
$ sudo chmod +s a
$ ./a
$ id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=500(sarnold)
$ exit

I expect this behaviour out of every Linux, BSD, commercial Unix,
Windows NT with POSIX emulation, QNX, etc. (For the curious, this was
run on Linux 2.4.21-9.EL_imnx_2smp.)

Can you please explain what specifically bothers you?

Thanks :)
