it's not mydoom.c - his name is Vesser (W32.HLLW.Deadhat) :

Vesser mainly targets computers that have previously been infected with the Mydoom.A or Mydoom.B worms. Vesser scans for the backdoors in those worms on IP addresses. While doing that it connects to TCP ports 1080. 3127 and 3128 and tries to copy itself there in a specially-crafted package.
