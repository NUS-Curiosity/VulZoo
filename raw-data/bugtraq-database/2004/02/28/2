After some discussion with someone on Apple's product security team it 
turns out that I was responsible for the lack of response - my original 
notice went to Apple corporate security rather than product security 
and apparently was never forwarded on. In contrast, a member of the 
product security team responded to my last email shortly after the 
advisory was released.
