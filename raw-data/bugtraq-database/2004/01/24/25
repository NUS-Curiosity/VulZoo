Hard drives were available for the first of the Apple postscript
laser printers... In fact it was a standing joke that the
printers had more CPU power than the machines they were serving.

There were also a couple of postscript printers that had sun
workstations in their guts... They allowed telnet logins with
trivial (or no) root passwords.

I remember one case where someone had attached his PS printer
to a building wide (apartment) net. Didn't use DHCP so he just
assigned it a random address (that conflicted with available DHCP
allocations).

Somebody from the support group logged in to the printer,
did some investigation on it.  The end solution was
to print a message on his printer asking him to call the
support group for help.
