Actually, PostScript does have open files; find a Red Book, look up the
"file" operator, and follow the pointers to elsewhere.  (Many/most
PostScript-capable devices do not have anything of significance by way
of a filesystem, but that's a different issue entirely.)

And if you actually read the Red Book, _you_'d get a better
understanding.  In the Second Edition Red Book, for example, you'd want
to read section 3.8, "File Input and Output".
