Mea culpa.

I'd always believed font handling was just done "special" :)

Both the "Red book" and "Blue book" are available online and to my
surprise there is "open", "read", "write" and "close".  A quick skip
through to the command index shows they're there.

Btw, someone else mentioned something to the effect that hard drives
were "new" to printers.  Hard drives have been in printers for ~10 years
(if not more) where you needed 100MB or so of space to spool print jobs.
