Subject: Re: Major hack attack on the U.S. Senate


Agreed this was not a "hack attack" as usually considered.  However, I would 
raise two points.  The first is simple - If someone starts reading files on a 
computer to which they are not supposed to have access, do we not consider 
this an attack?  Even if the reason they got in is configuration errors?

Second, there is a question of which side's position is easier to believe.  
You said: " Additionally the Republicans allegedly 'in the summer of 2002, 
their computer technician informed his Democratic counterpart of the glitch.'  
You cut off the next sentence which says:  " Other staffers, however, denied 
that the Democrats were told anything about it before November 2003."  The 
article does not state whether it was Democrat or Republican staffers.  

I'll ask a simple question which indicates why I think the latter is more 
probable:  Can you think of a sysadmin who wouldn't act when told that _all_ 
his clients' passwords were invalid because the permissions were misapplied?

I think that the word "hack" is wrong.  Otherwise, yes, I think the tenor of 
the article has validity.
