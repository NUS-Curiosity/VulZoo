Your view will depend on whether you are a Republican or a Democrat IF
you are in the US. If you are a member of another party in the US you
will likely say a pox on both. If you are not in the US you will sit
there laughing at both sides.

Whether a hack or a bad configuration, from a moral point what the
Republicans did is still dirty pool, and they would be screaming if it
were the other way around.  Lets be realistic and call a spade a spade -
in the US both parties are big business and neither will give the other
the time of day if they can help it. This is simply one more example of
what can happen.

Does it really matter if it was a hack or it was a screw-up which gave
the opponents a free entry into what they KNEW was not their material
and they KNEW they were supposed to stay out of?  Is anyone suggesting
that its wrong if you hack in to get the info but okay if it does not
require you actually hack in?  Get real... moral turpitude has NOT
changed, but then to claim that either the Democrats or the Republicans
are morally better than their opposites is hypocrisy in any event.

Give me a better democracy... Like that in Canada or the UK or New
Zealand or Australia... where we KNOW that the PM is both the head of
the executive and the head of the legislative and the current US bull is
NOT part of the mix.

FWIW
