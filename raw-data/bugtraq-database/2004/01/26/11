Subject: Re: Self-Executing FOLDERS: Windows XP Explorer Part V


I get the following dialogue box on:
+ Windows XP SP1,
+ IE 6.0.2800.1106.xpsp2.030422-1633, Updates: SP1; Q822925; Q330994; 
Q828750; Q825145

"Your current security settings prohibit running ActiveX controls on 
this page.  As a result, the page may not display correctly."

The site shows as being in My Computer zone.  Since I can't change those 
settings, my security settings for Internet are:
Download signed ActiveX controls: Prompt
Download unsigned ActiveX controls: Disable
Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked as safe: Disable
Run ActiveX controls and plugins: Enable
Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting: Enable

Internet Explorer / Windows Explorer (which ever it thinks it is) shows, 
"Installing components...My%20Pics.folder!malware.exe" in the status bar 
at the end of execution, though the exe was never run unless it was 
designed to look like a regular IE dialogue.
