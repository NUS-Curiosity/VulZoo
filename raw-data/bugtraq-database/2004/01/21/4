Subject: Re: vBulletin Security Vulnerability


What versions of vBulletin does this affect? What version is the oldest
patched version?

Like all vB security related bugs, I see no mention of this on the vB forums.

#  GERMAN COMPUTER FREAKS - SECURITY ADVISORY - SINCE 1997
#                   January 20st, 2003
# - - -------------------------------------------------------
# 
#   Software      : vBulletin Bulletin Board
#   Vendor        : Jelsoft Enterprises Limited / inGame GmbH
#   Vulnerability : Cross Site Scripting
#   Status        : Author has been notified
# 
# - - ------------------------------------------------------
# 
# - - - - Description
# 
#     vBulletin Bulletin Board derivatives contain a security bug
#    that may lead to disclosure of private informations due to a
#    cross site scripting attack.
# 
#     This vulnerability may enable an attacker to transmit sensitive
#    informations like 'encrypted' passwords, user identification
#    numbers or forum passwords to another server.
# 
#     Currently, we will refrain from publishing proof of concept
#    information to mitigate the impact of this vulnerability.
# 
# - - - - Technical Details
# 
#     Due to an improper quoted field in register.php it's possible
#    to inject malicious HTML code. With the use of Javascript code
#    an attack is then able to send sensitive informations (like
#    cookies) to a foreign server.
# 
#    Attack Example:
# 
#    <form action="http://www.VULN-BOARD.com/register.php" method="GET">
#    <input type="hidden" name="reg_site"
#     value="<SCRIPT><!-- EVIL CODE //--></SCRIPT>"/>
#    <input type="text" name="email" value="" />
#    <input type="submit" value="Show my cookies" />
# 
# - - - - Patch
# 
#     The vendor released a patch for this vulnerability.
# 
# - - - - Closing Words
# 
#   07.01.04  Contacting the board developers and explaining the vulnerability
#   08.01.04  Developing a proof of concept tool (undisclosed)
#   20.01.04  Disclosure of this advisory to public
