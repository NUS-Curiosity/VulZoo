                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated mc packages resolve buffer overflow vulnerability
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:034-01
Issue date:        2004-01-19
Updated on:        2004-01-19
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          mc buffer overflow vfs
Cross references:  
Obsoletes:         
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-1023
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated mc packages that resolve a buffer overflow vulnerability are now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Midnight Commander is a visual shell much like a file manager.

A buffer overflow has been found in Midnight Commander's virtual filesystem
code. Specifically, a stack-based buffer overflow in vfs_s_resolve_symlink
of vfs/direntry.c allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code during
symlink conversion.

Users of Midnight Commander should install these updated packages, which
resolve this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate 
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated 
certificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat 
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. Bug IDs fixed (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla for more info):

113850 - CAN-2003-1023 mc stack overflow

6. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/mc-4.6.0-7.9.src.rpm

i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/i386/mc-4.6.0-7.9.i386.rpm



7. Verification:

MD5 sum                          Package Name
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

a95b46e77c33aa44922b85fa87fd55e0 9/en/os/SRPMS/mc-4.6.0-7.9.src.rpm
ecce8798d9e33465f8aef6be1c0f7914 9/en/os/i386/mc-4.6.0-7.9.i386.rpm

These packages are GPG signed by Red Hat for security.  Our key is
available from https://www.redhat.com/security/keys.html

You can verify each package with the following command:
    
    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the md5sum with the following command:
    
    md5sum <filename>
