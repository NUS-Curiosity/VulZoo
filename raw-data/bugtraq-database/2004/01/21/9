Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2004-0005

Package name:      slocate
Summary:           possible privilege elevation
Date:              2004-01-21
Affected versions: Trustix 1.5, 2.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  Slocate is a security-enhanced version of locate. Just like locate,
  slocate searches through a central database (which is updated nightly)
  for files which match a given pattern. Slocate allows you to quickly
  find files anywhere on your system.


Problem description:
  Mr. Patrik Hornik discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in slocate
  version 2.6.  The vulnerability corrupts heap management structures and
  possibly leads to gaining slocate group privileges, which allows reading
  the global slocate database and thus obtaining a list of all files in the
  system by an unauthorized user.
  
  For further description, see CAN-2003-0848 at http://cve.mitre.org/

  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
