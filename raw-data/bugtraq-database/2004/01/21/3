Subject: Re: RE: Internet Explorer - Multiple Vulnerabilities


I looked into the "buffer overflow": it's actually a stack overflow. This
means Outlook Express just runs out of stack space and terminates. Nothing
is overwritten, this is not exploitable to gain unauthorized access or
elevate priviledges.
