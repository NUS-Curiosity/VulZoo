Subject: New release of Patchfinder2 (windows rootkit detector)



Patchfinder is a sophisticated diagnostic utility designed to detected
system libraries and kernel compromises. Its primary use is to check if
the given machine has been attacked with some modern rootkits.

With this tool you should be able to detect even the newest versions of
such rootkits like: Hacker Defender, APX, Vaniquish, He4Hook, and many
more...

New release (2.x) of Patchfinder is the first version which is intended to
be not only a proof-of-concept code for developers, but also to be useful
tool for administrators. To make a proper use of the PF, every user should
read the attached PDF paper.

Check out the website for more info: http://rootkit.com.

joanna.
