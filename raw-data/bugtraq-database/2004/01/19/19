	ote Code Execution (816458)


Just wanted others to be aware of this one. 
Usually, when you install a hot fix from Microsoft, there are warning about
shutting down services and or it just installs the patch and tells you to
reboot the server. 
This hot fix does not do this but immediately shuts down the services
associated with ISA and installs the patch. 

I am posting this so others do not take down their company during the day to
install a hot fix....
