Hi,

our initial posting contains a mistake about the vulnerability of the 2.2 
kernel series. Since the 2.2 kernel series doesn't support the 
MREMAP_FIXED flag it is NOT vulnerable. The source states 
"MREMAP_FIXED option added 5-Dec-1999" but it didn't make into recent 
2.2.x. We apologize for inconvenience.
