Synopsis:          Updated Ethereal packages fix security issues
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:001-01
Issue date:        2004-01-07
Updated on:        2004-01-07
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:

CVE Names:         CAN-2003-1012 CAN-2003-1013
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated Ethereal packages that fix two security vulnerabilities are now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Ethereal is a program for monitoring network traffic.

Two security issues have been found that affect Ethereal.  By exploiting
these issues it may be possible to make Ethereal crash by injecting an
intentionally malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to
read a malformed packet trace file.  It is not known if these issues could
allow arbitrary code execution.

The SMB dissector in Ethereal before 0.10.0 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via a malformed SMB packet that triggers a
segmentation fault during processing of Selected packets. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-1012 to this issue.

The Q.931 dissector in Ethereal before 0.10.0 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed Q.931, which triggers a
null dereference. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-1013 to this issue.

Users of Ethereal should update to these erratum packages containing
Ethereal version 0.10.0, which is not vulnerable to these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Please note that this update is available via Red Hat Network.  To use Red
Hat Network, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. RPMs required:
