Eric,

I would tend to agree with the other critiques of the paper and would
include one more point.  In your analysis of p_r (probability of
rediscovery), you assume its value to be very low, if not zero, for most
bugs (on a side note, vulnerabilities would be a much better term
here).  This is derived by noting that the number of bugs is very large
(IEEE studies indicate # of bugs (though not necessarily
vulnerabilities) to be anywhere from 1/10th to 1/100th of the number of
lines of code) and that the number of discovered bugs is low.  One thing
that this ignores is that the discovery of vulnerabilities is often
clustered as new classes of security issues are discovered.  

For example, over the past two years, we've seen an explosion in the
number of cross site scripting vulnerabilities being reported.  This
occurred (and continues) as the community recognized new types of XSS
vulnerabilities and tested these techniques against older software
packages.  Another example is the increasing number of "off by one"
reports as researchers (both black and white hatted) search through
applications for code that might be impacted. 

Of course, that theory breaks down somewhat when considering the
classics (like buffer overflows).  However, since the discovery of some
classes of vulnerabilities are clustered, it might be interesting to
search through ICAT to see if there is a temporal correlation in the
types of bugs discovered and to see if you can factor that into your
paper.
