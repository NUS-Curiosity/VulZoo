Subject: Re[2]: Hijacking Apache 2 via mod_perl


Dear Ben Laurie,

You're  right: mod_perl is inside apache memory space and can access any
descriptor, so it's impossible to blame apache descriptor is leaked. But
you're  wrong. mod_perl has access to memory, not perl script. At least,
it's  possible  to  store  descriptors  table  and  implement  check for
descriptor  in  every  perl  file/socket  function  inside mod_perl (and
mod_php  and mod_something) and only allow access to std descriptors and
to  descriptors open inside same script. The choice is between speed and
security.
