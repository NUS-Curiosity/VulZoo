Cripes, why don't they just print money that won't scan ?

You can buy paper that if you photocopy/scan will come out
with "illegal copy" all over it.  I'm sure they could do the
same for currency if they tried.

Of course another method is to create a well lit environment,
get a <bignumber> mega-pixel digital camera and generate an
image that's equivalent in quality to what you would get from
a scanner for reproduction purposes.  Well, maybe affordable
digital cameras with the requisite resolution are still a few
years away...

But there's only one commonly used currency in the world that
is worth targetting and is really vulnerable here, any more...
the US dollar (please don't write about how cool the new $20 is,
I've seen it and have joked about it with Americans when comparing
it to the AUD$20 note and other currencies) - British Pounds,
Australian Dollars, the list goes on, are all made using plastic
printing technology that's moved on from being vulnerable to
someone at home with a scanner and some paper.
