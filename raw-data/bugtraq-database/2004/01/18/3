Subject: Re: Anti-MS drivel



David,

Your company is obivously a "geek" friendly enviroment where not using m$
products is ok and not a business requirement.But when you have tons of
presentations monthly where the client is only using Powerpoint ( and only
powerpoint because it's working for him ) , using OpenOffice it's NOT an
option.Same goes for the rest of office products.
We have around 600 desktops running a mix of win 2k/ xp pro and maybe 50
servers
running 2k server and 2k3 server.We use a checkpoint fw and symantec corporate
edition for antivir.
Last time I've seen a server infected was 3 years ago ( one nt machine
everybody
forgot about got owned using unicode exploit ).As for virii we NEVER had an
infection.
It all boils down to keeping an eye on what's out there in terms of exploits
and
being pro-active.And don't give the "we dont have enough manpower to deal with
all the windows exploits" stuff.
I dont even remember when was the last time i had to go to a machine and
install
a patch ( we're using software update services for that - does a good job and
it's free ). The antivirus server is deploying updated virus def files as soon
is it gets any...and so on.
Ah, and the mail server strips any "funny" mail attachments.

Luca.
