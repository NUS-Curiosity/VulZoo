Subject: new outbreak warning - Bagle


This possible worm outbreak warning was received on TH-Research (The 
Trojan Horses Research Mailing List) from Moosoft Development 
(www.moosoft.com) a few hours ago.

AV and AT firms have had a few hours to update their databases.

Info can be found only on Kaspersky's web page, so far:
http://www.viruslist.com/eng/alert.html?id=783050

Let's hope it is stopped before it can do too much damage!

This email comes and an heads-up and FYI so you can take measures to 
stop it.
