Amazing.

I wonder if you would have the job you have or know the things you know were
it not for MS.

I get tired of anti-MS drivel. The fact is that around my area the
businesses are medium-small to small and of course home users. Without MS,
there wouldn't be anywhere near the amount of computer users there are now
from whom I can make a living.

MS has weaknesses to be sure but if you think you can write a much better OS
from the ground up with no holes in it, let me know. I would like to use it!

Greg.
