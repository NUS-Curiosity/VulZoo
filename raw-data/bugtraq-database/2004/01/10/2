Mostly "root"...and this will cause sure other fun, looks like some software 
didn't expect that file system runs out-of-space and still hang and have no 
fail-safe mechanism here...

That's an additional suggestion for a smart decompression unit.

Good idea...but the best will be vendors implementing the decompression unit 
in a proper way. 

BTW: note that the temp file created by Trend Micro's vscan has permission 
644. This can be an interesting issue for other local users which are 
looking for data which they should normally prevent to see.
