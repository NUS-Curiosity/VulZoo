Subject: [TH-research] OT: Israeli Post Office break-in


Mail from Gadi Evron <ge@...uxbox.org>

This is completely off-topic, but very interesting.

Apparently there was a break-in in a branch of the Israeli Post Office.

The offenders placed a wire-less gateway connected to a switch inside,
and through it stole a few tens of thousands of Shekels in the few days
they were in operation (the Israeli Post Office is a sort of a small bank).

They only managed to run this operation for a few days.. I guess people
noticed that contraption connected to their switch. Although it looks
very much like a legit piece of hardware.
Another option is that someone talked too much, or they were already
under investigation.
I find it hard to believe that they were located due to the break-in to
the network itself, as crude as it was.

Once again we get a glimpse into a far smarter world of computer related
crime. Always makes me wonder about what *else* is out there, that we do
not hear about.

Last item I heard of was the theft of Face Recognition servers holding
terrorism-related databases from an Australian airport. There was the
Industrial Espionage bit using Trojan horses as well.
