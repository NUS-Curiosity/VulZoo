Overview 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
XTREME ASP Photo Gallery is a photo gallery that 
allows easy photo management and complete 
administration via a web based interface. This 
interface offers many more features than conventional 
web based photo gallery's do. With XTREME ASP Photo 
Gallery, you can configure everything including 
colors, text styles, amount of imaged displayed per 
page and much more. 
 
 
 
Details 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Xtreme ASP Photo Gallery Version 2.0 is prone to a 
common SQL injection vulnerability. The problem 
occurs when handling user-supplied username and 
password data supplied to authentication procedures.

If we type: 
 
Username: 'or' 
Password: 'or' 
 
we gain admin access about the password protected 
administrative pages.
