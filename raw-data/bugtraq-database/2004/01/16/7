I'll not get into the endless banter that will certainly ensue when I tell
you that, in many circumstances, people don't have a choice in the products
they use. I know I don't, at least at the office. And don't tell me to go
find another job where I won't have to work for Microsoft Nazis -- I thank
my lucky stars just about every day that I actually HAVE a job, considering
the current job market.

What I WILL say, however, is that to Microsoft's credit, Outlook 2003 is
drastically improved over its predecessors. Outlook 2003 will no longer
automatically download pictures that are in an HTML e-mail, nor will it
automatically execute any embedded code or link itself to outside websites
that are linked in an e-mail.

They (MS) have a long way to go, but they're certainly climbing the
mountain.
