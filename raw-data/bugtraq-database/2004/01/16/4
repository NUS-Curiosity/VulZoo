That Web site is utterly disingenuous.  Rather than giving low-value
information, how about high-value information that actually protects people:

1) Don't use Windows.
2) Don't use Outlook.

Our company uses neither Windows nor Outlook, and although we do have a
firewall, we do not use anti-virus software.

Of course, the sponsors of the site (Microsoft and a bunch of anti-virus
vendors) can hardly see it as being in their interest to actually create
a secure computing environment.

Regards,

David.
