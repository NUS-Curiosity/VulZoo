First, remember that postscript has been designed for rendering images
on a page.  It has -no- native networking comands nor ability to talk
to any peripheral.  Most often, the 'general purpose' tasks have been
to do things like write a postscript program to calculate pi or things
like that.  I've never heard of anyone suggesting you could copy data
from one port to another, if only because there's no such thing as an
open file in postscript.  Another example might be rather than drawing
the graph and telling a printer how to draw it, with postscript, you
can write a program that you send to the printer and have it draw it.

Next, get whichever printer you are interested in to see what extensions
they have by way of postscript comments.  If there is going to be any
'connect to peripheral' thing, that's where it will be.

Of course if you had a postscript printer AND a the postscript cookbooks
you'd instantly get a better understanding.

Although for those that remember, Solaris 1 came with an X server that
listened on port 2000 where you could connect and send postscript commands,
rendering directly on to the background of the screen.

All that's not to say that a postscript engine is ever perfect...I'm
sure everyone who's had a postscript printer can tell of print jobs
that have "crashed the printer".  Maybe you can buffer overflow one,
but what OS are they running in there?  It's not likely to be anything
you'll have libraries for and maybe not even a CPU you're familiar with.
