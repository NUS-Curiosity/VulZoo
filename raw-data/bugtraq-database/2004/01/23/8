This was clearly not a "hack attack".  The title and opening content of this
article is quite intentionally misleading.  The phrases "infiltration",
"monitoring secret memos", "exploited computer glitch", "hack attack" are
used.  If you read the entire article you will find out the following:

First, "A technician hired by the new judiciary chairman, Patrick Leahy,
Democrat of Vermont, apparently made a mistake that allowed anyone to access
newly created accounts on a Judiciary Committee server shared by both
parties -- even though the accounts were supposed to restrict access only to
those with the right password."

Which means the Democrats screwed up setting up their own share point and
allowed public access to it.  There was no "computer glitch" which was
"exploited".  This was completely a human screw-up.  And there was no
hacking ("exploitation of a computer glitch") done by the Republicans.
Unless you wish to call clicking on a share point configured with public
access and opening it up "hacking".

Additionally the Republicans allegedly "in the summer of 2002, their
computer technician informed his Democratic counterpart of the glitch".

The Republicans knew that the share was supposed to be protected (why else
would they inform the Democrats of the misconfiguration?) so they certainly
did something wrong despite (supposedly) warning the Democrats of the
problem, but not to the extent that the article - in the way that it was
written - would like you to believe.
