An SQL Injection vulnerabilities have been found in the following scripts:

search.asp, browse.asp, details.asp, showcat.asp, users.asp, 
addtomylist.asp,
modline.asp, cart.asp, newuser.asp

User supplied input is not filtered before being used in a SQL query. 
Consequently,
query modification using malformed input is possible.

in the worst case to execute
arbitrary commands on a target's system (via MS SQL xp_cmdshell function).

scripts:

imagezoom.asp, recommend.asp

By injecting a specially crafted javascript code in url and tricking a

it a remote attacker can steal user session id and gain access to user's 
personal data.
