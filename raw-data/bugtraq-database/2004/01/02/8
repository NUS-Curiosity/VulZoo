Naturally, this only works from a local security zone such as the My
Computer zone. You cannot exploit the Shell.Application object from the
Internet Zone where you get an explanatory "Permission Denied" error.

This eases the process of abusing local security zone privileges but
does not change the fact that you could already download and execute
files when inside a local security zone. If you want to "exploit" this
from the Internet Zone you still need to rely on yet another
cross-domain vulnerability as well as a local file loading vulnerability
to gain access to the My Computer zone, where you could already use
ADODB and codeBase to execute files.

One more way to do the same, but definitely a more explanatory and
simplistic approach ;)

Naturally, locking down the My Computer zone prevents this exploit from
working - personally, I would recommend installing Qwik-Fix and forget
about command execution vulnerabilities in IE :)
