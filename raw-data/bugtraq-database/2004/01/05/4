  EnGarde Secure Linux is an enterprise class Linux platform engineered
  to enable corporations to quickly and cost-effectively build a complete
  and secure Internet presence while preventing Internet threats.

OVERVIEW
- --------
  This update fixes two security issues and one critical bug in the Linux
  Kernel shipped with EnGarde Secure Linux.

  A summary of the bugs fixed:

    * An EnGarde-specific memory leak in the LIDS code has been fixed.
      This memory leak could cause a machine, over time, to freeze up.

    * A security vulnerability in the mremap(2) system call was recently
      discovered by Paul Starzetz.  The incorrect bounds checking done
      in this system call could be exploited by a local user to gain root
      privileges.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
      assigned the name CAN-2003-0985 to this issue.

    * A somewhat less critical vulnerability has been found in the Linux
      RTC code.  This vulnerability may leak small bits of arbitrary
      kernel memory to user land.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
      assigned the name CAN-2003-0984 to this issue.

  Guardian Digital products affected by this issue include:

    EnGarde Secure Community 2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.5

  It is recommended that all users apply this update as soon as possible.
