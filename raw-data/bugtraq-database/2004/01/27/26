Subject: GOOROO CROSSING: File Spoofing Internet Explorer 6




Tuesday, January 27, 2004 

Trivial file spoofing in Internet Explorer 6.0.2800.1106 and all 
of 'its' patches to date on WIN XP [probably others]:

Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=malware.{3050f4d8-98B5-
11CF-BB82-00AA00BDCE0B}fun_ball_gites_pie_throw%2Empeg"

Absolute bare minimum working demo [perhaps even feeble] as we 
are absolutely confident the self-appointed resident gooroo will 
be along shortly handing out packets of two cents to everyone 
thus saving us the effort to illustrate in even greater detail 
to those lacking imagination:
