Synopsis
========

Apache's mod_python module could crash the httpd process if a specific,
malformed query string was sent.

Background
==========

Mod_python is an Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter within
the server allowing Python-based web-applications to be created.

Description
===========

The Apache Foundation has reported that mod_python may be prone to
Denial of Service attacks when handling a malformed query. Mod_python
2.7.9 was released to fix the vulnerability, however, because the
vulnerability has not been fully fixed, version 2.7.10 has been released.

Users of mod_python 3.0.4 are not affected by this vulnerability.

Impact
======

Although there are no known public exploits known for this exploit,
users are recommended to upgrade mod_python to ensure the security of
their infrastructure.

Workaround
==========

Mod_python 2.7.10 has been released [ the release announcement is at
http://www.modpython.org/pipermail/mod_python/2004-January/014879.html ]
to solve this issue; there is no immediate workaround.

Resolution
==========

All users using mod_python 2.7.9 or below are recommended to update
their mod_python installation:

~    $> emerge sync
~    $> emerge -pv ">=dev-python/mod_python-2.7.10"
~    $> emerge ">=dev-python/mod_python-2.7.10"
~    $> /etc/init.d/apache restart
