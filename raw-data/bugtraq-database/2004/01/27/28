Synopsis
========

Various overflows in the handling of AIM DirectIM packets was revealed
in GAIM that could lead to a remote compromise of the IM client.

Background
==========

Gaim is a multi-platform and multi-protocol instant messaging client. It
is compatible with AIM , ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo, IRC, Jabber,
Gadu-Gadu, and the Zephyr networks.

Description
===========

Yahoo changed the authentication methods to their IM servers, rendering
GAIM useless. The GAIM team released a rushed release solving this
issue, however, at the same time a code audit revealed 12
vulnerabilities [ 1 ].

Impact
======

Due to the nature of instant messaging many of these bugs require
man-in-the-middle attacks between the client and the server. But the
underlying protocols are easy to implement and attacking ordinary TCP
sessions is a fairly simple task. As a result, all users are advised to
upgrade their GAIM installation.

[ * ] Users of GAIM 0.74 or below are affected by 7 of the
~      vulnerabilities and are encouraged to upgrade.

[ * ] Users of GAIM 0.75 are affected by 11 of the vulnerabilities
~      and are encouraged to upgrade to the patched version of GAIM
~      offered by Gentoo.

[ * ] Users of GAIM 0.75-r6 are only affected by 4 of the
~      vulnerabilities, but are still urged to upgrade to maintain
~      security.

Workaround
==========

There is no immediate workaround; a software upgrade is required.

Resolution
==========

All users are recommended to upgrade GAIM to 0.75-r7.

~    $> emerge sync
~    $> emerge -pv ">=net-im/gaim-0.75-r7"
~    $> emerge ">=net-im/gaim-0.75-r7"
