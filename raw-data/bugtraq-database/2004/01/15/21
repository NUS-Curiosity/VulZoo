Subject: Re: January 15 is Personal Firewall Day, help the cause

more than raising awareness it looks like a corporate marketing 
operation from majors:
"Where to Get a Personal Firewall
Personal firewalls are available from several vendors, including these 
sponsors of Personal Firewall Day:
	• 	McAfee Security
	• 	Microsoft
	• 	Sygate
	• 	Zone Labs"

is that education?

Other other hand firewall day seems like being used by some people to 
distribute new toys? I got more than 20 000 ms sql  worm propagation in 
the ids log today.

Come on guys try to objective for one day, next time do a copy/paste of 
http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Security/Firewalls/Products/ 
. That'd be education and not another useless corporate spam to sell 
products.

The Personal Firewall Day is a campaign designed to raise awareness
about the dangers we face without a personal firewall. Security
experts such as yourself are encouraged to use the occasion of
Personal Firewall Day to share your expertise and advice with your
lesser technologically skilled friends and family, and help get them
secured by installing a personal firewall - this could be as simple as
helping them turn on the XP firewall. Direct them to the website where
they can learn more about personal firewalls and other layers of
protection.


Compromised end-user machines affect us all and the Internet as a
whole when they are used as zombies for DDoS networks or proxies by
criminal spammers, and your personal effort can help remedy this.


PFD is a direct result of the discussions that originated from the
NTBugtraq Retreat '03, and would not have been possible without the
dedication and hard work put into the project by Paul Robertson,
director of risk assessment with TruSecure and the original proponent
of the idea.
