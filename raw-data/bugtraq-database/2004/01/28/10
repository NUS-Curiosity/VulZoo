Subject: Re: New MiMail variant is DDoS'ing SCO.com


I had no problem downloading CA's cleansing tool a short time ago.
My hat is off to CA for producing this tool and making it available
for free.

Regarding the SCO DDoS, it's so sad when a thief (of services)
decides to attack a blackmailer, in my opinion.
