Subject: Oracle toplink mapping workbench password algorithm


Hi

I thought readers here might be interested in this item. Today I found
that a website has posted the algorithm and sample code for the
encryption algorithm used in Oracles toplink mapping workbench. This
code can be used to decrypt the passwords held in the xml file easily. A
link to the details can be found on my website at
http://www.petefinnigan.com/orasec.htm

If you use this tool beware of this fact and protect the files used.

kind regards

Pete
