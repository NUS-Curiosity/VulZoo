	The problem with this, of course, is that the security hole 
exists, but the whitehats (ie. us) haven't been generally notified.  I 
agree that in a perfect world, everyone should notify the vendor first.  
But a lot of people, if they got knocked back, and told to follow proper 
procedure, would just say "Ah well, I don't have time for that".  My 
understanding of Bugtraq is that it is to provide timely information on 
potential problems, and allow workarounds (ie. turn off javascript, or 
whatever it happens to be).

	I agree on this one -- if an exploit only functions under some 
circumstances (OS specific is a good example), then making it function 
under a wider range of circumstances is good because it allows people to 
see that they're vulnerable where they might've thought otherwise.  But 
posting an exploit that drops a root shell -- well, I wonder whether these 
shouldn't be rejected even if they are the first POC -- it shouldn't be 
too hard for the POC writer to change their code so that it doesn't.

	I agree, although I think I'd phrase that as "enable the whitehats
to deal with their security situation better".  

	Thanks,
