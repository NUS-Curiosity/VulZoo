greetings, 
i have done a litte reseach on a SuSE linux 9.0 box 
for possible symlink attacks. i have checked nearly 
every script i could found on the system. i havent 
found much and nothing very special.i dont have a 
clue if the following scripts are somewhere on the 
system executed but maybe someone useses them in a 
script or something like that.
