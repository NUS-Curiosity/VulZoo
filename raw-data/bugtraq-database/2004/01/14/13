Subject: Network Associates Product Security Contact


Hello list,

I wondered if anyone knew of a product security contact within Network 
Associates, in particular for their McAfee line of products?

Up to this point I've tried:

security-alert@....com (as described in bugtraq post from 2002)
Jim_Magdych@....com (sender of above post)
sec_labs@....com (NAI Labs)
support@....com
and lastly the AVERT alias for virus submissions (a long shot, I know).

I have had no response (or bounces) from any of these channels (bar an 
automated reply from AVERT).

cheers,

-mm
