CERT Advisory CA-2004-01 Multiple H.323 Message Vulnerabilities

   Original release date: January 13, 2004
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC, NISCC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Many  software  and  hardware  systems  that  implement  the H.323
       protocol

       Examples include
          + Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) devices and software
          + Video conferencing equipment and software
          + Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) devices and software
          + Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) devices and software
          + Other  networking  equipment  that  may process H.323 traffic
            (e.g., routers and firewalls)

Overview

   A   number   of   vulnerabilities  have  been  discovered  in  various
   implementations of the multimedia telephony protocol H.323. Voice over
   Internet Protocol (VoIP) and video conferencing equipment and software
   can  use  these  protocols  to  communicate over a variety of computer
   networks.

I. Description

   The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre (NISCC)
   has    reported   multiple   vulnerabilities   in   different   vendor
   implementations  of  the multimedia telephony protocol H.323. H.323 is
   an  international  standard  protocol,  published by the International
   Telecommunications  Union,  used  to  facilitate  communication  among
   telephony  and  multimedia  systems.  Examples of such systems include
   VoIP,  video-conferencing  equipment,  and network devices that manage
   H.323  traffic.  A test suite developed by NISCC and the University of
   Oulu   Security   Programming   Group  (OUSPG)  has  exposed  multiple
   vulnerabilities  in a variety of implementations of the H.323 protocol
   (specifically its connection setup sub-protocol H.225.0).

   Information about individual vendor H.323 implementations is available
   in the Vendor Information section below, and in the Vendor Information
   section of NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 006489/H323.

   The  U.K.  National  Infrastructure  Security  Co-ordination Centre is
   tracking  these  vulnerabilities as NISCC/006489/H.323. The CERT/CC is
   tracking this issue as VU#749342. This reference number corresponds to
   CVE  candidate  CAN-2003-0819,  as  referenced  in  Microsoft Security
   Bulletin MS04-001.

II. Impact

   Exploitation  of  these vulnerabilities may result in the execution of
   arbitrary  code  or cause a denial of service, which in some cases may
   require a system reboot.

III. Solution

Apply a patch or upgrade

   Appendix  A  and  the  Systems  Affected section of Vulnerability Note
   VU#749342  contain  information provided by vendors for this advisory
   (<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/749342#systems>).

   However,  as  vendors  report  new information to the CERT/CC, we will
   only  update  VU#749342. If a particular vendor is not listed, we have
   not received their comments. Please contact your vendor directly.

Filter network traffic

   Sites  are  encouraged to apply network packet filters to block access
   to  the  H.323  services  at  network  borders.  This can minimize the
   potential  of  denial-of-service  attacks originating from outside the
   perimeter. The specific services that should be filtered include

     * 1720/TCP
     * 1720/UDP

   If  access  cannot  be  filtered at the network perimeter, the CERT/CC
   recommends  limiting  access to only those external hosts that require
   H.323  for normal operation. As a general rule, filtering all types of
   network  traffic  that  are  not  required  for  normal  operation  is
   recommended.

   It  is important to note that some firewalls process H.323 packets and
   may  themselves  be  vulnerable  to  attack.  As  noted in some vendor
   recommendations   like   Cisco  Security  Advisory  20040113-h323  and
   Microsoft  Security Bulletin MS04-001, certain sites may actually want
   to disable application layer inspection of H.323 network packets.

   Protecting  your  infrastructure  against  these  vulnerabilities  may
   require careful coordination among application, computer, network, and
   telephony  administrators.  You  may  have  to  make tradeoffs between
   security and functionality until vulnerable products can be updated.
