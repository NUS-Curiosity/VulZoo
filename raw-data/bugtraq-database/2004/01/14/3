My favorite lately was the attempted compromise of the linux kernel 
that's currently in development.  Apparently the "backdoor" was a 
whopping 2 lines of code.

I've seem some other things lately that makes me think that the recently 
issued kernel may already be compromised.  I'm hoping I'm wrong about that.
