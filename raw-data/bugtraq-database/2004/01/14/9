Subject: an article on the Israeli Post Office break-in


Couldn't find any article in English, so I summarised all the facts and 
wrote my own.

www.math.org.il/post-office.rtf

IMPORTANT note: this is an RTF file, if you do not trust me (which 
should be obvious) or have a secure machine.. maybe it's not such a good 
idea opening it.

I'm too lazy to make an HTML. But I would vouch for creating this RTF 
myself. Besides, if I did send a backdoored RTF here I must be very stupid.
