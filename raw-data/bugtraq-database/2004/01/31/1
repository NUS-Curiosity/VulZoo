Subject: Mydoom DDoS attack time table


I apologize if in my previous email I didn't make it clear, this is an 
important issue for system administrators world wide, so I am emailing 
again in regard to this subject alone - a time table for the Mydoom DDoS 
attack.

In my post from the 30th of January with the subject: "Refuting 
tall-tales and stories about the Mydoom.A and Mydoom.B worms" -
we released an analysis of the Mydoom worms DoS mechanism, refuting 
rumors about it not existing (http://www.math.org.il/mydoom-facts.txt).

You can find a _time_table _for when the DDoS attack will happen, as
calculated by a C program Joe Stewart wrote at:
http://www.math.org.il/mydoom-a-timeline.txt

Mydoom.B has a time line too, but it can't be predicted as definitely
because of an extra random check.

For more information about the DoS attack itself performed by the worm, 
how and when (including reverse engineering bits) you should check the 
above mentioned article.
