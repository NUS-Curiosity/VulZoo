I had slightly better luck contacting the hosting firm which had the
corrupted site for one phishing scheme.  

However, it seems to me that the actually really is pretty much "we
just don't care" overall.  You can get a particular instance shut
down, but there doesn't seem to be a serious attempt to backtrack &
prosecute, probably becaues things just cross so many boundries of
responsibility.
