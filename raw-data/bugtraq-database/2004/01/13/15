if it's a managed switch, most have SPAN (or RSPAN) port capability.  mirror
other ports to the sniffer port as appropriate.

.. see comment to #4, then comment to #3.  To be fair, it would greatly
depend on the physical configuration of hardware in the rack, the size/shape
of the WAP device, it's power requirements, etc.

Assuming that it was a managed switch and physical access was achived:
At the end of the day, a simple system which checks the configuration for
managed switches vs. a stored configuration (not unlike a tripwire
implimentation) every N hours would have nailed a scheme like this quickly.
Better switch management (MAC-locking access ports, centralized
authentication, etc) may have even prevented the problem in the first
place - unless they had an insider who had priv's on the switch and physical
access to the device.  As a wise man once said .. if you've got physical
access, the rest is academic.

.. on the whole, I'd have to agree there's much better than even odds of at
least insider help.
