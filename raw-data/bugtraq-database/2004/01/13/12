Subject: RE: [Fwd: [TH-research] OT: Israeli Post Office break-in]

Without access to the entire article or knowing more than the media writes 
it's really not possible to tell.  But from what you've posted.  That is 
an interesting story.  With some configuration networks can be somewhat 
secure.  But leaving a port wide open to the public is not the best 
physical security.  I have seen this in hospitals.  The hospital remodels 
a public area but somehow leaves ports accessible to the public.  I've 
often thought that it would probablly be pretty easy for someone to say 
purchase a wireless AP (pretty inexpensive these days) sit in the public 
area (i.e. waiting room) with a laptop or PDA, connect to the AP and start 
surfing.

This of course would require a bit of knowedge but not much.

I can't resist any longer. I have to ask a few questions.

1. How did they know which switch to connect to? Wouldn't this require 
some
knowledge of network topology.
2. If it is indeed a switch and not a hub, how did they obtain access to 
set
this port to monitor traffic?
3. How did they get access to the switch. Shouldn't it have been locked
away.
4. How did they convert electrons to money? Was this by raiding bank
accounts or collecting credit card numbers?
5. How could they be unable to hide a WAP in a rack (assuming the switch 
was
in a rack)? I can think of several ways to hide one without it being
visible.

Seems like a bit of an inside job to me, but I'm no Dick Tracy...
