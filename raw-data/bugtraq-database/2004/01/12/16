Having used those links in the past and gotten a black hole (no ack,
and no way to really include header information and similar material,
for a phishing variant which was not listed among the known variants,
and included compromised site information), there really needs to be a
better way.

As mentioned, I got better luck from the hosting firm, but that's
still not very satisfactory.
