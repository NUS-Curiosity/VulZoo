All,

To report such issues for Citibank or Citicards, please refer to the about email fraud link on www.citibank.com or www.citi.com.

Subject: Abuse report email for CitiBank/CitiCards?


Anyone know valid email addresses for reporting potential abuse or fraud at
to CitiBank.com/CitiCards.com?

I'd like to forward some fraud emails (e.g. "Please go to this link and
enter your card number and PIN that you use for ATM access...") for their
information, but most of the usual suspects (abuse@XXX, webmaster@XXX, etc.)
bounce and using their web searches or Google comes up with nothing about
reporting this kind of thing.

Also, any recommendations for other places where such reports should be
sent, for the general public's good (especially since companies like
CitiBank are apparently reluctant to admit that such fraud exists)?
