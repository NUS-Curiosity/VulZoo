	Translation - BOHICA, Cisco doesn't want people writing compatible
free network stacks, they want to patent TCP. RAND basically means no
free software, you must license on some terms. So we end up with
stupid situations like we did with VRRP (see
http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html for that sordid tale), and the IETF
will roll over and piddle on itself insted of standing up to this
nonsense like W3C does.  This is nasty.
