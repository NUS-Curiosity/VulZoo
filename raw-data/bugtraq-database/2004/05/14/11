               elevated privileges

NOTICE:
 There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
 provided that it remains complete and intact.

 The information in this Security bulletin should be acted upon
 as soon as possible.

INITIAL RELEASE:    10 May 2004

POTENTIAL SECURITY IMPACT:    elevated privileges for a local
                              authorized user.

SOURCE:    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
                HP Software Security Response Team

REFERENCES:    None

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY:

A potential vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX running
B6848AB GTK+ Support Libraries where a directory permissions issue
could be exploited to allow a local authorized user to gain
elevated privileges.

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*:  ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11 with B6848AB GTK+ Support Libraries
installed

BACKGROUND:
     The product B6848AB (GTK+ Libraries) is available for
    download from software.hp.com:

    < http://www.software.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/
     displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=B6848AB>

    The source files in this product are world writable.
    After the product is installed any user can modify the
    source.  If new libraries are to be built using this
    source code the files should be verified.

    The web page above has the following description of B6848AB:

      The GTK+ Libraries are the open source GNU toolkit for X
      windows development. The version provided here is
      unsupported, but is provided for use with the unsupported
      Mozilla browser for 10.20 and for old versions of Netscape
      (i.e. 6.2.1), which depend on it. We recommend upgrading to
      a newer browser/OS combo, such as Mozilla for HP-UX 11.0
      and later, which require a newer version of the GTK.


    Note: Product B6848BA (ximian gnome 1.4 gtk+ libraries for
          hp-ux) does NOT have this permissions problem.

     AFFECTED VERSIONS

     Note: To determine if a system has an affected version,
           search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
           for an affected fileset.  Then determine if the
           recommended patch or update is installed.


     HP-UX B.11.00
     HP-UX B.11.11
     =============
      GTK+.GTK+-SRC
      GLib.GLIB-SRC
      action: remove (optionally reinstall and change perms)
              install revision 1.2.10.2.1 or subsequent.

      Gettext.GETTEXT-SRC
      action: remove (optionally reinstall and change perms)
              install revision 0.10.39.2.1 or subsequent.

     END AFFECTED VERSIONS


RESOLUTION:
    Note: The directory permissions are secure in all versions
          of B6848BA.  However, only B6848BA revision 1.4.gm.46
          or subsequent resolves the permissions issue for
          directories installed by  B6848AB.

    Note:  B6848AB is only required for Netscape 6,  which is no
              longer supported on HP-UX.   The recommended
              solution is HP's Mozilla (www.hp.com/go/mozilla),
              which requires B6848BA.

    If B6848BA is needed:

    1. Remove B6848AB.
       This removes any potentially altered source files.
       However, the directories remain with unsafe permissions.

    2. Install B6848BA revision 1.4.gm.46 or subsequent.
       This corrects the directory permissions.

    3. Reinstall B6848AB if it is needed.

    If B6848BA is not needed and B6848AB is needed.

    1. Remove B6848AB.

    2. Reinstall B6848AB.

    3. Immediately make the following changes to directory
       permissions:

         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GLib/glib-1.2.8
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GLib/glib-1.2.8/docs
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GLib/glib-1.2.8/gmodule
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GLib/glib-1.2.8/gthread
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GLib/glib-1.2.8/tests
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GTK+/gtk+-1.2.10
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GTK+/gtk+-1.2.10/docs
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GTK+/gtk+-1.2.10/gdk
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GTK+/gtk+-1.2.10/gtk
         chmod 555 /opt/gnome/src/GTK+/gtk+-1.2.10/po
