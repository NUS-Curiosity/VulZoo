Subject: IE URL Issue Being Used In Phishing In the Wild [USBank]


One of our developers (Laurentiu Nicula) received an alarming type
of phishing attack today.

received: from UsBank.com ([82.33.97.75]) 

[82.33.97.75 = [ 82-33-97-75.cable.ubr10.azte.blueyonder.co.uk ]

The email looks legitimate enough, but links to:

http://validation-required.info/

The webpage attempts to throw up a little url bar of it's own
which covers IE's url bar. This allows a pretty convincing spoof
job to happen. 

The pop up looks just like IE's url bar, and it is even selectable.

This does not work in Netscape.

It is very similiar to Malware's issues of late. 

He protected the source pretty well, but it reveals some interesting
code which I googled to some Italian guy here (post made in December
of last year):

Here is the vulnerable code page:
