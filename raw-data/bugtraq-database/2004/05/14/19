Synopsis
========

When the verify=header_syntax option is set, there is a buffer overflow
in Exim that allows remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Exim is an highly configurable message transfer agent (MTA) developed
at the University of Cambridge.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/exim        <= 4.33                           >= 4.33-r1

Description
===========

When the option "verify = header_syntax" is used in an ACL in the
configuration file, Exim is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack that
can be triggered remotely by sending malicious headers in an email
message. Note that this option is not enabled in Exim's default
configuration file.

Impact
======

This vulnerability can be exploited to trigger a denial of service
attack and potentially execute arbitrary code with the rights of the
user used by the Exim daemon (by default this is the "mail" user in
Gentoo Linux).

Workaround
==========

Make sure the verify=header_syntax option is not used in your exim.conf
file.

Resolution
==========

All users of Exim should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-mail/exim-4.33-r1"
    # emerge ">=net-mail/exim-4.33-r1"
