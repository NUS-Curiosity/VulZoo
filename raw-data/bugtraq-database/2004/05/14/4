Subject: Vulnerability Scanning on Windows 2003 localhost will crash RPC




I don't know whether this is real vulnerability or not. But my Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition with latest patch will crashing RPC after doing local vulnerability scanning using Retina or Shadow Security Scanner. This will force Windows 2003 to shutdown.

Anyone experience this?

p/s: for Dave, I can't change my email address because it need to confirm with old email address which is doesn't valid anymore. Could you change my email to farking@...kage.org? Thanks
