Secretary of Energy Launches Initiatives To Bolster Security at Nuclear
Facilities
Improvements To Impact Cybersystems, Guard Force Protection, and
Consolidation of Nuclear Materials

AIKEN, S.C. - Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham announced a set of
sweeping new initiatives today to improve security across the
Energy Department's nationwide network of laboratories and defense
facilities, particularly those housing weapons-grade nuclear material.
Addressing a gathering of top security officers from across the DOE complex,
Abraham noted that the Energy Department, which develops and maintains the
nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, is responsible for protecting critical
national defense assets that "simply put, must not be allowed to fall into
the wrong hands."
The Secretary unveiled initiatives to expand the capabilities of DOE
security personnel, including possibly federalizing some security units
currently managed by contractors; consolidate sensitive nuclear material
into fewer locations; enhance protections of classified computer
information; upgrade security systems at key facilities; and make managers
more receptive to security concerns.
"Since the stakes are so high" Abraham told the security officers at DOE's
Savannah River Site, "everything is on the table," including the
possibilities of common labor-contract language for security groups across
the DOE complex or establishing "a special elite federal force" to protect
the most sensitive installations.
To maximize the effectiveness of DOE security forces, Abraham said the DOE
will consider the creation of a specialized security contingent to guard the
department's high-priority nuclear facilities, with capabilities similar to
the military's Delta Force or Navy SEAL units.
Abraham acknowledged recent reports of security lapses, such as lost keys,
at some DOE sites, but he called the incidents rare. "But frankly, rare or
not, they are unacceptable, and the failure of any and all levels of
management to address instances such as these will not be tolerated," he
said.
In a move to reduce the number of nuclear facilities that need high-level
protection, Abraham proposed consolidating special nuclear material - the
type used for weapons and other sensitive applications - into fewer sites.
The consolidation effort would remove the most-sensitive nuclear material
from Los Alamos National Laboratory's Technical Area 18 and the Sandia Pulse
Reactor facility in New Mexico, consolidate material stored at the Y-12
National Security Complex in Tennessee, and assess whether defense-related
work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California could be
relocated, allowing removal of special nuclear material from that facility.

To improve the protection of sensitive information, Abraham announced a
Cyber Security Enhancement Initiative to help "protect the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of all our information systems to assure that we
can continue to perform our missions even while under cyber attack."  The
initiative, to be implemented within the next year, would deploy
intrusion-detection systems to guard against potential cyber attacks,
improve procedures to guard against internet threats and enhance the
security of on-line information.
Citing past problems with computer disks and hard drives containing
classified information, Abraham proposed "an initiative to move to diskless
workstations for classified computing" to allow sensitive functions such as
weapons design to be performed in a more-secure diskless environment.
Addressing the issue of lost keys and key cards, Abraham said he intends to
"do away with the use of mechanical keys as an important part of our
protection system" and replace them with sophisticated new technologies that
will allow "a keyless security environment, where access is not afforded by
any physical item or object that can be lost or stolen."
Abraham also called for regular reviews of DOE security standards and
procedures to ensure "a modern efficient, effective guard force able to meet
21st century threats" and for new programs to train security officers and
test their readiness to respond to attacks or attempts to infiltrate
facilities.
He also discussed initiatives to recruit and train the best possible
candidates for DOE security jobs and to increase employee retention rates.
The initiatives include faster background checks for employee security
clearances and an intern program to help recruit "highly qualified technical
personnel in the areas of cyber security, nuclear material control and
physical security."
To ensure that DOE's security establishment functions effectively, the
Secretary also called for "a change in our management culture" to improve
the way the department accepts, analyzes and responds to criticisms and
concerns from outside the department as well as from employees, who Abraham
said should be confident about raising questions or concerns without fear of
retribution.
"If we are able to implement a system - a culture - where people can
legitimately air concerns, then everyone will benefit. Our workforce will be
more effective, the public's confidence in this department will improve, and
America's security will be greatly enhanced," he said.
"We are committed to making bold changes where necessary," Abraham said,
adding that the new security initiatives "are designed to build and support
the most robust and motivated protective force in the world."
