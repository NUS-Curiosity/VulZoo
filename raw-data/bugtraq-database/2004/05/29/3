Subject: LDU (land down under) xss vulnerability




About Product 
=============

LDU is a php/mysql website engine.

Description
===========

A cross site scripting vulnerability exist in the BBcodes of the LDU forum.

When you add a image to your message on the forum, the script doesn't check if it is javascript. 
I will give the following proof of concept:

[img]javascript:alert(document.cookie);[/img]

With this vuln, you are able to become any user who uses a browser that "supports" xss (like IE), so it is possible to become admin.
Further there also lies a browser independed problem, cause if you post this message:
[img]http://www.thesitewithLDU.com/auth.php?m=logout[/img]

everyone who reads the topic, will logout.

Solution
========

I e-mailed the LDU developers and the bug was fixed the same day i notified them. 

Update to the newest version of LDU 700.
