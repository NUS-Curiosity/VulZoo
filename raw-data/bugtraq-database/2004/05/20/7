Auditor security collection released

Just like to inform, that i have released my penetration test distro 
right now on my companys website under the gpl. The main difference 
between phlack, fire and knoppix-std is, that it is focused on 
usability. As you know remote-exploit.org was focused in the past on 
wireless stuff, so you can bet that all the wireless stuff is included. 
No hassle to configure kismet etc, just plug in the card, start the 
scanner and go. But don't missunderstand, it is not focused on 
wireless, check the short description below or go to my companys 
website to see details and download links.

Short description:

The Swiss Army Knife for security assessments. A Linux-based, unified 
platform focused on penetration tests. The robust power of Open-Source 
tools without the hassles of configuring hardware or installing any 
additional software. This powerful toolset is started directly from the 
CD-ROM without any local installation. Independent of system hardware, 
Auditor security collection provides the user with over 300 powerful 
analysis tools for troubleshooting and securing networks and systems. 
Delivering powerful, functional tools in a user-friendly environment 
while eliminating complex configuration was our goal when enhancing 
knoppix and designing Auditor security collection.

No other commercial or freely available analysis platform offers an 
equivalent level of usability with automatic configuration and focus on 
penetration testing.
