Oh for the record.  A few chips make it possible to have --x
permissions.

alpha (I am not positive)
sparc64 (I am not positive)

ia64
hppa
amd29k

m88k

The first two have software tlb refillers with a split tlb architecture,
but I am not sure if there is tlb "leak"

The next three have specific page table bits for kernel (r w x) and
user (r w x).

The last has a harvard-style split mmu (entirely different mmu for
code and data), and it should be possible to play games to do it...
