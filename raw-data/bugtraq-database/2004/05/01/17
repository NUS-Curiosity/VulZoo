Subject: Will the Sasser worm become the next Blaster?




The LSASS Sasser worm is spreading through the documented MS04-011 (LSASS) vulnerability. Presently this worm has not gotten to plague proportions but statistically it may well. 

Apart from the Sasser worm problem, there also remains the problem of human hackers exploiting this hole. Warez ftp hackers have already started using an exploit targeting unpatched systems creating "pubstro" warez dumps. The DCOM vulnerability saw numerous script kiddie tools created that allowed trojan hackers to upload and run trojan servers, will we see another wave of tools being created?
