1. Systems affected:

        All versions of KDE up to KDE 3.2.2 inclusive. 


2. Overview:

        iDEFENSE identified a vulnerability in the Opera Web Browser
        that could allow remote attackers to create or truncate
        arbitrary files. The KDE team has found that similar
        vulnerabilities exists in KDE.

        The telnet, rlogin, ssh and mailto URI handlers in KDE do not
        check for '-' at the beginning of the hostname passed, which
        makes it possible to pass an option to the programs started
        by the handlers.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2004-0411 to this issue.


3. Impact:

        A remote attacker could entice a user to open a carefully crafted
        telnet URI which may either create or truncate a file anywhere 
        where the victim has permission to do so. In KDE 3.2 and later
        versions the user is first explicitly asked to confirm the opening
        of the telnet URI.

        A remote attacker could entice a user to open a carefully crafted
        mailto URI which may start the KMail program with its display 
        redirected to a remote machine under control of the attacker.
        An attacker can then use this to gain full access to the victims
        personal files and account.

        An attacker could entice a user to open a carefully crafted
        mailto URI which may start the KMail program using a configuration
        file specified by the attacker. If the attacker is able to install
        arbitrary files somewhere on the machine, the attacker can include
        commands in the configuration file which will be executed with the
        privileges of the victim allowing the attacker to gain full access
        to the victims personal files and account.

4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
