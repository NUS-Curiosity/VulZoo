Subject: Re: Microsoft Internet Explorer ImageMap URL Spoof Vulnerability


i find that this apparently works just the same in mozilla firefox on gentoo linux 2004.1.  the only way to detect that this is an image, or an image map, at all is to look at the source, or to select the text, as right clicking does not allow saving image or copying image location.
