Subject: RE: Microsoft Internet Explorer ImageMap URL Spoof Vulnerability


This bug is identical to malware's, which he posted five days
ago.

http://securityfocus.com/archive/1/362800/2004-05-07/2004-05-13/0

They both utilize the map object to the same end.

This "finding" even uses the same name for the same gif as Malware's
did. 

It does appear to have obfuscated the original work so as to be
confusing, but that is it.
