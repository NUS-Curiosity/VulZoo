Subject: RE: Remote Buffer Overflow in MailEnable HTTPMail


Hi,

Thanks for the email. This error was not an overflow issue but a bug in the
service (i.e. the error would cause the service to stop, but could the
exploiter could not exploit this further or run code on the server).

A fix for the bug can be found at:

Thanks

Regarding to the heap overflow vulnerability of MailEnable  HTTPMail
(http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10312), i installed the latest hotfix
(http://mailenable.com/hotfix/MEHTTPS.zip), and found an additional
overflow.

Sending a request like:

c:\telnet localhost 8080
   GET / HTTP/1.0
   Authorization: A

Crashes the services. The overflow seems to occur in the Authorization
header variable. A single character will lead to the crash.

I did no further research in order to fully exploit this vuln. A more
detailed readme can be found on my website:
