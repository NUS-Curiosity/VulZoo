Subject: Opera Telnet URI Handler Vulnerability also applies to other browsers


Hello,

a new Security Advicory by iDEFENSE describes an Opera Telnet URI Handler 
File Creation/Truncation Vulnerability.
<http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=104&type=vulnerabilities>

The described vulnerability also works on:
 - Konqueror (KDE <= 3.2.1) (and maybe other Browsers using the khtml engine?)
 - Firefox <= 0.8 on MacOS
 - Safari (MacOS, - only reported, don't know what version)


Sorry that this is not a reply to an iDEFENSE post but here arrived 
nothing, yet.


Regards,
Jannes
