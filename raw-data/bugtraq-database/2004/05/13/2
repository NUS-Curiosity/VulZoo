Subject: Re: surfboard1.1.6 local exploit.


I'm...mildly impressed. Someone's still *using* that thing? Not that 
things have changed in this regard, but the latest version is 1.1.9, 
anyway.

Serious question, actually - they shouldn't exist, I know (believe me, I 
don't still code like that...), but exactly how severe is a hole such 
as this, which is only exploitable by the user who is running the 
daemon in the first place? Unless you're doing something like running 
the daemon as root, with a user-modifiable config file (at which point 
you have much more serious problems, like CGI), this doesn't actually 
escalate someone's privilege at all.

Unfortunately, fluffy has neglected the file actually 
responsible, /usr/local/bin/surfd. Sorry to break it to him/her/it :^)

fluffy also forgot the next line, which goes something along the lines 
of:
apt-get install apache

Seriously. You shouldn't be using this lump of junk. Anyway, you 
*definitely* shouldn't be using 1.1.6, cause there's a good couple of 
arbitrary-traversal holes in there, along with tons of bugs (something 
you'd know if you read the archives of this list). 1.1.9 was the latest 
at time of announcement, and v1.1.10 is now on the sourceforge site, 
for any fool who's still using it...
