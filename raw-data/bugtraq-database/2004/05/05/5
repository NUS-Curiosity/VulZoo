Just a short update.
Shortly after sending this mail we have been contacted by their Product
Manager.
BusinessObjects are now addressing the problem, and we are waiting a
patch to be issued so the technical details of the vulnerability can be
disclosed.

Sincerely,

Ofer Maor
Application Defense Center Manager
Imperva(tm) Inc.

Our Business Object's  representative was contacted but was not aware of
any security related issues. The email was forwarded to them and they
said they would be contacting Imperva.
