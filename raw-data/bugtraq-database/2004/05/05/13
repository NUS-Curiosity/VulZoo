Hello,

FYI:
A FreeBSD user suggested that this issue requires a security advisory.
The issue has been public for some time, but currently, FreeBSD does not
issue advisories for local denial-of-service issues.  It is expected
that this bug will soon be fixed in FreeBSD 4.x (it is already fixed
in FreeBSD 5.x, as you can see below).

Cheers,

A user can cause the kernel to allocate an unbounded amount of wired
memory, causing the machine to panic or stop responding. It's been observed
to happen under real workloads; that is, the circumstances are not so
contrived that the bug could only be caused by a malicious user.

I don't have any immediate plans to MFC it (I don't have any 4.x systems
right now), but peter@ or ps@ may want to after letting it settle for a
while in -current.
