Synopsis
========

With a specific configuration (using %f in the VirusEvent parameter),
Clam AntiVirus is vulnerable to an attack allowing execution of
arbitrary commands.

Background
==========

- From http://www.clamav.net/ :

"Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose
of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded
daemon, a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via
Internet. The programs are based on a shared library distributed with
the Clam AntiVirus package, which you can use with your own software.
Most importantly, the virus database is kept up to date."

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/clamav        < 0.70                             >= 0.70

Description
===========

The VirusEvent parameter in the clamav.conf configuration file allows
to specify a system command to run whenever a virus is found. This
system command can make use of the "%f" parameter which is replaced by
the name of the file infected. The name of the file scanned is under
control of the attacker and is not sufficiently checked. Version 0.70
of clamav disables the use of the "%f" parameter.

Impact
======

Sending a virus with a malicious file name can result in execution of
arbirary system commands with the rights of the antivirus process.
Since clamav is often associated to mail servers for email scanning,
this attack can be used remotely.

Workaround
==========

You should not use the "%f" parameter in your VirusEvent configuration.

Resolution
==========

All users of Clam AntiVirus should upgrade to the latest stable
version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-mail/clamav-0.70"
    # emerge ">=net-mail/clamav-0.70"
