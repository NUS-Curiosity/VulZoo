Synopsis
========

Several format string vulnerabilities are present in the Neon library
included in OpenOffice.org, allowing remote execution of arbitrary
code when connected to an untrusted WebDAV server.

Background
==========

OpenOffice.org is an office productivity suite, including word
processing, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

Affected packages
=================

Description
===========

OpenOffice.org includes code from the Neon library in functions related
to publication on WebDAV servers. This library is vulnerable to several
format string attacks.

Impact
======

If you use the WebDAV publication and connect to a malicious WebDAV
server, this server can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running OpenOffice.org.

Workaround
==========

As a workaround, you should not use the WebDAV publication facilities.

Resolution
==========

There is no binary version including the fix yet. All users of the
openoffice-bin and ximian-openoffice-bin packages making use of the
WebDAV publication functions should upgrade to the latest version of
the corresponding source-based package.

openoffice users on the x86 architecture should:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=app-office/openoffice-1.1.1-r1"
    # emerge ">=app-office/openoffice-1.1.1-r1"

openoffice users on the sparc architecture should:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=app-office/openoffice-1.1.0-r3"
    # emerge ">=app-office/openoffice-1.1.0-r3"

openoffice users on the ppc architecture should:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=app-office/openoffice-1.0.3-r1"
    # emerge ">=app-office/openoffice-1.0.3-r1"

openoffice-ximian users should:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=app-office/openoffice-ximian-1.1.51-r1"
    # emerge ">=app-office/openoffice-ximian-1.1.51-r1"
