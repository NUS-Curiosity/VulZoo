Remove your proxy setttings from IE and try navigating to
http://@@website_allowed.pt@...url - you will get an invalid syntax
error.

This is a problem with Squid, as I was able to replicate the same
bypassing with Opera.

 hello  im not a expert in this area, but i work in a intranet that
haves
the Squid/2.3.STABLE5 filtring all access's to the internet..   so i
don't
have access to the internet directaly, but i know that this proxy allow
access to especific web sites.. so, in the past if i us this:
http://url@...site_allowed.pt -> the vuln that is already discovered...
i have access to the website that i want...  but in this days, this vuln
is now fixed so...  in my test's i found this way to pass this proxy,
using: http://@@website_allowed.pt@...url -> now i have access...  using
@@url.pt@ i can bypass the proxy and access the internet, i don't know
how faur, this could go!!  so i don't know if this is a bug from IE or
just a simple bug from Squid.. ??? can anyone tell what we have in hands
?  PS: sorry my
