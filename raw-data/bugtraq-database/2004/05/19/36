Package:             cvs
Vulnerability:       remote code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= cvs-1.12.7-20040414      >= cvs-1.12.8-20040519
OpenPKG 2.0          <= cvs-1.12.5-2.0.1         >= cvs-1.12.5-2.0.2

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Stefan Esser discovered [1] a remote vulnerability in Concurrent
  Versions System (CVS) [0] servers. CVS up to version 1.12.7 contains
  a flaw when deciding if a CVS entry line should get a modified or
  unchanged flag attached. This results in a heap overflow which can
  be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the CVS server. This
  could allow a repository compromise. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2004-0396 [2] to the
  problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q cvs". If you have the "cvs" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get cvs-1.12.5-2.0.2.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig cvs-1.12.5-2.0.2.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild cvs-1.12.5-2.0.2.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/cvs-1.12.5-2.0.2.*.rpm
