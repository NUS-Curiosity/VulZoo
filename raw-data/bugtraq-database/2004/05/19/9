               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated metamail resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1305
Issue date:        2004-05-18
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1305
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0104 CAN-2004-0105
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------


- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated metamail packages that fix a number of vulnerabilities are now 
available.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:
Metamail is a system for handling multimedia mail.

Ulf Harnhammar discovered two integer overflow bugs and two buffer overflow 
bugs in versions of Metamail up to and including 2.7.  An attacker could 
create a carefully-crafted message such that when it is opened by a victim 
and parsed through Metamail, it runs arbitrary code as the victim.  The 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned 
the names CAN-2004-0104 and CAN-2004-0105 to these issues.

Users of Red Hat Linux 7.2 and 7.3 are advised to upgrade to these erratum 
packages, which contain a backported security patch and are not vulnerable 
to these issues.  Please note that Red Hat Linux 8 or newer does not 
contain Metamail and is therefore not vulnerable to these issues.

Red Hat would like to thank Michal Jaegermann for notification of this 
issue, and Ulf Harnhammar for the patch
for these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those 
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are 
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you 
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains 
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many 
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate 
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or 
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit 
http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum 
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is 
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or 
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
