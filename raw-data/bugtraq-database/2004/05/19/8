               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated mc resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1224
Issue date:        2004-05-18
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1224
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-1023
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------


- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated mc packages that fix remote buffer overflow vulnerabilities are now 
available.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386
Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:
Midnight Commander is a visual shell much like a file manager, only with 
many more features. It is a text mode application, but it also includes 
mouse support if you are running GPM. Midnight Commander's best features 
are its ability to FTP, view tar and zip files, and to poke into RPMs for 
specific files.

There exists a stack-based buffer overflow in vfs_s_resolve_symlink of 
vfs/direntry.c for Midnight Commander (mc) 4.6.0 and earlier, and possibly 
later versions, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code during 
symlink conversion.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Seth Vidal for bringing this issue to our 
attention.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those 
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are 
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you 
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains 
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many 
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate 
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or 
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit 
http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum 
and apt-get.
