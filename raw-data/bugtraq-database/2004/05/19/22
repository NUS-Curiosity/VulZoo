For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit
<URL:http://www.freebsd.org/security/>.

I.   Background

The Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is a version control system.  It
may be used to access a repository locally, or to access a `remote
repository' using a number of different methods.  When accessing a
remote repository, the target machine runs the CVS server to fulfill
client requests.

II.  Problem Description

Due to a programming error in code used to parse data received from
the client, malformed data can cause a heap buffer to overflow,
allowing the client to overwrite arbitrary portions of the server's
memory.

III. Impact

A malicious CVS client may run arbitrary code on the server at the
privilege level of the CVS server software.

IV.  Workaround

Administrators of CVS repositories should disable remote access
through the "pserver" mechanism.  CVS servers which only allow remote
access through the "ext" mechanism (using RSH or SSH) are not
affected.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE; or to the RELENG_5_2,
RELENG_4_9, or RELENG_4_8 security branch dated after the correction
date.

2) To patch your present system:

The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.7, 4.8,
4.9, 4.10, 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-04:10/cvs.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-04:10/cvs.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/cvs
# make obj && make depend && make && make install

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.
