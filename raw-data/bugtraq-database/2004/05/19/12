               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated mutt resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1285
Issue date:        2004-05-18
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1285
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0078
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------


- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

New mutt packages that fix a remotely-triggerable crash in the menu drawing 
code are now available.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

Mutt is a text-mode mail user agent.

A bug was found in the index menu code in versions of mutt. A 
remoteattacker could send a carefully crafted mail message that can cause 
mutt to segfault and possibly execute arbitrary code as the victim. The 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned 
the name CAN-2004-0078 to this issue.

It is recommended that all mutt users upgrade to these updated packages, 
which contain a backported security patch and are not vulnerable to this 
issue.


Fedora Legacy would like to thank Johnny Strom for notification of this 
issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those 
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are 
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you 
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains 
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many 
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate 
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or 
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit 
http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum 
and apt-get.

5. Bug IDs fixed:

i386:
http://download.fedoralegacy.org/redhat/8.0/updates/i386/mutt-1.4.1-0.8.x.1.legacy.i386.rpm

7. Verification:

SHA1 sum                                 Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is 
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or 
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
