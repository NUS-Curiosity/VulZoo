Not terribly likely; system() in perl forks a new process, potentially
executing a command interpreter:

    ... If there is only one scalar argument, the argument is checked
    for shell metacharacters, and if there are any, the entire argument
    is passed to the system's command shell for parsing...

If you can cajole a web server into passing fairly arbitrary information
into the system() function, you probably own the machine even without
this overflow.
