Oliver,

Quickly testing the below string at the command line does crash perl.exe.  I have ActivePerl 5.8.0 Build 805 install on a Windows 2000 machine.

perl -e "$a="A" x 256; system($a)"

hi folks,

i played around with ActiveState's ActivePerl for Win32, and crashed 
Perl.exe with the following command:

perl -e "$a="A" x 256; system($a)"

I wonder if this bug isnt known?!? Because system() is a very common 
command....
Can anybody reproduce this?

I put together a little advisory on my website, including version 
information and a debugger output (Drwatson):

PS:  Due to travel activity, i will not be able to respond to mails 
within the next 8 days!

Regards,

Oliver
