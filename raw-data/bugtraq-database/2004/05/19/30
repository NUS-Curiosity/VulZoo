This isn't really a hole in perl itself, but in the particular build of
perl compiled and shipped by one particular vendor.  I can not replicate
this on OpenBSD, Debian Linux, or Solaris.  Nor can I replicate it using
the version of perl supplied with Cygwin.

I'd be interested to hear if a similar bug exists in Activestate's build
of perl for Linux and Solaris, which I didn't try.

In any case, if an attacker can inject his choice of data into a
system() function, then all bets are off so this is not something that
the users should worry too much about.
