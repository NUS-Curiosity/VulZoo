               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated pwlib resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1296
Issue date:        2004-05-18
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1296
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0097
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------


- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated PWLib packages that contain fixes for security issues found during 
protocol testing by the NISCC are now available.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386

3. Problem description:

PWLib is a cross-platform class library designed to support the OpenH323 
project. OpenH323 provides an implementation of the ITU H.323 
teleconferencing protocol, used by packages such as Gnome Meeting.

A test suite for the H.225 protocol (part of the H.323 family) provided by 
the NISCC uncovered bugs in PWLib prior to version 1.6.0. An attacker 
could trigger these bugs by sending carefully crafted messages to an 
application. The effects of such an attack can vary depending on the 
application, but would usually result in a Denial of Service. The Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the 
name CAN-2004-0097 to this issue.

Users are advised to upgrade to the erratum packages, which contain 
backported security fixes and are not vulnerable to these issues.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Johnny Strom for notification of this 
issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those 
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are 
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you 
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains 
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many 
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate 
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or 
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit 
http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum 
and apt-get.

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or 
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
