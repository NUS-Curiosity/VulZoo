You're right. I forgot about witty, I read CAIDA's analysis of the
worm just yesterday.

Still, the infected population of witty was pretty small (I believe
~12,000 machines in a day?) compared to SQLexp (~200,000 [1]),
Slammer
(~75,000-100,000 [2]), CodeRed (~360,000 in 12 hours [3]), Nimda
(around 1.6 times CodeRed, maybe over 500,000 systems? [4]). I don't
find data for Blaster, but I presume it infected  many more systems
than Nimda.  So I believe we might be facing a worm that will infect
over 1,000,000 systems.

Probably anti-virus vendors will have more accurate data. But I
haven't seen it, not even in Symantec's (excellent) Threat Report V
(December 2003) [5]. In any case, this worm was "predicted" by that
same report. I would like to suggest everyone to read it thouroughly
(Disclaimer: I don't work at Symantec).

Javier
