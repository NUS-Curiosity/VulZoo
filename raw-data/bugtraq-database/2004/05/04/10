I suspect you mis-read, or the article was badly written/edited.  That 
combination _is_ specifically mentioned by Microsoft as a configuration 
known to exhibit problems post-MS04-011:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;841382

However, my reading of that KB article is not that that is the only 
configuration that may cause trouble.  In particular:

   Note This problem may occur if other drivers or services do not
   load successfully. This workaround is specific to the Nortel
   Networks VPN client drivers.

Also, as the hotfix that is now available to address this issue 
replaces these core files:

   Mountmgr.sys
   Ntkrnlmp.exe
   Ntkrnlpa.exe
   Ntkrpamp.exe
   Ntoskrnl.exe   

it seems quite unlikely that this problem would be specific to just one 
common VPN client configuration...
