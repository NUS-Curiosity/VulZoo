What's more disturbing is that this worm has established a new record 
for Microsoft worms [1]. Blaster was the fastest worm (25 days since 
the patch was published to the worm), this one has been even faster 
(17 days for the first variant since the patch was published to the 
worm). Of course, I'm not considering the fact that this issue was 
known, at least to eEye and Microsoft, for over 5 months.

[1] Approaching the record of worms in other OS, which, I believe, is 
held by Scalper (10 days from patch to worm). But hey, they could 
browse the source changes for that one.
