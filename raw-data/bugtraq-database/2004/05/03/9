Another false positive is IRIX boxes which listen to port 5554/tcp for
esp-httpd (their "Embedded Support Partner").  From the default
/etc/inetd.conf:
sgi-esphttp stream  tcp wait   root  /usr/etc/esphttpd   esphttpd -u300

To cut down on false positives, I tried scanning for BOTH 5554/tcp AND
9996/tcp.  Unfortunately we found that very few (about 2%) of the
infected machines had both ports open.  Another 1% had only port
9996/tcp open.  The remaining 97% had only 5554 open.
