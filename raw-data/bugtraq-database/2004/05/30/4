Subject: RS-2004-1: SquirrelMail "Content-Type" XSS vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello,

I discovered a new XSS vuln in SquirrelMail which is quite dangerous
since it could be exploited simply by sending a specially crafted mail
to the victim. The victim only has to read the email in order to
trigger the exploit. This bug is present in latest versions (as well
as older ones).

I also noticed that latest Debian stable distro ships a very old
version of SquirrelMail, which is vulnerable to several old XSS bugs
(in addition to the new one).

Detailed info is included in attached advisory. Just in case of
problems with the attachment, you can download it from my site:
http://www.rs-labs.com/adv/RS-Labs-Advisory-2004-1.txt

Finally, I'd like to publicly state that somebody is using my nickname
(RoMaNSoFt) for mass-defacing PHP-Nuke sites (and some other nasty
actions like claiming to be the author of docs written by me) in a
clear attempt to incriminate myself. I'm not either a defacer, neither
a cracker. So please, don't mistake that script-kiddie with the real
RoMaNSoFt. Contact me for additional information or if you've been
affected/attacked by this likely Moroccan kiddie.

Regards from Spain,
 --Roman
