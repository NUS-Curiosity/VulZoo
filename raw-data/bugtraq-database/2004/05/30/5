As per your link....  I apologise for the paste.....

>It happened again today. Another one sold out, sacrificing their dreams
>to the corporate security machine.

Yeah sold out to prove there peers on irc that they are better then anyone
else, does it make you feel good ? your part of a dream, nothing more then
an interperation......

>Damn whitehats, noone believes in a cause anymore.

Yawn..... heard this before......

>Another bug was released today to the security mailing lists.

Sorry was using this bug to your own advantage..... like a kid being ratted
on by his friend for having his hand in the cookie jar.... heard of the term
grow up ?

>Damn Whitehats, they know not what they do. 

Is there a parrot in the house ?

>Another potential computer genius was relegated to an existence of nothing
>more than than a 9-5 cubicle-dwelling promotional tool. 

Really ? you have first hand experience of this ? shouting out the link for
this ? what experience do you have ? I'm guessing none....

>Damn whitehats, putting money before discovery.

Your getting repetitive.......

>Another family was ravaged by cooperations and governments bent on

Ever heard of life ?

>Another kid was sentenced today for searching for a way to understand
>the world. Convicted and imprisoned, not because of what he did, but
>because of what others thought he could do. 

Don't you mean another kid was comparing the size of his penis on irc and
got caught because he was trying to be 'elite'..........

>Damn Whitehats - Fear keeps them in business. 

No, it's people like you that that keep white hats in business, now tell me,
if you and your kind wasn't around, white hats wouldn't be around
either.....

Now your just ranting.......

>Damn Whitehats, you were once like us.

Maybe some were, but they grow up, they realized the damage that's caused to
innocent individuals and business, does the word terrorist spring to mind ?

>I was a Whitehat. I had an awakening. I saw the security industry for

I doubt you were a white hat, or if you were, you felt you couldn't cut the
grade with your peers.......

>I wanted to know, I wanted to understand, I wanted to go further then
>the rest. I never want to be held down by contracts and agreements.

Does that mean causing damage to peoples files ? to peoples lively hoods ?

>You say I should grow up. You say I should find better things to do with

No one is asking you to forget, no one is asking you to fall in line, are
you saying you can't be unique ? are you saying you don't have a mind ? what
this is saying is you can't follow the lines of a white hat, but you can
follow the lines of a black hat ? different people, different rules... but
at the end of the day, your following an ideal, your following the ideals
set down by your peers..... hypocrite....

What are you then, a rainbow warrior ? I think you should really read this
the whole way through, before your starting linking to it..... just shows
more of your ignorance....

Most people can see you for what you are, it's not a pretty picture and I am
guessing that at the end of the day, your be another face that is never
remembered......

So your not criminals ? so the dDoS'ing, the hacking, the rooting, it's
legal, it's fine to cause havoc on a machine that's used for business ? are
are you an ethical hacker, do you have morals ? or are you one of those that
just want to make a name for themselves,

So you are a criminal ? nah your crime is causing damage, your crime is
trying to be the best, maybe when you have grown up, your understand, every
action has a consequence, you think too small, yeah you may hit a vendor,
what happens to the guy who relys on the vendor to provide a service ? does
he deserve that ? are you that narrow minded ?

>I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You can't stop me, and you
>certainly can't stop us all. 


No your another elite plank who needs to start thinking, who needs to start
seeing the consequences of his actions.........

Oh and regards to your tag line "Destroying something good has always been
damn easy compared to creating new work which obsiously requires much more
knowledge, talent and brain!".

I don't think that fits with the above manifesto........ maybe you should
read it all the way through...

Greetz....

You are the fucking kid! You're the fucking security industry! There 
will be no public exploits according to my conversation with virulent. 
Next time use authors e-mail for thanksgiving please.

"Destroying something good has always been damn easy compared to creating

 new work which obsiously requires much more knowledge, talent and brain!".

Well,  gaining shell requires extra understanding and imagination!
