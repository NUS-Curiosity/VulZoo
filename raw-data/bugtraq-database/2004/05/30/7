 ADSL Router Authentication Bypass Vulnerability


3Com OfficeConnect Remote 812 ADSL Router Authentication Bypass
Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 05.27.04
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=106&type=vulnerabilities
May 27, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

The 3Com OfficeConnect Remote 812 ADSL Router is a standalone
bridge/router, with interfaces to a Local Area Network and an ADSL
interface to a Wide Area Network.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an authentication bypass vulnerability in 3Com's
OfficeConnect Remote 812 ADSL Router could allow remote users to
arbitrarily manipulate network traffic.

By making multiple successive authorization attempts to connect to the
router, it is eventually possible to authenticate with any
username/password combination. While the root cause of the vulnerability
is not known, exploitation is trivial and does not require either a
known username or password.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform any administrative
function that a legitimate administrator could perform.

More information about the 3Com OfficeConnect Remote 812 ADSL Router is
available at

rt&sku=3CP4144.

IV. DETECTION

Router with the last firmware patch is vulnerable

V. WORKAROUNDS
