Package:             ssmtp
Vulnerability:       denial of service, code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:      Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= ssmtp-2.48-20040207  >= ssmtp-2.60.8-20040507
OpenPKG 2.0          <= ssmtp-2.48-2.0.0     >= ssmtp-2.48-2.0.1
OpenPKG 1.3          <= ssmtp-2.48-1.3.0     >= ssmtp-2.48-1.3.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Two format string bugs were discovered in sSMTP [1], a simple
  sending-only Mail Transport Agent (MTA). Untrusted values in the
  functions die() and log_event() were passed to printf(3)-like
  functions as format strings. These vulnerabilities could potentially
  allow remote mail relays to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) and
  possibly execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2004-0156 [2] to the
  problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  ssmtp". If you have the "ssmtp" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution) [3][4].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get ssmtp-2.48-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig ssmtp-2.48-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild ssmtp-2.48-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/ssmtp-2.48-2.0.1.*.rpm
