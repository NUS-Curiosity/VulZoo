Out of interest, do you happen to know if your proxy also uses Dansguardian?  I ask because I work for the company behind CensorNet 
(www.censornet.com) and we recently had to make a modification to the Dansguardian code in order that the school kids that form the vast 
bulk of our user base couldn't get to prohibited sites by the slight of putting a trailing dot at the end of the url they wanted to visit.

We've fixed things such that invalid url's are no longer possible.  I ask because, our Access Denied page also claims to be a service provided 
by Squid/2.3 STABLE5.  Yet the problem was with DG and not Squid.
