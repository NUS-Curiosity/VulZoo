Subject: Zen Cart login.php SQL Injection Vulnerability




Overview:
"Zen Cartï¿½ truly is the art of e-commerce; a free, user-friendly, open source shopping cart system."

Description:
An input validation vulnerability has been reported in Zen Cart, allowing a remote user to inject SQL commands.

The '/admin/login.php' file does not properly validate user-supplied input in the "admin_name" and "admin_pass" variables. A remote user can create a specially crafted HTTP POST request to inject SQL commands to be executed by the underlying database.


Affected:
Zen Cart version 1.1.2d.


Solution:
Edit source to ensure user-supplied input is correctly verified and filter malicious characters and character sequences in a HTTP proxy or firewall with URL filtering capabilities.
