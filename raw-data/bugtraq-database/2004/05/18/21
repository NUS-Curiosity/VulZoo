Subject: Unknown IE bug with css-styles




Heya ppl!,

I was coding around a bit..
When I was testing the html code with internet explorer, the damn thing started to crash! (Including all other IE's that where open at the same time)

Iï¿½ve tested it several times (on different machines) and all had the same problem.

it has something to do with the loading of the css styles from a file in a <table>

it doesn't seem to be exploitable..
