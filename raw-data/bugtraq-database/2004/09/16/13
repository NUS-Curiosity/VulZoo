Synopsis
========

Several bugs exist in the Heimdal ftp daemon which could allow a remote
attacker to gain root privileges.

Background
==========

Heimdal is an implementation of Kerberos 5.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/heimdal       < 0.6.3                          >= 0.6.3

Description
===========

Przemyslaw Frasunek discovered several flaws in lukemftpd, which also
apply to Heimdal ftpd's out-of-band signal handling code.

Additionally, a potential vulnerability that could lead to Denial of
Service by the Key Distribution Center (KDC) has been fixed in this
version.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could be able to run arbitrary code with escalated
privileges, which can result in a total compromise of the server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Heimdal users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=app-crypt/heimdal-0.6.3"
    # emerge ">=app-crypt/heimdal-0.6.3"
