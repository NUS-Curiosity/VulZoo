Subject: RE: Microsoft GDIPlus.DLL JPEG Parsing Engine Buffer Overflow


 I am trying to distribute the patch via patch management software, the
problem is, Do I replace all incarnations if gdiplus.dll? 

If I have a win2k box running IE6 sp1, I install the IE6 patch. 

Fine, I can handle that, but what about my win2k boxes running AutoCAD
2004, Visio, IE6 and Dreamweaver? (all have gdiplus.dll, not sure which
ones need updating, but since the app versions of the dll are 5.1.3097.3
(.net) and 5.1.3097 (ACAD) and the ms replacement dll's are 5.1.3102 I
am assuming yes)

Is the package I should write is <script that looks for the DLL version
X and above, then replaces it with version Y> Would I use the SDK dll
for these other apps? Anyone know how to query for a dll version?

Suggestions responses, and posting this will be greatly appreciated!!

Ps: ARRRgh!!

P.p.s: Am I missing the all in one patch? Is the GDI+ Detection Tool
available as download? Will the GDI detection tool search through non-ms
sw?
