September 16, 2004

I. BACKGROUND

Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold is a Microsoft Windows based network monitoring
application. More information is available at

    http://www.Ipswitch.com/products/whatsup/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service vulnerability in Ipswitch
Inc.'s WhatsUp Gold allows attackers to cause the application to crash.

The problem specifically exists in the handling of reserved DOS device
names. By generating a GET request for 'prn.htm' to the HTTP daemon
installed by WhatsUp Gold, the application crashes and the following
Runtime Library error is displayed:

    Runtime Error!
    Program: C:\Program Files\WhatsUp\whatsupg.exe
    abnormal program termination

Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated remote attackers to crash
the WhatsUp Gold application, thereby preventing legitimate usage. The
WhatsUp Gold web server is not enabled by default.
