Subject: Re: Vulnerability in IBM Windows XP: default hidden Administrator account allows local Administrator access


This "hidden" Administrator account is part of Windows XP and NOT IBM's
porblem.
Every Windows XP system ships and installs with the Administrator and blank
password.
This "hidden" account has been known about for some time, just like Windows
2000
Administrator account is the same way. There are ways to disable or change
the
Administrator name and password or to disable the account completely.
