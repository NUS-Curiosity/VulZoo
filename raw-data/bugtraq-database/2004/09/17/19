This flaw has been fixed.

I would like to take this opportunity to first state that ProBoards does not run on YaBB software as the author of this thread implies.  We run on our own in-house developed software, which the YaBB team will vouch for.

Also I would like to note that we were not notified of this vulnerability until last last night, nearly 24 hours after it was posted here.  I respectfully request of the author of this post to first contact the vendor as is the standard courtesy for these situations.  Not contacting the vendor first is irresponsible.
