Problem first discovered on: Sun, 11 Apr 2004
Published on: Tue, 7 Sept 2004
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity:
---------
Medium


Overview:
---------
  A vulnerability in Usermin's Web mail function could result in
  arbitrary OS command execution upon viewing a specially crafted 
  HTML mail.


Problem Description:
--------------------
  Usermin is a web interface that allows all users on a Unix system 
  to easily receive mails and to perform SSH and mail forwarding
  configuration.

  A vulnerability exists in Usermin because the module responsible 
  for mail transmission fails to sanitize HTML mails including a link 
  to another Usermin module.  An attacker could take advantage of this 
  problem to execute arbitrary OS commands with the privileges of the 
  Usermin user.


Affected Versions:

  Usermin Version 1.070
  Usermin Version 1.080


Solution:
---------
  This problem can be addressed by upgrading Usermin to version 1.090.
