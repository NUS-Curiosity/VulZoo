The FTP site that was hosting the files was taken down. If anyone
would like to take a peek at the files used (for educational purposes
only of course), let me know off list. I grabbed a copy.

I'd also have to agree with Gerry. This doesn't replicate or spread
once executed - it just exploits the local machine, installing a
trojan/irc-bot, then connecting back. Still the first of it's kind
that I'd seen.
