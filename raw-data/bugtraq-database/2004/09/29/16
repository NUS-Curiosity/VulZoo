	vulnerabilities

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated cadaver resolves security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1552
Issue date:        2004-09-29
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1552
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0179, CAN-2004-0398
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated cadaver packages that fix multiple security vulnerability are
now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

An updated cadaver package that fixes a vulnerability in neon exploitable
by a malicious DAV server is now available.

cadaver is a command-line WebDAV client that uses inbuilt code from neon,
an HTTP and WebDAV client library.

Versions of the neon client library up to and including 0.24.4 have been
found to contain a number of format string bugs. An attacker could create
a malicious WebDAV server in such a way as to allow arbitrary code
execution on the client should a user connect to it using cadaver. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name CAN-2004-0179 to this issue. This issue was addressed in a previous
update for Red Hat Linux 9.

Stefan Esser discovered a flaw in the neon library which allows a heap
buffer overflow in a date parsing routine. An attacker could create
a malicious WebDAV server in such a way as to allow arbitrary code
execution on the client should a user connect to it using cadaver. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name CAN-2004-0398 to this issue.

Users of cadaver are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains patches correcting these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata 
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those 
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are 
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you 
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains 
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many 
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate 
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or 
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit 
http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/ for directions on how to configure yum 
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is 
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or 
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
