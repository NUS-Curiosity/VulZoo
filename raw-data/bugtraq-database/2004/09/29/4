	This criticism is not correct. The whole point of cryptographically-secure
voting systems is that you *don't* have to trust the code being run. If your
vote wasn't counted, you can trivially demontrate this. If a group of
Democrats in Florida want ot make sure all their members votes were counted,
they can easily do so. If someone pressures you to vote a particular way,
you can prove that it is impossible for anyone to know how you voted. And so
on.

	With the schemes proposed, about the only thing someone can do is
physically prevent you from voting. Any other kind of tampering would be
detectable by anyone who audited the cryptographic records. All you need to
do is require that those records be public.
