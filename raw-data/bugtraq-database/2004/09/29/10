I see your meaning. So, I agree.

I hope Microsoft fundamentally address the issue in the future.
In the meantime, I expect you (Microsoft) to do something for their problems 
piece by piece.
Don't leave "img src=file://..." as it is for 7 years.
I think many people use Windows by default but get WindowsUpdate. They 
aren't aware that they use weak LM authentication.

Kind regards,
