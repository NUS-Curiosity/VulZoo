How do you know that the software generating the audit trail is playing 
fair if it's closed source?

Sometimes, IMHO, there's just no alternative to pen and paper.  Surely 
the manual method of ticking a box and having multiple human vote 
counters checking ballots is the best option going, even if it is more 
expensive.  (I confess I've no idea what costs are involved either way.)
