Hi,

I did that using the DOS prompt (using a plain text file as source). Then, 
opening Windows Explorer, I tried opening the properties window by 
right-clicking the aux file... however, this caused explorer to crash.

I tested this issue on two systems running Windows 2000 Professional. I 
haven't been able to test it on any other versions of Windows. Anybody else 
noticed this?

regards,

Lise
