This is where the "voter-verified" part of "voter-verified audit trail" 
comes from.  The software produces a visible hardcopy of the voter's 
choice, which the voter has a chance to inspect before it is deposited 
in a ballot box.  Assuming reasonable precautions are taken to prevent 
physical tampering with these boxes, the software record of the votes 
cast can be compared at any time with the paper record - and the paper 
record would have primacy in the event of any discrepancy.
