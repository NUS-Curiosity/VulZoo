Subject: CoD United Offensive boom boom



An update for the Call of Duty bug
(http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/codboom-adv.txt)

The 15th September 2004 has been officially released the expansion pack
called United Offensive.
It is an expansion pack but uses a new executable that unfortunally has not
been fixed for the shutdown bug I reported to the developers the 1st July
2004.
To note that the executable (CoDUOMP.exe version 1.41) has been compiled the
23th August 2004 so when the developers were aware of the bug from over 8
weeks.

I have released an unofficial fix for it:

A big thanx goes to Andy Rafter (dj.gandy@...world.com) to have reported me
this useful information.


BYEZ
