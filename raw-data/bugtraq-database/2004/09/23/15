Subject: Re: ICMP spoofed source tunneling


At the risk of possibly sinking my foot firmly into my mouth, it appears
that you've implemented an unimplemented feature of LOKI2 (circa 1997).
ref: http://www.phrack.org/show.php?p=51&a=6

If you look in the source at the link referenced, specifically the 
help() function, you'll find:

%s dest\t-  redirect to another client [ UNIMPLIMENTED ]\n",

Nifty none-the-less.

Kind Regards,
