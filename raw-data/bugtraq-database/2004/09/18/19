Averatec laptop installs of XP Home have it hidden; you have to boot in
Safe Mode to add a password.

The documentation that specifies this is a Microsoft product, so I
suspect it's the same with other installs of Home, but I have only left
the packaged install of XP Home on one machine ever, so I am not at all
sure of this.
