Subject: Re: [exploitwatch.org] ALERT: Windows XP JPEG Buffer Overflow POCExploit



I may not have a clue but when I read the email from the author of this "POC" it stated that it was a poc to show where the overflow will occur and doesn't actually exploit the vulnerability. Furthermore the vulnerability is a heap based overflow which means that successful worm like exploitation isn't really the highest possibility as you suggest in your fear based email.
Simply,
Dan

A PoC for the Windows XP JPEG has been published. Because of the potential
impact, it is anticipated that this exploit will be widely used by worms and
other malware within a short period of time.
