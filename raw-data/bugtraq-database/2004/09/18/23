You said you had never seen "a Windows install" where the Administrator
account didn't show.  I told you about a very common Windows install
where that is true.

A more appropriate response when someone expands your knowledge would be
"thank you".  Another good one would be "huh, didn't know that" or "you
learn something new every day."

No response at all would be acceptable, and more in keeping with
commonly-agreed standards of mailing list ettiquette.

Unless you are contending that Windows XP Home isn't Windows.
