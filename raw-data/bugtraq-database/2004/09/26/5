It is impossible for a company to be non-partisan. That is why it would
be nice to develop an open source solution. That would be non-partisan.
Having being created by democrats, republicans, anarchists, whoever
wanted to contribute.

The problem is both technical and political.  The political impacts the
technical -- the technical aspect doesn't exist in a bubble.

Likewise, I wouldn't trust a voting machine that was created by a
company whose executives promised elections to democrats. 

I wasn't making a point about the party, I was making a point about the
appearance of partisanship.  Voting machine companies should be
inherently non-partisan.
