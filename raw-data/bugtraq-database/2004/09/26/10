All three issues have been addressed, and updates have been posted at 
http://www.pd9soft.com/. Thank you for bringing them to my attention.

However in the future, would it be too much to ask that I am contacted 
first?  I am very eager to fix any security vulnerabilities, but sipping 
coffee on a lazy Sunday afternoon and seeing this broadcast to a public 
list is a little disconcerting.

Thanks,
