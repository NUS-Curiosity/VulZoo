Subject: Re: Diebold Global Election Management System (GEMS) Backdoor Account    Allows Authenticated Users to Modify Votes


I usually stay comfortably hidden in lurkland but I'm a bit confused. Maybe someone here can enlighten me.

A few years ago I read Bruce Schneiers Applied Cryptography. Everything in the book which I tested or looked up independantly turned out to be true and it enjoyed an excellent reputation in our computer science department.

This book has a whole section on electronic voting. In it, Mr. Schneier lists several thing which we expect a voting system to provide; anonymity, accountability, verifiability, and others. He also points out that there is a theoretical limit to the level to which all of these can be satisfied. That is, we can never guarantee all of them with 100% confidence. This limit seems to extended to all voting systems whether they are electronic, paper based, clay-shards-in-an-amphora, or raised hands.

But we can choose the levels at which we will guarantee each characteristic and get them to levels at which we are comfortable. Mr. Scneier also presented an open protocol using public key cryptography which does just that. It doesn't involve hidden code, it doesn't require an actual physical paper trail and, as far as I know, noone has ever pointed out any flaws in it.

So my question is, given that this seems to be a solved problem why is there so much debate on finding the solution? Surely I am missing something obvious.
