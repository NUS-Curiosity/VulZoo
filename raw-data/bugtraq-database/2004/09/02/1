Comments:

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities will allow an attacker to 
completely compromise the OS and the database if Oracle is running on 
Windows platform, because Oracle must run under the local System account 
or under an administrative account. If Oracle is running on *nix then 
only the database would be compromised because Oracle runs mostly under 
oracle user which has restricted permissions.


Workaround:

-Check packages permissions and remove public permissions. Set minimal 
permissions that fit your needs.
-Restrict users to execute PL/SQL statements directly over the server.
-Periodically audit user permissions on all database objects.
-Lock users that aren't used.
-Change default passwords.
-Keep Oracle up to date with patches.

Vendor Contact:
Vendor was contacted and has released fixes.
