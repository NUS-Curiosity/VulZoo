 of Service



Close wait means the application locally has not closed
the file descriptor, yet the remote end has sent
a FIN.

This is %99 of the time an application bug.

But since you haven't provided much detail of the problem
nobody will ever know exactly what you're talking about.

Please, do me and everyone else here on this list a real huge
favor, don't post bug reports without all the details, you're
just wasting everyone's time.  If it's exploitable, even more
reason to post every single detail so we can work on a fix if
necessary as fast as possible.
