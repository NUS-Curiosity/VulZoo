DBAN is a nice little tool to wipe disks. Not so good for cleaning up
mem or slack space though, or not so I'd noticed.

"Darik's Boot and Nuke ("DBAN") is a self-contained boot floppy that
securely wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will automatically
and completely delete the contents of any hard disk that it can detect,
which makes it an appropriate utility for bulk or emergency data
destruction."
