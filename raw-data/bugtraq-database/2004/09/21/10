FWIW, some (two?) distributions have privsep'ed telnetd by now, where
the immediate impact of this flaw (if it were present there) would be
code execution as pseudo-user "telnetd" chrooted to /var/empty. (*)
This was first implemented by Chris Evans in 2000 and patches posted
on the security-audit mailing list.  My re-implementation of it in
Openwall GNU/*/Linux differs slightly:

	http://www.openwall.com/presentations/Owl/mgp00017.html
	http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/telnet/

(*) Of course, while not as bad as immediate root, this level of
access would still be quite nasty: it means ability to mount further
attacks off the system and ability to attack the system's own kernel
via syscall interfaces (possibly ultimately gaining root access, if a
suitable kernel bug is present, known to the attacker, and is
successfully exploited).
