Synopsis
========

New releases of Mozilla, Epiphany, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Mozilla
Firefox fix several vulnerabilities, including the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Mozilla is a popular web browser that includes a mail and newsreader.
Epiphany is a web browser that uses Gecko, the Mozilla rendering
engine. Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird are respectively the
next-generation browser and mail client from the Mozilla project.

Description
===========

Mozilla-based products are vulnerable to multiple security issues.
Firstly routines handling the display of BMP images and VCards contain
an integer overflow and a stack buffer overrun. Specific pages with
long links, when sent using the "Send Page" function, and links with
non-ASCII hostnames could both cause heap buffer overruns.

Several issues were found and fixed in JavaScript rights handling:
untrusted script code could read and write to the clipboard, signed
scripts could build confusing grant privileges dialog boxes, and when
dragged onto trusted frames or windows, JavaScript links could access
information and rights of the target frame or window. Finally,
Mozilla-based mail clients (Mozilla and Mozilla Thunderbird) are
vulnerable to a heap overflow caused by invalid POP3 mail server
responses.

Impact
======

An attacker might be able to run arbitrary code with the rights of the
user running the software by enticing the user to perform one of the
following actions: view a specially-crafted BMP image or VCard, use the
"Send Page" function on a malicious page, follow links with malicious
hostnames, drag multiple JavaScript links in a row to another window,
or connect to an untrusted POP3 mail server. An attacker could also use
a malicious page with JavaScript to disclose clipboard contents or
abuse previously-given privileges to request XPI installation
privileges through a confusing dialog.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround covering all vulnerabilities.

Resolution
==========

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv your-version
    # emerge your-version
