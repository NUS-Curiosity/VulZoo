At our website https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=85616
is a patch for PHPMyWebHosting v0.3.4 available, which now reads the
login forms and makes some checks on the data and closes sql
injection at login screen.

Next release version will be 0.5.0 where all data is checked against
several mysql and php functions to avoid sql injection.
