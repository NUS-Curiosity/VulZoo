Subject: Re: Mambo Portal lasted version 4.5.1 (1.09) and lower vesion :
	SQL injection Vulnerability.


Question:

Did you even bother to contact the vendor? Because if you had, you would
have been told that this is NOT a Mambo security flaw. 

It affects a third party add-on called Remository that is not part of
the core Mambo software. 

Please correct this security report, and also contact the developers of
Remository so that they can correct the flaw. If you don't know who the
developer of Remository is, you can find out through the site that you
hacked using this exploit. >:-|
