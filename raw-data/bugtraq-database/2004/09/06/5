Synopsis
========

Active keystroke logging in multi-gnome-terminal has been discovered in
potentially world-readable files. This could allow any authorized user
on the system to read sensitive data, including passwords.

Background
==========

multi-gnome-terminal is an enhanced terminal emulator that is derived
from gnome-terminal.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                         /  Vulnerable  /       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-terms/multi-gnome-terminal     < 1.6.2-r1         >= 1.6.2-r1

Description
===========

multi-gnome-terminal contains debugging code that has been known to
output active keystrokes to a potentially unsafe location. Output has
been seen to show up in the '.xsession-errors' file in the users home
directory. Since this file is world-readable on many machines, this bug
has the potential to leak sensitive information to anyone using the
system.

Impact
======

Any authorized user on the local machine has the ability to read any
critical data that has been entered into the terminal, including
passwords.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All multi-gnome-terminal users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=x11-terms/multi-gnome-terminal-1.6.2-r1"
    # emerge ">=x11-terms/multi-gnome-terminal-1.6.2-r1"
