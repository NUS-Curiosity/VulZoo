Subject: New Data Wipe Tools


I've created a few simple shell scripts that use /dev/urandom to wipe data 
from the swap partition, wipe unused disk space on the root partition, or 
wipe an entire disk.  You'll find them at http://basicsec.org/tools.html.

Data hygiene is generally easier on *nix because there are fewer hiding places 
than on a Windows system, but there are no free wipe tools that i'm aware of.  
So I got busy.

This is not a perfect solution, but it's a step.  I'd be delighted to knows 
from fellow list members what I might do to improve them.  The scripts are 
freely available and freely modifyable (is "modifyable" a legitimate word?) 

PS: See the README file for cautions, exceptions, and caveats.

thanks,
