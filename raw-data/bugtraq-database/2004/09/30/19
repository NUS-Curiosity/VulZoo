Keywords:          Bugfix

1. Topic:

An updated rsync package that fixes several security issues is now
available.

The rsync program synchronizes files over a network.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Rsync before 2.6.1 does not properly sanitize paths when running a
read/write daemon without using chroot. This could allow a remote
attacker
to write files outside of the module's "path", depending on the
privileges
assigned to the rsync daemon. Users not running an rsync daemon, running
a
read-only daemon, or running a chrooted daemon are not affected by this
issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0426 to this issue.

Versions of rsync up to and including version 2.6.2 contain a path
sanitization issue. This issue could allow an attacker to read or write
files outside of the rsync directory. This vulnerability is only
exploitable when an rsync server is enabled and is not running within a
chroot. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0792 to this issue.

Users of rsync are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches and is not affected by these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that
you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.
