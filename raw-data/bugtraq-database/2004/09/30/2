Of course you have to trust code being run.  The code could be telling
you that it's running some Chaumian scheme for vote counting, and
actually be running Diebold code underneath.  What?  Your
visually-crypted reciept didn't verify?  Some sort of bug, sorry.

In other schemes, other code needs trusting to handle private keys, to
distribute the results, etc.  And in the end, are people who can't
