Subject: Unicornscan 0.4.2


For those of you who didn't get to catch our Unicornscan launch at Toorcon over the weekend, I would like to invite you to http://www.unicornscan.org.

Unicornscan is a new information gathering and correlation engine built for and by members of the security research and testing communities. It was designed to provid
e an engine that is Scalable, Accurate, Flexible, and Efficient. It is released for the community to use under the terms of the GPL license.

Unicornscan is an attempt at a User-land Distributed TCP/IP stack. It is intended to provide a researcher a superior interface for introducing a stimulus into and mea
suring a response from a TCP/IP enabled device or network. Although it currently has hundreds of individual features, a main set of abilities include:
* Asynchronous stateless TCP scanning with all variations of TCP Flags.
* Asynchronous stateless TCP banner grabbing
* Asynchronous protocol specific UDP Scanning (sending enough of a signature to elicit a response).
* Active and Passive remote OS, application, and component identification by analyzing responses.
* PCAP file logging and filtering
* Relational database output
* Custom module support
* Customized data-set views

We would love feedback from the community where ever possible.

Sincerely,

Robert
