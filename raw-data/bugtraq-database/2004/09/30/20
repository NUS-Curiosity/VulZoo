1. Topic:

Updated Ethereal packages that fix various security vulnerabilities are
now
available.

Ethereal is a program for monitoring network traffic.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

Issues fixed with this Ethereal release include:

Stefan Esser reported that Ethereal versions 0.10.1 and earlier contain
stack overflows in the IGRP, PGM, Metflow, ISUP, TCAP, or IGAP
dissectors.
On a system where Ethereal is being run a remote attacker could send
malicious packets that could cause Ethereal to crash or execute
arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0176 to this issue.

Jonathan Heussser discovered that a carefully-crafted RADIUS packet
could
cause a crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0365 to this issue.

Ethereal 0.8.13 to 0.10.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) via a zero-length Presentation protocol selector. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the name CAN-2004-0367 to this issue.

The MMSE dissector in Ethereal releases 0.10.1 through 0.10.3 contained
a
buffer overflow flaw. On a system where Ethereal is running, a remote
attacker could send malicious packets that could cause Ethereal to crash
or
execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0507 to this issue.

In addition, other flaws in Ethereal prior to 0.10.4 were found that
could
cause it to crash in response to carefully crafted SIP (CAN-2004-0504),
AIM
(CAN-2004-0505), or SPNEGO (CAN-2004-0506) packets.

The SNMP dissector in Ethereal releases 0.8.15 through 0.10.4 contained
a
memory read flaw. On a system where Ethereal is running, a remote
attacker could send malicious packets that could cause Ethereal to crash
or
possibly execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0635 to this
issue.

The SMB dissector in Ethereal releases 0.9.15 through 0.10.4 contained a
null pointer flaw. On a system where Ethereal is running, a remote
attacker could send malicious packets that could cause Ethereal to
crash.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2004-0634 to this issue.

The iSNS dissector in Ethereal releases 0.10.3 through 0.10.4 contained
an
integer overflow flaw. On a system where Ethereal is running, a remote
attacker could send malicious packets that could cause Ethereal to crash
or
possibly execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0633 to this
issue.

Users of Ethereal should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain
backported security patches that correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that
you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
