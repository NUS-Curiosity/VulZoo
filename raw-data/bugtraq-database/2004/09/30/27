               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated flim resolves security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1581
Issue date:        2004-09-30
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1581
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0422
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated flim packages that fix a security vulnerability are now available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The flim package includes a MIME library for GNU Emacs and XEmacs used by
the wl mail package.

Tatsuya Kinoshita discovered a vulnerability in flim, an emacs library
for working with Internet messages. Temporary files were being created
without taking adequate precautions, and therefore a local user could
potentially overwrite files with the privileges of the user running
emacs. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CAN-2004-0422 to this issue.

Users of flim are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains patches correcting these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/ for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.
