Phishing relies on the victim lacking the information or the intellectual
capability to distinguish genuine email or web page from a fake one. That is
why phishers attempt to use nearly-real URLs and shiny padlock icons so that
the user feels a false sense of security and correctness when he sends in
his social security number. If a phishing email is signed correctly, the
email client will display a padlock icon on its own plus assurances that the
email has been signed and valid and authenticated, etc. All this will
further the false sense of security that phishing relies on, unless the
email client is configured to explicitly display enough information on the
signature and enough warnings for the average user to be able to make an
informed decision.
