Well, that's pretty stupid.

The answer is not to try to show that open source can be used in
captialistic ventures, but rather to be very clear in stating that free
enterprise (and capitalism) has no place whatsoever at any time in the
creation, formation, and instatement of a government for the people.

Indeed those involved in creating a government for the people need to be
very wary of even the support of corporate entities since such support
can invoke almost infinitely more power than any one governed individual
can ever hold over his or her government or a government representative.

Just as the Church(es) has(have) no place in the halls of government,
neither do corporations.  Corporations, despite being legally
individuals, don't even need one vote as no matter what governments
might do to regulate them they still have far more power than any human
individual.
