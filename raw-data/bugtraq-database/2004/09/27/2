Subject: RE: Microsoft's GDI Detetection Tool faults


How did you test this (and on what platform), and why do you propose
that the SANS tool is delivering more accurate results than the GDI tool
delivered by Microsoft?

I tested the SANS tool against a properly patched XP system on Friday
and found it to false positive on many of the locations it said it
wouldn't test on.  Additionally, I found it to alert on MS09.dll, on an
XP system.  Our understanding from Microsoft is that MS09.DLL only needs
to be updated to be fully compatible with an updated GDIPLUS.DLL in the
system directory, it is not directly vulnerable.

So, it would be good to know what you found.

Best,

Gaby

Today I downloaded the a gdi+ vulnerability (MS04-028) detection tool
published by The SANS. In contraddiction as the report provided by MS
gdidettool.exe it found two version of vulnerable dlls.



Be warned don't trust only MS's detection tool! Do all steps to patch
your machines.

P.S. I think this will be another nightmare for many people.... any news
about SUS 2.0/WUS?
