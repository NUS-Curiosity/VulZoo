Why can't this all be done the same way Nevada handles modern slot machines? 
For example if you are playing a slot in Nevada and feel it's not behaving 
there is a 24 hour toll free number you can call and the Nevada Gaming 
Commission and they will send someone out to tear the machine apart and 
verify (among other things) that the software image in the machine 
corresponds to an approved one that is on file with the Nevada Gaming 
Commission. Slot machines undergo a torture test that involves 20,000 volt 
tasers to the outer case, lights (to try and confuse the pay out mechanism) 
and so on. The source code is reviewed and approved, kept on file with 
approved binary images, etc.

Seriously folks, if it can be done right for a nickel slot machine you think 
it could be done right for an electronic voting machine.
