That's a very interesting viewpoint, but one that's directly at odds with
the trend in America today (and probably other countries too).  In the US,
corporations build nearly all the military equipment, do a lot of the
military work, transport the mail (most US mail goes on jets run by private
companies), run some of the jails, provide social services, deliver nearly
all the healthcare (e.g., for Medicare and Medicaid), etc.  In short, the US
government can't run today without substantial work by private industry.

Thus, Greg Woods' statement that we need to be "very clear in stating that
free enterprise (and capitalism) has no place whatsoever at any time in the
creation, formation, and instatement of a government for the people" is a
lovely thought, and totally out of touch with reality.  Not saying he's
wrong in his desire; just that it's a much bigger issue than voting
machines.

Arguing that the government shouldn't be relying on private corporations to
provide voting machines misses the point.  The government ISN'T going to
build its own voting machines; it's going to rely on the private sector,
using laws and regulations to keep risk at an acceptable level.

Besides, given what most of us know about government efficiency, would you
WANT the government to be designing and building voting machines?  Be
careful of what you wish for, as you may get it!

P.S. Worth noting that Mr. Woods lives in Canada, as judging by his domain
and phone number.  The relationship of government and private industry may
be different in Canada from the US; I have no idea and wouldn't hazard a
guess.
