Subject: Re: Diebold Global Election Management System (GEMS) Backdoor


If a vendor did a proper job of constructing a machine that conformed to 
the VVAT spec, then open source would not be required *at all*. The 
voter gets to verify the paper ballot before it is deposted in the 
ballot box, and external oververs can physically inspect the ballot box 
and the discard box to ensure that the right number of ballots are 
deposited into each box.

OTOH, if the machine does *not* conform to the VVAT spec, then open 
source is no where near sufficient to assure fair balloting, because the 
vendor could supply source code all over the place, and then just 
install trojan code at the last moment.

And that is the fundamental problem with all-electronic (no paper trail) 
voting: a human observer on the outside cannot tell what is going on in 
the chips and disks. You can get all the tripwire/opensource/checksum 
report crap you want, but if a bad guy got access to the machine and 
installed a trojan, then your reports are all a pack of lies, and no 
amout of election observing by anyone will help.

That is why the VVAT isn the one and only answer to fair digital voting. 
Open source is a distraction.
