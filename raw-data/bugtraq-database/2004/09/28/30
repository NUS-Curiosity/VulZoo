                             Security Advisory

Advisory Name: Vignette Application Portal Unauthenticated
               Diagnostics
 Release Date: 09-28-2004
  Application: Vignette Application Portal
     Platform: Multiple
     Severity: Unauthenticated diagnostic functionality and
               information disclosure
       Author: Cory Scott <cscott@...take.com>
Vendor Status: Vendor has published remediation advice 
CVE Candidate: CAN-2004-0917
    Reference: www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2004/a092804-1.txt


Overview:

Vignette Application Portal is a portal framework that runs on a
variety of application servers and platforms. As part of the
deployed framework, there is a diagnostic utility that discloses
significant detail on the configuration of the application server,
operating system, and Vignette application. The diagnostic utility,
which is installed by default, exposes details such as application
server and operating system version, database connection parameters,
and bean IDs that are used for access to Vignette portal resources.

In the default installation of the Vignette software, the utility is
not secured against anonymous and unauthenticated access. Since
many portal deployments are on the Internet or exposed to untrusted
networks, this results in an information disclosure vulnerability.

Vignette documentation does not give deployment advice to either
alert administrators to the diagnostic utility's exposure or to
restrict access to the utility. In addition, the utility performs
a set of diagnostic checks that results in system load and outbound
network connections to test portal functionality.
       

Details:

To access the diagnostic utility, a user makes a web request to
<sitename>/portal/diag/


Vendor Response:

After notification by @stake, Vignette published a knowledge base
article (KB 6947) with remediation advice. It is accessible by
Vignette customers only. 


Recommendation:

Restrict access to the diag directory on the web server or
application server. Ultimately, it would make sense for Vignette
to authenticate user requests to the diagnostic utility and
implement access control.
