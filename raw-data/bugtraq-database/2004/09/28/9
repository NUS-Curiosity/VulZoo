The machine is a Windows XP SP1 completly patched with Office 2000 SP 3 completly patched.

I don't have any kind of imaging programs installed (Photoshop, Picture It, etc)

The output from the SANS tool is:

Does anybody know what the content of the WinSxS directory under the windows installation path is?
