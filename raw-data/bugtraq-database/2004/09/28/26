No, I think it is more general than that. Seth's criticism of PGP
actually generalizes to any authentication-based "solution": it requires
the users to be trained to reject all non-authenticated communications,
and for the users to have a sophisticated notion of what constitutes
"properly authenticated."

This problem exists because the common mail clients accept
non-authenticated e-mail, and the users have been trained to just accept
that. No matter what you do, the users will continue habitually
accepting non-authenticated traffic, with all the expected consequences.

To actually fix this problem, you would have to supply your users with a
mail client that will *not* do anything "interesting" unless the mail
has been authenticated. Go ahead and try that on your users; I'll wait :)

This has nothing to do with whether you use a hierarchical PKI (VeriSign
et al) or a non-hierarchical PKI (PGP). It is all about the ease-of-use
and default policies of the mail client.

Disclaimers galore: I am on PGP's Technical Advisory Board, but do not
speak for PGP. Seth works for me at Immunix, but gets to have his own
opinions.
