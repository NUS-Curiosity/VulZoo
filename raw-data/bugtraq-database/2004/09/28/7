Agreed but forcing phishers to generate key pairs, purchase 
certificates, and/or buy-off CA vendor personnel creates additional 
audit trails that could help in the tracking and prosecution of those 
individuals. Combine this with certificate revocation and you have at 
least a model that gives more verification, auditing, and remediation 
than currently exists in the pursuit of these criminals. It's at least a 
step in the right direction and shouldn't be avoided simply because it 
won't immediately stop all phishing attacks or protect all users.

Watermarks do not stop all counterfeiting. Holograms do not stop all 
credit card fraud. It doesn't mean we shouldn't do what we can to help - 
even if its only a partial solution.
