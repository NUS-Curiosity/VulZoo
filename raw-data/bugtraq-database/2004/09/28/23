Subject: Re: Diebold Global Election Management System (GEMS) Backdoor   
 	Account    Allows Authenticated Users to Modify Votes


I've been following this thread and bit and can't hold back my 2 cents .

Running voting machines on OSS software seems obvious its the only way 
to do it correctly, since its true noone trusts each other.

Each polictical party can have their own team of hired geeks to make 
sure the code stays clean and fair.
Otherwise, it become a finger pointing and guessing game.
