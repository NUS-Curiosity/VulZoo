Subject: Patch available for IBM DB2 Universal Database flaws


Researchers at NGSSoftware have discovered multiple critical/high risk 
vulnerabilities in IBM's DB2 Universal Database. Versions affected include

DB2 8.1 Fixpak 6 and earlier
DB2 7.x Fixpak 11 and earlier

Two of the issues, remotely exploitable buffer overflows, have been fixed in 
Fixpak 7 for DB2 8.1 and Fixpak 12 for DB2 7.x. These Fixpaks were released 
last week and they can be downloaded from

http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/support/downloadv8.html - DB2 
v8.1
http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/support/downloadv7.html - DB2 
v7.x

The flaws fixed in these Fixpaks equate to NGSS BUGID 98 and 101 from the 
Vendor Notification Alerts - http://www.nextgenss.com/vna.htm

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about these flaws for three 
months. Full details will be published on the 1st of December 2004. This 
three month window will allow DB2 database administrators the time needed to 
test and apply the Fixpak before the details are released to the general 
public. This reflects NGSSoftware's new approach to responsible disclosure.

NGSSQuirreL for DB2, NGSSoftware's advanced vulnerability assessment scanner 
and security manager for IBM DB2, has been updated to check for and 
positively identify these flaws in DB2 database servers on the network. More 
information about NGSSQuirreL for DB2 can be found at
