The information in your snip is incorrect.  Is that content located on a 
current site? (URL pls).

WF does indeed install by default on domain members, with the default 
settings allowing file and printer sharing within the scope of the local 
subnet and remote assistance from anywhere.  Of course, you can change this 
with a custom inf at install, or manage settings enterprise-wide with Group 
Policy.  The Windows Security Center isn't disabled per se-- the service is 
still set to automatic, though it does not start by default.  The monitoring 
of AV/FW/AU is indeed disabled (in fact, the entire 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center reg key is removed). 
But you can still configure those items from the WSC.
