BlackBoxVoting.org reported a vulnerability in the Diebold GEMS central tabulator.
 
A local authenticated user can enter a two-digit code in a certain "hidden" location 
to cause a second set of votes to be created on the system.  This second set of votes 
can be modified by the local user and then read by the voting system as legitimate 
votes, the report said.
 
GEMS 1.18.18, GEMS 1.18.19, and GEMS 1.18.23 are affected.
 
The vendor was reportedly notified on July 8, 2003.

 
Solution:  No vendor solution was available at the time of this entry.
