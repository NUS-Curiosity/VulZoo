Researchers at NGSSoftware have discovered multiple critical vulnerabilities 
in Oracle Database Server and Oracle Application Server. Versions affected 
include

Oracle Database 10g Release 1 Version 10.1.0.2
Oracle9i Database Server Release 2, versions 9.2.0.4 and 9.2.0.5
Oracle9i Database Server Release 1, versions 9.0.1.4, 9.0.1.5 and 9.0.4
Oracle8i Database Server Release 3, version 8.1.7.4
Oracle Application Server 10g (9.0.4), versions 9.0.4.0 and 9.0.4.1
Oracle9i Application Server Release 2, versions 9.0.2.3 and 9.0.3.1
Oracle9i Application Server Release 1, version 1.0.2.2

The vulnerabilities range from buffer overflow issues, PL/SQL Injection, 
trigger abuse, character set conversion bugs and denial of service. On the 
31st of August 2004 Oracle released a set of patches to address all of these 
issues (and for other flaws found by other researchers.) This patch set can 
be downloaded from the Metalink website - http://metalink.oracle.com/.

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details about these flaws for three 
months. Full details will be published on the 31st of November 2004. This 
three month window will allow Oracle database administrators the time needed 
to test and apply the patch set before the details are released to the 
general public. This reflects NGSSoftware's new approach to responsible 
disclosure.

NGSSQuirreL for Oracle, NGSSoftware's advanced vulnerability assessment 
scanner and security manager for Oracle, has been updated to check for and 
positively identify these flaws in Oracle database servers on the network.
