These inaccurate allegations appear to stem from those not familiar with the product, misunderstanding the purpose of legitimate structures in the database.  These structures are well documented and have been reviewed (including at a source code level) by independent testing authorities as required by federal election regulations.

The results from each individual machine are then tabulated, and thoroughly audited during the standard election canvass process. Once the audit is complete, the official winners are announced.  Any alleged changes to a vote count in the election management software would be immediately discovered during this audit process, as this total would not match the true official total tabulated from each machine.
==================

oops, looks like no one told you that this is a forum of computer security 
professionals who understand the difference between a insecure machine and 
a press release. you can "strongly refute" all you want: until the code is 
available for public scrutiny it will remain suspect. but if it's written 
as poorly as is rumored, exposing it to public scrutiny would only confirm 
that it's insecure either through carelessness or intent.
