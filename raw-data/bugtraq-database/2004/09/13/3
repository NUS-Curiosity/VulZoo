OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project

OpenPKG-SA-2004.039                                          13-Sep-2004
________________________________________________________________________

Package:             kerberos
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution, denial of service 
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:         Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= kerberos-1.3.4-20040730 >= kerberos-1.3.4-20040901
OpenPKG 2.1          <= kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.0    >= kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.1
OpenPKG 2.0          <= kerberos-1.3.1-2.0.1    >= kerberos-1.3.1-2.0.2

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to two vendor security advisories [1][2], multiple
  vulnerabilities exists in the Kerberos [0] network authentication
  system. The first set of problems are double-free issues in the KDC
  and libraries. The second problem is a denial-of-service vulnerability
  in the ASN.1 decoder. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  project assigned the ids CAN-2004-0642 [3], CAN-2004-0643 [4],
  CAN-2004-0644 [5] and CAN-2004-0772 [6] to the problems.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q kerberos". If you have the "kerberos" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [7][8].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [9][10], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [11][12] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [13], build a corresponding binary
  RPM from it [7] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [8]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.1, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.1/UPD
  ftp> get kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/kerberos-1.3.4-2.1.1.*.rpm
