Subject: New whitepaper "The Phishing Guide"


Hi List,

I'd like to point out that NGS have just released a new whitepaper.  The
whitepaper "The Phishing Guide" can be downloaded from:
http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/NISR-WP-Phishing.pdf 


Abstract

Phishing is the new 21st century crime. The global media runs stories on an
almost daily basis covering the latest organisation to have their customers
targeted and how many victims succumbed to the attack. While the Phishers
develop evermore sophisticated attack vectors, businesses flounder to
protect their customers' personal data and look to external experts for
improving email security. Customers too have become wary of "official"
email, and organisations struggle to install confidence in their
communications.
While various governments and industry groups battle their way in preventing
Spam, organisations can in the meantime take a proactive approach in
combating the phishing threat. By understanding the tools and techniques
used by professional criminals, and analysing flaws in their own perimeter
security or applications, organisations can prevent many of the most popular
and successful phishing attack vectors.
This paper covers the technologies and security flaws Phishers exploit to
conduct their attacks, and provides detailed vendor-neutral advice on what
organisations can do to prevent future attacks. Security professionals and
customers can use this comprehensive analysis to arm themselves against the
next phishing scam to reach their in-tray.
