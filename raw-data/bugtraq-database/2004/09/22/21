 Account    Allows Authenticated Users to Modify Votes


What's to stop them from giving you source code for one executable, and
then installing something totally different on the machines, come election
day?

If you've read Ken Thompson's article "Reflections on Trusting Trust," you
realize that even the source code won't provide ultimate proof of security
and trustworthiness.  Only dissecting the object code taken from one of
the voting machines in production can do that, and that's an exteremely
difficult thing to do.

To quote from Ken Thompson's article (which can be found at
http://www.acm.org/classics/sep95/ ):

"The moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally
create yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people like
me.) No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you
from using untrusted code. In demonstrating the possibility of this kind
of attack, I picked on the C compiler. I could have picked on any
program-handling program such as an assembler, a loader, or even hardware
microcode. As the level of program gets lower, these bugs will be harder
and harder to detect. A well installed microcode bug will be almost
impossible to detect. "
