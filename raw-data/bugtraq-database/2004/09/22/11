Something with a legitimate purpose may not always be used in a 
legitimate fashion. If "legitimate" features exist which could pervert 
the primary purpose of the system -- to accurately record and collate 
votes -- and those features could forseeably be used in such a way with 
the collusion of only a small number of individuals, then that system is 
broken.

Your second point here has got nothing to do with security of the GEMS 
software -- it's talking about election processes as a whole, of which 
the software is only a part. The assumption in the design and 
implementation of your voting machines and software should be that the 
other parts of the process might *not* work, not that they are perfect 
and will excuse any flaws in your system.

Craig.
