Nothing new realy..

There is a trick to get SYSTEM shell in VirusScan Enterprise 7.1.0
and the 'brand' new version 8.0.0 also.

Do a new task, for a example "Update" and choose a program to run after the task,
do this task to run with a schedule, efter this task is done
the chosen program is running with SYSTEM priviligies.

Well, cmd.exe dosn't pop up on screen,
but connect back or portbind stuff works just fine..

Have a nice day
