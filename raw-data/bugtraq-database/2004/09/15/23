Subject: Php Vulnerability N. 2


Let's go for the second one:

=========================================
Title: Overwrite $_FILE array in rfc1867 - Mime multipart/form-data File
Upload 

Affected: Php <= 5.0.1
Not Affected: it seems none
Vulnerability Type:  Possible write of a downloaded file in an arbitrary
                     location.
Vendor Status: Vendor has released a fix on cvs.php.net

==Summary:

Bad array parsing in rfc1867.c could lead to overwrite $_FILES array
elements.

==Description:

I don't know if releasing a POC for this vuln is a good thing because php is used widely in the net...
so if you are interested feel free to contact me.


==Solution: 
Authors where contacted and they have released the patch
that can be found on the CVS
cvs.php.net

=================================================

Regards,

Stefano
