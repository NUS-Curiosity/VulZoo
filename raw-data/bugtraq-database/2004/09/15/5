Subject: Corsaire Security Advisory - Multiple vendor MIME RFC2231 encoding issue



-- Corsaire Security Advisory --

Title: Multiple vendor MIME RFC2231 encoding issue
Date: 04.08.03
Application: various
Environment: various
Author: Martin O'Neal [martin.oneal@...saire.com]
Audience: General distribution
Reference: c030804-008


-- Scope --

The aim of this document is to clearly define a MIME content evasion 
issue that affects a variety of products including; browsers, proxy 
servers, email clients, content security gateways and antivirus 
products. 


-- History --

Discovered: 04.08.03 (Martin O'Neal)
NISCC notified: 19.02.04
Document released: 13.09.04


-- Overview --

There are a number of content security gateway and antivirus products 
available that provide policy based security functionality. Part of this 
functionality allows the products to block embedded file attachments 
based on their specific content type, such as executables or those 
containing viruses. However, by using malformed MIME encapsulation 
techniques centred on the presence of fields encoded using the RFC2231 
continuations or parameter value character set and language information, 
this functionality can be evaded. 


-- Analysis --

The MIME standards are intended to provide a common mechanism to 
exchange data between systems and are used extensively by protocols such 
as HTTP and SMTP. The structure of a MIME message is defined in RFC2045 
[1], which in turn makes use of concepts introduced in RFC822 [2] 
(superseded by RFC2822 [3]).

The standards define a range of fields that control how data is encoded 
within the transport, and how it should be interpreted by the receiving 
agent. RFC2231 [4] extends RFC2047 [5] which defines "techniques to 
allow the encoding of non-ASCII text in various portions of a RFC 822 
[2] message header, in a manner which is unlikely to confuse existing 
message handling software". 

The implementation of these encoding standards has not been universal by 
all of the vendors. For many products, such as email clients and 
browsers, this scope for variation might only result in some unreliable 
behaviour. However, for a collection of security products, being unaware 
of the various ways that the standard has been implemented can lead to 
more serious results, as the products may fail to detect a threat within 
the data stream.

When a receiving agent is presented with a MIME message that contains an 
unknown RFC2231 encoding, it tends to respond in one of two broad ways:

- It identifies the MIME message as malformed and blocks it.
- It fails to interpret the MIME field (or message).

The first of the two would be the correct behaviour for a security 
conscious product, but based on empirical research this is not the 
common result for a number of scenarios. 

The RFC2231 encoding issue has been observed to affect many of the 
security products. To use this issue as an attack vector, all that is 
required is to identify a target that has a client agent that 
successfully interprets the RFC2231 encoding correctly, where any 
security products that protect it do not.


-- Recommendations --

To be effective tools, the security products must not only be able to 
process encoding techniques implemented as per the relevant standard, 
but also common misinterpretations and deliberate corruptions.

As an ongoing process, a study project should be undertaken by the 
vendors to identify applications that routinely decode MIME objects and 
have a liberal interpretation of the MIME standard. 

NISCC have produced a document consolidating a number of vendor 
statements on these issues [6]. Contact your vendor directly to 
establish whether you are affected by these issues.


-- Background --

This issue was discovered using a custom SMTP/HTTP vulnerability 
analysis tool developed by Corsaire's security assessment team. This 
tool is not available publicly, but is an example of the specialist 
approach used by Corsaire's consultants as part of a commercial security 
assessment. To find out more about the cutting edge services provided by

-- CVE --

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CAN-2004-0161 to this issue. This is a candidate for
inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardises
names for security problems.
