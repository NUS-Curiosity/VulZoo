OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project

Package:             aspell
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:        Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= aspell-0.50.5-20040310 >= aspell-0.60-20040827
OpenPKG 2.1          <= aspell-0.50.5-2.1.0    >= aspell-0.50.5-2.1.1
OpenPKG 2.0          <= aspell-0.50.5-2.0.0    >= aspell-0.50.5-2.0.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a security advisory from shaun2k2 [0], multiple
  stack-based buffer overflows exists in the "word-list-compress"
  utility from the spell-checker GNU Aspell [1]. By providing a
  specially crafted word list containing an overly long string (more
  than 256 bytes), an attacker can cause a buffer overflow and execute
  arbitrary code. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via
  a long entry in the wordlist. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2004-0548 [2] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/openpkg
  rpm -q aspell". If you have the "aspell" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) and its dependent packages (see above), if
  any, too [3][4].

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][8] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [9], build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [3] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [4]. For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.1, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.1/UPD
  ftp> get aspell-0.50.5-2.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig aspell-0.50.5-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild aspell-0.50.5-2.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/aspell-0.50.5-2.1.1.*.rpm
