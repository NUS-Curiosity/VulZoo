Actually, I found that it doesn't matter if an SQL query is there or not.

Example:

http://www.example.com/viewtopic.php?t=12345&highlight=bug,%20*

Something like:

http://www.example.com/viewtopic.php?t=12345&highlight=bug,*

does not work however. There doesn't _appear_ to be any exploit here,
though granted I did not check this a great deal.
