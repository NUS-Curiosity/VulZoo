This all depends on the amount of ram you have and what is nornally
done on  your mac.  Still a major issue you have, but if you put in 
>640 you probably have nothing to worry about.  A sad work around I
know, but while we wait for the ever slow to fix things - namely Apple
- its the best you can do.
