Subject: [tool] webstretch 0.1.6 http inspection proxy





Project page & download site...

http://sourceforge.net/projects/webstretch

Enables a user to view & alter all aspects of http comunication with a
web site via a personal web proxy. Primarily used for security based penetration testing of web sites, it can also be used for debugging during
development. Basically, its main feature is that it allows you to
access the web, and shows you the information the proxy is about to pass to the web server, so that you can view & alter any info (all while still in your browser) before finally accessing the page

(written in Java) (J2SE required to run)

New features appearing all the time. e.g.

* request alteration
* request viewing
* html comment detection
* browser impersonation
* hidden area detection
* proxy chaining

Please add any problems, feature requests, comments, etc to the page
linked above.
