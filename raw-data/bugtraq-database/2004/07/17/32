there has been reports norton AntiVirus 2004 and norton AntiVirus 2005 (beta) is also prone to the exploit. 

It's always hard to handle such tricks unless you specify a timeout value to scan a particular file. But, i doubt if this the right way to handle any file!

even if we impliment signatures for archive bombs, there are 10's of possibility to make..... again something different that the AV wont detect. )O;
