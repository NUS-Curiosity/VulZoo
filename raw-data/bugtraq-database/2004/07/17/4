I won't argue the rest of your points, however, this one I would 
consider invalid. Here, I have to agree with Microsoft's original 
concept. Those with pirated copies have no claim to, nor a right to, any 
fixes (security or otherwise) from Microsoft.  While an argument could 
be made that not permitting these people to have fixes could endanger 
innocent users and others with legal copies, this is at best a morally 
ambiguous and thin argument. The simple fact is, those who use pirated 
software (be it Microsoft's or anyone else's), are simply thieves who do 
not deserve to reap any benefits from their actions.
