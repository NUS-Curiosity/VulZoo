It works on 2k3, same steps taken.

	I had to specifically click on the "Program" tab, which evoked a null-
	pointer read attempt (at a guess, something in the .PIF parser assumes
	a length or offset will always be >0 so doesn't do any sanity checking,
	and/or some higher level routines don't do any checking).

	Yeah, but how long is it now since we've been telling programmers
	"don't trust user-supplied data"??  (Hmmmm -- does it also fail on
	W2K3??)
	
	And don't you also find the inconsistencies this throws up at least
	somewhat interesting?
	
	Rename a PE executable to a .PIF extension, right click, ask to see the
	file's properties and splat -- whatever code is invoked to handle that
	task dies a stupid, if not ugly, death because internally the file is
	the wrong type.  However, if you double-click that renamed file it is 
	executed as if nothing is amiss.
	
	And to think that some folk will see this as further reason to enforce
	their belief that when it comes to security and code quality, Microsoft
	really just doesn't get it...
	
	Why did MS make ".EXE files renamed as .PIF" execute "properly"?  Aside
	from "because we can", I'd not be at all surprised if it was on some
	internal "stupid user tricks we should eliminate support calls for"
	list.  But, whatever the reason, did anyone at Microsoft give two
	milliseconds of thought to the security (or other) consequences of that
	design decision?  I seriously doubt it and I'm sure I'm far from alone
	in that...
