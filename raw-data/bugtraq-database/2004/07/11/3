According to whois the technical contact seems to be:
Reddiff.com : bhushang (at) REDIFF.CO.IN
indiatimes.com : raman.gulati (at) timesgroup.com
sify.com: hostmaster (at) SATYAM.NET.IN

At least they are the technical contact if they aren't the security 
contact as well i guess they would know who is.
