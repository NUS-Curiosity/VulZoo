Subject: RE: Unchecked buffer in mstask.dll


Thor wrote about IconHandler starting mstask. Are there any other dangerous
IconHandler entries: is there a way we can reassure ourselves that the
others are safe?

Being curious, on Win2k, I copied cmd.exe (from winnt\system32) as xyz.pif;
then (right-click) Properties, Program crashes explorer. Is this related to
IconHandler, and is it exploitable?

Cheers,
