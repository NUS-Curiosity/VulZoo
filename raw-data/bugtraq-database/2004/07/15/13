Subject: Re: Mac OS X stores login/Keychain/FileVault passwords on disk


The swapfiles are deleted on startup -- this means even a clean shutdown by 
user leaves the passwords on disk.
So if you loose your powerbook someone might boot it in "target disk mode" and 
will be able to get your password!
