Due to the lag time in posts appearing to the list,
this may have already been mentioned, and if so, I
apologize. Also, if you could care less what this
report has to say, I apologize as well.

Dept of Homeland Security has released an audit of
security within the dept. In his report 'Progress and
Challenges in Securing the Nation.s Cyberspace', the
department's inspector general Clark Kent Ervin points
to the human factor as the weak plate of armor.
