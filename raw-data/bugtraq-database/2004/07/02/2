Both you and I know perfectly well that Windows Update serves a
different page for non-IE browsers, and that that page does not contain
any frames. You should focus on the facts instead of letting your hatred
for Microsoft overwhelm you.

Since you have trouble reproducing a very simple example I have instead
put this example online:

http://www.jscript.dk/2004/7/subframe/

Open the page. Click the first button called "Open window". Click the
second button called "Load page". See that the page from geocities.com
is now loaded inside the subframe on jscript.dk.

As you can see, this is perfectly reproduceable in both IE, Mozilla,
Firefox and Opera. This is of course provided that they allow popups in
the first place, but as I mentioned in my previous posts you can
acomplish the same with inline frames instead of a new browser window. 

To make doubly sure, I even downloaded fresh copies of Firefox 0.9.1
(worked fine in 'Safe Mode' as well) and Opera 7.51.

Yes of course.
Two tiny problems though:

1. your little scriplet doesn't work for me. I get:

'W.frames.2.location' is null or not an object

2. If as you claim this is "standard practice" then there is something
wrong with these browsers as it apparently does not work on them:

The following browsers are not affected:
* Mozilla Firefox 0.9 for Windows
* Mozilla Firefox 0.9.1 for Windows
* Mozilla 1.7 for Windows
* Mozilla 1.7 for Linux

Perhaps someone who really knows will enlighten us all.
