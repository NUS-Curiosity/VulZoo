Subject: RE: Microsoft technologies. By default, non-HIPAA compliant?


I must deal with HIPAA everyday.

In support of the claim that Microsoft is not HIPAA compliant, show me ANY Microsoft machine that actually does Healthcare and show me that I cannot recreate a patient from data stored on the computer in cache or other areas.

The machine does NOT have to be connected to anything in order to automatically violate the HIPAA mandate that patient data is secure and that a patient record of other information available on the system can reconstruct a patient record.

If the machine IS connected to anything, including an Intranet or Internet, then it is susceptible to virus and hacking attacks and data can be reconstructed.

Most machines connect to a clearing house via the Internet using a browser.

Clearing houses may include WebMD, ProxyMed, Medifax, and others.

The mere fact that a Microsoft browser is used, leaves the machine and all data vulnerable to attack and retrieval.

Even if certificates, which really are NOT used, are used, they merely encrypt the data to and from the websites, but do nothing to the data in the computer.

Simple forensic programs can retrieve all patient data and doctor records and this does not require a brain surgeon to perform this.

The machines NOT connected to anything are still vulnerable, as users, non-users, janitorial, and others physically in the same location of the PC can turn it on and run forensics against it and retrieve data.

I have tested the Microsoft products and cannot use them and feel secure in that the data is really safe.

I have many competitors out there who do use Microsoft, because they get to market fast. But, they will also CRASH fast too.

Sorry to say that abm may be correct in the statement that Microsoft is not secure.

Sure on the surface they appear to be, but simple hacking will crash the systems and simple hacking will retrieve patient data.
