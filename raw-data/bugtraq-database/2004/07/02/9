The problem with thinking like that though is you aren't taking the
consumer into account. Say my mom or dad want to pay their visa bill
and they are unsure where to go on the internet to pay. They do a
google search and sure enough,  the find a page that has a link to
visas payment portal or account login page. Now they are happy because
even though they are not as technically advanced as people on this
list, and they did eventually get to the visa site on their own. They
checked the URL and made sure that it was the visa site that they were
at. But regardless of what they did to protect themselves, they still
become the victims of identity theft. How much more is the average
consumer who uses the computer a max of 2 hours a week expected to
know? You surely don't expect them to start learning about frames
sources or automatic redirects in their web browser, do you?
