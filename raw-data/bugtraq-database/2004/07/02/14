This would not be the case, as the trojaned sites could easily present
the malware directly, rather than contacting a third party site.  That
it didn't is simply a sign that the attacker was less clever and
creative than he could have been.  Thus all sites which can be
contacted need to be "trusted".

A better criticism is that, yeah, QA is important, but this is a known
critical exploit for over a WEEK now and there is no patch in sight.

That the crisis hasn't bloomed further with the simple hack:

Make the malcode modify any .html it can find, and include itself on
that site for download, combined with the continual attacks on IIS
sites, banner servers, etc...

is a mystery to me.
