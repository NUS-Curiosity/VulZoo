I am not american, but I have to agree to all of the following:

 - Nobody trusts the OIS or its motives.
 - the purpose of the OIS is to lobby towards a business model for Microsoft

  and the other OIS members that involves the removal of non-compliant 
 security researchers.
 -  This call for feedback is a thinly disguised attempt to get public 
 legitimacy and allow the OIS to claim it has community backing, which it 
 clearly does not.
