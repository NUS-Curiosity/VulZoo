You can title your UI anyway you please.

I haven't checked out the new demo, but it is inconsquential,
you can totally change the contents of the window so that "No"
becomes "yes", or "yes" becomes "no", or whatever else. [By
stating, "Do Not Run This App", for instance, turns the positive
into the negative.]

"Close this window"?

"Yes".

Boom.

There are countless variations on this as you can put in there,
around there, all around anything you want.

It is a pain to make a really good demo, though, this is
why no one has probably messed with it. And, it is likely
too old for the current wave of criminals to get a handle
on it.

Well, not anymore. But, thankfully, Microsoft fixed this in
SP 2. Hopefully everyone else will get this fix in their
IE as well.

Yeah, you can probably flicker it and hide it as well.

Really, the exploitation is for an artist...
