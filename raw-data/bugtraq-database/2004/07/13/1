Should you not be able to tile your gui any way you please? 

Someone may be thinking that you could put an image in front of the security box in order to trick users into clicking on "open" without knowledge. I noticed that you cant click on the buttons when the image is in front of them.

Would you be able to have an insane speed at which the object moves over the buttons, or a  pulse action to where the image would appear to be solid, but would still select "open" when pressed?
