Subject: Inappropriate methods exposed in XML  -what's the essence?


Does somebody know what is essence of Microsoft Security Bulletin 
MS02-052: what is so called "inappropriate methods exposed in XML 
support classes" (CVE-CAN-2002-0865). Could anybody compile some POC 
exploit showing this problem?

Regards,

Alex
