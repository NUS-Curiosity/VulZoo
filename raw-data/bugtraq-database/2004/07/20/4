               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated libxml2 resolves security vulnerability
Advisory ID:       FLSA:1324
Issue date:        2004-07-19
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Security
Cross references:  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1324
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0110
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------


- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated libxml2 packages that fix an overflow when parsing remote resources 
are now available.

2. Relevent releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

libxml2 is a library for manipulating XML files.

Yuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml2 versions prior to 2.6.6.  
When fetching a remote resource via FTP or HTTP, libxml2 uses special 
parsing routines.  These routines can overflow a buffer if passed a very
long URL.  If an attacker is able to find an application using libxml2 that 
parses remote resources and allows them to influence the URL, then this 
flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0110 
to this issue.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a 
backported fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Johnny Strom for reporting this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata 
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those 
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are 
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you 
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains 
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many 
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate 
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or 
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit 
http://www fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to configure yum 
and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is 
available from http://www.fedoralegacy org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or 
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
