Dear all

Finally there's going to be a true blue security conference in Singapore
that is product and vendor neutral.

The Symposium on Security for Asia Network (SyScAN "04) would be held on
16th - 17th December 2004 in Singapore. SyScan "04 would be held at the
beautiful Swissotel Merchant Court Hotel, which is located a stone throw
away from the financial and the pub districts, and 10 minutes away from the
famous shopping belt of Orchard Road.

SyScAN "04 boasts a list of expert speakers in their various fields, coming
from US and Europe and the topics would be scintillating and mesmerising.

SyScAN "04 would be a wonderful avenue for all security enthusiasts from all
over the world, especially those from Asia, to gather and fraternise.

Please do visit www.syscan.org for more information and register.



Thanks!

I have problems with the OIS guidelines as I distrust at least one
member of OIS since it won't publish verifiable information on Bugtraq
since some years. When I combine the policy of that company with the
next statement from OIS's about.html page

"Does OIS support pre-disclosure of vulnerability information to select
groups?
No. We believe the software author should be given a chance to create a
fix before vulnerability information is made public, but that there
should be no further distribution of that information until the fix is
complete. This priniciple can be very difficult to adhere to in certain
situations, such as dealing with the open source community where there
aren't protections to keep vulnerability information secret."

I am afraid that that company might take years to supply a fix or even
to never supply that. A limit of at most four weeks before disclosure
seems reasonable to me. If that company cannot live with that it can opt
to die.

Another interesting point for me is the statement about the open source
community in the same paragraph. Some organizations still have problems
with that community, which is reflected by adopters.html webpage of OIS.
No representation of the open source community as far as I can see. But
please correct me if I am wrong.
