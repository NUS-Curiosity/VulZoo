The simple argument I was making was that if MS' "testing process" is what
keeps patches from coming out in a timely manner, perhaps they should
actually be of decent quality.  When you're getting patches that are both
slow to release, as well as adversely affecting the systems they're being
installed on, MS has met neither of their agends.
