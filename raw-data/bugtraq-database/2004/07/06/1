The definition of the term "security vulnerability" still does not
match current industry practice.  Almost all COTS software lacks a
publicly reviewable design document, and popular software has not been
designed for Internet security *at* *all*.  In a few cases, this is
even acknowledged by the vendor (think of Microsoft Windows Me or
Microsoft Windows NT).

In fact, I can't think of any recent, critical vulnerability that
matches your definition of a vulnerability.
