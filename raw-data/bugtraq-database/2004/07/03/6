SUBJ: THE INSIDER VULNERABILITY STILL WORKS AFTER TODAY'S PATCH
DATE: 2004/07/03 UTC+800
BODY:

[background]
the latest 0day remote compromise exploit for internet explorer was found
being used in the wild. :-)

"the-insider" exploit was first noticed by the-insider:
http://umbrella.name/iebug.com/display-singlemessage.php?readmsg:fulldisclosure_message-2004060050
and then documented by jelmer:
http://umbrella.name/iebug.com/display-singlemessage.php?readmsg:fulldisclosure_message-2004060124
http://62.131.86.111/analysis.htm 

microsoft just released:
Critical Update for Microsoft Data Access Components - Disable ADODB.Stream
object from Internet Explorer (KB870669)
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4D056748-C538-46F6-B7C8-2FBFD0D237E3&DisplayLang=en
which kills the old exploit.

[FIX FOR THE PATCH]
use Shell.Application instead.

[service]
both "attack service"(finding bugs) and "defense service"(securing systems):

[greetings]
malware( http://www.malware.com/ ) who found Shell.Application.
