Subject: Re: DLINK 614+ - SOHO routers, system DOS


Hello,
a followup concerning the two DOSes that were found affecting DLINK's DI 
614+ model.
I finally got a chance to test a DI624 revision B and i can confirm that 
this model is affected by the exact
same flaws. (signedness bug/service DOS and flood/system DOS)
While it is not quite a surprise, i'm still at lost to understand why 
they said this issue was limited to their 604 and 614 models
and even more surprised since they have asked me for my tool, 3 days 
ago, in order to be able to reproduce the DOSes. ;-)
So DI-624 owners, please update ...

Gregory
