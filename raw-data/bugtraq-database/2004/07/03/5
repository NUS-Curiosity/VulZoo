The Organization for Internet Safety (OIS) extends an invitation to
the readers of the BugTraq, NTBugtraq, and Full-Disclosure mailing
lists to participate in the ongoing public review of the OIS Security
Vulnerability Reporting and Response Guidelines. 

The OIS reviews the Guidelines annually to ensure that they remain
useful and relevant to the security community and, most importantly,
to the millions of computer users who are the ultimate beneficiaries
of effective computer security practices.  Over the past year, OIS
has received feedback from many adopters of the Guidelines as well as
from several public-private partnerships, and have incorporated much
of this feedback into an interim version that is available at
http://www.oisafety.org/review/draft-1.5.pdf.  We recommend reviewing
the interim version, but reviewers are welcome to provide feedback on
the original version at http://www.oisafety.org/reference/process.pdf
if they would like.

For more information on the public review, please visit
http://www.oisafety.org/review-1.5.html.  The closing date for the
review has been extended until 16 July 2004.  We look forward to your
feedback.

Regards,

The Organization for Internet Safety
