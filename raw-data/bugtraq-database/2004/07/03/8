Do you plan to release generic advisories (not SuSE-specific ones) for
some of the issues?

These are too many changes to reproduce here.

This patch also applies to 2.6.7 (in the sense of patch(3), not
necessarily semantically).

The problem is the missing check against the fsuid, a Linux-specific
user ID used by NFS servers and the like.  (It's been added so that
processes can assume the UID of different users without exposing
themselves to signals from those users.)

This patch is essentially the same that was presented by the
discoverers, but it also fixes the same code for IPv6.  The IPv6 fix
appears to be SuSE-specific, the official 2.6.7 code is different (it
doesn't use skb_copy_bits()), and apparently doesn't have this
particular bug.
