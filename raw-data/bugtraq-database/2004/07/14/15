This isn't quite right - on my system at least, browsing for cmd.exe
in this way generates an error:
"The C:\WINNT\system32\cmd.exe file is not a Windows Help file, or the
file is corrupted."

That said, the file dialog can be made to display a ListView control
(display details rather than a list).  This ListView control will
accept both WM_SETTEXT (to inject shellcode into the caption of the
window) followed by LVM_SORTITEMS (which specifies the address for a
sort function) to execute said code.  It is a valid method for
arbitrary code execution as LocalSystem, but not quite as simply as
Vivek makes out.
