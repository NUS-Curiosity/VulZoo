Subject: [HV-MED] DoS in Microsoft SMS Client


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Denial of Service (DoS) in Microsoft SMS Client

Classification:
===============
Level: low-[MED]-high-crit
ID: HEXVIEW*2004*07*14*1

Overview:
=========
Microsoft Systems Management Server provides configuration management
solution for Windows platform. It is widely deployed in medium and large
network environments. A flaw in SMS Remote Control service makes possible to
crash the service remotely leading to the DoS condition.

Affected products:
==================
All tests were performed on a client part of Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 2.50.2726.0.

Cause and Effect:
=================
SMS Remote Control Client service is listening on TCP ports 2701 and 2702.
The service performs basic signature checks and size tests on received data
and assumes the data is correct if those tests pass. It is possible to create
a data packet that will go through basic checks and throw an exception by
causing the server to read or write to an invalid memory address. It is also
possible to specify the memory address value in the data packet.
Initial analysis showed that the problem is not [easily] exploitable because
there is no buffer overflow condition and it is not possible to specify the
data to be written to the memory. The exception occurs in multprot.dll
library when the service makes an API call with invalid parameters.

Demonstration:
==============
The problem can be reproduced by sending the "RCH0####RCHE" string followed by
a large number of characters (over 130) to TCP port 2702.

Vendor Status:
==============
At the time of release vendor was not aware of the vulnerability.
HexView does not notify vendors unless there is a prior agreement to do so.
