Subject: File downloads in Opera at known locations


Hi,
 This is just a question. While using opera, I observed that as soon as it
prompts you for file download, it simultaneously starts the download with
same file extension in its %USERPROFILE/application data/opera/cache. Even
if the user afterwards chooses cancel, this temporary file does not get
deleted. So if the file size was very small, it will get downloaded
completely. Reported this to opera and they are convinced this is not a
problem (bugid 148412). They do not have problems such as directory
traversal causing file dropping in user startup etc. 
Is this a problem? Can this be used in conjunction with some other
vulnerability to get access to the system?

Thanx
Rohit Dube
