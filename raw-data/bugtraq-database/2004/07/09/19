The same thing happens with classic mail bombs like 42.zip, NAV can't 
handle them.

Morover, NAV is unable to stop the scan in middle, even if the user wishes to manually stop the virus scan. Then, in this situation the only alternate is to kill the process.

NAV will take hours or MIGHT even days to complete the scan causing 100% cup use in email gateways for hours. The compressed archive must not necessarily be a '.zip' to trigger this attack.
