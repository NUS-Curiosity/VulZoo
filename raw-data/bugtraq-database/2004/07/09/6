Subject: Re: MOZILLA: SHELL can execute remote EXE program



Interesting... I was trying to determine if the shell: exploit could be 
used to execute remote code on a known web server but hadn't approached 
it from the SMB angle.

The obvious mitigating factor for this exploit is that someone would 
need to have prior knowledge of which SMB shares had been visited by the 
user, or otherwise try to manipulate those.   Unless a way to merge this 
flaw with an automated method of placing this shortcut into the nethood 
and controlling what content is on said share --  then this 
vulnerability would almost definately not be usable in widespread exploit.

It could be a danger in situations where the cracker has prior knowledge 
of the network environment, though.
