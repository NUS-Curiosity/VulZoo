Overview:

WebSphere Edge Component Caching Proxy, part of WebSphere Application
Sever, is a reverse proxy designed to reduce bandwidth use and improve a
Web site's speed and reliability by providing a point-of-presence node
for one or more back-end content servers. It is built to work with
content provided by one or more backend WebSphere Application Servers.

Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability discovered allows a remote attacker to generate a
denial of service condition against the WebSphere Edge Component Caching
Proxy. 

If the reverse proxy is configured with the JunctionRewrite directive
being active, a remote attacker can trivially cause a denial of service
by executing the GET HTTP method without parameters.

Exploit:

$ echo “GET” | nc <victim_host_ip> <proxy_port>

Solutions:

If JunctionRewrite is unnecessary, disabling it will suffice to prevent
the Denial of Service. Also if the option UseCookie in the
JunctionRewrite directive is unnecessary disabling it will suffice to
prevent the Denial of Service.

Vendor Response:

IBM opened a case regarding the vulnerability and provided a patch
within 2 weeks of the initial contact.
