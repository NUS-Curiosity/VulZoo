Err, have you actually tried that?  See

  <http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106482>

and note the section which states that one of the effects of turning on 
"Open Firmware Password Protection" is that it "Blocks a reset of Parameter 
RAM (PRAM) by pressing the Command-Option-P-R key combination during 
startup".  This has certainly been my experience here.

Your point on physical security though is well made, and it is trivial to 
defeat most BIOS controls if you have physical access to the device.
