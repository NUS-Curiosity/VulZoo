Subject: Mozilla Bug Isn't So Bad




ok so mozilla can execute existing files on the user's system. so what? how many times has this happened to internet explorer? this is an insignificant vulnerability compared to everything in ie. internet explorer has been vulnerable to the codebase vulnerability for several years. also, you can't even specify command line parameters. and besides, this isnt even a real problem with mozilla. it is a problem with microsoft explorer. mozilla didnt make the shell: protocol; microsoft did. so in reality, this could be considered a vulnerability in microsoft software triggered in non-microsoft software.

thanks a lot, microsoft...
