Subject: [tool] p0f 2.0.4 is out


I am proud to announce the availability of p0f 2.0.4, a passive OS
fingerprinter (and more). Since 2.0.1 (announced here over a year
ago), p0f has gained features such as:

  - RST+ACK (connection refused) fingerprinting,
  - Official SYN+ACK (outgoing connection) fingerprinting support,
  - Sophisticated masquerade / IP sharing detection algorithms,
  - TCP/IP stack bug dissector and fingerprinting support,
  - External query API for easier service integration,
  - Rudimentary fuzzy matching,
  - Cool supplementary utilities and ports,
  - Numerous bugfixes and functionality enhancements,
  - Plenty of new signatures.

P0f is extremely useful in various security-related applications,
including but not limited to traffic analysis, IDS, forensics, policy
enforcement, pen-testing, low-profile network reconnaissance.

More information, links to related or derived projects, and last but not
least, source downloads, can be all found at:
