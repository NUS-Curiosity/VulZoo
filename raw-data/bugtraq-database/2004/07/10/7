42.zip was a arc. BOMB and a different story... It's similar to my WinRar advisory that date back, 2003.

Well, within few seconds... after the AV scan have started norton quickly scan's the infected file and skips the empty folder within the zip archive! But after norton detects virus in the archive it tries to delete the virus within the archive, and re-create the un-infected/fresh archive........ again!
The problem triggers when NAV tries to re-create all the empty folders and re-construct the archive. *ANY* av scanners that autometically tries to delete the infected file and re-create the archive should be vulnerable to this exploit!!!

Note: in the "AutoProtect Menu" in the option tab in Norton AV the option........

*autometically repair the infected file <--- is set by default!
you could temporarily be immune by this bug by setting the option,
*deny access to the infected file. 

The compressed archive mustn't necessarily be a zip archive to trigger this attack. You could experiment this with other archive types......
