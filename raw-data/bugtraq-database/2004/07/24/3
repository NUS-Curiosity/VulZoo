This program would run inside the corporate network, behind the firewall and access anything the infected user has access to.

Linux/or Unix users with Netscape may have the javascript, page redirection and popup email run, however, the activeX component will not run.
>
> Comcast users have the option of using Comcast Webmail or Outlook Express.  Because of the inability to disable html/java/or active-x in Comcast Webmail, those using Webmail had an increased chance of their computers' becoming infected in the event of a potential hacker either a) referencing active-x controls or b) including javascript within an HTML e-mail message.

> The security community first became aware of the potential for this kind of threat about two years ago.  Software companies that produce Web-based email, blog or input system must check for arbitrary java and html code.  Note:  the original Web Mail system was written by AT&T and was inherited by Comcast during their purchase of AT&T's broadband business.

> Vendor Response: April 7, 2004. A Comcast representative called our office immediately.  Comcast worked quickly on fixing this bug and rolling it out to their servers, with a solution in place by April 13, 2004.  Release of this notification was held back waiting for Comcast to decide how and when to self-release.

> The original problem with IIE, Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express was found by George Grunski and involved insecure default reading of a malformed HTML in Outlook and OE and insecure running of HTML (see <http://www.guninski.com/browsers.html>) And thanks to Johannes B. Ullrich, CTO SANS Internet Storm Center for assistance.
