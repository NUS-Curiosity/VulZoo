Subject: Re: DoS against Domino 6.5.1



Hello,

IBM changed his mind and a hotfix that solves the problem is available.
After installing the fix the server does not crash anymore when opening 
a message formatted as described below.
Accessing the mail with IE on Windows leads to a browser hang. You have to 
terminate the browser with the task-manager, but I think this is not a big 
problem, since the server keeps on running and you can access all other 
mails in you box and the problem normally occurs only when opening 
malformatted mails.
