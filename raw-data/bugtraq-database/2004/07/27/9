Subject: RE: Forward:FullDisclosure/IE - Possible Address Spoofing

I played the exploit using IE5 and IE6. I observed
some strange behaviors. Under IE5 no sp when I click
the link, the IE will open the urls specified in the
href, i.e., microsoft, google and slatdot first. Then,
the IE will redirect the window to the url specified
in onunload. Under IE6 sp1, the IE will directly open
the url specified in onunload. But for the specific
example of google.com, the IE copies the content of
google page and opens it in the local domain. The
screenshots are attached in the email. Two questions:

1. Why does IE6 treat Microsoft.com, slatdot.com and
google.com differently? 
2. Does this mean that, google can execute code with
local privilege in my computer?
