SMTP (or SMTP via CVP) is handled as a store and forward mechanisme. Hence
the 80% rule does not apply.

The issue was seen with both v3.5 in CVP mode as well as v4 in bridging
mode. No further labtest were done to see if a full live EICAR version
could be passed along.

If someone is able to create a test executable based on the EICAR string
the point might be proven. Unfortunatly I am not a programmer and lack
window compiler tools all together. But if someone thinks (s)he can create
a sample binary that may run when the last bit is shot to pieces and still
contain a valid EICAR definition to show to the screen the issue might be
proven.

Putting it on a webserver and posting the URL would allow anyone who wants
to to verify the issue themselves.
