Believe it.  Banking is concerned with regulatory requiprements, 
Medical/HIPAA is concerned with privacy of data on every level, 
appropriate access to data, the ability to access data in an emergency 
in a secure, aduitable manner, and all other variations of 
complexities.  The basic HIPAA electronic security guidelines consist of 
mandatory and "addressable" components.  How each company addresses the 
"addressable" components is open to interpretation.  Banking is 
stringent, to be sure - but HIPAA takes accountability and privacy to a 
whole new level.
