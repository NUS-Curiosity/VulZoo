Hi,

Are you certain of your findings? You are stating that anyone can access 
through the EW FileManager module arbitrary files (that are world-readable)…

This doesn’t happen unless you have strictly configured your EW FileManager to 
work badly, as the PHP will return NOAUTH on any unauthorized user accessing 
the administrator interface, and specifically manager functionality.

The code that causes this can be found in pnadmin.php:
function ew_filemanager_admin_manager() {
...
...

  if(!pnSecAuthAction(0, 'ew_filemanager::', '::', ACCESS_EDIT)) {
    $output->Text(_NOAUTH);
    return $output->GetOutput();
  }

...

So you exploit won't work unless you are logged in to the EW FileManager. If 
this is true, then this greatly diminishes the validity of your 
vulnerability, as EW FileManager's purpose is:
( http://home.postnuke.ru/index.php?module=subjects&func=viewpage&pageid=3 )
Module designed to manage file and directories inside directory given by site 
admin.

So allowing someone you don't trust access to this PHP causes more danger than 
the simple fact that he can view files... he can upload new PHPs, that then 
can get executed, and provide a "complete" shell.
