Minor security issue in punbb with SQLite

Georgi Guninski security advisory #76, 2019

Running punbb-master from https://github.com/punbb/punbb
from Thu 07 Nov 2019 11:23:33 AM UTC

Installing on http://host/forum
In install.php set:

database type: SQLite3
database name: database1

Accessing http://host/forum/database1 returns the full raw database,
including hashes and email addresses.

If attacker guesses the name "database1" or brute force from common
database names, this gives her read access of the raw database.

If you consider this a bug, as workaround set database to something
hard to guess.

Other forum software explicitly want the SQLite database to
be non-accessible from the web.
