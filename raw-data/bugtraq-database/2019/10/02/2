Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-1547 CVE-2019-1549 CVE-2019-1563

Three security issues were discovered in OpenSSL: A timing attack against
ECDSA, a padding oracle in PKCS7_dataDecode() and CMS_decrypt_set1_pkey()
and it was discovered that a feature of the random number generator (RNG)
intended to protect against shared RNG state between parent and child
processes in the event of a fork() syscall was not used by default.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.0l-1~deb9u1.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.1d-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

For the detailed security status of openssl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssl
