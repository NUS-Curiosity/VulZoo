Package        : wpa
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-13377 CVE-2019-16275
Debian Bug     : 934180 940080

Two vulnerabilities were found in the WPA protocol implementation found in
wpa_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).

CVE-2019-13377

    A timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when
    using Brainpool curves could be used by an attacker to retrieve the
    password.

CVE-2019-16275

    Insufficient source address validation for some received Management frames
    in hostapd could lead to a denial of service for stations associated to an
    access point. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a
    specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point
    to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection
    to the network.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version $stretch_VERSION.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:2.7+git20190128+0c1e29f-6+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.
