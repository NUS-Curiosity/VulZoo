This comes immediately after panic this week over a hidden Telnet-based 
diagnostic interface was found in Huawei gateways. Although that vulnerability 
was real, irritating, and eventually removed at Vodafone's insistence, it was 
dubbed by some a hidden backdoor perfect for Chinese spies to exploit to snoop

Which, of course, comes as America continues to pressure the UK and other 
nations to outlaw the use of Huawei gear from 5G networks over fears Beijing 
would use backdoors baked into the hardware to snatch Uncle Sam's intelligence.

Well, if a non-internet-facing undocumented diagnostic Telnet daemon is reason
