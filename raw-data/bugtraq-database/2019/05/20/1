Subject: local privilege escalation via CDE dtprintinfo

Dear Bugtraq,

Please find attached an advisory for the following vulnerability:

A buffer overflow in the DtPrinterAction::PrintActionExists() function in the
Common Desktop Environment 2.3.0 and earlier, as used in Oracle Solaris 10 1/13
(Update 11) and earlier, allows local users to gain root privileges via a long
printer name passed to dtprintinfo by a malicious lpstat program.

Note that Oracle Solaris CDE is based on the original CDE 1.x train, which is
different from the CDE 2.x codebase that was later open sourced. Most notably,
the vulnerable buffer in the Oracle Solaris CDE is stack-based, while in the
open source version it is heap-based.

This is a 0day vulnerability demonstrated at #INFILTRATE19 on May 2nd, 2019 in
the talk "A bug's life: story of a Solaris 0day".
