Package        : libu2f-host
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20340
Debian Bug     : 921725

Christian Reitter discovered that libu2f-host, a library implementing
the host-side of the U2F protocol, failed to properly check for a
buffer overflow. This would allow an attacker with a custom made
malicious USB device masquerading as a security key, and physical
access to a computer where PAM U2F or an application with libu2f-host
integrated, to potentially execute arbitrary code on that computer.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libu2f-host packages.

For the detailed security status of libu2f-host please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libu2f-host
