Package        : spip
Debian Bug     : 926764

It was discovered that SPIP, a website engine for publishing, did not
properly sanitize its user input. This would allow an authenticated
user to perform arbitrary command execution.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.4-4~deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your spip packages.

For the detailed security status of spip please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/spip

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
