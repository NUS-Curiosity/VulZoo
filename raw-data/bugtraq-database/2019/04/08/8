Package        : samba
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-3880

Michael Hanselmann discovered that Samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print, and
login server for Unix, was vulnerable to a symlink traversal
attack. It would allow remote authenticated users with write
permission to either write or detect files outside of Samba shares.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:4.5.16+dfsg-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.

For the detailed security status of samba please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/samba
