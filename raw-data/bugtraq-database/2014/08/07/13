Subject: (CVE-2014-3501/2/3) Apache Cordova for Android - Multiple
 Vulnerabilities

Hi,

We have recently discovered a severe Cross-Application Scripting (XAS) vulnerability in Apache Cordova for Android. This vulnerability enables theft of sensitive information from Crodova-based apps both locally by malware and also remotely by using drive-by exploitation techniques.

In addition, we have also found a set of vulnerabilities which allow for data exfiltration to an arbitrary target, bypassing Cordova's whitelisting mechanism. 

The CVE identifiers are:

CVE-2014-3500: Cross-Application Scripting via Android Intents
CVE-2014-3501: Cordova whitelist bypass for non-HTTP URLs
CVE-2014-3502: Data Leak to Other Applications via Android Intent URIs

We had privately reported the issues to Cordova and CVE-2014-3100 has been fixed in Cordova 3.5.1. See our whitepaper for details on how to mitigate CVE-2014-3501 and CVE-2014-3502.
