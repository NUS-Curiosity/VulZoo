challenges.

  - Current Research Category (30 mins - 1 hr) - comprises of known
security issues, case studies, twist to an existing research, tool,

additions to it.

of insufficient information available in the abstract.

Note
====
  - Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected.
  - The Abstract should clearly mention the techniques and hacks in
detail and merely mentioning that it works will not help in
understanding the research to its full extent.
  - Be as descriptive as possible in the abstract.
  - Attach your source code/exploit/full paper along with the submission
  - nullcon is an open knowledge/research sharing platform and hence
product/company marketing and pitches will be rejected. We request you
