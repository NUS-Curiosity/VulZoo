Package        : nss
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1741 CVE-2013-5606 CVE-2014-1491 CVE-2014-1492

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in nss, the Mozilla Network
Security Service library:

CVE-2013-1741

    Runaway memset in certificate parsing on 64-bit computers leading to
    a crash by attempting to write 4Gb of nulls.

CVE-2013-5606

    Certificate validation with the verifylog mode did not return
    validation errors, but instead expected applications to determine
    the status by looking at the log.

CVE-2014-1491

    Ticket handling protection mechanisms bypass due to the lack of
    restriction of public values in Diffie-Hellman key exchanges.

CVE-2014-1492

    Incorrect IDNA domain name matching for wildcard certificates could
    allow specially-crafted invalid certificates to be considered as
    valid.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.14.5-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 2:3.16-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
