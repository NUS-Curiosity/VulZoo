Subject: SaaS Marketing platform Hubspot export vulnerability

Hubspot is a widely used SaaS marketing platform to email all your customers, collect data about them and attract new customers. It's is common practice to keep customer lists in Hubspot to send newsletters or other email communication. Hubspot has hardcoded roles that grant users access to various areas of the application.  

Most user activity is tracked and can be audited, EXCEPT exporting. 

A marketing level user can easily export a companies entire contact data set without Hubspot or the company knowing.
