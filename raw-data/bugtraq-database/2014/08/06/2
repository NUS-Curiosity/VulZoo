Subject: RE: ownCloud Unencrypted Private Key Exposure - version (6.0.4)
 reported not vulnerable

This came into our security group when we inquired with ownCloud:

It has been officially confirmed by ownCloud security team that the version (6.0.4) running on our servers is not vulnerable to this issue.

"Hi --:
 
I heard back from the Security team within ownCloud and this is not an issue in 6.0.4.

Subject: Re: ownCloud Unencrypted Private Key Exposure

Hi,

thank you for this announcement. I have a (very naive) question about this. As a consequence of this vulnerability an attacker with access to the ownCloud server's file system can compromise the encrypted data stored on the server. There does not seem to be a workaround for that and there will be no fix. Thus, data on an ownCloud server is always accessible to an attacker with access to the file system, regardless of whether ownCloud's encryption feature is enabled or not. Is that correct so far?

It seems to me that one of the encryption feature's main purposes is to prevent an attacker with access to the server's file system from immediate access to the user data. If my understanding above is true, then this purpose is void since the encryption is useless in that scenario. If this is somehow not part of the vendor's threat model, isn't it at least an important restriction? Or did I completely misunderstand something?

Regards
Frank
