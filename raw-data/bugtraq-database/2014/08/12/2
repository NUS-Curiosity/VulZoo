Package        : acpi-support
Debian Bug     : 755969

It was discovered that the acpi-support update for DSA-2984-1 would
make a laptop's power button forcibly shut the system down, instead of
triggering the configured action (usually suspend to RAM). This only
affects systems using the gnome-settings-daemon.

For reference, the original advisory follows.

CESG discovered a root escalation flaw in the acpi-support package. An
unprivileged user can inject the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment
variable to run arbitrary commands as root user via the policy-funcs
script.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.140-5+deb7u2.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.142-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your acpi-support packages.
