Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered XSS vulnerability in Storesprite, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Storesprite: CVE-2014-3737

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data in URI. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an attacker to change appearance of the web site, steal cookies of other users and forge check out pages. It is also possible to gain administrative access to the web site its administrator falls victim to XSS attack.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display "immuniweb" word:
http://[host]/brand.php/%22onmouseover%3d%27alert%28%22immuniweb%22%29%27%20a%3d%22%3E
