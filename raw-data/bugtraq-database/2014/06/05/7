True, but it is a slight help and I'm in favour of keeping it.

For permanent dropping of privilege I suggest calling setgid() and
setuid() to the desired values *twice* (and ignore the return code).
Then try to reset to the original values (should fail; ignore return code).

Then test that the real and effective values are the same and are the
ones you want - that's the result that indicates success in this case.
And exit() if failed.

That's the simple usage guide - David Wagner has written at length on
the technicalities.
