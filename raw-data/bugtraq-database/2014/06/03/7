I was unable to reproduce this issue in OpenCart version 1.5.6.4. From the
picture this seems to be path disclosure issue or could you provide working
proof-of-concept to exploit directory traversal issue? Did you report this to
vendor? Does this have CVE? Did you use any plugins or themes (like Shoppica) or
did you have OpenCart as module/extension in some other software?

Sadly at the moment this looks like yet another fake/false from iedb.
