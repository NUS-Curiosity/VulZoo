 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:123
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : tor
 Date    : June 11, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated tor packages fix multiple vulnerabilities:
 
 Tor before 0.2.4.20, when OpenSSL 1.x is used in conjunction with
 a certain HardwareAccel setting on Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge
 platforms, does not properly generate random numbers for relay identity
 keys and hidden-service identity keys, which might make it easier
 for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms
 via unspecified vectors (CVE-2013-7295).
 
 Update to version 0.2.4.22 solves these major and security problems:
 
 - Block authority signing keys that were used on authorities vulnerable
 to the heartbleed bug in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160).
 
 - Fix a memory leak that could occur if a microdescriptor parse fails
 during the tokenizing step.
 
 - The relay ciphersuite list is now generated automatically based on
 uniform criteria, and includes all OpenSSL ciphersuites with acceptable
 strength and forward secrecy.
 
 - Relays now trust themselves to have a better view than clients of
 which TLS ciphersuites are better than others.
 
 - Clients now try to advertise the same list of ciphersuites as
 Firefox 28.
