Scope:
The International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy aims at creating a meeting point of researchers and practitioners that address security and privacy challenges that concern information systems, especially in organizations, including not only technological issues but also social issues. The conference welcomes papers of either practical or theoretical nature, presenting research or applications addressing all aspects of security and privacy, such as methods to improve the accuracy of data, encryption techniques to conceal information in transit and avoid data breaches, identity protection, biometrics, access control policies, location information and mobile systems privacy, transactional security, social media privacy control, web and email vulnerabilities, trust management, compliance violations in organizations, security auditing, and so on. Cloud computing, big data, and other IT advances raise added security and privacy concerns to organizations and
  individuals, thus creating new research opportunities.
