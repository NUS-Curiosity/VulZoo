========================================================================
Vulnerability 1 - Denial of Service
========================================================================
Vulnerability Type:    XML Entity Expansion [CWE-776]
CVE-ID:                CVE-2014-8875
CVSSv2 Base Score:     5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
========================================================================

Description
-----------
Similar vulnerabilities have been discovered and reported earlier in 
2014 for other PHP applications, i.e. Drupal and WordPress. It has been 
discovered that the Revive Adserverâ€™s XML-RPC implementation might be 
vulnerable to the same kind of attacks.

A remote attacker can send specifically crafted payloads to the XML-RPC 
endpoints of a Revive Adserver instance in an attempt to consume the 
server resources (CPU and memory) and ultimately lead to the application 
becoming unavailable or unresponsive (denial of service).


Details
-------
Revive Adserver XML-RPC servers, available both in the delivery engine 
(/www/delivery/[ad]xmlrpc.php, /adxmlrpc.php) and the API endpoints 
(/www/api/v2/xmlrpc/, /www/api/v1/xmlrpc/*.php) might be vulnerable to 
certain types of XML entity expansion attacks, also depending on the 
libxml2 version available on the system.

Vulnerability 2 - XSS
========================================================================
Vulnerability Type:    Cross-Site Scripting [CWE-79]
CVE-ID:                CVE-2014-8793
CVSSv2 Base Score:     4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
Also known as:         HTB23242
========================================================================

Description
-----------
A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was recently discovered and 
reported by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab ( 
https://www.htbridge.com/ ).

A remote attacker can trick logged-in user to open a specially crafted 
link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of 
the vulnerable website.


Details
-------
Input passed via the "refresh_page" GET parameter to 
"/www/admin/report-generate.php" script is not properly sanitised before 
being returned to the user.

Please see High-Tech Bridge's own advisory for more information.
