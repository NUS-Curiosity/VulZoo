Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher discovered a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the official ZTE Ucell 3G Modem software.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local privilege escalation vulnerability has been discovered in the official ZTE Ucell 3G Modem application software.
The local security vulnerability allows an attackers to gain higher access privileges by execution of arbitrary codes.

The application is vulnerable to an elevation of privileges vulnerability which can be used by a simple user that can change
the executable file with a binary of choice. The vulnerability exist due to the improper permissions, with the `F` flag (full)
for the `Everyone`(Tout le monde:F) and `Users` group, for the all binary file. The files are installed in the `Ucell Internet`
directory which has the Everyone group assigned to it with full permissions making every single file inside vulnerable to change
by any user on the affected machine. After you replace the binary with your rootkit, on reboot you get SYSTEM privileges.

The security risk of the local privilege escalation vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) 
count of 6.1. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a local privileged systen user account without user for interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the privilege escalation web vulnerability results in software- or system compromise.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted account privileges and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
