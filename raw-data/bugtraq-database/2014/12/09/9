Advisory ID: VMSA-2014-0013
Synopsis:    VMware vCloud Automation Center product updates address a 
             critical remote privilege escalation vulnerability 
Issue date:  2014-12-09
Updated on:  2014-12-09 (Initial Advisory)
CVE number:  CVE-2014-8373

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

    VMware vCloud Automation Center (vCAC) product updates address a 
    critical vulnerability in the vCAC VMware Remote Console (VMRC) 
    function which could lead to a remote privilege escalation.

2. Relevant releases

    vCloud Automation Center 6.x without patch

3. Problem Description 

   a. VMware vCloud Automation Center remote privilege escalation

      VMware vCloud Automation Center has a remote privilege escalation 
      vulnerability. This issue may allow an authenticated vCAC user to
      obtain administrative access to vCenter Server.

      This issue is present in environments that use the "Connect (by) 
      Using VMRC" function in vCAC to connect directly to vCenter Server.
      Environments that exclusively use vCloud Director (vCD) as a 
      proxy to connect to vCenter Server are not affected.

      At this time the issue is remediated by removing the "Connect (by)
      Using VMRC" functionality for directly connecting to vCenter 
      Server. Deploying the provided patch will remove this 
      functionality. 

      VMware is working on a secure solution that will restore this 
      functionality. Customers may continue to use the "Connect (by) 
      Using RDP" or "Connect (by) Using SSH" options for remote desktop 
      management as they are not affected by this issue.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the identifier CVE-2014-8373 to this issue. 

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is 
      available.
