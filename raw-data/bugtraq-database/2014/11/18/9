 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:214
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/

 Package : dbus
 Date    : November 18, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated dbus packages fixes the following security issues:
 
 Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie discovered several vulnerabilities
 in the D-Bus message daemon:
 
 On 64-bit platforms, file descriptor passing could be abused by local
 users to cause heap corruption in dbus-daemon, leading to a crash,
 or potentially to arbitrary code execution (CVE-2014-3635).
 
 A denial-of-service vulnerability in dbus-daemon allowed local
 attackers to prevent new connections to dbus-daemon, or disconnect
 existing clients, by exhausting descriptor limits (CVE-2014-3636).
 
 Malicious local users could create D-Bus connections to dbus-daemon
 which could not be terminated by killing the participating processes,
 resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2014-3637).
 
 dbus-daemon suffered from a denial-of-service vulnerability in the
 code which tracks which messages expect a reply, allowing local
 attackers to reduce the performance of dbus-daemon (CVE-2014-3638).
 
 dbus-daemon did not properly reject malicious connections from local
 users, resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2014-3639).
 
 The patch issued by the D-Bus maintainers for CVE-2014-3636 was
 based on incorrect reasoning, and does not fully prevent the attack
 described as CVE-2014-3636 part A, which is repeated below. Preventing
 that attack requires raising the system dbus-daemon&#039;s RLIMIT_NOFILE
 (ulimit -n) to a higher value.
 
 By queuing up the maximum allowed number of fds, a malicious sender
 could reach the system dbus-daemon&#039;s RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n,
 typically 1024 on Linux). This would act as a denial of service in
 two ways:
 
 * new clients would be unable to connect to the dbus-daemon
 * when receiving a subsequent message from a non-malicious client
 that contained a fd, dbus-daemon would receive the MSG_CTRUNC flag,
 indicating that the list of fds was truncated; kernel fd-passing APIs
 do not provide any way to recover from that, so dbus-daemon responds
 to MSG_CTRUNC by disconnecting the sender, causing denial of service
 to that sender.
 
 This update also resolves the CVE-2014-7824 security vulnerability.
