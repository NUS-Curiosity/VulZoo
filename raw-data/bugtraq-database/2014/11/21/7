         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  The Asterisk module res_pjsip_acl provides the ability to    
                 configure ACLs that may be used to reject SIP requests from  
                 various hosts. In affected versions of Asterisk, this        
                 module fails to create and apply ACLs defined in             
                 pjsip.conf. This may be worked around by reloading           
                 res_pjsip manually after res_pjsip_acl is loaded.            

    Resolution  The PJSIP ACL code has been changed to create and apply the   
                ACLs properly at startup.
