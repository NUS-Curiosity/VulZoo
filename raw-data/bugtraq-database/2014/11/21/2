         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  The ConfBridge application uses an internal bridging API to  
                 implement conference bridges. This internal API uses a       
                 state model for channels within the conference bridge and    
                 transitions between states as different things occur. Under  
                 load it is possible for some state transitions to be         
                 delayed causing the channel to transition from being hung    
                 up to waiting for media. As the channel has been hung up     
                 remotely no further media will arrive and the channel will   
                 stay within ConfBridge indefinitely.                         

    Resolution  The underlying bridging code that ConfBridge uses has been    
                fixed so state changes can not occur that will take a         
                channel out of the hung up state.
