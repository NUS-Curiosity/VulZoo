Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
BookFresh LLC
Product: BookFresh - Web Application & API 2014 Q4


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation & mail encoding vulnerability has been discovered in the official BookFresh web-application & api.
The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable service module.

The security vulnerability is located in the `phone`,`from` and `message` input values of the `cindex.php/clients` module. Remote attackers 
are able to perform a PUT request to execute persistent script codes in bookfresh service notification mails. The attackers registers an user 
account and is able to execute script codes in the invite people notification mails of the bookfresh service. The attack vector of the issue 
is on the application-side of the online-service and the request method to inject the code is `PUT`.

The security risk of the persistent vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.9.
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privileged application user account and low user interaction. Successful exploitation of the 
vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirect via mail and persistent manipulation of 
affected or connected module context.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Index > Add Clients (Invite)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] phone
				[+] from
				[+] message

Affected Service(s):
				[+] Invite Mail Notification Service (noreply@...kfresh.com)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Vulnerable Module: 	Index > Add Clients (Invite)
Vulnerable URL: 	https://www.bookfresh.com/cindex.php/clients#9f29673d878097fd23de3bae1523da44

Test Account: 		bkm@...lution-sec.com
Test Password: 		chaos666
Date/Time:		24.10.2014 14:35-14:50

Manual steps to reproduce the security vulnerability ...
1. Register an account and login to the bookfresh online-service application
2. Open the client add module to invite another user account
3. Inject your own script code payload to the phone, message and from input fields
4. Send the invite to another bookfresh user or to a random email user account by usage of the save function
Note: After the PUT request the injected script code in the vulnerable values bypass the validation through the bookingfresh api
5. The target mailbox gets a notify of the bookfresh service mail (noreply@...kfresh.com) thats executes the script code on the application-side in the vulnerable values context
6. Successful reproduce of the application-side (persistent) security vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The security vulnerability can be patched by a secure restriction to the input of special chars or script code tags. Parse and encode the vulnerable from, phone and message input in the clients invite module to prevent persistent script code execution attacks through service notification mails.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability in the web-server mail db encode is estimated as medium (CVSS 3.9)
