Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a persistent input validation vulnerability in the official iTransferPro v1.1 iOS mobile application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2014-10-27:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
SeasonApps iTransfer
Product: iTransfer - iOS Mobile Web Application (Wifi) 1.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official SeasonApps iTransferPro v1.1 iOS mobile application.
The vulnerability allows a local attacker to inject own script code as payload to the application-side of the vulnerable service function or module.

The vulnerability is located in the albumname value. Local attackers with low privileged device user accounts are able to manipulate the albumname 
values by usage of the wifi sync function in the `Share Photo Library` module. The attack vector is persistent on the application-side and the request 
method to inject is a app sync. The issue allows to stream persistent malicious script codes to the front site of the wifi photo library interface.

The security risk of the application-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 2.5.
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities result in persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, persistent external redirect to malicious 
sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
					[+] Sync

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] Share Photo Library

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
					[+] items - group (albumname)

Affected Module(s):
					[+] Wifi Interface - Share Photo Library Index (http://localhost:8888/)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with low privileged device user account and low or medium user interaction.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure restriction of the foldername/albumname input fields.
Encode the input and parse the output of the name values in the wifi interface to prevent persistent script code executions.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side input validation web vulnerability in the wifi interface is estimated as medium(-). (CVSS 2.5)
