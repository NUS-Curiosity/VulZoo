Notes

SMH 7.2.3 recommended for customers running Windows 2003 OS
Updated OpenSSL to version 1.0.1g

Note: If you believe your SMH installation was exploited while it was running
components vulnerable to heartbleed, there are some steps to perform after
youve upgraded to the non-vulnerable components. These steps include
revoking, recreating, and re-importing certificates and resetting passwords
that might have been harvested by a malicious attacker using the heartbleed
vulnerability.

Impact on VCA - VCRM communication: VCA configures VCRM by importing the SMH
certificate from the SMH of VCA into the SMH of VCRM. When this certificate
is deleted & regenerated (as suggested before), it needs to be (re)imported
if the user wants to continue with Trust by Certificate option, and the
outdated certificate should be revoked (deleted) from each location where it
was previously imported.
If you use HPSIMs 2-way trust feature, and have imported SMH certificates
into HPSIM, you will also need to revoke those SMH certificated from HPSIM
and reimport the newly created SMH certificates.
Though SMH uses OS credentials using OS-based APIs, user provided credentials
are passed from the client (browser) to the server (SMH) using the HTTPS
protocol. If you suspect your systems using SMH were exploited while they
were vulnerable to heartbleed, these passwords need to be reset.

Frequently Asked Questions

Will updated systems require a reboot after applying the SMH patch?
No, reboot of the system will not be required. Installing the new build is
sufficient to get back to the normal state.
Is a Firmware Update necessary in addition to the SMH patch?
No, only the SMH update is sufficient to remove the heartbleed-vulnerable
version of SMH.
Will new certificates be issued along with the patch, or need to be handled
separately?
If you suspect the certificate has been compromised due to this
vulnerability, we do recommend to delete and revoke the certificate, or SMH
will reuse the existing certificate. New certificate will be created when SMH
service starts (at the end of the fresh / upgrade installation). Instructions
on deleting the certificate are in the notes above.
Where can I get SMH documentation?
All major documents are available at:
http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/enterprise/servers/solutions/info-library
Select HP Insight Management under Product and Solutions & check HP System
Management Homepage to get SMH related documents.

How can I verify whether my setup is patched successfully?
SMH version can be verified by executing following command on:
Windows: hp\hpsmh\bin\smhlogreader version
Linux: /opt/hp/hpsmh/bin/smhlogreader version
Will VCA-VCRM communication be impacted due to the SMH certificate being
deleted?
VCA configures VCRM by importing the SMH certificate (sslshare\cert.pem) from
the SMH of VCA to the SMH of VCRM. When this certificate is deleted &
regenerated (as suggested before), it needs to be (re)imported if user wants
to continue with Trust by Certificate option, and remove the old, previously
imported certificate.
Should I reset password on all managed nodes, where SMH was/is running?
Though SMH uses OS credentials using OS based APIs, user-provided credentials
are passed from the client (browser) to the server (SMH) using the HTTPS
protocol. Passwords need to be reset if you suspect the vulnerable version of
SMH was exploited by malicious users/ hackers.
