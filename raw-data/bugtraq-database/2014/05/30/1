3. Problem Description

   a. Guest privilege escalation in VMware Tools

      A kernel NULL dereference vulnerability was found in VMware
      Tools running on Microsoft Windows 8.1. Successful exploitation
      of this issue could lead to an escalation of privilege in the
      guest operating system.

      VMware would like to thank Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security
      Team for reporting this issue to us.
 
      The vulnerability does not allow for privilege escalation from
      the Guest Operating System to the host. This means that host
      memory can not be manipulated from the Guest Operating System. 

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2014-3793 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.
