Subject: CVE-2014-2881 - Poor Quality Implementation of Diffie-Hellman Key
 Exchange in Citrix Netscaler

Vulnerability title: Poor Quality Implementation of Diffie-Hellman Key
Exchange in Citrix Netscaler
CVE: CVE-2014-2881
Vendor: Citrix
Product: Netscaler
Affected version: All prior to 10.1-122.17/9.3-66.5
Fixed version: 10.1-122.17/9.3-66.5
Reported by: Graham Sutherland

Details:

The remote configuration Java applet contains a poor implementation of
the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. The random number generator
used to produce secret values is the java.util.Random class, which is
not of cryptographic quality. Publicly known predictors exist for the
underlying RNG, and the seed is either 32-bit or 48-bit depending on the
host system.

Furthermore, the selection of the secret 'a' value within the key
generation process is potentially vulnerable to timing attacks that leak
the RNG state, as the implementation loops until the RNG outputs a value
within a publicly known range.
