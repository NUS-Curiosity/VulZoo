Cisco Wide Area Application Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20140521-waas

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2014 May 21 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) software versions 5.1.1 through 5.1.1d, when configured with the SharePoint acceleration feature, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exploit a buffer overflow and cause arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect buffer handling for SharePoint responses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious SharePoint application. An exploit could allow the attacker to crash the application optimization handler and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the WAAS appliance.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability.
