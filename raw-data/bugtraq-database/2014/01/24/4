Package        : denyhosts
Vulnerability  : regression
Debian Bug     : 734329
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6890

A regression has been found on the denyhosts packages fixing
CVE-2013-6890.  This regression could cause an attempted breakin attempt
to be missed by denyhosts, which would then fail to enforce a ban.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-7+deb6u3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-10+deb7u3.

For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distribution, the package denyhosts
has been removed, and its users are encouraged to switch to an alternative like
fail2ban.

We recommend that you upgrade your denyhosts packages.
