Subject: CVE-2013-6429 Fix for XML External Entity (XXE) injection
 (CVE-2013-4152) in Spring Framework was incomplete

Severity: Important

Vendor: Spring by Pivotal

Versions Affected:
- Spring MVC 3.0.0 to 3.2.4
- Spring MVC 4.0.0.M1-4.0.0.RC1
- Earlier unsupported versions may be affected

Description:
Spring MVC's SourceHttpMessageConverter also processed user provided XML and
neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable them.
SourceHttpMessageConverter has been modified to provide an option to control the
processing of XML external entities and that processing is now disabled by
default.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:
- Users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.5 or later
- Users of 4.x should upgrade to 4.0.0 or later
 (This is also fixed in 4.0.0-RC2 but users are recommended to use 4.0.0 or later)

Credit:
This issue was identified by the Spring development team.
