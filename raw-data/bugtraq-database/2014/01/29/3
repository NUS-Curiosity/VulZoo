Subject: SiteCore XML Control Script Insertion

Hey All,

Sitecores “special way” of displaying XML Controls directly allows for a 
Cross Site Scripting Attack – more can be achieved with these XML 
Controls and will be documented in another vulnerability report

More information can be found at

file for use with Burp when auditing SiteCore.
