Subject: [SE-2013-01] Security vulnerabilities in Oracle Java Cloud Service


Hello All,

Those concerned about security of Java PaaS (Platform as a Service)
or cloud services in general might find the following information
interesting.

Security Explorations discovered multiple security vulnerabilities
in the environment of Oracle [1] Java Cloud Service [2].

Among a total of 28 issues found, there are 16 weaknesses that make
it possible to completely break Java security sandbox of a target
WebLogic server environment. An attacker can further leverage this
to gain access to application deployments of other users of Oracle
Java Cloud service in the same regional data center.

The nature of the weaknesses identified in Oracle's service indicates
that it was not a subject of a thorough security review and penetration
testing prior to the public offering. They illustrate known and widely
discussed security risks related to Java [3]. They also expose weak
understanding of Java security model and attack techniques by Oracle
engineers.

More information regarding our research can be found at the official
pages of SE-2013-01 project:

We hope the next time Larry Ellison is about to choose between boats
and work [4], work is gonna win as obviously certain areas at Oracle
need actual work, not the improvisation.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Adam Gowdiak
