Subject: Ektron CMS Take Over - Hijacking Accounts

I have detailed a vulnerability within Ektron CMS that allows an 
unauthenticated user to hijack any account.  The clear targets of choice 
for this CMS would be the builtin or admin account.

Whilst I found this issue back in 2012, it appears that around 65% are 
still vulnerable and should be patching their systems.  I did notify 
Ektron about this and I know a patch was made, but I did not bother 
releasing an advisory.  Why now...  Way to many sites have still not 
updated, this could be in part because it appears there is no mention of 
the issue on Ektrons site.  Security issues are always a good incentive 
to adopt patches.  The other reason being, I have a new vulnerability in 
their fix and I will follow up with this shortly.

As usual, full details can be found here with Screen shots -

All the best
