Advisory Details:

During a Pentest Help AG discovered the following:
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mediatrix Web Management Interface, found in the login page, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML via the vulnerable parameter �username� 

1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Mediatrix Web Management Interface: CVE-2014-1612

As proof of concept, one needs to access the following URL on a Mediatrix Web Interface: http://<<MediatrixWebInterfaceIP/Host>>/login.esp?r=system_info.esp&username=%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E 

Hackers could craft malicious URLs and send them to system admins to try to gain access to the administrative interface of the Mediatrix Device. As the targeted Mediatrix device in our case is used for providing voice over IP (VoIP) connectivity to ISDN telephones, the attacker could even set up his rogue SIP server, replace the original one in the Mediatrix configuration and listen to all corporate calls if an administrative account is compromised via the XSS in the login page.
