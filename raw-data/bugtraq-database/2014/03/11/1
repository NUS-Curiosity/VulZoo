         CVE Name       CVE-2014-2286                                         

    Description  Sending a HTTP request that is handled by Asterisk with a    
                 large number of Cookie headers could overflow the stack.     
                 You could even exhaust memory if you sent an unlimited       
                 number of headers in the request.                            

    Resolution  The patched versions now handle headers in a fashion that     
                prevents a stack overflow. Users should upgrade to a          
                corrected version, apply the released patches, or disable     
                HTTP support.
