 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:051
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : file
 Date    : March 13, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated file package fixes security vulnerability:
 
 It was discovered that file before 5.17 contains a flaw in the handling
 of indirect magic rules in the libmagic library, which leads to an
 infinite recursion when trying to determine the file type of certain
 files (CVE-2014-1943).
 
 Additionally, other well-crafted files might result in long computation
 times (while using 100% CPU) and overlong results.
 
 A flaw was found in the way the file utility determined the type of
 Portable Executable (PE) format files, the executable format used on
 Windows. A malicious PE file could cause the file utility to crash or,
 potentially, execute arbitrary code (CVE-2014-2270).
 
 A memory leak in file has also been fixed.
 
 The affected packages have been upgraded to the 5.12 version and
 patched to correct these flaws.
