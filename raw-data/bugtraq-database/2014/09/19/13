         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  It is possible to trigger a crash in Asterisk by sending a   
                 SIP SUBSCRIBE request with unexpected mixes of headers for   
                 a given event package. The crash occurs because Asterisk     
                 allocates data of one type at one layer and then interprets  
                 the data as a separate type at a different layer. The crash  
                 requires that the SUBSCRIBE be sent from a configured        
                 endpoint, and the SUBSCRIBE must pass any authentication     
                 that has been configured.                                    
                                                                              
                 Note that this crash is Asterisk's PJSIP-based               
                 res_pjsip_pubsub module and not in the old chan_sip module.  

    Resolution  Type-safety has been built into the pubsub API where it       
                previously was absent. A test has been added to the           
                testsuite that previously would have triggered the crash.
