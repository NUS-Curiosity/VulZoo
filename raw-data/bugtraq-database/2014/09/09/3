Cisco Unified Computing System E-Series Blade Servers Cisco Integrated Management Controller SSH Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20140908-ucse

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2014 September 8 16:00  UTC (GMT)
+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (Cisco IMC) SSH module of the Cisco Unified Computing System E-Series Blade servers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition.

The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle a crafted SSH packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet to the SSH server running on the Cisco IMC of an affected device, which could result in the Cisco IMC becoming unresponsive. The operating system running on the blade will be unaffected.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability.
