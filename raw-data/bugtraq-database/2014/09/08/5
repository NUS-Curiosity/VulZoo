Subject: apache tomcat cookie handling problem - characters out of 0x80 - 0xff
 causing internal server error

#####
* Title: Client-based DoS for Apache Tomcat on sending cookie with
value out of 0x80 - 0xff scope.
* Author: Elar Lang

* Date: 02. January 2014 / 05. September 2014

#####
* Vendor: Apache
* Product: Tomcat
* Affected versions (at least):
7.0.26
7.0.39
7.0.40

#####
* Timeline:
#1 02. January 2014 - [me > vendor] information sent to
security@...cat.apache.org
--------------------
if HTTP request to Apache Tomcat server contains some cookie and
cookie value contains character with ascii code larger than 128 result
is Error 500 - Internal Server Error.

It's good attack vector for attackers, because one XSS hole is enough
to write one cookie with value ¤ (for example), and for that browser
this site is not accessible anymore.

Versions affected (tested):
7.0.26
7.0.39
7.0.40
--------------------

#2 08. January 2014 - [vendor > me] response from Apache. Basically,
it's not their bug. Included the following line.
--------------------
The Tomcat developers do not view the scenario you describe as a
Tomcat vulnerability since the vulnerability is the initial XSS and
without that this behaviour cannot be exploited by an attacker.
--------------------

#3 10. June 2014 - [me > vendor] information and explanation, that one
XSS in SOP (Same-Origin-Policy) scope is enough to "turn off" one
client. I also asked, how to prevent against that problem.

#4 11. June 2014 - [vendor > me] Response from Apache. "From a
security perspective there is nothing to add to our previous
response."
--------------------
For details of the changes (planned and implemented) to Tomcat's
cookie parsing that may well mitigate the DoS see the dev@ list.
--------------------

#5 04. September 2014 - [me > vendor] information resent and asked how
the impact is different from
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/67671/info

#6 05. September 2014 - [vendor > me] Response from Apache. They said,
they have nothing to add to previous comments.

#7 05. September 2014 - [me] publish.

Cookies what contains at least one symbol out of range 0x80 .. 0xff,
causing Internal Server Error.
