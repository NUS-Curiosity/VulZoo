Subject: Re: [FD] SSH host key fingerprint - through HTTPS

Good to hear from you!

"marginally better"
We never said this is perfect. checkssh.com stops LOCAL bad boys. That's all.

"both myself and that site are BOTH falling victim"
Ah, here is the source code...
https://checkssh.com/result/indexdotphp.txt
It's extremely short and easy to read. You can set up your own Check SSH(where you trust).

"more robust alternatives"
Trust me - HTTPS is more mature. And our code is more simple.

Best Wishes,
