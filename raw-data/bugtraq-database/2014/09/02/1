Excellent point and thanks for the tool! Indeed, fingerprint
verification is the absolute weak point of SSH. Here the problem
is that you have to trust the service operators when you use
checkssh or set up your own. Is the source code available
somewhere?

Also, a better solution is to use Monkeysphere which uses the
public key infrastructure of PGP. It can not just check your SSH
fingerprints automatically but do a whole lot of other things:
