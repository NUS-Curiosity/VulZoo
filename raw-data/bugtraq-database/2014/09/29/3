Subject: Hands-on Mobile (Android & iOS) + ARM Exploitation Training at Toorcon

Hello everyone,

I'm glad to announce that, I'll be running a 2-day class on Android,
iOS and ARM Hands-on Exploitation at Toorcon 2014 in San Diego this
October. The training will focus on a hands-on approach to find vulns
and exploit them on mobile applications as well as the platform as
well.

All the exercises will be performed on a customised Mobile
Exploitation training distro
and on a set of vulnerable labs built for Toorcon class. The labs
contains of over 25+
challenges over a span of 2 days along with 2 final CTF competition.

 The goal of the class is to take the students from a ground level to
upwards of you being
 able to find and exploit vulnerabilities in any real world
application. Some of the topics
 that will be covered are :

 [+] Internals of Android and iOS Security architecture
 [+] Finding application based vulnerabilities
 [+] OWASP Mobile Top 10 and lesser known vulns
 [+] Exploiting Platform based weaknesses
 [+] Assessing security of native apps
 [+] Breaking obfuscation for mobile apps
 [+] Security weaknesses in BYOD/MDM solutions
 [+] Dex and Smali Labs for Android
 [+] ARM Exploitation on Real world scenarios

 Attendees will also be receiving :

 [+] 3 months free access to online labs for mobile exploitation
 [+] Reference materials for mobile exploitation
 [+] Mobile Application Security Checklist for developers & security
professionals
 [+] Winners of CTF will also receive author signed copy of "Learning
Pentesting for Android Devices"

 I've been running a previous version of this class for the past two
years at Toorcon,
 receiving amazing feedback from the students. Apart from Toorcon, a modified
 early version of this training has also been conducted at BlackHat,
Syscan, OWASP AppSec, Brucon, HackInParis etc.

 There are limited number of seats which usually fill out quite fast.
