Package        : dbus
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3635 CVE-2014-3636 CVE-2014-3637 CVE-2014-3638 
                 CVE-2014-3639

Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie discovered several vulnerabilities in
the D-Bus message daemon.

CVE-2014-3635

    On 64-bit platforms, file descriptor passing could be abused by
    local users to cause heap corruption in the dbus-daemon crash,
    leading to a crash, or potentially to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2014-3636

    A denial-of-service vulnerability in dbus-daemon allowed local
    attackers to prevent new connections to dbus-daemon, or disconnect
    existing clients, by exhausting descriptor limits.

CVE-2014-3637

    Malicious local users could create D-Bus connections to
    dbus-daemon which could not be terminated by killing the
    participating processes, resulting in a denial-of-service
    vulnerability.

CVE-2014-3638

    dbus-daemon suffered from a denial-of-service vulnerability in the
    code which tracks which messages expect a reply, allowing local
    attackers to reduce the performance of dbus-daemon.

CVE-2014-3639

    dbus-daemon did not properly reject malicious connections from
    local users, resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.8-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.
