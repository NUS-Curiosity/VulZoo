Apache Struts 2 Command Execution Vulnerability in Multiple Cisco Products

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20140709-struts2

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2014 July 9 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple Cisco products include an implementation of the Apache Struts 2 component that is affected by a remote command execution vulnerability identified by Apache with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ID CVE-2010-1870.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization on user-supplied input in the XWorks component of the affected software. The component uses the ParameterInterceptors directive to parse the Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions that are implemented via a whitelist feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain OGNL expressions to an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability for all the affected products except Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series. Customers using Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series should contact their Cisco representative for available options.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available. This advisory is available at the following link:
