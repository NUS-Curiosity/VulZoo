Package        : dbus
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3477 CVE-2014-3532 CVE-2014-3533

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in dbus, an asynchronous
inter-process communication system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-3477

    Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered that dbus-daemon sends an
    AccessDenied error to the service instead of a client when the
    client is prohibited from accessing the service. A local attacker
    could use this flaw to cause a bus-activated service that is not
    currently running to attempt to start, and fail, denying other users
    access to this service.

CVE-2014-3532

    Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered a bug in dbus-daemon's
    support for file descriptor passing. A malicious process could force
    system services or user applications to be disconnected from the
    D-Bus system by sending them a message containing a file descriptor,
    leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2014-3533

    Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. and Alejandro Martinez Suarez
    discovered that a malicious process could force services to be
    disconnected from the D-Bus system by causing dbus-daemon to attempt
    to forward invalid file descriptors to a victim process, leading to
    a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.
