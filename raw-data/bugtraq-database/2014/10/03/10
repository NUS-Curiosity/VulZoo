 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:195
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libvirt
 Date    : October 3, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in libvirt:
 
 An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way libvirt&#039;s
 qemuDomainGetBlockIoTune() function looked up the disk index in
 a non-persistent (live) disk configuration while a persistent disk
 configuration was being indexed. A remote attacker able to establish a
 read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd
 or, potentially, leak memory from the libvirtd process (CVE-2014-3633).
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in the way libvirt&#039;s
 virConnectListAllDomains() function computed the number of used
 domains. A remote attacker able to establish a read-only connection
 to libvirtd could use this flaw to make any domain operations within
 libvirt unresponsive (CVE-2014-3657).
 
 The updated libvirt packages have been upgraded to the 1.1.3.6 version
 and patched to resolve these security flaws.
