Vulnerability Laboratory ID (VL-ID):
====================================

Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
3.2


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
The BulletProof Security Plugin allows you to create and activate .htaccess website security with one-click (figuratively) for 
your website without having to know anything about .htaccess files. The Master .htaccess files are pre-made and BPS writes 
.htaccess code that is customized to each specific website. There is nothing to figure out or to configure. Click the AutoMagic 
buttons (creates customized Master .htaccess files) and Activate BulletProof Modes (copies the customized Master .htaccess files 
to your root and wp-admin folders). BPS has built-in Backup and Restore and an .htaccess File Editor for full manual editing 
control as well. BPS Custom Code allows you to add additional custom .htaccess code or BPS Bonus Custom Code.

Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a persistent POST inject web vulnerability in the official Bulletproof Security (BPS) v50.8 Wordpress Plugin.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2014-09-30: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
AIT-pro
Product: BPS Wordpress Plugin - Web Application  50.8 


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side POST inject web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Bulletproof Security (BPS) v50.8 Wordpress Plugin.
The issue allows remote attackers to inject own malicious persistent script code to the application-side of the vulnerable module.

The vulnerability is located in the bspURL value of the wp_remote_get POST method request in the system-info.php file. Remote attackers can form 
malicious pages to perform application-side executions via POST injection attack. The vulnerability is local and remote exploitable. During the 
testings the researcher discovered that the `Check Headers GET request` and `Check Headers HEAD request` are the vulnerable input fields.
The execution after the inject occurs in the main system-info.php next to the `Check Website Headers Tool` web context.

The security risk of the persistent POST inject vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.2. 
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account but low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent phishing attacks, session hijacking, persistent external redirect to malicious 
sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] System Info > Check Website Headers Tool

Vulnerable Input(s):
				[+] Check Headers GET request
				[+] Check Headers HEAD request

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] bspURL (wp_remote_get)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] System Information (system-info.php)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The POST inject web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers and by remote attackers without privileged application user account 
with low or medium user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information 
and steps below to continue.

PoC: Exploit (system-info.php)

<form name="bpsHeadersHead" action="admin.php?page=bulletproof-security/admin/system-info/system-info.php" method="post">
<input id="_wpnonce" name="_wpnonce" value="055c5fd94e" type="hidden"><input name="_wp_http_referer" 
value="/dev/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bulletproof-security/admin/system-info/system-info.php" type="hidden">
<div><label for="bpsHeaders"><strong>Enter a Website URL - Example: http://www.ait-pro.com/</strong></label><br>
    <input name="bpsURL" value="" size="50" type="text"> <br>
    <p class="submit">
	<input name="Submit-Headers-Check-Head" class="bps-blue-button" value="Check Headers HEAD Request" 
onclick="return confirm('This cURL Headers check makes a HEAD Request and you will see HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden displayed if you are 
blocking HEAD Requests in your BPS root .htaccess file on your website.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n
Use the Check Headers GET Request tool to check your headers using GET instead of HEAD. This tool can also be used to check that your Security 
Log is working correctly and will generate a Security Log entry when you make a HEAD Request using this tool if you are blocking HEAD Requests 
in your BPS root .htaccess file on your website.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClick OK to proceed or 
click Cancel.')" type="submit"></p>

/wp-admin/%5C%22x%5C%22[PERSISTENT INJECTED SCRIPT CODE!]


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure encode and parse of the vulnerable bpsURL value.
Restrict the input and filter wrong context to prevent persistent script code execution with a secure exception-handling.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the POST inject web vulnerability in the vulnerable bpsURL parameter is estimated as medium.
