NOTE: HP strongly recommends implementing the following security best
practices to help reduce both known and future security vulnerability risks:

Isolate the HP Integrity Server's management network by keeping it separate
from the data or production network, and not connecting it directly to the
Internet without additional access authentication.
Patch and maintain Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and web
servers.
Use virus scanners, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and
vulnerability scanners regularly.
Apply all recommended HP Firmware updates.
