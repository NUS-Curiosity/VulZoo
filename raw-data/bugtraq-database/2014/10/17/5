APPLE-SA-2014-10-16-2 Security Update 2014-005

Security Update 2014-005 is now available and addresses the
following:

Secure Transport
Available for:  OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5
Impact:  An attacker may be able to decrypt data protected by SSL
Description:  There are known attacks on the confidentiality of SSL
3.0 when a cipher suite uses a block cipher in CBC mode. An attacker
could force the use of SSL 3.0, even when the server would support a
better TLS version, by blocking TLS 1.0 and higher connection
attempts. This issue was addressed by disabling CBC cipher suites
when TLS connection attempts fail.
CVE-ID
CVE-2014-3566 : Bodo Moeller, Thai Duong, and Krzysztof Kotowicz of
Google Security Team

Note: Security Update 2014-005 includes the security content of
OS X bash Update 1.0. For further details see
