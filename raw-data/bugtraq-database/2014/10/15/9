Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered three XSS vulnerabilities in WP Google Maps WordPress plugin, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against administrators of vulnerable WP website.

1) Multiple XSS in WP Google Maps WordPress plugin: CVE-2014-7182

1.1 Input passed via the "poly_id" HTTP GET parameter to "/wp-admin/admin.php" script is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display "immuniweb" word:

http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-google-maps-menu&action=edit_poly&map_id=1&poly_id=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28/immuniweb/%29;%3C/script%3E

1.2 Input passed via the "poly_id" HTTP GET parameter to "/wp-admin/admin.php" script is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display "immuniweb" word:
http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-google-maps-menu&action=edit_polyline&map_id=1&poly_id=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28/immuniweb/%29;%3C/script%3E

1.3 Input passed via the "poly_id" HTTP GET parameter to "/wp-admin/admin.php" script is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display "immuniweb" word:
http://wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-google-maps-menu&action=edit_marker&id=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28/immuniweb/%29;%3C/script%3E
