Package        : drupal7
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-2983

An information disclosure vulnerability was discovered in Drupal, a
fully-featured content management framework. When pages are cached for
anonymous users, form state may leak between anonymous users. Sensitive
or private information recorded for one anonymous user could thus be
disclosed to other users interacting with the same form at the same
time.

This security update introduces small API changes, see the upstream
advisory at https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-002 for further information.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.14-2+deb7u4.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.27-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.27-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.
