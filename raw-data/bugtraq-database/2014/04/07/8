Advisory Details:

During a Pentest Help AG discovered the following:
Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the message board. Logged in as a Super User we managed to inject malicious cross site scripting payloads via enterprise messages. The payload would execute in the context of every user in the system. This could be used to hijack session, provide victims with phishing pages or completely compromise the computer that is executing the payload.

1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Pearson eSIS Enterprise Student Information System: CVE-2014-1454

To reproduce the issue a Super User account is needed. After that is accomplished one needs to log in, go to the message board functionality of eSIS and create a new enterprise message using the HTML tab and add the following payload as a message:
<img src="https://esisplatform.example.com/aal/1" onerror="alert(document.cookie)">


Hackers could compromise a Super User account and send a malicious message to every teacher/student using the platform. This can be anything from a session hijacker script to a malicious backdoor
