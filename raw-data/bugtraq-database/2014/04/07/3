The Mediawiki update issued as DSA 2891-1 caused regressions. This
update fixes those problems. For reference the original advisory
text follows.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in MediaWiki, a wiki engine.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project describers the followin
issues:

CVE-2013-2031

    Cross-site scripting attack via valid UTF-7 encoded sequences
    in a SVG file.

CVE-2013-4567 & CVE-2013-4568

    Kevin Israel (Wikipedia user PleaseStand) reported two ways
    to inject Javascript due to an incomplete blacklist in the
    CSS sanitizer function.

CVE-2013-4572

    MediaWiki and the CentralNotice extension were incorrectly setting
    cache headers when a user was autocreated, causing the user's
    session cookies to be cached, and returned to other users.

CVE-2013-6452

    Chris from RationalWiki reported that SVG files could be
    uploaded that include external stylesheets, which could lead to
    XSS when an XSL was used to include JavaScript.

CVE-2013-6453

    MediaWiki's SVG sanitization could be bypassed when the XML was
    considered invalid.

CVE-2013-6454

    MediaWiki's CSS sanitization did not filter -o-link attributes,
    which could be used to execute JavaScript in Opera 12.

CVE-2013-6472

    MediaWiki displayed some information about deleted pages in
    the log API, enhanced RecentChanges, and user watchlists.

CVE-2014-1610

    A remote code execution vulnerability existed if file upload
    support for DjVu (natively handled) or PDF files (in
    combination with the PdfHandler extension) was enabled.
    Neither file type is enabled by default in MediaWiki.

CVE-2014-2665

    Cross site request forgery in login form: an attacker could login
    a victim as the attacker.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.19.15+dfsg-0+deb7u1 of the mediawiki package and 3.5~deb7u2
of the mediawiki-extensions package.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.19.15+dfsg-1 of the mediawiki package and 3.5 of the
mediawiki-extensions package.

We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.
