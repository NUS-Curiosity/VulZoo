Package        : a2ps
CVE ID         : CVE-2001-1593 CVE-2014-0466
Debian Bug     : 737385 742902

Several vulnerabilities have been found in a2ps, an 'Anything to
PostScript' converter and pretty-printer. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2001-1593

    The spy_user function which is called when a2ps is invoked with the
    --debug flag insecurely used temporary files.

CVE-2014-0466

    Brian M. Carlson reported that a2ps's fixps script does not invoke
    gs with the -dSAFER option. Consequently executing fixps on a
    malicious PostScript file could result in files being deleted or
    arbitrary commands being executed with the privileges of the user
    running fixps.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.14-1.1+deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.14-1.1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your a2ps packages.
