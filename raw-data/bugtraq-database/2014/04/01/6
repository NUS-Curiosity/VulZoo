It looks April Fools' Day is playing with us too...There is some minor,
though potentially important error in our previous post (and the above).

We know that Oracle Java Cloud Service was vulnerable between Jun
2013 and Jan 2014. We erroneously stated that it was a year earlier.

My apologies for the error and any confusion originating from it.

Thank you.
