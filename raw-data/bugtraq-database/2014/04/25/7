VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified in HP BladeSystem
c-Class Virtual Connect Support Utility (VCSU) running OpenSSL on Linux and
Windows. This is the OpenSSL vulnerability known as "Heartbleed" which could
be exploited remotely resulting in disclosure of information. The Virtual
Connect firmware itself is not vulnerable to CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed),
however, the installer component in versions 4.10 and 4.20 of Virtual Connect
does have the vulnerability, and should be replaced with versions 4.10b or
4.20b, or the latest version of Virtual Connect Support Utility referenced
below. The VCSU vulnerability is only present during the firmware upgrade
process.
