RESOLUTION

HP is actively working to address this vulnerability for the impacted
firmware versions of HP StoreEver ESL G3 Tape Library and Enterprise Library
LTO-6 Tape Drives. This bulletin will be revised when the software updates
are released.

HP recommends the following mitigation or workaround that can reduce the
likelihood of an attacker being able to exploit the "Heartbleed"
vulnerability for the HP StoreEver ESL G3 Tape Library and the StoreEver
Enterprise Library LTO-6 Tape Drives:

The following configuration options that allow access to the Heartbeat
function in the vulnerable versions of OpenSSL are not enabled by default.
Verify that the following options are "disabled" using the Tape Library GUI:

Secure SMI-S
CVTL User

Note: disabling these features blocks the vulnerable OpenSSL function in both
the ESL G3 Tape Library and the StoreEver Enterprise Library LTO-6 Tape
Drives. The basic functionality of the library is not affected by these
configuration changes and SSL access to the user interface is not blocked by
these settings.
