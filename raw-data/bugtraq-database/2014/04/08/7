Package        : tomcat7
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2067 CVE-2013-2071 CVE-2013-4286 CVE-2013-4322 
                 CVE-2014-0050

Multiple security issues were found in the Tomcat servlet and JSP engine:

CVE-2013-2067

    FORM authentication associates the most recent request requiring 
    authentication with the current session. By repeatedly sending a request 
    for an authenticated resource while the victim is completing the login 
    form, an attacker could inject a request that would be executed using the 
    victim's credentials.

CVE-2013-2071

    A runtime exception in AsyncListener.onComplete() prevents the request from 
    being recycled. This may expose elements of a previous request to a current 
    request.

CVE-2013-4286

    Reject requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length 
    header when chunked encoding is being used.

CVE-2013-4322

    When processing a request submitted using the chunked transfer encoding, 
    Tomcat ignored but did not limit any extensions that were included. This allows 
    a client to perform a limited denial of service. by streaming an unlimited amount 
    of data to the server.

CVE-2014-0050

    Multipart requests with a malformed Content-Type header could trigger an 
    infinite loop causing a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.28-4+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.52-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.52-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.
