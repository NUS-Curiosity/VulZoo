Package        : dpkg
Debian Bug     : 746306

Javier Serrano Polo discovered that the recent dpkg update introduced a
vulnerability in systems where the patch utility did not support
C-style filename quoting - such as the oldstable distribution
(squeeze). This revision of dpkg instead refuses to process patches
with C-style filename quoting altogether.

For reference, the original text of DSA-2915-1 is reproduced below:

Jakub Wilk discovered that dpkg did not correctly parse C-style
filename quoting, allowing for paths to be traversed when unpacking a
source package - leading to the creation of files outside the directory
of the source being unpacked.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.15.10.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.16.14.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17.9.

We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.
