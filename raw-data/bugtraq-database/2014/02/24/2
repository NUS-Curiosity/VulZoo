CFP Registration: https://cfp.44con.com/
Tickets *available now*: http://shop.44con.com/

The conference will host two speaking tracks, two workshop tracks and a

mix of Infosec Professional and softer technical talks while day two 
will host two fully technical tracks and the hidden track. The proposed 
schedule can be found here: http://www.44con.com/schedule.

This is the Call for Papers, Talks and Workshops for 44CON 2014. Both 
Technical and Infosec Professional talk submissions will be accepted. 
Talks are 45 minutes long. Workshops are either 60 or 120 minutes in length.

]-- Submissions

Submissions should be sent via the CFP website (https://cfp.44con.com/). 
Submissions are reviewed by a panel consisting of end-user industry 
specialists from industry rock stars and CxOs to burned out techies.

In particular, we are looking for original talks of the highest quality 
in the following areas:

1. Offensive and Defensive Technologies and Techniques
2. Bugs - Finding, Fixing and Reverse Engineering
3. Incident Handling, Detection, Forensics and Anti-Forensics
4. Cloud Computing and Virtualisation Security
5. Owning the Enterprise
6. Attacking and Defending the Online Economy
7. Embedded/Hardware Hacking
8. Application and Mobile Security
9. Networking and Comms
10. UK and European Critical National Infrastructure (CNI)
11. Threats, Risk, Controls, Governance, Compliance
12. Humans, Social Engineering and Layer 8

New talks tend to score higher than repeat talks in the CFP review stage 
but this is not a hard and fast rule. If you plan to repeat a talk less 
than 6 months after 44CON, we need to know when and where so we can plan 
for it.

Note: this is not an exhaustive list. If you have a good talk proposal 
covering something not mentioned above, please let us know.
