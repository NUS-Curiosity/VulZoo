Open Web Analytics Pre-Auth SQL Injection

Advisory Information
Title: Open Web Analytics Pre-Auth SQL Injection
Advisory ID: SWRX-2014-001
Advisory URL: http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/advisories/SWRX-2014-001/
Date published: Thursday, January 9, 2014
CVE: CVE-2014-1206
CVSS v2 base score: 7.5
Date of last update: Wednesday, January 8, 2014
Vendors contacted: Open Web Analytics
Release mode: Coordinated
Discovered by: Dana James Traversie, Dell SecureWorks

Summary
Open Web Analytics (OWA) is open source web analytics software that can track and analyze how visitors use websites and applications. OWA is vulnerable to SQL injection that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements in the context of the configured OWA database user without authenticating to the web application.

Affected products
This vulnerability affects Open Web Analytics v1.5.4.

Vendor Information, Solutions, and Workarounds
The vendor has released an updated version to address this vulnerability. OWA users should upgrade to version v1.5.5 or later.

Details
An SQL injection vulnerability exists in Open Web Analytics v1.5.4 due to insufficient input validation of the �owa_email_address� parameter on the password reset page. The password reset page does not require user authentication. A remote attacker can leverage this issue to execute arbitrary SQL statements in the context of the configured OWA database user. The impact of the vulnerability varies based on the deployment and configuration of the OWA, database, and web server software. Successful exploitation could result in complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the OWA database and may affect the entire underlying database management system. This issue could also lead to operating system compromise under the right conditions.

CVSS severity (version 2.0)
Access vector: Network
Access complexity: Low
Authentication: None
Impact type: Manipulation of SQL queries and execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying
