 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:034
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : yaml
 Date    : February 14, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected in yaml:
 
 The yaml_parser_scan_tag_uri function in scanner.c in LibYAML before
 0.1.5 performs an incorrect cast, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which triggers
 a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2013-6393).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the 0.1.5 version which
 is not vulnerable to this issue.
