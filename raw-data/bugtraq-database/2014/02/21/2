About the Vendor
-------------------------
The InterWorx Hosting Control Panel is a web hosting and linux server
management system that provides tools for server administrators to
command their servers and for end users to oversee the operations of
their website.

Advisory Details:
-------------------------
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the InterWorx
Web Control Panel.

The application uses XMLHttpRequests to post messages to the web
server. However, insufficient output encoding is performed enabling
remote execution of arbitrary scripting code in the target's web
browser. By changing the request method from POST to GET the following
URL could be used as proof of concept:
