========================================================================

============================ Overview ==================================

During analysis of the SWF file format used by commercial Flash authoring
applications multiple heap overflows were discovered within Adobe Flash
CS3 Professional, and Adobe Flash MX 2004.

Heap overflow conditions occurred when opening or importing malformed .SWF
files within the Flash authoring applications.

Exploitable conditions were related to excessively long control parameters
within an SWF file, which resulted in a heap overflow condition.

Exploitation of the heap overflow conditions would allow a malicious user
to gain command execution on the system which opened the file.

Only the Flash authoring software was found to insecurely parse malformed
.SWF files.

The Flash player was NOT found to be vulnerable to these specific attacks.


=========================== Solutions ==================================

A patch has been released from Adobe to address this vulnerability within CS3.
Additionally Adobe Flash CS4 has been officially released which resolves
these particular vulnerabilities.
