Subject: HTTPBruteForcer released

Hi there,

Due to the high number of requests, I have decided to release a fully
usable version of HTTPBruteForcer, the free and easy to use web-based
login forms' bruteforcer for Windows.
HTTP BruteForcer is a tool designed for webmasters, programmers and
websites administrators, or pentesters, to perfom a password strength
check against a simple web login form.

The old demo version was limited to a limited built-in wordlist.
The new public version let you use a custom wordlist. (
https://www.securinfos.info/wordlists-dictionnaires.php or default
passwords list
