Subject: MS08-067 - Where can I find an exploit for this?

Hello

There are some computers I know of that are NEVER updated (well
Service Packs, but that's all).

What I wish to do (with permission) is to show the owners of these
computers why they HAVE TO update there computer.

Here is the information about this (MS08-067);

Please tell me where I can find an exploit for MS08-067.

Thanks in advance,
