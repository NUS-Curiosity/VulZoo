Subject: KVIrc version 3.4.0 Virgo remote format string proof of concept exploit.

Regarding:

http://www.zeroscience.org/codes.html

It seems like this is the old 
http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2951 , found 
by Stefan Cornelius from Secunia Research and patched in kvirc >= 
3.2.6_pre20070714 . Tested y users on 3.4.0 and 3.4.2, can't reproduce. 
What's the point in this?
