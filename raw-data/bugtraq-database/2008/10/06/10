Subject: RE: RE: MySQL command-line client HTML injection vulnerability

Hi,

So, should we bring up all patches that have been released 5 months ago
or thereabouts?  There's been a LOT of serious vulnerabilities released
since then - if you're 5 months behind in patching, then there's more
serious questions than this one patch.

We ALL need to keep up to date with patches.  5 month old patches are
ancient news and should have been taken care of no more than about 4
months ago at the most.  If this list were to make mention of all old
patches after 5 months or so, the list would be flooded with nigh on
useless information taking the bandwidth as compared to new, relevant
patch and vulnerability. information.
