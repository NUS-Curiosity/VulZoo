Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.30.08: Adobe PageMaker Key Strings
 Stack Buffer Overflow

iDefense Security Advisory 10.30.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
OCT 30, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe PageMaker is document layout application, and is commonly used for
desktop publishing. For more information see the vendor's website found
at the following address.

http://www.adobe.com/products/pagemaker/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in Adobe
Systems Inc.'s PageMaker could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the current user.

  A vulnerability exists within the handling of PMD files, the native
file format for storing PageMaker documents. When parsing a malformed
PMD file, data from the file is copied into a buffer without proper
validation. This results in an exploitable stack based buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the file.
Exploitation would require that an attacker hosts a maliciously crafted
document on a website and entice users to visit the site. An attacker
could also e-mail the malicious document and use social engineering
techniques to trick the e-mail recipient into opening the document.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Adobe
PageMaker version 7.0.1 with the CVE-2007-5169 patch applied. Previous
versions may also be affected. However, Adobe InDesign CS, the
successor to PageMaker, is not affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Adobe categorizes this as a critical issue and recommends affected users
patch their installations, and avoid opening PageMaker files from
untrusted or unknown sources.
