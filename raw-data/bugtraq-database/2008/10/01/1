Subject: RE: MySQL command-line client HTML injection vulnerability

Hi Thomas,

This bug was fixed in a MySQL release dated 01 May 2008.  It is now 01
Oct 2008 - 5 months after the bug was released.  So why exactly is this
news?  Did I miss something here?

> 
> DESCRIPTION
> 
> The mysql command-line client does not quote HTML special characters
> like < in its output. This allows an attacker who is able to write
data
> into a table to hide or modify records in the output, and to inject
> potentially dangerous code, e. g. Javascript to perform cross-site
> scripting or cross-site request forgery attacks.
> 
> HOW TO REPRODUCE
> 
> $ mysql --html --execute "select '<a>'" ...
> <TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TH><a></TH></TR><TR><TD><a></TD></TR></TABLE>

> RESOLUTION
> 
> Users are advised to install the available patch from

> 
> WORKAROUND
> 
> If another resolution is not feasible, users are advised to modify
> their
>  SELECT statements to filter out the characters < and &:
> 
> SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE(...,'&','&amp;'),'<','&lt;') AS ...;
> 
> This workaround is incompatible with the described resolution and
> should
> be reversed after installation of the patch.
