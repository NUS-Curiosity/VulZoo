Subject: Universal Website Hijacking by Exploiting Firewall Content Filtering Features + SonicWALL firewalls 0day

Hello folks,

Yesterday, I presented for the first time [1] a new method to perform
universal website hijacking by exploiting content filtering features
commonly supported by corporate firewalls. I briefly discussed [2] the
finding on GNUCITIZEN in the past without giving away the details, but
rather mentioning what the attacker can do and some characteristics of
the attack.

Anyway, I'm now releasing full details on how the technique works, and
a real 0day example against SonicWALL firewalls.

The paper can be found on the GNUCITIZEN labs site. Please let me know
if you can successfully use the same technique against firewalls by
other vendors:

Finally, I'd like to thank Zero Day Initiative [3] for their great
work and the Hack in the Box crew for organizing such a fine event!

Regards,
ap.
