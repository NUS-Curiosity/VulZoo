____________________________________________________________________________

Overview:
--------
EATON MGE Office Protection Systems designs and manufactures secured
power products and solutions for enterprises, small business and homes.
The Network Shutdown Module continuously wait for information from the
Management Proxy or Management Card connected to the EATON UPS and warns
administrators and users if AC power fails and proceeds with graceful
system shutdown before the end of battery backup power is reached.

Description:
--------
Remote exploitation of an authentication bypass vulnerability could
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

In detail, the following flaw was determined:

- Custom actions can be added to the MGE frontend without authentication
   required (pane_actionbutton.php)
- Actions can be executed (tested) without authentication required
   (exec_action.php)


Impact:
--------
This problem can lead to a remote file execution vulnerability. It can
allow an attacker to add and execute custom actions. The commands to be
executed are included within the added action.

The vulnerability is present in MGE Network Shutdown Module software
versions prior 3.10 build 13.

Solution
--------
EATON MGE Office Protection Systems has issued an update to correct this
vulnerability. A new version of the software (version 3.20) can be found at:
