Subject: Application-level OS fingerprinting research - pre-release hashes

Since I seem to have the curse of waiting too long to release research and then seeing it released by someone else, I've decided I'm going to release a couple hashes of an existing version of the presentation I've made on the topic while I iron it out with some peer review.

The research I'm doing deals with performing OS fingerprinting through application-level probing more advanced than simple banner grabbing. I will also give several examples with Apache HTTP server version 2.2.9, the latest at the time the paper was written. I expect these techniques should work on most versions of Apache, though I have not tested it.

The hashes are for a .ppt file, though I hope to have the research available as a whitepaper as well, in .pdf and .txt format.

I should be releasing it by the end of the month if all goes according to plan.

Thank you!

And let's not forget the hashes...

MD5: e6d94b5998a68d4e611e2f03691d7e9c
SHA1: 1d2147b42dbb3142fdddbcfef518ec0e12e5300b
SHA256: 9108faaa17b2cbe118f76c3e3c81a923ae99693065cb2710adf17a1bfde6166d
CRC32: 66ecf986

(these hashes were calculated with HashCalc)
