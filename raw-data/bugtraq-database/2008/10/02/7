Subject: Re: [MajorSecurity Advisory #53]BLUEPAGE CMS - Cross Site
 Scripting and Session Fixation Issues

The vendor released a new working patch which solves the released vulnerabilities. All BluePage CMS versions hosted by the vendor himself have been automaticly updated to BluePage CMS version 2.5.8 .

We recommened users to update to version 2.5.8 as soon as possible to make sure they are running a fixed version.
