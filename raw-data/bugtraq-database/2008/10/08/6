Subject: Windows Mobile 6 insecure password handling and too short WLAN-password

hi list,

I noticed on my HTC Hermes with latest available WM6 (not 6.1!), that
after I entered the password for my WLAN, auto-copletion knows the
phrase and suggests my WLAN-password for almost any input-field.
Further, the memory for passwordstorage is way too small. I can enter
my whole password (auto-completion shows it correctly) but i still
can't connect. If I re-enter the settings, I get shown only 17 dots.
But this isn't enough for my password.

any1 can see the same behavior on his device?
