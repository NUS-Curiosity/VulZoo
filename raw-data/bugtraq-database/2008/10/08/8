Not fixed in any version I know of.
Patch has been available for 5 months, but this has not gotten into any
production version (or am I wrong?)
Try this on your system:

mysql --html --execute "select '<a>'"

If you get this, then its not patched:
<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TH><a></TH></TR><TR><TD><a></TD></TR></TABLE>

If you get this (on 5.1, a little different than 5.0) than its patched:
(note the escaped <a>)
