Sun Solstice AdminSuite sadmind adm_build_path() Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

http://risesecurity.org/advisories/RISE-2008001.txt
Published: October 14, 2008

INTRODUCTION

There exists a vulnerability within a function of the Sun Solstice AdminSuite 
sadmind, which when properly exploited can lead to remote compromise of the 
vulnerable system.
This vulnerability was confirmed by us in the following versions of the Sun 
operating system, other versions may be also affected.

Sun Solaris 9 SPARC
Sun Solaris 9 x86
Sun Solaris 8 SPARC
Sun Solaris 8 x86

DETAILS

Solstice AdminSuite is a collection of graphical user interface tools and 
commands used to perform administrative tasks such as managing users, groups, 
hosts, system files, printers, disks, file systems, terminals, and modems.

The distributed system administration daemon (sadmind) is the daemon used by 
Solstice AdminSuite applications to perform distributed system administration 
operations.

The sadmind daemon is started automatically by the inetd daemon whenever a 
request to invoke an operation is received. The sadmind daemon process 
continues to run for 15 minutes after the last request is completed, unless a 
different idle-time is specified with the -i command line option. The sadmind 
daemon may be started independently from the command line, for example, at 
system boot time. In this case, the -i option has no effect; sadmind continues 
to run, even if there are no active requests.

The vulnerable function adm_build_path() does does not validate user supplied 
data when appending it to a stack-based buffer using strcat(), resulting in a 
stack-based buffer overflow. The exploitation of this vulnerability is trivial 
and results in remote compromise of the vulnerable system.
This is the debug information about this vulnerability (from Sun Solaris 9 x86).

VENDOR

Sun Security Coordination Team was notified of this issue, proper corrections
should be available soon. Meanwhile, we recommend disabling the distributed
system administration daemon (sadmind).
