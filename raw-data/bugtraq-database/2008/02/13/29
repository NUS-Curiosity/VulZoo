For Public Release 2008 February 13 1600 UTC (GMT)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager is vulnerable to a SQL Injection
attack in the parameter key of the admin and user interface pages. A
successful attack could allow an authenticated attacker to access
information such as usernames and password hashes that are stored in
the database.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2008-0026 
leavingcisco.com has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080213-cucmsql.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco Unified Communication Manager 5.0/5.1 versions prior to 5.1(3a)
and 6.0/6.1 versions prior to 6.1(1a) are affected by this
vulnerability.

The software version of a CallManager or Unified Communications
Manager system can be determined by navigating to Show > Software via
the administration interface.

For Unified Communications Manager, the software version can also be
determined by running the show version active command in the Command
Line Interface (CLI).

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco CallManager or Unified Communication Manager systems prior to
5.0 are not affected by this vulnerability. No 3.x and 4.x releases
are vulnerable.

No other Cisco products are known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified CallManager/Communications Manager (CUCM) is the call
processing component of the Cisco IP telephony solution. This
solution extends enterprise telephony features and functions to
packet telephony network devices such as IP phones, media processing
devices, voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateways, and multimedia applications.

An attacker can trigger this SQL injection vulnerability by entering
a specially crafted value is entered in the key parameter of either
the admin or user interface page. Attacks against this vulnerability
are conducted through the web interface and use the http or https
protocol. A successful attack could terminate a SQL call and force a
connection to the back-end database resulting in the disclosure of
potentially sensitive information such as usernames and password
hashes.

This vulnerability is documented as bug ID CSCsk64286

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is performed in accordance with
CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at

software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
