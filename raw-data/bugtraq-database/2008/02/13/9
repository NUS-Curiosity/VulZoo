-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists in the handling of the "by" property of an
animateMotion SVG element. By assigning other DOM elements to this
property, a memory corruption occurs during the destruction of a
Variant data type. The corruption causes an overwrite of a virtual
function address allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
