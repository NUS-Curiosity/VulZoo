I reported it a little while after mailing bugtraq, was
given bug ID #3728773 which was marked as a duplicate of
#3711425 (both after your duplicate of #3250780).
Keep in mind that the increment of millions probably
includes all kinds of automated bug submissions. 

As an aside to grabbing secrets from sleeping machines,
OS X's "secure virtual memory" will encrypt the hibernate
image (good) but then seems to store the key in a nvram
variable.  So that'd be another avenue of attack I guess.
