Synopsis
========

A vulnerability within Python's copy of PCRE might lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/python     < 2.3.6-r4                        >= 2.3.6-r4

Description
===========

Python 2.3 includes a copy of PCRE which is vulnerable to an integer
overflow vulnerability, leading to a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by tricking a vulnerable
Python application to compile a regular expressions, which could
possibly lead to the execution of arbitrary code, a Denial of Service
or the disclosure of sensitive information.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Python 2.3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.3.6-r4"
