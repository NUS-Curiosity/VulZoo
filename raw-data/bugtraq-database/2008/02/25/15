Subject: Packeteer Products File Listing XSS

Packeteer Products File Listing XSS


Product:

Packeteer PacketShaper
http://www.packeteer.com/products/packetshaper/

Packeteer PolicyCenter
http://www.packeteer.com/products/packetshaper/policycenter.cfm


The web management interface of several Packeteer products contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the file listing function. Parameter FILELIST, specified in an arbitrary page request, is not sufficiently sanitized before it gets embedded in the HTML output of the Error Report page. (The parameter value is limited to 64 characters.)

Example:
https://(target)/whatever.htm?FILELIST=%3C/script%3E%3Cbody+onLoad=alert(%26quot%3BXSS%26quot%3B)%3E%3Cscript%3E


The vulnerability has been identified in version 8.2.2. However, other versions may be also affected.


Solution:
Do not stay logged into the Packeteer web management interface while browsing other web sites.
