Alkacon OpenCms tree_files.jsp resource XSS


Product: Alkacon OpenCms

OpenCms contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the file tree navigation function. An invalid value supplied to parameter resource in page opencms/system/workplace/views/explorer/tree_files.jsp is not sanitized before it gets embedded in the HTML output as part of a JavaScript comment.

Example:
http://(target)/opencms/opencms/system/workplace/views/explorer/tree_files.jsp?resource=+*/+alert(document.cookie);+/*+/


The vulnerability has been identified in version 7.0.3. However, other versions may be also affected.


Solution:
