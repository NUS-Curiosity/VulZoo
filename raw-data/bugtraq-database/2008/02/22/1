Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV may result in the remote execution
of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus is a free anti-virus toolkit for UNIX, designed
especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.92.1                      >= 0.92.1

Description
===========

An integer overflow has been reported in the "cli_scanpe()" function in
file libclamav/pe.c (CVE-2008-0318). Another unspecified vulnerability
has been reported in file libclamav/mew.c (CVE-2008-0728).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to scan a
specially crafted file, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running ClamAV (either a system
user or the "clamav" user if clamd is compromised).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.92.1"
