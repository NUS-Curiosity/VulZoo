Synopsis
========

Several integer overflow vulnerabilities have been reported in
Gnumeric, possibly resulting in user-assisted execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

The Gnumeric spreadsheet is a versatile application developed as part
of the GNOME Office project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/gnumeric       < 1.8.1                        >= 1.8.1

Description
===========

Multiple integer overflow and signedness errors have been reported in
the excel_read_HLINK() function in file plugins/excel/ms-excel-read.c
when processing XLS HLINK opcodes.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted XLS
file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Gnumeric users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/gnumeric-1.8.1"
