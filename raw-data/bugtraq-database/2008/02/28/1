Subject: security and aluminum foil hats

Hi,

A video walk-through and explanation of the new security testing
methodology, OSSTMM 3, which I did recently has been created by Dreamlab
(www.dreamlab.net).  The video covers a walk-through of the most important
factors of OSSTMM 3 and a little bit about aluminum foil hats.  So if you
are interested in the new methodology, completely re-written and
re-structured from the ground up, check out the video.

The full OSSTMM 3 will still be released publicly and for free as soon as
we can get it out but all development has completed for this version and
only editing of the document is left.  We hope to make this the easiest and
most beneficial OSSTMM to use for everyone.  We want a manual professionals
can use but also to give to their clients as something very readable and
informative.

You can get see the video and download the presentation, "The Vision of the
OSSTMM" at:

Also, ISECOM is looking for training partners and trainers. Anyone
interested in being a training partner should contact us because we have
the next Train the Trainer class coming up March 31st - April 2nd in
Barcelona where it's sunny and warm ;)  Trainers are taught the newest
ISECOM research and even the terrible truth about security (you can see the
video for details about that).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
-pete.
