Subject: Windows Installer msiexec GUID Buffer Overflow

aushack.com - Vulnerability Advisory
-----------------------------------------------
Release Date:
 03-Jun-2008

Software:
 Microsoft Corporation - Windows Installer (msiexec.exe)
 http://www.microsoft.com/

 "Microsoft Windows Installer is an installation and configuration service that
  reduces the total cost of ownership. Windows Installer enables customers to
  provide better corporate deployment and provides a standard format for
  component management."

Versions tested:
 4.5.6001.22159 and 3.1.4000.1823 are vulnerable.
 Other versions are untested but assumed.

Vulnerability discovered:

 Unicode based stack overflow.

Vulnerability impact:

 Moderate - Code execution is possible but difficult due to the unicode
 	    conversion. Some ActiveX controls pass the GUID, so it may
	    be exploited remotely. Other avenues may also be present.

Vulnerability information:

 By specifying an overly long Globally Uniquie Identifier (GUID),
 it is possible to overwrite the stack and SE Handler.

 Example:

  msiexec.exe /x {<a few thousand A's>}
