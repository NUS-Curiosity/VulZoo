Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.03.08: Sun Java System Active Server
 Pages Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.03.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 03, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Sun Java System Active Server Pages is a multi-platform ASP application
server. It provides provides ASP (Active Server Pages) functionality to
a web server. More information is available at the following URL.

http://www.sun.com/software/chilisoft/index.xml

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Sun
Microsystem's Java System Active Server Pages allows attackers to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the ASP server.

The vulnerability exists within the request handling code within the ASP
server. An attacker supplied string is copied into a fixed size stack
buffer without first validating that there is sufficient space
available. By supplying a specially crafted request, an attacker can
cause a stack-based buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context
of the ASP server. This vulnerability can be reached from a normal web
server, usually on TCP port 80, configured to pass requests for ASP
applications through the ASP server. No authentication is required to
exploit this vulnerability. If this service is configured to run with
root privileges it is possible to gain complete control over the
affected system.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability within
version 4.0.2 of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java System Active Server
Pages. Older versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.

However, configuring the ASP server to run with reduced privileges can
help prevent a complete compromise. This can be accomplished via the
"Inherit user security" setting or setting a user and group to run with
when using the "Defined user security" mode.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Sun Microsystems has addressed this vulnerability with the release of
version 4.0.3 of Sun Java System Active Server Pages. For more
information, refer to Sun Alert 238184 at the following URL.
