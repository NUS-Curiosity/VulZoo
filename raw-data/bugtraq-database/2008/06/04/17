-- CVE ID:
CVE-2008-2541

-- Affected Vendors:
Computer Associates

-- Affected Products:
Computer Associates eTrust Secure Content Manager

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Computer Associates eTrust SCM.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the HTTP Gateway service icihttp.exe running
on port 8080.  When issuing a request for a FTP service the process
tries to decorate the contents of the transaction.  In this particular
case by specifying a overly long response to a LIST command a stack
buffer can be overflowed.  Successful exploitation can lead to complete
system compromise under the SYSTEM context.

vulnerability. More
