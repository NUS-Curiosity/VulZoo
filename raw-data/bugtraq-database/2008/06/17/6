Subject: iPhoneDbg Toolkit


Hello!

We are proud to announce the release of the iPhoneDbg Toolkit, an effort
towards iPhone exploit development.

You can find it here:
http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/iphonedbg.html.

- What is the iPhoneDbg Toolkit?

This set of tools will enable you to delve into iPhone Binary Reversing.

    * The iPhone Debugger allows you to debug running or newly-created
native processes inside iPhone (iphonedbg).
    * The Library Loader Patcher will allow to debug iPhone libraries
(dyld_patcher).
    * You can also build a tunnel from your PC to your iPhone through
USB (iphone_tunnel.exe).

Thanks!
Nicolas (*)
