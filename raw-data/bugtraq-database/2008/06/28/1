Subject: [Tool] PktAnon packet trace anonymization tool released

I am glad to announce the release of PktAnon 1.2.0 - a tool for 
profile-based network trace anonymization of pcap/tcpdump traces.

PktAnon supports a large number of protocol and anonymization 
primitives. All fields of a protocol can be addressed using PktAnon, 
therefore making PktAnon highly flexible. The anonymization is 
configured through XML profiles and allows arbitrary mappings of network 
protocol fields to anonymization primitives. Anonymization of live 
traffic is as well supported as interplay with other tools such as e.g. 
tcpreplay for live replay of anonymized network traffic.

PktAnon is available from http://www.tm.uka.de/pktanon
Feedback and cooperation is highly welcome!

Please note that this is a development release and not yet in a final 
state. Therefore care must be taken when releasing anonymized network 
traces.

Best regards,
Chris
