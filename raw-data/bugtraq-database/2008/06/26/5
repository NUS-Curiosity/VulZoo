Description

Evolution is an email client that is built with ubuntu.


------------------------------------------------------
Vulnerability

	
The vulnerability works when mail is sent and specially armed with html code, this causes the client to break.

Analyzing with a debugger, you can see the failure with the following function.


0xb7a219d7 in html_engine_get_view_width () from /usr/lib/libgtkhtml-3.14.so.19


------------------------------------------------------
POC/EXPLOIT

	
The proof of concept can be done locally, 
when you save the following code in a html file and then load it into an e-mail from the new option "insert" and "html file",
as that could verify the client is broken.

<IFRAME SRC="A"></IFRAME>
<FRAMESET><FRAME SRC="A"></FRAMESET>
