Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd may lead to information disclosure
or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

lighttpd is a lightweight high-performance web server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /   Vulnerable   /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/lighttpd      < 1.4.19-r2                >= 1.4.19-r2

Description
===========

Julien Cayzax discovered that an insecure default setting exists in
mod_userdir in lighttpd. When userdir.path is not set the default value
used is $HOME. It should be noted that the "nobody" user's $HOME is "/"
(CVE-2008-1270). An error also exists in the SSL connection code which
can be triggered when a user prematurely terminates his connection
(CVE-2008-1531).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit the first vulnerability to read
arbitrary files. The second vulnerability can be exploited by a remote
attacker to cause a Denial of Service by terminating a victim's SSL
connection.

Workaround
==========

As a workaround for CVE-2008-1270 you can set userdir.path to a
sensible value, e.g. "public_html".

Resolution
==========

All lighttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.19-r2"
