Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080403-drf.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following Cisco products are known to be vulnerable:

  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) 5.x and 6.x
  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager Business Edition
  * Cisco Unified Precense 1.x and 6.x
  * Cisco Emergency Responder 2.x
  * Cisco Mobility Manager 2.x

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 3.x and 4.x are not
vulnerable. No other Cisco products are currently known to be
affected by these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Disaster Recovery Framework (DRF) is a feature shared among
several products in the Cisco Unified Communications family of
products. DRF allows administrators to backup and restore a system
configuration to a local tape drive or remote server.

The DRF Master server is responsible for performing backup and
restoration requests. This vulnerability documents an issue where the
DRF Master server does not perform authentication on requests that it
receives over the network. A remote, unauthenticated user can connect
to the DRF Master server and may be able to perform any DRF-related
tasks. These tasks include:

  * Modifying or deleting a scheduled backup
  * Copying a system backup to a remote, user-specified server
  * Restoring a user-specified configuration from a remote server
  * Execute arbitrary operating system commands

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of
service condition, obtain sensitive configuration information,
overwrite configuration parameters, or execute arbitrary commands
with full administrative privileges.

This vulnerability is documented in CVE-2008-1154 and the following
Cisco Bug IDs:

  * CSCso53771 - Cisco Unified Communications Manager 5.x and 6.x

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote,
unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service condition,
obtain sensitive configuration information, overwrite configuration
parameters or execute arbitrary commands with full administrative
privileges.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Fixed software is available for the following Cisco products. This
advisory will be updated as additional fixes are available.

A patch has been provided that can be applied to CUCM 5.x and 6.x,
CUCMBE, Cisco Unified Presence 1.x and 6.x, Cisco Emergency Responder
2.x, and Cisco Mobility Manager 2.x. The filename is
ciscocm.CSCso53771.security.patch.cop and can be downloaded at the
following link:

http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/callmgr-utilpage?psrtdcat20e2

Please consult the COP file Readme for installation instructions.

Workarounds
===========

Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling the DRF
Master service. However, administrators should exercise caution when
disabling the DRF Master service, as system backups will not occur
while the service is stopped. Administrators are encouraged to
perform a complete system backup before employing this workaround and
use care when making configuration changes until the DRF Master
service can be safely re-enabled.

Instructions for disabling the DRF Master service on Cisco Unified
Communications Manager systems are available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/service/5_0_1/ccmsrva/sasrvact.html#wp1048220

The vulnerability may be mitigated by restricting access to the DRF
Master service (TCP port 4040). For a Cisco Unified Communications
Manager cluster, access to the port should be restricted to valid
cluster nodes.

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20080403-drf.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.
