Synopsis
========

Use of insufficient randomness in PowerDNS Recursor might lead to DNS
cache poisoning.

Background
==========

The PowerDNS Recursor is an advanced recursing nameserver.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/pdns-recursor       < 3.1.5                      >= 3.1.5

Description
===========

Amit Klein of Trusteer reported that insufficient randomness is used to
calculate the TRXID values and the UDP source port numbers.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send malicious answers to insert arbitrary DNS
data into the cache. These attacks would in turn help an attacker to
perform man-in-the-middle and site impersonation attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PowerDNS Recursor users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/pdns-recursor-3.1.5"

==========
