Subject: ANNOUNCE: RFIDIOt-0.1s release (now available for Windows)

Folks,

I'm pleased to announce an update to RFIDIOt, the open source RFID 
exploration python library and toolkit...

Not much has changed, but the big news with this release is that by 
popular demand, there is now a separate Windows distribution (thanks to 
Zac Franken for pointers/testing). The code is identical, but this 
includes specific instructions and dependencies to help you get up and 
running under windows.

 From CHANGES:

   v0.s
   fix -L issue in RFIDIOtconfig (readernum must be 0)
   add human readable dump to readmifaresimple.py (ReadablePrint() in 
RFIDIOt)
   fix logic in tag selection in unique.py (would not use hitag2)
   add hitag2 login (password mode) to RFIDIOt.py
   add hitag2bruteforce program hitag2brute.py
   start migrating definitions into smaller files to aid sharing with 
other apps (e.g. iso3166.py)
   add Windows distribution [Zac Franken]

cheers,
Adam
