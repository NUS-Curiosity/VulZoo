Subject: Re: Hamachi Password Disclosure Vulnerability

This is a bogus vulnerability. 

Ability to dump the process memory for a random system account implies that the system is fully compromised.

Besides Hamachi 1.x does not use password-based login authentication as it's clearly stated in a product description.
