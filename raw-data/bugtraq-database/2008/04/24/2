Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in SILC Client, Server, and
Toolkit, allowing for Denial of Service and execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing protocol) Toolkit is a software
development kit for use in clients, SILC Server is a communication
server, and SILC Client is an IRSSI-based text client.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/silc-toolkit       < 1.1.7                        >= 1.1.7
  2  net-im/silc-client        < 1.1.4                        >= 1.1.4
  3  net-im/silc-server        < 1.1.2                        >= 1.1.2
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     3 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

* Nathan G. Grennan reported a boundary error in SILC Toolkit within
  the silc_fingerprint() function in the file lib/silcutil/silcutil.c
  when passing overly long data, resulting in a stack-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2008-1227).

* A vulnerability has been reported in SILC Server which is caused
  due to an error in the handling of "NEW_CLIENT" packets that do not
  contain a nickname (CVE-2008-1429).

* Ariel Waissbein, Pedro Varangot, Martin Mizrahi, Oren Isacson,
  Carlos Garcia, and Ivan Arce of Core Security Technologies reported
  that SILC Client, Server, and Toolkit contain a vulnerability in the
  silc_pkcs1_decode() function in the silccrypt library (silcpkcs1.c),
  resulting in an integer underflow, signedness error, and a buffer
  overflow (CVE-2008-1552).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SILC Toolkit users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/silc-toolkit-1.1.7"

All SILC Client users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/silc-client-1.1.4"

All SILC Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/silc-server-1.1.2"
