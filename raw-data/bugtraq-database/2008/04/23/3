Subject: LayerOne 2008 - Final Pre-Con Update

We're less than a month out from the event and we're starting to make
final preparations for the con.

Speakers and Scheduling:
We are currently beginning to schedule the talks for this years event.
The speaker line-up is full and we have some pretty amazing talks
lined up. Check out our speaker page for all of the details.

Hotel Discount:
UPDATE: We have filled our hotel block. The Hilton has rooms still,
and tell them you are with LayerOne when you book (this will help us
get more rooms next year), but the room deal is sadly over.

Contests:
Check out our contests page for details, but we are bringing some old
favorites and some new ones to the event this year. Deviant Ollam is
bringing us the Lockpicking Village thats been such a hit at Defcon
and Shmoocon in the past, as well as his newly devised Gringo Warrior
contest that pits your lockpicking skills in a 'real life' situation.
Nkryptr and Nous are also joining us with the Phreaking Challenge.
Come try out your phone phreaking skills and see how you measure up

Sponsors/Vendors:
Huge thanks to ASG, Microsoft, and William Knowles from ISN for
sponsoring us this year. Our vendor room will also feature t-shirts
from Ghetto Geeks, tunes from Miss DJ Jackalope and possibly a few
others.

Registration:
Pre-Registration is still open, and still just 80 dollars. We will be
closing registration on May 9th. Tickets will still be available at
the event but the cost will be 100 dollars.

We want to thank you again for all of your support!
