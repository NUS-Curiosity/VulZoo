4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities Symantec Mail
Security, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
vulnerable system when scanning Applix documents.

1) An unsafe call to "sscanf()" when parsing the "ENCODING" attribute
of the "*BEGIN" tag can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer
overflow.

2) A boundary error when parsing overly long tokens from the input
file can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 
3) A boundary error when parsing the initial "*BEGIN" tag can be
exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflow.
  
Successful exploitation of the above vulnerabilities allows execution
of arbitrary code.
 
4) A logic error when parsing long tokens can result in an infinite
loop.  Exploitation will result in maximum CPU usage until an
application-configured timeout expires. In some cases memory usage
will increase until the OS terminates the process.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

For Symantec Mail Security for SMTP, update to version 5.0.1 patch
189, which resolves the vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities will be addressed in upcoming patches for Symantec
Mail Security for Exchange and Symantec Mail Security for Domino.
