  Bug
  ===
 There is an Authentication Bypass weakness on Wayport's Public Access
 PCs. To exploit the weakness, one needs to open an Internet Explorer
 Window through the 'help' function that is available before the card
 gets swiped and do the following:
 Help --> Tools --> Manage Add-ons --> Disable Blocker Class
 This add-on controls the entire charging element of the Solution.

 An attacker who successfully exploits this misconfiguration could,
 besides browsing the web for free, use a public access PC as a
 launching pad.

 Wayport know about it since the 14th of February. The following reply
 was received by them on the 15th of February:

 "Dear Pascal,

 Thank you very much for your timely advisory and your high moral
 values. We have verified your findings and made a fix that will get
 deployed worldwide ASAP (within a week or so)."
