Reference                 Base Vector                      Base Score 
CVE-2008-0708  (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P)     1.7

Information on CVSS is documented in HP Customer Notice: HPSN-2008-002.

Virus Information: W32.Fakerecy and W32.SillyFDC 
Discovered: January/February 2007 
Type: Worm 
Threat Level: Low 
Systems Affected: Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows XP, Windows Me, Windows NT, Windows 2000 
Virus detail: W32.Fakerecy and W32.SillyFDC are worms that spread by copying themselves to removable and/or mapped drives. 

RESOLUTION
HP is providing the following procedure to resolve this vulnerability:

1. HP recommends that the optional HP USB Floppy Drive Key be checked for the potential virus infections and cleaned. To detect and clean this virus infection the HP USB Floppy Drive Key can be plugged into a USB 2.0 port on a system with current (up-to-date) anti-virus software and scanned.

2. If the optional HP USB Floppy Drive Key has been used in an environment without current (up-to-date) anti-virus software then the W32.Fakerecy or W32.SillyFDC virus may have spread to any mapped drives on the server. In this case HP recommends that the server and mapped drives are scanned with current (up-to-date) anti-virus software.
 
This virus infection would have been immediately detected and cleaned if the optional HP USB Floppy Drive Key had been used in an environment with any current (up-to-date) anti-virus software 

Note: These are standard USB 2.0 Floppy Drive Keys (similar to 'Flash Drives') that can be plugged into a USB 2.0 port on any system.
