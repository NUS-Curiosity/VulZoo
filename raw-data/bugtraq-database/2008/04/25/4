Subject: R.I.P. rgod

The Italian hacker, PHP master, formally named "rgod" died two days ago at that hospital in Catania. It was a surprise and a shockï¿½to all of us who knew him. rgod was suffering of a rare bony marrow
disease, leading to paralysis during his last days, despite is strong resistance to the illness.
If there are any announcements about memorials, tributes, etc., I will attempt to post them
A short note on http://retrogod.altervista.org/, which we will try to keep updated
