Subject: RE: Internet explorer 7.0 spoofing

Ok, I'm missing it, what exactly is the spoof here?  When the popup comes up
for me, the address of the page is
http://www.google.com.ar/#www.microsoft.com and I see in the address bar
#www.microsoft.com.  

If I'm understanding the wording below correctly, it's because the # keeps
the browser from interpreting Microsoft.com and thus giving a bad URL, and
presumably, the browser cannot or does not have the ability to show the full
address (and perhaps in other browsers or scenarios people don't see the #
like I did - and also don't realize that the browser always prefixes it's
URLs with HTTP, so seeing a URL starting with # is a bit fishy)...

Subject: Internet explorer 7.0 spoofing

Hello, as they are? This time I communicate with you to let you know of a
vulnerability such as "spoofing" in the Internet Explorer 7.0 (tested at 8.0
and does not work). 

Creating a pop-up malformated can put any address in the address bar in the
body any page or content. 


This flaw is possible because if in the address bar we eg 


Address # direction 


The numeral makes the first address is run and what comes after the numeral
does not interfere with the original page. This is why creating popup with
the special measures and to try to pass such an easterly direction popup
displayed the end of the address and did not show the direction it runs.
(Special measures are important because if it does not work largest). 


Just a single click in the body popup to this reveals the true direction,
which can be equal to dodge an event like javascript onblur or onfocus ..
Anyway that's more serious an attack that a proof of concept. 


Here I leave the proof of concept.
