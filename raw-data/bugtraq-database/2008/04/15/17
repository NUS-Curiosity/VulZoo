12 mails for the same library?

>From what I have understood all the bugs are just in this Autonomy
Keyview library so in my opinion reporting the same identical bugs in
each software which uses this thirdy part component and additionally
without saying that the problem in reality is in the library is wrong
and leads to a lot of confusion.

It's just like if someone finds a bug in zlib and releases 10000
advisories, one for each program in the world which uses the library...
the bug is not in these 10000 programs but only in zlib.
