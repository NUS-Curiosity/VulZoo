Hi Michael,

The file sizes and MD5 sums listed on the libpng site may be wrong. HEAnet are hosting the exact same file that is on both the SURFnet SourceForge mirror and the ftp.simplesystems.org site (804821 bytes, md5 d2f0339117eb190ce3db98c139198c88).

If you have any problems with our mirror service, please contact mirrors@...net.ie as this will ensure a more timely response.
