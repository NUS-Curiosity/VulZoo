Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.08.08: Microsoft Windows Graphics Rendering
 Engine Integer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.08.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 08, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Windows graphics device interface (GDI) is the core library
used to display graphics and text on the Windows operating system. It
is the standard interface through which applications access the
graphics rendering engine. For more information, see the vendor's site
found at the following link.

http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536795(VS.85).aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in multiple
versions of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system could allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current
user.

The vulnerability occurs when parsing a header structure that describes
a bitmap contained in the file. Several values from this header are
used in an arithmetic operation that calculates the number of bytes to
allocate for a heap buffer. This calculation can overflow, which
results in an undersized heap buffer being allocated. This buffer is
then overflowed with data from the file.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the current user. Exploitation would require convincing a
targeted user to visit a malicious URL through some form of social
engineering.

This vulnerability can also be triggered through e-mail. If the e-mail
client automatically displays images embedded in the e-mail, the user
only needs to open the e-mail to trigger the vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the
following Microsoft products:

Windows 2000 SP4
Windows XP SP2

Windows Server 2003 SP1, SP2, Vista, and Vista SP1 are not affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Turn off metafile processing by modifying the registry.

Under registry key

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\GRE_Initialize

create a DWORD entry "DisableMetaFiles" and set it to 1.

Note 1: This doesn't affect processes that are already running, so you
might need to log off and log in again or restart the computer after
making the change.

Note 2: This workaround only blocks the metafile attack vector. Since
the vulnerable code is in gdi32.dll, it can possibly be reached through
other attack vectors.

Impact of Workaround: components relying on metafile processing might
not work properly, such as printing.

Viewing email in plain text format will mitigate email based attacks.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Microsoft has officially addressed this vulnerability with Security
Bulletin MS08-021. For more information, consult their bulletin at the
