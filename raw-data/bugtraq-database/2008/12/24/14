Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in VLC may lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/vlc      < 0.9.8a                           >= 0.9.8a

Description
===========

Tobias Klein reported the following vulnerabilities:

* A stack-based buffer overflow when processing CUE image files in
  modules/access/vcd/cdrom.c (CVE-2008-5032).

* A stack-based buffer overflow when processing RealText (.rt)
  subtitle files in the ParseRealText() function in
  modules/demux/subtitle.c (CVE-2008-5036).

* An integer overflow when processing RealMedia (.rm) files in the
  ReadRealIndex() function in real.c in the Real demuxer plugin,
  leading to a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-5276).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted CUE
image file, RealMedia file or RealText subtitle file, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.9.8a"
