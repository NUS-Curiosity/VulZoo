Synopsis
========

Smart cards formatted using OpenSC do not sufficiently protect the PIN,
allowing attackers to reset it.

Background
==========

OpenSC is a smart card application that allows reading and writing via
PKCS#11.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/opensc      < 0.11.6                           >= 0.11.6

Description
===========

Chaskiel M Grundman reported that OpenSC uses weak permissions (ADMIN
file control information of 00) for the 5015 directory on smart cards
and USB crypto tokens running Siemens CardOS M4.

Impact
======

A physically proximate attacker can exploit this vulnerability to
change the PIN on a smart card and use it for authentication, leading
to privilege escalation.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenSC users should upgrade to the latest version, and then check
and update their smart cards:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/opensc-0.11.6"
    # pkcs15-tool --test-update
    # pkcs15-tool --test-update --update

==========
