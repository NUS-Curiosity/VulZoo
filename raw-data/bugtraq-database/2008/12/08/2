the things that must be considered that the POC it's variant  from exploit to exploit(some times
Kaspersky and the other famous AV Sofware can be  deceive).
Proof Of Concept:
as i said the exploit are based on the magic of magic byte methode we will first add the MZ Header to the HTML Exploit and  change the exstention to txt or jpg or non extension,the exploit is compatible with IE6 and IE7 because IE6&7  execute the HTML Event if it's in txt file or non extension files.
so the exploit it's with corporate of IE6&7 :).
virustotal result of MS Internet Explorer (VML) Remote Buffer Overflow Exploit (XP SP2).

and this is a Variant one "obfuscated by this methode".
http://www.virustotal.com/fr/analisis/7db1bd321a1f945b4abfa73844c36d99
POC:
1-add the MZ Header to the HTML file:
MZ&#1711;       &#1746;&#1746;  �       @                                   &#1591;   &#1563; �    &#1581;!�L&#1581;!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.
you can put other EXE info on the HTML Body for more deception "showing in the second result".
-rename the HTML to non extension file or txt or jpg.
3-upload it to webserver.
    http://localhost/mallpage.txt or http://localhost/mallpage<non extenstion>.
