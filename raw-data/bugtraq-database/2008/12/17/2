Subject: Re: [IVIZ-08-016] F-Secure f-prot Antivirus for Linux corrupted
 ELF header Security Bypass

Version 4.6.8 is an old, obsolete version of F-PROT that is no longer supported by the developers.

We no longer release regular virus definition updates for this version, and as far as we know, we have no paying customers of F-PROT 4.6.8 for Linux.

The security issue is not present in the current version.
