Subject: reliable IOS exploitation

FX has given a comprehensive talk about IOS exploitation (including even TCL 
scripts operators leave behind when they moved jobs to retain access).

He has shown effective and ineffective ways of detecting compromise in IOS.

Then, he has shown how reliable exploitation of IOS routers works.

His talk will probably be downloadable from the CCC (25C3) web site by 
tomorrow.
