Synopsis
========

Multiple memory management errors in JasPer might lead to execution of
arbitrary code via jpeg2k files.

Background
==========

The JasPer Project is an open-source initiative to provide a free
software-based reference implementation of the codec specified in the
JPEG-2000 Part-1 (jpeg2k) standard.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /   Vulnerable   /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/jasper     < 1.900.1-r3                  >= 1.900.1-r3

Description
===========

Marc Espie and Christian Weisgerber have discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in JasPer:

* Multiple integer overflows might allow for insufficient memory
  allocation, leading to heap-based buffer overflows (CVE-2008-3520).

* The jas_stream_printf() function in libjasper/base/jas_stream.c
  uses vsprintf() to write user-provided data to a static to a buffer,
  leading to an overflow (CVE-2008-3522).

Impact
======

Remote attackers could entice a user or automated system to process
specially crafted jpeg2k files with an application using JasPer,
possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All JasPer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/jasper-1.900.1-r3"
