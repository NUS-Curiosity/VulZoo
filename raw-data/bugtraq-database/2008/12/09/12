3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Microsoft
Hierarchical FlexGrid Control bundled with various products, which can
be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerabilities are caused due to integer overflow errors in the 
ActiveX control (mshflxgd.ocx) when handling the "Rows" and "Cols" 
properties and the "ExpandAll()" and "CollapseAll()" methods. These
can be exploited to corrupt memory.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
