Something that seems to be being missed is that it doesn't matter HOW the 
problem was found, NO domain usage (be it application or OS ) should be able 
to impact the uptime of the other partitions.

The point of the partitioning is that you can isolate semi-trusted usage so 
it won't cause downtime for other semi-trusted users.  The fact it
(a) marks the hardware as unusable
(b) doesn't let the system admin override/correct that
(c) requires _all_ hardware to be power cycled, not just the effected parts
is the problem.  If (b) or (c) were fixed, I think the issue wouldn't be.
