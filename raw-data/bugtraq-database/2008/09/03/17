Wrong.

cobalt@...ome:~ $ host www.planetcobalt.net
www.planetcobalt.net    CNAME   chrome.planetcobalt.net
chrome.planetcobalt.net CNAME   planetcobalt.net
planetcobalt.net        A       217.10.9.49
cobalt@...ome:~ $ host 49.9.10.217.in-addr.arpa
49.9.10.217.in-addr.arpa        PTR     mail.planetcobalt.net
cobalt@...ome:~ $ host mail.planetcobalt.net
mail.planetcobalt.net   A       217.10.9.49
