Subject: Advisory : Google Chrome Carriage Return Null Object Memory Exhaustion
 Remote Dos.


*Google Chrome Carriage Return Null Object Memory Exhaustion Remote Dos.*

*Version Affected:*
Chrome/0.2.149.30
Chrome/0.2.149.29

*Severity:*
High

*Description:*
The Google chrome browser is vulnerable to memory exhaustion based 
denial of
service which can be triggered remotely.The vulnerability triggers when 
Carriage
Return(\r\n\r\n) is passed as an argument to window.open() function. It 
makes the
Google Chrome to generate number of windows at the same time thereby 
leading
to memory exhaustion. The behavior can be easily checked by looking at 
the task
manager as with no time the memory usage rises high. The problem lies in 
the handling
of object and its value returned by the javascript function. Once it is 
triggered the pop
ups are started generating. The Google Chrome browser generate object 
windows continuously
there by affecting memory of the resultant system. Probably it can be 
crashed within no time.
User interaction is required in this.
