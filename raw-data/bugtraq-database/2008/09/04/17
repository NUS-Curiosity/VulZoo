Synopsis
========

RealPlayer is vulnerable to a buffer overflow allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

RealPlayer is a multimedia player capable of handling multiple
multimedia file formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /     Vulnerable     /         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/realplayer     < 11.0.0.4028-r1     >= 11.0.0.4028-r1

Description
===========

Dyon Balding of Secunia Research reported an unspecified heap-based
buffer overflow in the Shockwave Flash (SWF) frame handling.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted SWF (Shockwave Flash)
file, a remote attacker could be able to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All RealPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # 
emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/realplayer-11.0.0.4028-r1"
