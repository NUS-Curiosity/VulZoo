It was pointed out to me in private that, of course, you can have
multiple PTR records mapping one address to different names. My bad.

However, since oftentimes (colocation scenarios for instance) forward
and reverse zone have different maintainers, it's some hassle to keep
the reverse zone in sync with the forward zone. Thus I have my doubts
that proper reverse mappings for every name will become common practice
anytime soon.

Anyway, I apologize again for the misinformation in my previous mail.
