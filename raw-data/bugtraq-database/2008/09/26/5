Subject: Estonian Cyber Security Strategy document -- now available online

The Estonian cyber security strategy document is now available online.

quite interesting.

Those who wish to download the document::

My contact there specified she'd be happy to answer any questions. To 
avoid spam of her inbox, email me for her address.
