Okay, let's pretend you somehow prevent a local Administrator from 
reading the password out of memory... I'm already running code, so I 
install a key logger, and then crash/exit the process so you have to log 
in again.  Once the attacker can run code on your system, it's game 
over.  All you do by storing the password encoded is to make the 
attacker read the source to see how to decode it, and then write a k-rad 
31337 script to automate it.
