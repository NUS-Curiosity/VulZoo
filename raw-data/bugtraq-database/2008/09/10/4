I agree with Theo. This is a privilege-escalation DOS attack, pure and
simple. A user with sufficient privilege in one domain, but not
necessarily in others, can 1) force that domain down for an extended
time, and/or 2) force all domains down.

"Privilege" isn't an absolute; there are degrees of privilege, and this
bug lets a user do more damage than their degree of privilege should
allow.
