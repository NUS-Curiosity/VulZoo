Interesting reasearch.

It looks like Oracle DBMS may be vulnerable to the "Unicode Smuggling" 
attack exploiting homoglyphic translation. As outlined by David Litchfield 
in an old full-disclosure post [1]:

"It didn't take long to discover that this patch could be bypassed using 
the following techinque: due to internationalization, an Oracle database 
server will convert the ? character (value 0xFF) to a capital Y. The PLSQL 
Gateway will not. Thus, if we request:

http://www.example.com/pls/dad/S%FFS.PACKAGE.PROCEDURE

the gateway will happily pass it over to the database server where the ? 
is conveted to a Y and we can gain access again".

Cheers,
