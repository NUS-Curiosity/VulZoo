Description:
    Previous versions of the mercurial package do not properly honor
    "allowpull" permissions when serving a repository using hgweb.
    
    Additionally, the git converter in mercurial has been updated to 
    work with recent git releases.
    
    Note that hgweb is not enabled by default on rPath Linux systems.
