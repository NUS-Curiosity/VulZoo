Subject: Pidgin IM Client Password Disclosure Vulnerability.

Pidgin IM Client Password Disclosure Vulnerability.

*Version Affected:*
0.7.10 Unicode / Previous version can be affected.

*Release Date:*
11 September 2008

*About:*
Pidgin is a graphical modular messaging client based on libpurple which 
is capable
of connecting to AIM, MSN, Yahoo!, XMPP, ICQ, IRC, SILC, SIP/SIMPLE, 
Novell GroupWise,
Lotus Sametime, Bonjour, Zephyr, MySpaceIM, Gadu-Gadu, and QQ all at 
once. It is written using GTK+.

*Description:*
The pidgin client inherits client side password disclosure 
vulnerability. The credentials used to
connect to the required service i.e. username and password is not 
encrypted properly. The credentials
can be extracted in clear text by dumping process memory of the live 
pidgin process when a connection
is set. The vulnerability allows anyone with access to the client system 
to obtain the username and password.
Additionally, this vulnerability could also be exploited by fooling the 
user to execute malicious code which
would dump the memory of the process "pidgin.exe"..
