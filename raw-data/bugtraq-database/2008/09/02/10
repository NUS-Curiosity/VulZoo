Subject: [Suspected Spam]New IETF I-D-: Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol
  version 4

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Hello, folks,

We have published an IETF Internet-Draft entitled "Security Assessment of
the Internet Protocol version 4", which is heavily based on the "Security
Assessment of the Internet Protocol" that was recently released by the UK
CPNI (http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Products/technicalnotes/3677.aspx). The IETF
I-D is available at: http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/ip-security/index.html
(and is also available at the IETF internet-drafts repository)

Our IETF I-D is an effort to take the results of the IP security assessment
to the IETF, so that all the identified issues get documented in an
official IETF document, and hopefully the IETF standards are modified as
necessary.

Any feedback on the IETF I-D and/or the original UK CPNI document will be
more than welcome.

Thanks!

Kind regards,
Fernando Gont
