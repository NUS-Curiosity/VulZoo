Yes, obviously, otherwise you could run on hardware which has been
detected as faulty.

If my theory is correct, it would have been possible to avoid the
power-off by replacing the hardware in that domain.  You should be able
to clear the fault information in the affected FRUs off-line (which
probably requires some magic numbers, too), and mount them in a
different enclosure.

Hey, after all, you are tampering business records related to your
support contract. 8-/
