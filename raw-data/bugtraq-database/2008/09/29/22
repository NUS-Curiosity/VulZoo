Right.  Glad that is clear.

Yes, we all agree that is bad but this is an OpenBSD specific problem
and, whilst interesting, the reality is that there are no going to be
many people that are lunatic enough to run an untrusted third party
operating system on a machine of this class.

Yes, no arguing with that.

I suggest you go read the archives again then - I was not the only one.

I can handle being wrong.  Can you?  As I said before, if you know of
a problem with solaris zones then that makes things a lot more of a
problem but all you have at the moment is a firmware bug which
requires loading a random kernel module - something that can be
controlled in Solaris.
