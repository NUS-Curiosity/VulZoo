 Service(Freeze) exploit

I can confirm that the PoC indeed freezes Chrome 0.2.149.29 (looks like inf loop, not responding to anything, the whole browser, not a renderer only) on Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate SP1.

I can also confirm that the PoC DOES NOT freeze Chrome on Microsoft Windows XP Pro SP2.

Is it system dependent ?
