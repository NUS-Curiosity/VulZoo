 for Script Injection Attacks

Hi kuza55,

Are you trying the payload that includes the tilde or the one without?

The one with the tilde (~) only works if the payload returns after an
opening angle bracket (<).

Please see: http://www.procheckup.com/Vulnerability_PR08-20.php

And yes, it also works on IE7. Just tried it on a live environment last
week.
