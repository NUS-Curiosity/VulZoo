 Install Data HTTP Vulnerability

Managed Workplace 6.0 Service Pack 3 fully resolves this exposure and was released at the end of March 2008 and made generally available to all Level Platforms users on May 5, 2008.

No exploits of this exposure occurred prior to the release of this service pack.  

In fact there are no attributed exploits of any kind for any version of Managed Workplace.
