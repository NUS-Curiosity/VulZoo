Actually, this is not the proof that the vulnerability is not connected with format, because program could read the file and judge that if this program has M3U format or RML or something else. But if we try following code we are sure:

#!/usr/bin/python
content = (
"A" * 5000 + "\n"
)

fd = open("music","w");
fd.write(content)
fd.close();
print "FILE CREATED"
