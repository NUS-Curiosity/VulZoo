 Line Switch Injection

iDefense Security Advisory 03.11.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 11, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Outlook provides an integrated solution for managing and
organizing e-mail messages, schedules, tasks, notes, contacts, and
other information. More information is available at the following URL.

http://office.microsoft.com/outlook/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an input validation error in the handling of
"mailto" URIs by Microsoft Corp.'s Outlook may allow arbitrary code
execution.

It is possible to construct a "mailto" URI which causes the web browser
to pass extra command line switches to Outlook. These switches can
modify Outlook's account configuration.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to access
sensitive information or take complete control of an affected system.
In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to
convince a user to view an attacker-controlled website.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Microsoft
Outlook 2007 on Windows XP SP2. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling the "mailto" URI handler will prevent exploitation of this
vulnerability. However, doing so will also disable e-mail links within
all applications.
