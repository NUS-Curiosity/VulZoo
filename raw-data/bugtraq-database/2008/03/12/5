Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 03.11.08: Microsoft Excel 2003 Malformed
 Formula Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.11.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 11, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Excel is the spreadsheet application that is included with
Microsoft Corp's Office productivity software suite. More information
is available at the following website.

http://office.microsoft.com/excel/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Excel 2003 could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the currently logged on user.

This vulnerability specifically exists due to the improper handling of
malformed formulas. By creating a document containing a specially
crafted formula, an attacker is able to cause memory corruption that
leads to arbitrary code execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context
of the currently logged on user. In order to exploit this vulnerability,
the attacker must persuade a user to open a specially crafted Excel
(XLS) document. Likely attack vectors include sending the file as an
e-mail attachment or linking to the file on a website.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Excel 2003
SP2. Other versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling support for legacy binary file formats in the registry will
prevent exploitation of this issue. However, this workaround is not
available for all versions of Microsoft Excel.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Microsoft has officially addressed this vulnerability with Security
