I most probably understated the difficulty of implementing a safe
ieee1394 DMA driver earlier.  However, it's one of those things where
the drivers ought to at least default to a safe configuration and allow
those who like operating in the "wild west" for the purposes of speed to
do so.

In the specific case of FireWire, Windows already does this, but that is
exactly how the restrictions were bypassed.  You can't trust a disk
device any more than any other device, since a laptop can simply emulate
a storage device.
