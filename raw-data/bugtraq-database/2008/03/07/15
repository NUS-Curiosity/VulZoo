There is a quite viable technical solution in the form of a patch which
solves most of these problems. Also, I heavily disagree that physical
security is of no importance. Nowadays, there are ways to achieve quite
good physical security using disk encryption and mechanisms which lock
the encrypted parts of the disk on demand (e.g. when closing the lid of
a notebook). Now, all of these mechanisms can be circumvented by
plugging an evil device which looks like an iPod, smells like an iPod
but fetches your keys from memory.
