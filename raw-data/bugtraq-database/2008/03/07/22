>>Let's say the computer is off. You can turn it on, but that gets you
to a login screen. What can the Firewire device do? 

OK, I guess I misunderstood the original paper
(http://www.sec-consult.com/fileadmin/Whitepapers/Vista_Physical_Attacks
.pdf). It now looks to me like they are claiming they can disable
password authentication *even while the system is not logged on* - do I
have that right?
