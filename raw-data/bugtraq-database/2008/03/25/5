A security "problem" that is only a problem if security =elsewhere= has 
been breached... is not a problem in and of itself. The breach of your LAN 
is the problem.

If the device can only be attacked locally then it's really a non-issue. 
This is why securing your LAN is of paramount importance - because once 
they cross your DMZ there is no end to the number of ways you're screwed.
