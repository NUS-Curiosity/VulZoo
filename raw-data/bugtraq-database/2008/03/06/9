Roger, you should note that Adam's "Hit by a Bus" paper includes information
about how Linux users can load their OS' Firewire driver in a way that should
disallow physical memory DMA access, and close this attack vector. I have not
yet seen anyone explain how to do the same in Windows. If there is no such
option in Windows (as the Panholzer paper claims), then Microsoft deserves 
the negative attention.

As for "broader solutions", Microsoft is in an excellent position to help
improve the situation -- maybe you could shed some light on their efforts?
