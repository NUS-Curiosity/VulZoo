That's very easy: because the specific attack was against Windows
Vista's activation mechanism.

The deficiencies of Firewire with regard to direct memory access have
been known for quite a while now. The purpose of the referenced attack
was specific to Windows Vista. It is of course also possible though to
steal GnuPG keys from the memory of a Solaris machine, of course,
that's in the nature of the beast, but this is not relevant to the
specific attack mentioned here.

May I also add that I am actually aware of patches from vendors which
can render this attack ineffective for most other OSes (Solaris, Linux,
etc.) - as far as I know, though, there is no such patch for Windows?
That might also be a reason why this attack was created and published
in the first place - like I said, the attack vector has been known for
ages now.
