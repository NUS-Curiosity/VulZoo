Hi Alexandr!

I added a "monkey-patch" for this in the Metasploit source tree -- even if 
you use Metasploit 3.1 with an unpatched version of Ruby, the patched 
handler code is loaded into memory on top of the existing module. Since 
the msfweb service will bind to 127.0.0.1 by default, this is not a major 
risk, but it seemed prudent to patch it anyways. 

The patch was pushed to the Metasploit SVN trees, which are used by the 
Online Update functionality in the Windows version. Mac OS X users will 
need to change into the Metasploit directory and 'svn update'.

Thanks!
