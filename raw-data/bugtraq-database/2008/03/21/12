I'm a bit behind in reading bugtraq but thought I'd throw this in:  We  
had a similar situation sometime back with Maia Mailguard, and the  
null byte thing depends on the platform.  It was reported on a BSD  
system I think, but our Linux systems would not reproduce it.

In any case, the data should be sanitized. :)
