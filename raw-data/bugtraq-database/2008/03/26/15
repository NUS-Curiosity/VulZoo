Yeah, I had no idea what this meant either. Same goes for Mitsubishi's 
UK tech support...

Indeed.

Yep. I think the manual should really say "this device should be 
connected directly to the ethernet socket of a computer, and that 
computer should have locked down software to prevent unauthorised people 
bypassing the security on the GB-50A".

I find it slightly scary that someone might have one of these on a 
network that controls something like data centre aircon, and that an 
attacker can scan for it trivially (what answers on port 80 with a 200 
to a GET for /en/administrator.html) and turn off all the aircon in the 
data centre...

cheers,

Chris
