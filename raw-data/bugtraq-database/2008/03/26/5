Based on an online copy of the GB-50A manual that I found, there are
dip switches that can be used to set IP address ranges between
192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.15 (page 14).

However, if all dip switches are off, the unit can defer to
configuration as provided via an "Initial Setting Web".  This tool can
be used to set the IP address (page 13).  There is no statement that
the tool restricts which address can be set, nor is there a
recommendation that only local addresses should be used.

It doesn't seem like much of a stretch that an admin might want to
modify the address to something other than private addresses.  Whether
the Initial Setting Web will allow this is another question, but if
so, then the scope of attack widens considerably.
