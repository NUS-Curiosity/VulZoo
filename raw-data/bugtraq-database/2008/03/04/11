Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Opera, allowing for
file disclosure, privilege escalation and Cross-Site scripting.

Background
==========

Opera is a fast web browser that is available free of charge.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/opera       < 9.26                             >= 9.26

Description
===========

Mozilla discovered that Opera does not handle input to file form fields
properly, allowing scripts to manipulate the file path (CVE-2008-1080).
Max Leonov found out that image comments might be treated as scripts,
and run within the wrong security context (CVE-2008-1081). Arnaud
reported that a wrong representation of DOM attribute values of
imported XML documents allows them to bypass sanitization filters
(CVE-2008-1082).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to upload a file with a known
path by entering text into a specially crafted form, to execute scripts
outside intended security boundaries and conduct Cross-Site Scripting
attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.26"
