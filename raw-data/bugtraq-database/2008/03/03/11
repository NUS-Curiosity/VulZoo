Subject: CSRF in joomla 1.0.11 stable version

Joomla(CMS) framework version 1.0.11 stable is susceptible to a CSRF attack which can compromise the super admin account and the whole application.
The CSRF attack can be performed on the framework to 
change the super admin account password because the change password functionality does not asks for the current password.

Other than this flaw there are multiple places where XSS have been identified.
