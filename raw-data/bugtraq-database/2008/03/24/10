Subject: Re: XSS in cPanel 11.x

Hello, 
Is this internal or external thus do you need to be logged in? I tested external/internal and nothing it appears to just dump it out as a missing directory or manpage.

"Could not open /usr/man/man3/%3Cscript%3Ealert(LeZr)%3C/script%3E.3"

Also I believe you meant to place x3 instead of x after frontend? if not it still just says manpage not found. 

I tested this out on 11.18.3-STABLE build 21703.

Regards
Joshua
