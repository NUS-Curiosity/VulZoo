PR08-02: Plone CMS Security Research: the Art of Plowning

Product description:

Plone is a ready-to-run content management system built on the powerful,
and free, Zope application server. Plone is easy to set up, extremely
flexible, and provides you with a system for managing web content that
is ideal for project groups, communities, web sites, extranets and
intranets.

Plone is designed with security in mind by addressing the 10 most common
security vulnerabilities in web applications (OWASP Top 10).

Summary of issues identified:

- - CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgeries)
- - Credentials (username and password) stored in cookies
- - Lack of authentication state on the server side
- - Session cookies never, ever change (even after user password is
changed or user logs out!)
