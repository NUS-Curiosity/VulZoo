If DMA is enabled on the firewire interface its possible!

If the BIOS allows to boot from a firewire device then it will setup
the hardware!

If the BIOS does not setup the firewire interface the some driver has
to do it. So: it depends.

You can also read the memory if you shut down but dont power off your
system. Typically drivers leave their devices in working condition.
