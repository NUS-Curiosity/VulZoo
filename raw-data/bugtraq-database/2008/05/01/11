Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martínez
Fayó of Application Security Inc.

Details:
Oracle Database Server provides the SYS.DBMS_AQJMS_INTERNAL package.
This package contains the procedures AQ$_REGISTER and AQ$_UNREGISTER
which are vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

Impact:

SYS.DBMS_AQJMS_INTERNAL can exploit this vulnerability. By default,
users granted EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE, AQ_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE or
AQ_USER_ROLE have the required privilege. Exploitation of this
vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. It can also
be exploited to cause DoS (Denial of service) killing the Oracle server
process.
