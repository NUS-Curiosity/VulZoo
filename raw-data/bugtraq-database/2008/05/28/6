== Subject:     Boundary failure when parsing SMB responses
==              can result in a buffer overrun
==
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2008-1105
==
== Versions:    Samba 3.0.0 - 3.0.29 (inclusive)
==
== Summary:     Specifically crafted SMB responses can result
==              in a heap overflow in the Samba client code.
==              Because the server process, smbd, can itself
==              act as a client during operations such as
==              printer notification and domain authentication,
==              this issue affects both Samba client and server
==              installations.
