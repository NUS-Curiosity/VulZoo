====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Samba, which can be
exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the 
"receive_smb_raw()" function in lib/util_sock.c when parsing SMB 
packets. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow 
via an overly large SMB packet received in a client context.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code by tricking
a user into connecting to a malicious server (e.g. by clicking an 
"smb://" link) or by sending specially crafted packets to an "nmbd" 
server configured as a local or domain master browser.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to upcoming version 3.0.30 or apply patches.
