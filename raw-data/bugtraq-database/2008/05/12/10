  Google outscatter is one longstanding problem, but this is a
different problem which allows spammers to use Google's MXes as their
outbound mailservice.

  Google's chronic silence on all abuse reports makes it impossible to
tell whether they've taken any action on the problem, whether the
problem reports have even made it to the operational staff responsible
for the mailservers, or whether they simply don't care.

  I'm sure you can all make your own snarky comments re "Do no evil".
