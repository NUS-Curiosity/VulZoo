 Description
_______________

Altiris deployment solution is a suite installed to manage the 
configuration and operation of machines on the network. Part of 
the Deployment solution setup involves configuring the domain 
accounts to be used to access the various clients for imaging 
and configuration jobs.

Altiris deployment solution listens for connections from the 
Altiris client on port 402. It is possible to make a request to 
this port that will result in the encrypted domain credentials 
being returned.  

The encryption is not salted or specific to the install, allowing 
for offsite decryption of the credentials.

_______________

 Details
_______________

The retrieved encrypted credentials can be placed into a local
installation, through direct insertion into the SQL server
database. The GUI can then be used to view the decrypted 
credentials.

Alternatively a standalone tool to decrypt the credentials could 
easily be written.

_______________

 Solution
_______________

Symantec have released a security update to address this issue;
