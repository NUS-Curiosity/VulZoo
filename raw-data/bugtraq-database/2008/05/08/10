Amusing. They pulled the fix from being released in October at the last 
minute, quoting memory leaks. I guess they didn't fully address it after 
all...

Somehow the code to increase the entropy has caused random xid's to cross and spoof randomly, poisioning the cache through normal usage without the use of extracurricular programs. I've reported this to Microsoft and have been working with them in fixing this issue, which to date has not been fixed.

Sounds like they just draw a random number each time, regardless of the 
history (i.e. of previously drawn numbers), which can cause collisions 
(I think that's the phenomenon you describe). BIND 9 has a mechanism 
that ensures that collisions are discarded. OpenBSD retains history of 
the last 32K (IIRC) numbers used, and does not re-use those numbers. 
PowerDNS randomizes UDP source ports, so it considerably reduces 
collision likelihood. I guess MS didn't implement any such mechanism (I 
don't know for sure because I never reviewed their solution - I didn't 
get a preview version from MS).

Thanks,
