== Overview ==
Another day, another file format bug, nothing to see here, move along..

Security-Assessment.com discovered multiple heap based overflow flaws
within
Acrobat Distiller 8 which under certain circumstances can be used to
execute
arbitrary code.
The vulnerability was found within the .joboptions file type.
An auto-opening PDF quality settings file extension used by Acrobat
Distiller.

Font names stored within the parameters /AlwaysEmbed and /NeverEmbed
both
produce a heap based overflow when a large (160+ char) font name is
supplied.

Acrobat 8 professional and any other Adobe suite which contains Acrobat
Distiller
acrodist.exe (Such as CS3) is vulnerable to this issue.
