Call for Papers

The fourth annual EC2ND conference will take place on December 11th & 12th
2008 in the Faculty of Engineering and Computing at Dublin City University.
The theme of the conference is the protection of computer networks. As with
past EC2ND conferences, this year's event will encourage participants from
academia and industry within Europe and beyond to discuss current topics in
applied network and systems security.

EC2ND 2008 invites submissions presenting novel ideas at an early stage
with
the intention to act as a discussion forum and feedback channel for
promising, innovative security research. While our goal is to solicit ideas
that are not completely worked out, and might have challenging and
interesting open questions, we expect submissions to be supported by some
evidence of feasibility or preliminary quantitative results.

Topics include but are not limited to:

Intrusion Detection
Denial-of-Service
Privacy Protection
Security Policies
Peer-to-Peer and Grid Security
Network Monitoring
Web Security
Vulnerability Management and Tracking
Network Forensics
Wireless and Mobile Security
Cryptography
Network Discovery and Mapping
Incident Response and Management
Malicious Software
Web Services Security
Legal and Ethical Issues
