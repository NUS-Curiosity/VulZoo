I do not dispute this.

The point is I found OpenID servers with weak keys.

If you have a better forum, bring it on.

However, CAs do not have everything at their disposal to remove the
threat. Browsers,OpenID libraries and RPs must also participate.

Just as saying "buffer overflows are bad" has not magically caused all
buffer overflows to be fixed, I am confident that the only way to get
this problem fixed is to chase down all the culprits individually. I
am sure that OpenID is not the only thing with problems, as you say.
