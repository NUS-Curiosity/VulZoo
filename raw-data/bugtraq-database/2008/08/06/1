Synopsis
========

xine-lib is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows when processing
media streams.

Background
==========

xine-lib is the core library package for the xine media player, and
other players such as Amarok, Codeine/Dragon Player and Kaffeine.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xine-lib      < 1.1.13                       >= 1.1.13

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xine-lib:

* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia reported an array indexing vulnerability in
  the sdpplin_parse() function in the file input/libreal/sdpplin.c when
  processing streams from RTSP servers that contain a large "streamid"
  SDP parameter (CVE-2008-0073).

* Luigi Auriemma reported multiple integer overflows that result in
  heap-based buffer overflows when processing ".FLV", ".MOV" ".RM",
  ".MVE", ".MKV", and ".CAK" files (CVE-2008-1482).

* Guido Landi reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the
  demux_nsf_send_chunk() function when handling titles within NES Music
  (.NSF) files (CVE-2008-1878).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to play a specially crafted video
file or stream with a player using xine-lib, potentially resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the player.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.13"
