Subject: Re: 8e6 Technologies R3000 Internet Filter Bypass with Host Decoy

I've been testing this and it appears that *any* HTTP 1.0 request will bypass the 8e6 filter (if there is not an IP in the library).
I've been testing this by using scapy to generate the HTTP GET request. 1.0 succeeds and 1.1 fails.
