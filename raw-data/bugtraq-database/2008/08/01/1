Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Python may allow for the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/python     < 2.5.2-r6                      *>= 2.4.4-r14
                                                           >= 2.5.2-r6

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python:

* David Remahl of Apple Product Security reported several integer
  overflows in core modules such as stringobject, unicodeobject,
  bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule,
  mmapmodule (CVE-2008-2315).

* David Remahl of Apple Product Security also reported an integer
  overflow in the hashlib module, leading to unreliable cryptographic
  digest results (CVE-2008-2316).

* Justin Ferguson reported multiple buffer overflows in unicode
  string processing that only affect 32bit systems (CVE-2008-3142).

* The Google Security Team reported multiple integer overflows
  (CVE-2008-3143).

* Justin Ferguson reported multiple integer underflows and overflows
  in the PyOS_vsnprintf() function, and an off-by-one error when
  passing zero-length strings, leading to memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-3144).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities in Python
applications or daemons that pass user-controlled input to vulnerable
functions. Exploitation might lead to the execution of arbitrary code
or a Denial of Service. Vulnerabilities within the hashlib might lead
to weakened cryptographic protection of data integrity or authenticity.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Python 2.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.4.4-r14"

All Python 2.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.5.2-r6"

Please note that Python 2.3 is masked since June 24, and we will not be
releasing updates to it. It will be removed from the tree in the near
future.
