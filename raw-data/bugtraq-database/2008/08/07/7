This is going to *possibly* cause support line bottlenecks tomorrow.

This worm is somewhat similar to zlob, here is a link to a kaspersky paper 
on a previous iteration of it, they call it koobface:
http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207575670

The worm collects spam subject lines from, and then sends the users 
personal data to the following C&C:
zzzping.com

I spoke with DirectNIC last night and the Registrar Operations (reg-ops) 
mailing list was updated that the domain is no longer reachable. That was
very fast response time from DirectNIC, which we appreciate.

The worm is still fast-spreading, watch the statistics as they fly:

The facebook security team is working on this, and they are quite capable. 
The security operations community has been doing analysis and
take-downs, but the worm seems to still be spreading.

All anti virus vendors have been notified, and detection (if not removal) 
should be added within a few hours to a few days.

For now, while users may get infected, their information is safe (UNLESS 
the worm has a secondary contact C&C which I have not verified yet).

It seems like some users may have learned not to click on links in email, 
but any other medium does not compute.
