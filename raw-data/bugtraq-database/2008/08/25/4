4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in Calendarix
Basic, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct SQL
injection attacks.

Input passed to the "catsearch" parameter in cal_search.php and
"catview" in cal_cat.php is not properly sanitised before being used
in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by
injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Successful exploitation allows e.g. retrieval of administrator
usernames and password hashes.
