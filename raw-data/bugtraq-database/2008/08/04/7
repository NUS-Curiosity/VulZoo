Team SHATTER Security Advisory

Cross-site scripting in Oracle Enterprise Manager (REFRESHCHOICE Parameter)

August 4, 2008

Risk Level:
High

Affected versions:
Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Control 10gR1, 10gR2 and 11g (11.1.0.6)

Remote exploitable:
Yes

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martínez
Fayó of Application Security Inc.

Details:
Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities occur when an attacker tricks a
legitimate web application into sending malicious code, generally in the
form of a script, to an unsuspecting end user. The attack usually
involves crafting a hyperlink with malicious script code embedded within
it. A valid user is likely to click this link since it points to a
resource on a trusted domain. The link can be posted on a web page, or
sent in an instant message, or email. Clicking on the link executes the
attacker-injected code in the context of the trusted web application.
Typically, the code steals session cookies, which can then be used to
impersonate a valid user.
The "REFRESHCHOICE" parameter used in web pages of Oracle Enterprise
Manager are vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. User supplied
input to these parameters is returned without proper sanitization,
allowing a malicious attacker to inject arbitrary scripting code.

Impact:
Attackers might steal administrator's session cookies, thereby allowing
the attacker to impersonate the valid user.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this issue.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update July 2008 available at Oracle Metalink.
