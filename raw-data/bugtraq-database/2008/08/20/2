Subject: ToorCon 10 Call For Papers

TOORCON X

9 years have gone by since we released our first CFP and crammed into
a couple of small rooms at UCSD, but we're very proud to have come
this far and to be finally accepting submissions for the 10th ToorCon.
I could go on and on talking about how great this year's event is
going to be, but I'm sure you already know that it's going to kick ass
or don't give a hoot and aren't going to read any further.

Now that we've eliminated all of the losers here's some details about
the con this year. We'll be having the main conference again at the
San Diego Convention Center on September 26th-28th, starting off with
our standard reception on Friday night, 50-minute talks on Saturday,
and 20-minute talks on Sunday. We will also be having 2 days of
hands-on training on September 24th-25th, 2008 and our Deep Knowledge
Seminars on September 26th, 2008. Talks are currently being accepted
for all slots and will be given preference based on the order that
they are received. Here's the infoz that we need from y'all:

DISCLAIMERS

No sales pitches are allowed and please no presentations on old
discoveries or things that most technical people already know about.
We try to keep ToorCon highly technical so please no talks on phf, oob
netbios packets, smurfs, gnomes, other mythical creatures, etc.
ToorCon has full permission to record and republish any material that
is presented at the conference and all that boring stuff. Also, if you
for some reason ditch out on your talk, it wasn't us that hacked your
myspace (I'm sure it was samy).


REASONS TO SUBMIT

- The fame and prestige of presenting at the best hacker conference
out there (no duh)
- A free ticket for yourself and a friend (with benefits or otherwise)
- Invitations to all of the parties and special events (including our
staff/speaker appreciation party/dinner on sunday)
- Free admission to the friday seminars (limited amount of seats
provided on a first-come first serve basis)

SPONSORSHIP

As always, ToorCon doesn't mind getting money from anyone who wants to
give it to them. If you've got any growing on trees and don't mind
sharing with some starving conference planners to help them throw an
even more kickass conference, please let us know. We have all sorts of
ways of making it look like your money was well spent including
banner/logo placement, booths, sponsored parties & lunches, etc. For
more information, please contact geo@...rcon.org .
