Description
Outpost Security Suite is a software application that contains several security,
including anti-virus and is mainly a firewall but also includes an anti-spam and content control.

Vulnerability

The vulnerability is that when using certain special characters such as file name
could be left without protection for the system. 

The first flaw is  used as a special character file name,
making this could evade antivirus protection and make a file already detected
by the antiviru not be detected. 

The second flaw is that using a certain amount of special characters such as filename to run a program
that this blocked by the firewall, the firewall to detect the file, it would break the firewall and would
continue to be running malicious file without restrictions. 

In the latter case exceptions vary depending on the type of characters which are used
for example here there are two different results.

------------------------------------------------------
POC/EXPLOIT
To evade the virus requires the following character.

ASCII:&#12288;
HEX: 26 23 31 32 32 38 38 3b 

To perform the test to fail the firewall will require the following.

ASCII:� � � &#8227; &#8228; &#8229; �
HEX: 86 20 87 20 95 20 26 23 38 32 32 37 3b 20 26 23 38 32 32 38 3b 20 26 23 38 32 32 39 3b 20 85 


Note: In the case of evasion of anti-virus testing must be done with a file detected by antivirus and firewall
in the case obviously does not have a file that would make connections.
