Wordtrans-web Remote Command Execution Vulnerability

I. Summary

Wordtrans is a free front-end graphical application that allows you to
look for
words in several dictionaries. It can also translate the word that the
user
selects with his mouse.

The latest Wordtrans version could allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary
code in the server, caused by an input validation error in the
wordtrans-web
package, which is a PHP-based Web interface for Wordtrans.

II. Affected Products

This vulnerability affects the wordtrans 1.1pre15 and probably previous
versions.

III. Details

By Sending a GET request with the variable "command" set to 'show_desc',
the
variable "link_options" receives one argument from the user, passed via
the
"advanced" variable using the GET method. Then, the variable
"link_options" is
concatenated with the variable "exec_wordtrans". Since "exec_wordtrans"
is
passed to the function "passthru" without checking for special
characters, an
attacker can send shell characters like | or ; to execute commands in
the
machine with the privileges of the Web server process at the time the
URL is
submitted. This is part of vulnerable script from wordtrans 1.1pre15:

...
$exec_wordtrans = $wordtrans . "-d \"$dict\" ";

switch ($_GET['command']) {
case "show_desc":
$exec_wordtrans .= "--desc ";
$link_options = "--html-link-options \"?lang=
$lang_case&amp;advanced=".$_GET['advanced']."&amp;\" ";
$exec_wordtrans .= $link_options;

passthru($exec_wordtrans);
break;
...

To exploit this vulnerability, the "Magic Quotes" option needs to be
unset.
But since this option was removed from PHP since version 6.0.0, this is
a
critical vulnerability.

IV. Solution

No vendor response.
