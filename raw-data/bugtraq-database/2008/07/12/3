A customer service message from ZoneAlarm ï¿½

On Tuesday, Microsoft rolled out an automatic update to all of their users.  Unfortunately, this cut off Internet access for anyone on Windows XP or Windows 2000 using the ZoneAlarm firewall.  This is the #1 free firewall in the world, and is also included in other security products sold by ZoneAlarm.
