Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Apache might lead to a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/apache       < 2.2.9                         >= 2.2.9

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache:

* Dustin Kirkland reported that the mod_ssl module can leak memory
  when the client reports support for a compression algorithm
  (CVE-2008-1678).

* Ryujiro Shibuya reported that the ap_proxy_http_process_response()
  function in the mod_proxy module does not limit the number of
  forwarded interim responses (CVE-2008-2364).

* sp3x of SecurityReason reported a Cross-Site Request Forgery
  vulnerability in the balancer-manager in the mod_proxy_balancer
  module (CVE-2007-6420).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by connecting to
an Apache httpd, by causing an Apache proxy server to connect to a
malicious server, or by enticing a balancer administrator to connect to
a specially-crafted URL, resulting in a Denial of Service of the Apache
daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.2.9"
