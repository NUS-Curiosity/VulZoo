Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in PCRE, allowing
for the execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

PCRE is a Perl-compatible regular expression library. GLib includes a
copy of PCRE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/libpcre       < 7.7-r1                         >= 7.7-r1
  2  dev-libs/glib         < 2.16.3-r1                    >= 2.16.3-r1
                                                              < 2.14.0
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security team reported a heap-based buffer
overflow when compiling regular expression patterns containing
"Internal Option Settings" such as "(?i)".

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
specially crafted regular expression to an application making use of
the PCRE library, which could possibly lead to the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PCRE users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libpcre-7.7-r1"

All GLib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/glib-2.16.3-r1"
