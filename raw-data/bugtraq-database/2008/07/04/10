The F5 FirePass 1200 SSL VPN appliance contains a denial-of-service vulnerability in the SNMP daemon. Traversing (walking) OID branch hrSWInstalled in HOST-RESOURCES-MIB (OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.6) will cause the daemon to crash. No analysis has been done to determine if the vulnerability is further exploitable.


The vulnerability has been identified in version 6.0.2, hotfix 3. However, other versions may be also affected.


Solution:
Limit network access to the SNMP daemon.
