Also, back when I was working in a big company, we had Windows2000  
laptops that the admins seemed very conservative in patching (at  
least, if the output of hfnetcheck could be believed).

I imagine it's the same in a lot of other companies, if only for lack  
of time for integration-testing: there may be dozens of IE5.5-only  
intranet-applications that don't work with IE7 (or even 6) and that  
may even break after specific security patches have been applied.
Some of these applications may be "legacy stuff" where the maintainer  
(probably an intern or a defunct company) is no longer around.



cheers,
Rainer
