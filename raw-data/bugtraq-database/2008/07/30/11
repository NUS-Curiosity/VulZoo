Subject: Tool: PorkBind Nameserver Security Scanner 

In light of the new DNS cache poisoning issue and now that everyone has had 
plenty of time to apply patches, I've decided to release a new version of my 
nameserver security scanner called porkbind. It is a multi-threaded nameserver 
scanner that can recursively query nameservers of subdomains for version 
strings. (i.e. sub.host.dom's nameservers then host.dom's nameservers) 
After acquiring the version strings it tests them against version numbers 
from CERT advisories and reports back to the user. Zone transfer 
capability is also tested for. It is available for download at:
