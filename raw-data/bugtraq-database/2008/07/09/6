You seem to have rediscovered the issue that I reported on full-disclosure
on April 1st - see
https://www.cynops.de/advisories/AKLINK-SA-2008-002.txt

Note that Office 2008, Microsoft Live Mail and Microsoft Mail on Vista
are also affected.

For those of you who want to try that out, you can send an empty email
to smime-http@...nk.name, which will send you back an email that
will trigger the vulnerability and provide you with a link to check
whether the HTTP request reached my server.

I have also talked at this year's EuSecWest about this issue (and some
others), see the slides here:

They have known since mid-January, tested a bit in February but have not
responded to my mails on how they intend to fix it ...

Cheers,
