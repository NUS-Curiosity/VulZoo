      Advisory for Oracle CPU January 2008 - Ultra Search excessive
      privileges


See http://www.petefinnigan.com/Advisory_CPU_Jan_2008.htm for details.


      Description

Oracle Ultra-Search uses database and Oracle text functionallity to 
provide a uniform search function that is fully integrated with the SQL 
language and where it allows full text search capabilities within the 
database. For more details see Introduction to Oracle Ultra Search 
<http://support.cs.nott.ac.uk/help/docs/databases/oracle/standard/ultra.101/b10731/over.htm>. 
The issue located by PeteFinnigan.com Limited relates to excessive 
privileges assigned to the WKSYS database schema/user account.


      Risk

If the WKSYS schema exists then the risk is still present without 
application of the patch. The CVSS score is 3.0 which is low but the 
risk increases if the schema is accessible due to a weak password or an 
additional attack vector that allows code to run as WKSYS. Access to the 
schema, either directly or indirectly are required to expliot this issue.


      Workaround

If the Oracle Ultra-Search functionallity is not required either 
directly or indirectly then ensure that this component is not installed. 
This can be verified by checking if the WKSYS schema is present in the 
database.
