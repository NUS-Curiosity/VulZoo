Yeah, you are right. Protocol switching was disabled in my Quicktime
preferences. Sorry about that.. I should have checked before writing
inaccurate statements here.

By the way, even with "Transport setup" -> "Automatic", the software
doesn't crash nor loops after reading the HTTP payload, but I really
don't know why.. It merely sits there, saying "Swiching transports".

Attached a full pcap dump of the session and QuickTime.app's version
plist.

Have fun! :)
