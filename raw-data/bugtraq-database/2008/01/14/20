Looks like your site was compromised along with several hundred others
in the last day or so.

A full account is up on
http://blog.trendmicro.com/e-commerce-sites-invaded/ but the JS you
posted is the exact same as the one used in those attacks. I'm
guessing you have Javascripts embedded in your pages that pointed to a
randomly named js in the same directory, right?
