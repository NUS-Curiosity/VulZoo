Jamie,

the servers are definately 'rooted' - as in, root access required for
what the exploit does ie. it's dug itself deep into the kernel and you
can't even compile a new kernel on the infected machine or even create
files or directories that start with a digit. So yeah, the servers are
rooted in every sense of the word (even the Aussie slang interpretation)

I don't believe the exploit would  be nearly as damaging or dangerous if
it didn't involve root compromise.

Scott.MC explains it better on the webhostingtalk.com link posted
earlier. Cheers

Denis
