Subject: Facebook security contact

I've been trying to contact Facebook to report a security vulnerability. The
Facebook site does not seem to have any information about how to report
vulnerabilities or contact their security team. I tried emailing
security@...ebook.com and privacy@...ebook.com but got no response. 

Does anybody have a security contact for Facebook, or should I just
post the bug here?
