Dear Jos?e M. Palazon Romero,

This   approach   is   not   new,   it   was   demonstrated  by  ShAnKaR
<shankar_(at)_shankar.name> against Simple Machines Forum 1.1.2 in June,
2007.

JeMPR> Hi all,

JeMPR> Some days ago I wrote an advisory which demonstrates how the
Peter's
JeMPR> Math Antispam Spinoff plugin for wordpress
JeMPR> (http://www.theblog.ca/math-anti-spam) can be defeated by its
audio file.

JeMPR> It's hard to summarize, you better read the advisory, but in a
very
JeMPR> small nutshell, the flaw its about not using any kind of
distortion on
JeMPR> the audio clip, which makes it easily identificable by a script.

JeMPR> Here is the link:

JeMPR> I'm sure you will find the advisory inspirational, as the
approach is
JeMPR> applicable to many other capthas, and anti-script methods.

JeMPR> Regards

JeMPR> Jose
