Not at all, if you have the ability to integrate DNS lookups into
your filtering process (coupled with a DNS cache running locally on
the firewall, this should not be particularly demanding on your
resources). This problem has already been solved by people wanting
to weight scores for incoming E-mail from mailservers in different
geographic regions. One of the more popular free geographic DNS
lookup services is described at http://countries.nerd.dk/ (and
Jacobsen makes updated versions of his DNS zone data available for
download in case you want to host your own copy instead of relying
on someone else's nameservers).

In my professional life, I see frequent requests of this nature from
customers in western/English-speaking countries. My immediate
response is, "you *are* aware that Australia and New Zealand are
part of APNIC, right?"
