Subject: Pre-auth buffer-overflow in mySQL through yaSSL


The following is a proof-of-concept for testing the buffer-overflow
which affects yaSSL <= 1.7.5 on mySQL servers, any version, included the
latest 6.0.3:

  http://aluigi.org/poc/mysqlo.zip

The vulnerability is exploitable before authentication so the only
requirements for testing it are the usage of SSL on the server and
naturally having an IP address with access to the database.

By default mySQL uses yaSSL (1.6.0) for avoiding licences conflicts,
anyway if the test server has been compiled with specific OpenSSL
support it is NOT vulnerable.
