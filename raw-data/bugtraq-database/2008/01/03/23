Package        : tomcat5.5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-3382 CVE-2007-3385 CVE-2007-3386 CVE-2007-5342 CVE-2007-5461

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-3382

    It was discovered that single quotes (') in cookies were treated
    as a delimiter, which could lead to an information leak.

CVE-2007-3385

    It was discovered that the character sequence \" in cookies was
    handled incorrectly, which could lead to an information leak.

CVE-2007-3386
 
    It was discovered that the host manager servlet performed
    insufficient input validation, which could lead to cross-site
    scripting.

CVE-2007-5342

    It was discovered that the JULI logging component did not restrict
    its target path, resulting in potential denial of service through
    file overwrites.

CVE-2007-5461

    It was discovered that the WebDAV servlet is vulnerable to absolute
    path traversal.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.20-2etch1.

The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tomcat5.5.

The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat5.5 packages.
