Subject: Yet another Dialog Spoofing Vulnerability - Firefox Basic Authentication

Summary
Mozilla Firefox allows spoofing the information presented in the basic
authentication dialog box. This can allow an attacker to conduct phishing

is from a trusted website.

Affected versions
Mozilla Firefox v2.0.0.11. 
Prior versions and other Mozilla products may also be affected.
