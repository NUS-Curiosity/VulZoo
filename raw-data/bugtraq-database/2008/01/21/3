Package        : tomcat5.5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0128 CVE-2007-2450

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-0128

    Olaf Kock discovered that HTTPS encryption was insufficiently
    enforced for single-sign-on cookies, which could result in
    information disclosure.

CVE-2007-2450

    It was discovered that the Manager and Host Manager web applications
    performed insufficient input sanitising, which could lead to cross-
    site scripting.

This update also adapts the tomcat5.5-webapps package to the tightened
JULI permissions introduced in the previous tomcat5.5 DSA. However, it
should be noted, that the tomcat5.5-webapps is for demonstration and
documentation purposes only and should not be used for production
systems.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.20-2etch2.

The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tomcat5.5.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat5.5 packages.
