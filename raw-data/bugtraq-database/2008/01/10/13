Tried on QuickTime 7.3.10 running on OSX 10.5.1, and the player doesn't
try to connect to port 80 if 554 is closed.

Either putting nc to listen on port 554 and making QT connect to rtsp:/
or listening on port 80 and connecting to http:/ does not crash it. So,
yeah, the bug should lie somewhere in the "fallback" that QT employs on
Windows when finding out that the rtsp port is closed.

Best regards!
