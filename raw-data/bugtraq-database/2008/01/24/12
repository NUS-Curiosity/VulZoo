Dumb question: can you reproduce this issue when you have a non-blank
enable password? I can see this behavior when a blank enable password is
set, but if I have a non-blank enable password I don't see the behavior
- I get dropped back into unprivilege EXEC after using the backspace
key.

When the enable password is blank you still get prompted for a password
when you want to go into privileged EXEC mode via the "enable" command.
However, hitting just <Enter> will grant you access. There is no
password set after all.

Could you make sure that you have an non-blank enable password set by
using the command "enable password <some password>" and try again?

Note: even if "show running-config enable" shows an "enable password"
command in the configuration that doesn't mean that the enable password
is non-blank; the output just displays a hash of a blank password.

Cheers,
