Subject: Revised: OpenSSH security advisory: cbc.adv

Hi,

There was an error in the original advisory. The estimate of 32768
attempts to carry out a successful attack is incorrect. The correct
estimate is 11356 attempts. A revised version is now available at:
http://www.openssh.com/txt/cbc.adv

The advisory and its recommendations are otherwise unchanged.
