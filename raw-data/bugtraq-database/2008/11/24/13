Could someone please help the uncomprehending [i.e. me :-)] understand
why or whether this is anything to be worried about at all ?

Quick calculator session :
2^(-18) = 0.000003814697265625
2^(-14) = 0.00006103515625

So there is a vanishingly small probability that a Bad Guy may
discover less than 2 characters from my command-line, every time they
try this attack.  And each time they fail, my connection gets rudely
chopped.  Two characters won't help them much.  They'd need to succeed
about ten times per typed command-line to snoop on most of my
sessions.  This weakness is surely of no conceivable use to a Bad Guy
?

What am I missing ?
Is this something to do with subsequently using those characters in a
known plaintext attack, or recovering a significant fraction of a
shortish typed password, or what ?

Given the amount of data pumped down the typical automated connection
per hour, this is hardly anything to worry about .. surely ?
