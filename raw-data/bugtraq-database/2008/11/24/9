When RLIMIT_AS has been exceeded.

If you disable the use of mmap'd-malloc() via mallopt(M_MMAP_MAX, 0),
you can effectively limit malloc() via RLIMIT_DATA.

If you really want to allow a single process to use all available RAM
for itself, you can; but you don't have to.

It might be nice if the browser limited the amount of memory which
could be used by e.g. JavaScript (although for Firefox, you would
probably want the limit to only be applied to "external" JavaScript,
given that much of the browser itself is written in JavaScript).
