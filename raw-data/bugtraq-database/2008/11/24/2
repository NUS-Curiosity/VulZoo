Subject: Re: Wrong report: BID 32287, Pi3Web ISAPI DoS vulnerability

Vulnerability is confirmed on Pi3Web 2.03 PL 2. If an attacker sends a request to one of the files in the isapi directory, the dialog box appears on the host system. Until the OK button on the host system is pressed, Pi3Web does not serve any requests. There is no application crash, but technically, it`s a DoS.
