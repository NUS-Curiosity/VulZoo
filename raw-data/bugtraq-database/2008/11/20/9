Does that also hold true if you use a javascript/java applet to deliver the URL rather than just placing it in a text link?

Hi Peter,

Apropos File URI scheme, if you are saying about accessing a file with something like file://abcd... in a link, 'over a network', then most of the browsers (perhaps all) do not follow "file:" links on a page that is fetched with "HTTP". The purpose is "security" or to prevent a remote page from executing a program on the visitor's computer. 

The file: links work on pages that are local files on the user's disk! Though in some browsers these settings can be changed. That is why the Opera exploit through file://abcd.... does not work on network.

Hope it answers your query!
