Subject: Re: Re: Re: Opera 9.6x file:// overflow

For whatever reason, the file:// exploit isn't working on the version of Opera I have on this machine, but it worked on my XP SP2 machine back home. I can't get it to crash with https:// either. Both have Opera 9.62. Perhaps there's been a silent fix? I'm not sure; I wish Opera would reply.
