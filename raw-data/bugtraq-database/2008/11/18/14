Hello Bug Traq Readers, here are some updates on upcoming Black Hat
briefings as well as ways to get involved.

BLACK HAT FREE WEBINAR Nov 20th
https://www.blackhat.com/html/webinars/clickjacking.html

Black Hat Webcast #5 is scheduled for Thursday, November 20 at 1pm PST.  
The topic this time is Clickjacking, and our featured guest is Jeremiah
Grossman, the co-discoverer of the widely publicized vulnerability.  For the
uninitiated, it's a set of techniques discovered by Jeremiah Grossman and
Robert Hansen that allows an attacker to transparently capture a user's
clicks, forcing the user to do all manner of unpleasant things ranging from
adjusting security settings to unwittingly visiting websites with malicious
code.

The vectors for this attack include all the major browsers and Flash. In
co-operation with Adobe, the discoverers delayed public discussion to allow
a patch to be created. In the intervening time, other researchers have made
partial disclosures, but this is your chance to join co-discoverer Jeremiah
Grossman for a Black Hat webcast that deals with the attack from all sides.
Bring your questions - we'll have a Q&A session after the presentation.

Black Hat Japan is in the books and we're already looking forward to the
Washington DC and Europe events. If you missed Black Hat Tokyo, we have put
all the material on-line for download, and are in the process of getting the
audio files tagged and on-line as well:
