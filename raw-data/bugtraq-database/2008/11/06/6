Hi,

I was mistaken.  Turns out that init spawns a root shell on
/dev/console -- so everything you type automatically gets executed, as
root, as a command.  This is just a bug and requires the user to
physically type at the keyboard.  I don't think it could be exploited
automatically by an application.
