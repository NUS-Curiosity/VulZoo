[ - The venue - ]

FRHACK 01 (1st edition) will take place at the Great Kursaal Hall of
Besançon with capacity for up to 1400 people.

[*] About Besançon (stolen from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besan%C3%A7on)

Besançon is the capital and principal city of the Franche-Comté region
in eastern France. Located close to the border with Switzerland, it is
the capital of the Doubs department.
As well as being famed as one of France's finest "villes d'art" (art
cities), Besançon is the seat of one of France's older universities, of
France's National School of Mechanics and Micromechanics, and one of the
best known French language schools in France, the CLA. It is also
reputed to be France's most environmentally-friendly city, with a public
transport network that has often been cited as a model. On account of
the topography, the historic city centre lies at the edge of the modern
city, and hiking tracks lead straight from the centre and up into the
surrounding hills.
The Citadel of Besançon dates back to the Celtic era. In his De Bello
Gallicum, Julius Caesar already said about the fortress of Vesontio
(celtic name of Besançon) that it was one of the best defensive sites he
had ever seen.
Besançon is situated at the crossing of two major lines of
communication, the NE-SW route, following the valley of the river Doubs,
and linking Germany and North Europe with Lyon and southwest Europe, and
the N-S route linking northern France and the Netherlands with
Switzerland. A key staging post on the Strasbourg-Lyon (Germany-Spain)
route, it also has direct high-speed train (TGV) links with Paris,
Charles de Gaulle International Airport, and Lille. Unusually for a town
of its size, it does not have a commercial airport, though two
international airports, EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg and Lyon
Saint-Exupéry International Airport, can be reached in about 2 hours.
