You could still use this attack in DOS scenarios. Through those
connection terminations the service quality is reduced. You could e.g.
lock admins out (prevent security updates, have more time for time-
consuming attacks which would otherwise be reset from time to time
by admins, ...) or reduce transmission rate of security logs by machines
without harddisk using SSH like a VPN to send logs to some central
server or in general could inhibit many vital processes based on SSH.
Thus you could increase your chances of other attacks. And of course
you can attack the service ssh itself.

(all those could be prevented by the use of a VPN - but most people
won't take this effort if they don't really need to do so and therefore
don't have one set up when they would need it)

Best regards
