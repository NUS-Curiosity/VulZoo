Aleph One's paper on stack smashing, Tim Newsham's on format strings,
Shaun Clowes' on PHP issues - not to mention a bunch of others -
demonstrate how successful a white paper can be for raising widespread
awareness about an issue.  Aleph One was hardly the first to discover
and exploit buffer overflows, but few would disagree about how
important his paper was to the industry.
