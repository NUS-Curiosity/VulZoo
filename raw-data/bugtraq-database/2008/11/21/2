-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to retrieve arbitrary files

Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the SAN Manager Master Agent service
(msragent.exe) which listens by default on TCP port 10444. While
processing SST_SENDFILE requests the service does not validate the
requestor allowing any remote attacker to download arbitrary files.
