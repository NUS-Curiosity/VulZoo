Subject: sharedlog CMS Remote File Includes

I have discovered a remote file include vulnerability in the sharedlog Content management system. 

http://www.shatm.com/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharedlog/

Vulnerable code segment:
require_once($GLOBALS['root_dir'].'classes/!class.memcache.inc.php');
Line 5 of slideshow_uploadvideo.content.php

As usual,Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled. 

Happy hacking.
