Subject: Updated: Google Chrome 0.4.154.25 URI Meta Character URL Obfuscation

Hi All

The Google chrome new version 0.4.154.25 is also suffering from this
vulnerability.The full POC have been released at milw0rm.

Have a look at it: http://milw0rm.com/exploits/7226

The problem is this most of web servers have anti viruses which
treated it as URL Spoofing virus. Anyways the POC has been
released for the latest version.
