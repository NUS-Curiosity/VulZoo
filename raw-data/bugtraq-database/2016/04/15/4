         CVE Name       

    Description  Asterisk may crash when processing an incoming REGISTER      
                 request if that REGISTER contains a Contact header with a    
                 lengthy URI.                                                 
                                                                              
                 This crash will only happen for requests that pass           
                 authentication. Unauthenticated REGISTER requests will not   
                 result in a crash occurring.                                 
                                                                              
                 This vulnerability only affects Asterisk when using PJSIP    
                 as its SIP stack. The chan_sip module does not have this     
                 problem.                                                     

    Resolution  Measures have been put in place to ensure that REGISTER       
                requests with long Contact URIs are rejected instead of       
                causing a crash.
