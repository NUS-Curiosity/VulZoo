Vendor description:
-------------------
"Digitalstrom is designed to systematically network all the electrical devices

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends every user to sign out immediately after configuring
the Digitalstrom installation in the Digitalstrom Konfigurator. This should
prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. Furthermore every user should be
aware that an attack could occure everytime when he clicks on an unknown link.

However, SEC Consult recommends the vendor to conduct a comprehensive security
analysis, based on security source code reviews, in order to identify all
available vulnerabilities in the Digitalstrom Konfigurator and increase the
security of its customers.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------

1) Multiple Persistent Cross-Site Scripting
Digitalstrom Konfigurator suffers from multiple cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, which allow stealing session tokens and impersonation of
other users in order to gain unauthorized access to the web interface.
Furthermore it is possible to alter the contents of the interface in the
context of the current user.


2) Cross-Site Request Forgery
Digitalstrom Konfigurator doesn't implement any kind of cross-site request
forgery protection. Due to that, attackers are able to execute arbitrary
requests with the privileges of any user. The only requirement is, that a
victim visits a malicious webpage. For example, an administrator can be
forced to execute unwanted actions. Some of these actions are:

  -) Change network configuration
  -) Enable SSH service
  -) Turn various devices on and off


Proof of concept:
-----------------
Has been removed due to the request from the vendor.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
