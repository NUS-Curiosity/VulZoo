RESOLUTION

HPE has provided the following resolution to fix this vulnerability: Upgrade
all servers running HPE System Management Homepage to HPE System Management
Homepage version 7.5.4. Systems that are already running SMH version 7.4.x do
not have to be upgraded, as SSLV2 was removed beginning with that version of
the software.

Once all SMH servers are upgraded, regenerate all certificates that the
servers use, making sure to discard any old, SSLV2-generated certificates
which could be used to exploit the DROWN vulnerability. Certificates that
were generated using System Management Homepage v7.4.x or later do not have
to be recreated.
