    WebKit in Apple iOS before 9.3, Safari before 9.1, and tvOS before

    The Page Loading implementation in WebKit in Apple iOS before 9.3
    and Safari before 9.1 mishandles character encoding during access to
    cached data, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin
    Policy and obtain sensitive information via a crafted web site.

    The Page Loading implementation in WebKit in Apple iOS before 9.3
    and Safari before 9.1 mishandles HTTP responses with a 3xx (aka
    redirection) status code, which allows remote attackers to spoof the
    displayed URL, bypass the Same Origin Policy, and obtain sensitive
    cached information via a crafted web site.
