Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Evolved Programmable Network Manager Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160406-remcode

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 April 6 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of HTTP user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP POST with crafted deserialized user data. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges on the affected system, which could be used to conduct further attacks.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds are not available.
