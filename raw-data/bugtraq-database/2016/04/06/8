Cisco TelePresence Server Crafted IPv6 Packet Handling Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20160406-cts

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 April 6 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence Server devices running software versions 3.0 
through 4.2(4.18) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a kernel 
panic on the device.

The vulnerability exists due to a failure to properly handle a specially crafted stream 
of IPv6 packets. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause a kernel panic, 
rebooting the device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that 
mitigate this vulnerability are available.
