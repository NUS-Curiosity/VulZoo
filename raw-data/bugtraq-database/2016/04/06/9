Cisco TelePresence Server Crafted URL Handling Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20160406-cts1

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 April 6 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence Server devices running software versions 4.1(2.29) 
through 4.2(4.17) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device 
to reload.
 
The vulnerability exists due to a failure of the HTTP parsing engine to handle specially 
crafted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple URL 
requests to an affected device. The requests will eventually time out because negotiation 
from the client does not occur; however, each request consumes additional memory, 
resulting in memory exhaustion that causes the device to crash. If successful, the 
attacker could utilize all available memory resources, causing the device to reload.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that 
address this vulnerability are not available.
