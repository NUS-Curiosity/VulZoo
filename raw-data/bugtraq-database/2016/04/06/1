Subject: Re: [SE-2012-01] Broken security fix in IBM Java 7/8


Hello All,

I should have included the following information in my original post:
1) Issue 67 was assigned CVE-2013-3009 [1],
2) it originally affected IBM Java from versions 1.4 to 7 [2],
3) CVE-ID corresponding to a broken patch will likely not reflect the
    original issue. This was the case for IBM's Issue 49 (CVE-2012-4823)
    and two of its broken fixes (CVE-2013-3012 and CVE-2013-5458).
4) Incomplete patch for Issue 67 may affect IBM Notes / Domino, Websphere,
    Tivoli and other IBM products incorporating vulnerable IBM JRE (source:
    IBM Security Bulletins where CVE-2013-3009 identifier strings appears).

Thank you.
