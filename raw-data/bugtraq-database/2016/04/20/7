Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Wireless LAN Controller HTTP Parsing Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160420-htrd

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 April 20 16:00  GMT (UTC)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the HTTP URL redirect feature of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of HTTP traffic by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the device, which could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition, or execute arbitrary code on the device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
