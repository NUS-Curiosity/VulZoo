Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software DHCPv6 Relay Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160420-asa-dhcpv6

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 April 20 16:00  GMT (UTC)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the DHCPv6 relay feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of DHCPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DHCPv6 packets to an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

This vulnerability affects systems configured in routed firewall mode and in single or multiple context mode. Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability only if the software is configured with the DHCPv6 relay feature. The vulnerability is triggered only by IPv6 traffic.

This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software release 9.4.1 only.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
