Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the Bonjour task manager of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Bonjour traffic by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Bonjour traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
