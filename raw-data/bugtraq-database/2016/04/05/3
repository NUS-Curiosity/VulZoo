Package        : roundcube
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8770

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered that Roundcube, a
webmail client, contained a path traversal vulnerability. This flaw
could be exploited by an attacker to access sensitive files on the
server, or even execute arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.7.2-9+deb7u2.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 1.1.4+dfsg.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.
