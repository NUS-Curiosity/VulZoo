Net Acceleration
Product: AccelSite Content Manager - CMS (Web-Application) 1.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql-injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the
AccelSite Content Manager v1.0 Content Management System.
The web vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql
commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The sql-injection vulnerability is located in the `contentID value of
the `index.php` file GET method request. Remote attackers
are able to execute sql commands by injection of malicious statements
via GET method request. The vulnerability is located on the
application-side of the online service. The injection points is the
contentID value in the vulnerable index.php file. The security
vulnerability is a classic order by sql injection bug in the contentID
parameter.

The security risk of the sql-injection vulnerability is estimated as
high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.2.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no
user interaction or privileged web-application user accounts.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database
management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
                [+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
                [+] index.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                [+] contentID


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql-injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers without user interaction or privileged web-application user
accounts.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.

Dork(s):
intext:powered by AccelSite Content Manager inurl:.php?contentID=

PoC: Exploitation
http://localhost:8080/index.php?contentID=899%27-1[SQL-INJECTION
VULNERABILITY!]--
http://localhost:8080/index.php?contentID=169%27-1[SQL-INJECTION
VULNERABILITY!]--


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The sql-injection vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and
encode of the vulnerable contentID value in the index.php file GET
method request.
Restrict the input and disallow usage of special chars. Prevent an
execution by usage of a prepared statement in connection with stable set
entities.
Escape the context as well at the end.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql-injection web vulnerabilities in the
content management system are estimated as high. (CVSS 7.2)
