Debian Bug     : 814732 825800 847055

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in GraphicsMagick, a
collection of image processing tool, which can cause denial of service
attacks, remote file deletion, and remote command execution.

This security update removes the full support of PLT/Gnuplot decoder to
prevent Gnuplot-shell based shell exploits for fixing the CVE-2016-3714
vulnerability.

The undocumented "TMP" magick prefix no longer removes the argument file
after it has been read for fixing the CVE-2016-3715 vulnerability. Since
the "TMP" feature was originally implemented, GraphicsMagick added a
temporary file management subsystem which assures that temporary files
are removed so this feature is not needed.

Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or writing output
to a shell command, by prefixing the specified filename (containing the
command) with a '|' for fixing the CVE-2016-5118 vulnerability.

CVE-2015-8808

    Gustavo Grieco discovered an out of bound read in the parsing of GIF
    files which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-2317

    Gustavo Grieco discovered a stack buffer overflow and two heap buffer
    overflows while processing SVG images which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-2318

    Gustavo Grieco discovered several segmentation faults while processing
    SVG images which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-5240

    Gustavo Grieco discovered an endless loop problem caused by negative
    stroke-dasharray arguments while parsing SVG files which may cause
    denial of service.

CVE-2016-7800

    Marco Grassi discovered an unsigned underflow leading to heap overflow
    when parsing 8BIM chunk often attached to JPG files which may cause
    denial of service.

CVE-2016-7996

    Moshe Kaplan discovered that there is no check that the provided
    colormap is not larger than 256 entries in the WPG reader which may
    cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-7997

    Moshe Kaplan discovered that an assertion is thrown for some files in
    the WPG reader due to a logic error which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8682

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a stack buffer read overflow
    while reading the SCT header which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8683

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the
    PCX coder which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8684

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the
    SGI coder which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-9830

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in
    MagickRealloc() function which may cause denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.20-3+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems (with the
exception of CVE-2016-9830) have been fixed in version 1.3.25-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.25-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.
