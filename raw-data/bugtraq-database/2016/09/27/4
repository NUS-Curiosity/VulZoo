Potential Security Impact: Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities

Source: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Product Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
Potential security vulnerabilities have been identified with HPE iMC PLAT
network products using SSL/TLS. These vulnerabilities could be exploited
remotely resulting in disclosure of information and other impacts including:

  - The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm is not collision resistant, which makes
it easier for context-dependent attackers to conduct spoofing attacks, as
demonstrated by attacks on the use of MD5 in the signature algorithm of an
X.509 certificate.
  - The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, has many
single-byte biases, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of ciphertext in a large
number of sessions that use the same plaintext.
  - The RC4 stream cipher vulnerability in SSL/TLS known as "Bar Mitzvah"
could be exploited remotely to allow disclosure of information.
