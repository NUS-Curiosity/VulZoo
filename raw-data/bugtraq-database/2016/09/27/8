Package        : bind9
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2775 CVE-2016-2776
Debian Bug     : 831796 839010

Two vulnerabilities were reported in BIND, a DNS server.

CVE-2016-2775

    The lwresd component in BIND (which is not enabled by default)
    could crash while processing an overlong request name.  This could
    lead to a denial of service.

CVE-2016-2776

    A crafted query could crash the BIND name server daemon, leading
    to a denial of service.  All server roles (authoritative,
    recursive and forwarding) in default configurations are are
    affected.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
