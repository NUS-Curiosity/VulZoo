Subject: Google Nexus 5X Bootloader Unauthorized Memory Dumping via USB

Vulnerable versions:
================
Android 6.0.0 MDA89E through 6.0.1 MMB29V (bootloaders bhz10i/k)

Non-vulnerable versions:
====================
Android 6.0.1 MHC19J (bootloader bhz10m) and above.

Details:
======
The attacker reboots the phone into the 'fastboot' mode. A physical
attacker can do this, without authorization, by pressing both the
'power' and 'volume down' buttons during device boot. An attacker with
an authorized ADB access can do this by issuing the 'adb reboot
bootloader' command. The fastboot mode exposes a USB interface, which,
on locked devices, must not allow any security-sensitive operation to
be commanded. However, we discovered that if the attacker issued the
'fastboot oem panic' command via the fastboot USB interface, the
bootloader would be forced to crash:

[38870] fastboot: oem panic
[38870] panic (frame 0xf9b1768):

[38880] panic (caller 0xf936964): generate test-panic

The problem is that in the vulnerable versions of the bootloader, such
a crash would cause the bootloader to expose a serial-over-USB
connection, which would allow an attacker to obtain a full memory dump
of the device using tools such as QPST Configuration. The resulting
memory dump files would then be available under the attackerâ€™s PC.
