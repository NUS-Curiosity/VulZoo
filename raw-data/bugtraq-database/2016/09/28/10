Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Smart Install Memory Leak Vulnerability

Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20160928-smi

Revision: 1.0

For Public Release: 2016 September 28 16:00  GMT

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Smart Install client feature in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak and eventual denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of image list parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Smart Install packets to TCP port 4786. A successful exploit could cause a Cisco Catalyst switch to leak memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability other than disabling Smart Install functionality on the affected device.
