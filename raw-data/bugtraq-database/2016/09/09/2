         CVE Name       

    Description  The overlap dialing feature in chan_sip allows chan_sip to   
                 report to a device that the number that has been dialed is   
                 incomplete and more digits are required. If this             
                 functionality is used with a device that has performed       
                 username/password authentication RTP resources are leaked.   
                 This occurs because the code fails to release the old RTP    
                 resources before allocating new ones in this scenario. If    
                 all resources are used then RTP port exhaustion will occur   
                 and no RTP sessions are able to be set up.                   

    Resolution  If overlap dialing support is not needed the “allowoverlap”   
                option can be set to no. This will stop any usage of the      
                scenario which causes the resource exhaustion.                
                                                                              
                If overlap dialing support is needed a change has been made   
                so that existing RTP resources are destroyed in this          
                scenario before allocating new resources.
