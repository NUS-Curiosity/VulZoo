REcon is a computer security conference with a focus on reverse
engineering and advanced exploitation techniques. It has been held
annually in Montreal, Canada, for 10 years.

We are pleased to announce that after 10 great years of hosting the
conference in Montreal, we are expanding to share the REcon experience
with Europe as well. This January we will host our first European annual
edition of the conference in Brussels, Belgium!

To get a feel for what the conference is all about, you can see videos
of presentations from REcon Montreal 2016 on our website at
https://recon.cx/

The conference offers a single track of presentations over the span
of three days along with technical training sessions held before
the presentation dates.  Technical training varies in length between
two and four days.

Attendees help define the event. They have always been and always will
be those looking to learn something new, share ideas, and unwind in a
welcoming environment. The registration for the conference will open
soon.

We are now inviting speakers to submit proposals for Recon Brussels 2017
year's talks. Some guidelines for talks are:

 - 30 or 60 minute presentations
 - We are open to proposals for workshops that would occur alongside
   talks
 - There will be time for five to ten minute informal lightning talks
   during the REcon party

Registration for training is also now open. This year we have another
great set of training's available:

 - Mobile and Telecom Applied Hacking and Reverse Engineering by
   Philippe Langlois (2 days: 25-26 January)
 - Reverse Engineering Malware by Nicolas Brulez (4 days: 23-26 January)
 - Windows Internals for Reverse Engineers by Alex Ionescu (4 days:
   23-26 January)
 - Hardware Hacking (Advanced) by Dmitry Nedospasov
   (4 days: 23-26 January)
 - The ARM Exploit Laboratory by Saumil Shah (4 days: 23-26 January)

   and Tillmann Werner (4 days: 23-26 January)

Conference talks in the following fields are encouraged (but not
limited to):

 - Hardware reverse engineering
 - Software reverse engineering
 - Protocol reverse engineering
 - Finding vulnerabilities and writing exploits
 - Novel data visualization for hackers and reverse engineers
 - Bypassing security and software protections
