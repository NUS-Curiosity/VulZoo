RESOLUTION

HPE has made the following mitigation information available to resolve the
vulnerability for version A.11.31.18.21 of HP-UX IPFilter.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by either of the following actions:

A. Remove the keep state option from udp rules

Search for rules with proto udp and keep state to identify the impacted rule
and remove the keep state option.

Example rules are as follows:
pass in quick on lanN proto udp from <IP-addr1> to <IP-addr2> keep state
pass out quick on lanN proto udp from <IP-addr3> to <IP-addr4> keep state

For the above example rules, remove the keep state from the rule as follows:
pass in quick on lanN proto udp from <IP-addr1> to <IP-addr2>
pass out quick on lanN proto udp from <IP-addr3> to <IP-addr4>

B. Alternatively, HP-UX IPFilter can be downgraded to version A.11.31.18.10
