Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Shareholder Investor Relations  web-application. (2015-Q2).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate client-side application requests to compromise user account session information.

The vulnerability is located in the browser name http request. Remote attackers are able to manipulate the local user agent name value. After the first 
manipulation the attacker requests the investor web-application with the wrong credentials to provoke a client-side script code execution. The user agent 
information are not correctly parsed or encoded which results in the client-side exploitation of the vulnerability.

The security risk of the cross site web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.4. 
Exploitation of the cross site scripting web vulnerability requires no privilege web application user account and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation results in client-side account theft by hijacking, client-side phishing, client-side external redirects and 
non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected service modules.

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers withour privilege application user account and with low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the link http://investor.fb.com/results.cfm?Quarter=2&Year=a
2. With tamper data in the request GET change the value of User-Agent to User-Agent[Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0<iframe src=x onload=alert('Xss_By_Samir')>
Note: To change the client details to a payload you can also use the firefox addon `user agent switcher`

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable client agent name value. 
Encode the input and parse the output to prevent further client-side script code injection attacks via GET method. 


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote cross site scripting web vulnerability in the investor web-application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.4)
