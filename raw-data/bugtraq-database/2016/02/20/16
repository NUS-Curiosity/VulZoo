Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official ifixit online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the affected modules context.

The vulnerability is located in the additional information input field of the `my profile > about me` web-application module. Remote attackers with low 
privileged web-application user accounts are able to inject own script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable modules context. The attack vector 
is located on the application-side and the request method to inject is POST.

The security risk of the filter bypass and persistent validation vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.6. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects to malicious source and persistent 
manipulation of affected or connected application modules.


Request Method(s):
