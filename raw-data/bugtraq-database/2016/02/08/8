CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS
======================
9th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN 2016)
20-22 July 2016, Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA, www.sinconf.org

In Technical Cooperation with ACM / SIGSAC (pending).
Proceedings by ACM Press; all papers will be inserted into the ACM Digital Library (pending).
-------------------------
In succession to the successful SIN 2007 - SIN 2015, the 9th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN 2016) will provide an international forum for presentation of research and applications of security in information and networks. SIN 2016 conference features contributed as well as invited papers, special sessions, workshops, and tutorials on theory and practice. 
The next SIN Conference is scheduled to take place in Australia (2017).

PROPOSALS 
==================
Papers, special sessions, tutorials, and workshops addressing all aspects of security in information and networks are being sought. Researchers and industrial practitioners working on the following and related subjects are especially encouraged: development and realization of cryptographic solutions, security schemes, new algorithms; critical analysis of existing approaches; secure information systems, especially distributed control and processing applications, and security in networks; interoperability, service levels and quality issues in such systems; information assurance, security, and public policy; detection and prevention of cybercrimes such as fraud and phishing; next generation network architectures, protocols, systems and applications; security education curriculum; industrial experiences and challenges of the above. Doctoral students are encouraged to propose papers on ongoing research.
Original papers will be considered; submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to any other conference or workshop that has proceedings. All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee judging its originality, significance, correctness, presentation and relevance. Authors are also encouraged to propose position papers on practical studies and experiments, critique of existing work, emerging issues, and novel ideas under development. 
Enterprises and research centers developing, implementing, or using security tools and frameworks are encouraged to propose application / tool demo. 
Proposals of half-day tutorials on fundamental to advanced subjects covering practical implementation aspects of security are welcome.

Proposals of special session(s) to be held in the main conference are welcome.
Proposals are invited for workshops to be held in conjunction with SIN 2016 Conference. The workshop proposal theme should be closely related to the conference topics. Broad areas of interest include theory, tools, and applications of security for information, computer, network, and cloud but are not limited to, the following:  
* Access control and intrusion detection
* Security of cyber-physical systems
* Autonomous and adaptive security
* Security tools and development platforms
* Computational intelligence techniques in security
* Security ontology, models, protocols & policies
* Computer network defense
* Standards, guidelines and certification
* Cryptographic techniques and key management
* Security-aware software engineering
* Trust and privacy
* Information assurance
* Malware analysis
* Network security and protocols
* Security in Mobile/Embedded Systems
* Cloud security
* Security education and innovative curriculum
