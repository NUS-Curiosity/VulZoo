High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Alsovalue Content Management System (2016-Q1).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The sql injection web vulnerability is located in the id value of the document name php files. The request method to inject is GET 
and the attack vector of the issue is located on the application-side. Remote attackers are able to inject own sql commands to 
compromise the web-application or connected database management system. The issue is a classic order-by sql injection vulnerability.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.7.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
