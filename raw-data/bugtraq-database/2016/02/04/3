Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch ICMP Record Route Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160203-n9knci

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 February 3 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the ICMP implementation in the Cisco Nexus 9000
Series Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode Switch could 
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the switch to 
reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of an ICMP packet with 
the IPv4 Type 7 option for record route. An attacker could exploit 
this vulnerability by sending an ICMP packet with the record route 
option to an interface on the affected switch. An exploit could allow 
the attacker to cause a DoS condition because the switch will reload 
each time the ICMP packet is received.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 
A workaround that addresses this vulnerability is available.
