Description

_User Submitted Posts_ plugin for WordPress suffers from a XSS
vulnerability. The `user-submitted-content` field of the new post
submission form is not properly sanitized, thus allowing users to
include JS code to submitted post content.

Normally only users with `unfiltered_html` capability are allowed to
include JS code to post content. By default Administrators or Super
Administrators have this capability, so this is considered as Persistent
XSS vulnerability.
