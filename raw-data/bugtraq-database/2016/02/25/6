Package        : gajim
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8688
Debian Bug     : 809900

Daniel Gultsch discovered in Gajim, an XMPP/jabber client. Gajim didn't
verify the origin of roster update, allowing an attacker to spoof them
and potentially allowing her to intercept messages.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.15.1-4.1+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16-1+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.16.5-0.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16.5-0.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gajim packages.
