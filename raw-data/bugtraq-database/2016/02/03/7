Affected Product(s):
====================
DPD - Digital Product Delivery
Product: DPD Online Service (Web-Application) 2015 Q3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Getdpd online service web-application.
The security vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own script code to the application-side of the affected application module.

The vulnerability is located in the input value id asm0option0 of the Button/Link creator module. Remote attackers with low privilege 
web-application user accounts are able to inject own malicious script code via POST method request. The injection point is the vulnerable 
id parameter with the title input and the execution point is located in storefront/productchooser?method=cart module. The request method 
to inject is POST and the vulnerability is located to the application-side of the vulnerable service.

The security risk of the application-side cross site vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.9. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a low privilege web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious source 
and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
						[+] POST

Vulnerable Service(s):
						[+] getdpd.com
						
Vulnerable Module(s):
						[+] Button/Link creator
						
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] storefront/productchooser?method=cart  (asm0option0)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The security vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privilege web-application user account and low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Create new product with payload code( injection code)
2. Click to creat Button/link creator  (https://getdpd.com/storefront/deploy)
3. Click Product Chooser (https://getdpd.com/storefront/productchooser?method=cart)
4. Product Chooser 
5. The payload code will execute!

<div class=``grid_8 omega``>
          <div class=``box-header info``>Product Chooser</div>
          <div class=``box info``>Add products to your chooser using the pulldown on the left. Once added to the display below, sort them as you like by dragging and dropping. Click on a button to use it. Click on it again to remove it.  When you don't use a button, selecting from your chooser will automatically send you to the cart (or buy now).  Once you have it the way you like, copy the code and paste it on your site.
