Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Car v3.00.30 content management system.
The vulnerability allows remote attacker to inject own malicious script codes on the client-side of the vulnerable module or service.

A client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the search engine. The web vulnerability could allow an attacker 
to execute javascript in the web-browser of the user or administrator to compromise session credentials. The attacker can connect 
to a third account to trigger the issue without knowing the password.

The security risk of the client-side vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.2. 
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires a low privileged account with restricted access and without user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in non-persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, non-persistent external 
redirect to malicious sources and client-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.
