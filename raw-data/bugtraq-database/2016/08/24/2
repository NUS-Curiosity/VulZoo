Subject: nullcon 8-bit Call for Papers is open

Dear Hackers and Security Pros,

Welcome to nullcon 8-bit!
nullcon is an annual security conference held in Goa, India. The focus
of the conference is to showcase the next generation of offensive and
defensive security technology. We happily open doors to researchers
and hackers around the world and the universe , working on the next
big thing in security and request everyone to submit their new
research.

What is 8-bit?
As a tradition of choosing themes based on year, nullcon 8th year's
theme is 8-bit.
If you love security, hacking, cutting edge research, Goa, trance,
then the universe will conspire to send you to nullcon :)
No, seriously its a lot of learning and fun! Time to tickle your gray
cells and submit your research.

Submission URL
=============

Tips for submitting
================

1) Submit early - Submitting early increases the chance of acceptance
in the first round of review itself. The more you delay the more
competition you have with other papers that are submitted later.
 2) Technical description - The more concrete technical details you
provide the better chance you have of getting accepted. Reviewers
usually give low score to submissions that have very small or vague
abstract and may not request for more details. The best way is to
provide a supporting full technical paper that explains all the
vulnerabilities, exploits etc in detail.
 3) Declining a paper - Please take rejection as a suggestion for
improvement somewhere in the paper and not as an offense. Declining a
paper does not mean your submission is not good. There are many
parameters we look at when reviewing a paper, technical in-depth is
only one of them. Many times we have to let go of really good talks
because there is already an accepted paper on similar subject or too
many good submissions. We want you to succeed and are only trying to
help you in preparing you for future submissions. So, cheer up and get
ready for the next submission.
4) Review comments - We do not ask our review board for comments.
5) Category - If the submission is (being) presented prior nullcon or
if it is an enhancement of an already presented research, please DO
NOT mark it as new research as it falls under current research.
