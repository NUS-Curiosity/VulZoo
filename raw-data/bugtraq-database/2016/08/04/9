Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Crafted Network Time Protocol Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160804-wedge

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 August 4 16:00  GMT

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the processing of Network Time Protocol (NTP) packets by Cisco IOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface wedge and an eventual denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient checks on clearing the invalid NTP packets from the interface queue. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted NTP packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an interface wedge and an eventual denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.

Cisco released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability; however, there is a mitigation for this vulnerability.
