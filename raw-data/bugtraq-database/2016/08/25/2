Business recommendation:
------------------------
During a quick security check SEC Consult found three vulnerabilities in the
Micro Focus GroupWise server applications.

As these partly critical vulnerabilities were identified during a short time
frame SEC Consult recommends to conduct a thorough technical security audit.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected cross site scripting in the administrator console (CVE-2016-5760)
Two reflected cross site scripting vulnerabilities have been identified in the
gwadmin-console application. An attacker could potentially take over an
administrator's session.

2) Persistent cross site scripting via emails (CVE-2016-5761)
By sending a single email to a victim an attacker could take over the victim's
email account. For a successful exploitation the victim has to click on a
link in an email opened in GroupWise WebAccess.

3) Heap-based Buffer Overflow / Integer Overflow (CVE-2016-5762)
By sending a crafted value for the username or the password to GroupWise
WebAccess or the GroupWise Post Office Agent during login an attacker can
overwrite heap memory. In order to exploit this vulnerability no user
authentication is required.
PLEASE NOTE: A successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an
attacker to execute code remotely. As SEC Consult only conducted a very quick
security check this has not been verified.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected cross site scripting in the administrator console
The following links demonstrate reflected cross site scripting vulnerabilities:

https://testhost:9710/gwadmin-console/install/login.jsp?token=asdf%22%2balert%28%27xss%27%29%2b%22
https://testhost:9710/gwadmin-console/index.jsp#poa:%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert%28%27xss%27%29%3E

2) Persistent cross site scripting via emails
The following Python fragment demonstrates the generation of a hyperlink that,
when embeded into an HTML email, would, upon clicking it, open a new mail dialog.

---- snip ----
msg = """
<a
href="javascript:top.opener.document.getElementById(String.fromCharCode($charcode)).firstChild.firstChild.click()"
target = _self>click me</a>
""".replace('$charcode', ','.join(str(ord(x)) for x in list('idNewPopupMenu')))
---- snip ----

3) Heap-based Buffer Overflow / Integer Overflow
When a username or password longer than 65332 (2^16 - 3) is specified, an
overflow causes the Post Office Agent to allocate too little memory.

The following pseudocode shows how the memory to be allocated is calculated
based on the input length.

((uint16_t) ((<length>) + 3) & 0xFFFC) + 1)

Therefore, a value of 65533 would cause the application to allocate 1 byte. By
modifying this value accordingly, an attacker can cause the application to
allocate an arbitrary amount of memory.

The user-specified value is then copied into this buffer until a NUL-byte is
reached. This allows an attacker to write non-NUL bytes after the allocated
heap chunk.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The version 2014 R2 SP1 of Micro Focus GroupWise was found to be
vulnerable. This version was the latest version at the time of the discovery.
