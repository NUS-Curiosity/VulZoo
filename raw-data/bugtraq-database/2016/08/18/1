Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance SNMP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160817-asa-snmp

Revision: 1.0

For Public Release: 2016 August 17 18:45 UTC (GMT)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) code of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code.

The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the affected code area. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SNMP packets to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system or to cause a reload of the affected system. The attacker must know the SNMP community string to exploit this vulnerability.

Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects systems configured in routed and transparent firewall mode only and in single or multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 traffic only.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.
