Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W Routers Static Credential Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160803-rv110_130w2

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 August 3 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the default account when used with a specific configuration of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and the Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain root access to the device. The account could incorrectly be granted root privileges at authentication time.
 
The vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) of the default account. The default account should never be allowed root privileges and should, in all cases, be read-only. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging into the targeted device using the default account. An exploit could allow the attacker to authenticate to the device using the default account and be assigned root privileges.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
