Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Microsoft Corporation
Product: Education - Online Service (Web-Application) 2016 Q3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A stored cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Microsoft Education online service web-application.
The Stored cross site vulnerability allows remote attacker to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the module.

The stored cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the `Default.aspx` file GET method request. During the exploitation the 
victim education account retrieves the malicious script to the server when it requests the stored database information. The attack vector 
of the issue is application-side and the request method to inject the payload is POST. The execution occurs in the default.aspx file 
context after the review of the about me page via GET method request. 

The security risk of the cross site web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.6. 
Exploitation of the input validation web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious 
source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.


Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] /Create-My-Account/

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] Default.aspx

Affected Module(s):
[+] About Me


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The stored xss vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.
