Package        : collectd
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-6254
Debian Bug     : 832507 832577

Emilien Gaspar discovered that collectd, a statistics collection and
monitoring daemon, incorrectly processed incoming network
packets. This resulted in a heap overflow, allowing a remote attacker
to either cause a DoS via application crash, or potentially execute
arbitrary code.

Additionally, security researchers at Columbia University and the
University of Virginia discovered that collectd failed to verify a
return value during initialization. This meant the daemon could
sometimes be started without the desired, secure settings.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.1-6+deb8u1.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 5.5.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your collectd packages.
