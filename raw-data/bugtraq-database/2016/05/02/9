Package        : botan1.10
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5726 CVE-2015-5727 CVE-2015-7827 CVE-2016-2194

Debian Bug     : 817932 822698

Several security vulnerabilities were found in botan1.10, a C++
library which provides support for many common cryptographic
operations, including encryption, authentication, X.509v3 certificates
and CRLs.

CVE-2015-5726
    The BER decoder would crash due to reading from offset 0 of an
    empty vector if it encountered a BIT STRING which did not contain
    any data at all. This can be used to easily crash applications
    reading untrusted ASN.1 data, but does not seem exploitable for
    code execution.

CVE-2015-5727
    The BER decoder would allocate a fairly arbitrary amount of memory
    in a length field, even if there was no chance the read request
    would succeed. This might cause the process to run out of memory or
    invoke the OOM killer.

CVE-2015-7827
    Use constant time PKCS #1 unpadding to avoid possible side channel
    attack against RSA decryption

CVE-2016-2194
    Infinite loop in modular square root algorithm.
    The ressol function implementing the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for
    finding square roots could be sent into a nearly infinite loop due
    to a misplaced conditional check. This could occur if a composite
    modulus is provided, as this algorithm is only defined for primes.
    This function is exposed to attacker controlled input via the
    OS2ECP function during ECC point decompression.

CVE-2016-2195
    Fix Heap overflow on invalid ECC point.

CVE-2016-2849
    Use constant time modular inverse algorithm to avoid possible
    side channel attack against ECDSA.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.10.8-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your botan1.10 packages.
