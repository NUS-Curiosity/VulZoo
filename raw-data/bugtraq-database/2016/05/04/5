Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance with FirePOWER Services Kernel Logging Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160504-fpkern

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 May 4 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the kernel logging configuration for Firepower System Software for the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5585-X FirePOWER Security Services Processor (SSP) module could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to high consumption of system resources. 

The vulnerability is due to the logging of certain IP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of specially crafted IP packets to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco FirePOWER module to cease inspecting traffic or go offline.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
