Trend Micro Direct Pass - Filter Bypass & Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

Trend Micro Security ID: 1-1-1039900197


Release Date:
=============
2016-05-01


Vulnerability Laboratory ID (VL-ID):
====================================
1716


Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
4.3


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
DirectPass runs as a local console and browser plug-in but can also sync between multiple PC installations through your Trend Micro account. 
Unlike LastPass 1.72 (free, 5 stars), Dashlane (free, 4.5 stars), and RoboForm Everywhere 7 ($19.95 direct, 4.5 stars), it doesn`t let you 
log in to your saved credentials online. However, it will sync with free DirectPass apps for Android and iPhone. You can also test a free 
edition that manages just five passwords.

DirectPass can export its data for import to another DirectPass installation. It can also import login data from LastPass. Hoping to get a 
fast start, I imported my 200+ LastPass logins. The results were disappointing. For starters, DirectPass doesn`t include the ability to 
categorize sites, so my passwords came through as an unordered list, a very long list. There`s no way to sort the list, and no provision to 
search for a particular login. For some reason, clicking in the list`s scroll bar doesn`t scroll down by one  `page` of items. Instead, it 
scrolls to the corresponding location in the list. Finding any particular login required tediously scrolling through the entire list.

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A filter bypass and cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the official Trend Micro DirectPass online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the filter restrictions of the web-application validation procedure mechanism.
The cross site vulnerability allows an attacker to inject own malicious script codes on the application-side of the vulnerable modules context.

There is a filter which filters special characters in the website, but it was bypassed through filter-evasion by a live session tamper for http.
The mechanism does approve the direct input but does not filter the request context itself. Thus allows an attacker to bypass the basic special char filter.
The cross site issue is inside the `(title) has been deleted` once you delete a password listed, replace (title) with a xss payload would execute 
the cross site scripting payload. 


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The filter bypass and cross site vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1.  Go to pwm.trendmicro.com
2.  Make sure you have the Trend Micro Password Manager (Direct Pass) extension installed
3.  Go to add a new password
4.  Open a proxy interpreting tool (livehttpheaders / tamper data / burpsuite)
5.  Insert a title and the rest of the information while interpreting/tampering the requests
6.  Then edit the POST request which is sent to localhost:49154 and has the information of the new password
7.  Now edit "DisplayName":"(your title)" to "DisplayName":"'><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>" (this will alert "XSS")
8.  Then edit "ID":"(id)" and add anything to it like "ID":"anything(id)"
9.  Now replay the request
10. Go back to pwm.trendmicro.com
11. Check your passwords and you will see that you were able to put invalid characters to the title! [Filter Bypass=done]
12. Now delete the password
13. The xss will alert with cookie! [XSS=done]
14. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the filter bypass issue and cross site scripting web vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 4.3)
