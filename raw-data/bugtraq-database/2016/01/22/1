Package        : fuse
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-1233

Jann Horn discovered a vulnerability in the fuse (Filesystem in
Userspace) package in Debian. The fuse package ships an udev rules
adjusting permissions on the related /dev/cuse character device, making
it world writable.

This permits a local, unprivileged attacker to create an
arbitrarily-named character device in /dev and modify the memory of any
process that opens it and performs an ioctl on it.

This in turn might allow a local, unprivileged attacker to escalate to
root privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), the fuse package is not affected.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.3-15+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.9.5-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your fuse packages.
