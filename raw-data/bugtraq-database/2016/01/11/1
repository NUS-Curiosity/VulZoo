Potential Security Impact: Remote Denial of Service (DoS)

Source: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Product Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
Potential security vulnerabilities have been identified with HP-UX Web Server
Suite running Apache on HP-UX 11iv3. These vulnerabilities could be exploited
remotely to create a Denial of Service (DoS) and other impacts including:

The TLS vulnerability using US export-grade 512-bit keys in Diffie-Hellman
key exchange known as "Logjam" could be exploited remotely to allow
unauthorized modification.
The RC4 stream cipher vulnerability in SSL/TLS known as "Bar Mitzvah" could
be exploited remotely to allow disclosure of information.
Apache does not properly parse chunk headers, which allows remote attackers
to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via a crafted request, related to
mishandling of large chunk-size values and invalid chunk-extension
characters.
