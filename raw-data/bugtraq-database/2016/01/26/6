Subject: Authentication bypass in PHP File Manager 0.9.8

PHP File Manager 0.9.8 (http://phpfm.sourceforge.net/) is vulnerable
to authentication bypass due to insecure implementation of register
globals emulation. An attacker is able to override the blockKeys array
and thus build a valid session and access all the protected
functionality (including execution of shell commands) without actual
knowledge of the password set.
