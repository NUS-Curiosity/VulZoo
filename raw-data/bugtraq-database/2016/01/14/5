Cisco Aironet 1800 Series Access Point Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160113-aironet

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 January 13 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the IP ingress packet handler of Cisco Aironet 1800 
Series Access Point devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote 
attacker to cause a complete denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of IP packet
headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
crafted IP packet to an affected device. An successful exploit could 
allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 
There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.
