Cisco RV220W Management Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160127-rv220

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 January 27 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV220W
Wireless Network Security Firewall devices could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain 
administrative privileges on a targeted device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of HTTP 
request headers that are sent to the web-based management interface 
of an affected device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit 
this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains 
malicious SQL statements to the management interface of a targeted
device. Depending on whether remote management is configured for the 
device, the management interface may use the SQL code in the HTTP 
request header to determine user privileges for the device. A 
successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication 
on the management interface and gain administrative privileges on the 
device.

Cisco released a firmware update that addresses this vulnerability. 
There are workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.
