Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official los818 Content Management System (2016-Q1).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The sql injection web vulnerability is located in the id value of the products-new.php, products-desc.php, products-asc.php & 
products.php files. The request method to inject is GET and the attack vector of the issue is located on the application-side. 
Remote attackers are able to inject own sql commands to compromise the web-application or connected database management system.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.6.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] products.php (products-new.php, products-desc.php, products-asc.php & products.php)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] id
				[+] sid


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account or user interaction.
