VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified in HP Integrated
Lights Out 2/3/4.

The TLS vulnerability using US export-grade 512-bit keys in Diffie-Hellman
key exchange known as "Logjam" could be exploited remotely to allow
unauthorized modification. Unlike the TLS server-side version of Logjam, this
vulnerability affects the client-side TLS connection on iLO, or when the iLO
acts as a client in a client-server connection.
