Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends not to use this product until a thorough security
review has been performed by security professionals and all identified
issues have been resolved.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Broken Local Admin Authentication in SolarEagle V2.00
Attackers which have access to the locally installed software are able to
bypass the administrative login and can control the MPPT Solar Controller.

2) Missing Server Side Authentication in MPPT Solar Controller SMART2
Attackers which have access to the local network can send their own commands
to the MPPT Solar Controller and are able to control the device this way.

3) Unencrypted Communication in MPPT Solar Controller SMART2
Eavesdropping the communication is possible since unencrypted TCP is used
for all packets which are transferred between the controller and SolarEagle.

4) Denial of Service in MPPT Solar Controller SMART2
Attackers are able to disrupt an active connection as long as they want.
