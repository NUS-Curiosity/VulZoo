Vulnerability Type: Insufficient Protection of Code (Firmware) and 
                    Data (Cryptographic Key)
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Open

CVE Reference: Not yet assigned
Authors of Advisory: Gerhard Klostermeier and Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000 is a wireless desktop set consisting of
a mouse and a keyboard.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"This keyboard features Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) technology, 
which is designed to help protect your information by encrypting your
keystrokes. Each keyboard is permanently paired with its receiver at 
the factory - no key information is ever shared over the air."

Due to the insufficient protection of the flash memory of the keyboard
and of the USB dongle, an attacker with physical access has read and
write access to the firmware and the used cryptographic key.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The SySS GmbH found out that the embedded flash memory of the wireless
keyboard Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000  and of the corresponding USB
dongle can be read and written via the SPI interface of the used
transceivers with an embedded microcontroller nRF24LE1H (keyboard) and
nRF24LU1+ (USB dongle) as the flash memory is not protected by the
offered read back protection feature (RDISMB - Read DISable Main Block).

Thus, an attacker with physical access to the keyboard or the USB
dongle can simply read and write the SPI-addressable code and data
flash memory. Due to the use of nRF24 transceiver versions with one-time
programmable memory, write access is limited in such a way that a set
1 bit can be changed to a 0 bit but not vice versa.

The AES cryptographic key used by the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000
keyboard and the corresponding USB dongle is for both devices accessible
via the SPI interface. 

By having read and write access to the code and data flash memory, an
attacker can either extract the cryptographic key, for instance to
perform further attacks against the wireless communication, or modify
the firmware or the cryptographic key in a limited way due to the
used one-time programmable memory.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH could successfully read the contents of the code and data
flash memory of the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000 keyboard and of the
USB dongle using the hardware tool Bus Pirate [3] in combination with
the software tool nrfprog [4].
