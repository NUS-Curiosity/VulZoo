Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco NX-OS Software-Based Products Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Bypass Vulnerability

Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20161005-nxaaa

Revision: 1.0

For Public Release: 2016 October 5 16:00  GMT

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======
A vulnerability in the SSH subsystem of the Cisco Nexus family of products could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) restrictions.

The vulnerability is due to the improper processing of certain parameters that are passed to an affected device during the negotiation of an SSH connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and passing a malicious value as part of the login procedure. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass AAA restrictions and execute commands on the device command-line interface (CLI) that should be restricted to a different privileged user role.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
