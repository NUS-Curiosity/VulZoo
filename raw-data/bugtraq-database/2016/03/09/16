This vulnerability demonstrates Microsoft's terrible SLOPPY coding
horror^Wpractice: it needs two mistakes to create this kind of bug!

"%CommonProgramFiles%\System\wab32res.dll" is (as its name implies)
a resource DLL, which means that it contains no code, but only
(localized) resources, and SHOULD (better: MUST) be loaded via
    LoadLibraryEx("%CommonProgramFiles%\System\wab32res.dll", NULL, LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE)
to avoid the call of its DllMain() startup code!
See <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684179.aspx>

JFTR: LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE was introduced in the last millennium!

Either
    LoadLibrary("%CommonProgramFiles%\System\wab32res.dll")
or
    LoadLibraryEx("wab32res.dll", NULL, LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE)
were sufficient to avoid this vulnerability.

Have you checked how Microsoft fixed it?
Did they exercise all due diligence now, practised defense in depth
and replaced the call to
    LoadLibrary("wab32res.dll")
with a call to
    LoadLibraryEx("%CommonProgramFiles%\System\wab32res.dll", NULL, LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE)?
