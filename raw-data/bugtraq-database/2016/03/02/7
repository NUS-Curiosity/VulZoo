Cisco Nexus 3000 Series and 3500 Platform Switches Insecure Default Credentials Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160302-n3k

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 March 02 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS Software running on Cisco Nexus 3000
Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 3500 Platform Switches could allow 
an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the device with the 
privileges of the root user with bash shell access.
 
The vulnerability is due to a user account that has a default and 
static password. This account is created at installation and cannot 
be changed or deleted without impacting the functionality of the 
system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting 
to the affected system using this default account. The account can 
be used to authenticate remotely to the device via Telnet (or SSH 
on a specific release) and locally on the serial console.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 
Workarounds that address this vulnerability are available.
