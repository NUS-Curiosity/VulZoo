Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libebml, a library for
manipulating Extensible Binary Meta Language files.

    Context-dependent attackers could trigger a use-after-free
    vulnerability by providing a maliciously crafted EBML document.

    Context-dependent attackers could obtain sensitive information
    from the process' heap memory by using a maliciously crafted UTF-8
    string.

CVE-2015-8791

    Context-dependent attackers could obtain sensitive information
    from the process' heap memory by using a maliciously crafted
    length value in an EBML id.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.2-2+deb7u1.
