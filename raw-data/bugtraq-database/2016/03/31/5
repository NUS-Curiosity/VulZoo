High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the
Patron Info System web-application (2016 Q1).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to
compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The vulnerabilities are located in the
`menu_id`,`id`,`ads_id`,`gallary_category_id`,`mmenu`,`news`,`boxes_id`,`branch_id`,
`news_events_id` and `id` values of the
`page_details.php`,`gallery.php`,`view_ads_desc.php`,`eventsdesc.php`,`page_details.php`,
`news.php`,`boxes_details.php`,`centre_details.php`,`gallerydetails.php`
or `news_desc.php` files. Remote attackers are able to
execute sql commands by injection of malicious statements via GET method
request. The vulnerability is located on the application-
side and the request method to inject/execute is GET. The security
vulnerability is a classic order by sql injection in the `id` value.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as
high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.6.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no
user interaction or privileged web-application user accounts.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database
management system, web-server and web-application compromise.
