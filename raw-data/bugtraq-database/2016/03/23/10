Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Locator/ID Separation Protocol Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160323-lisp

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 March 23 16:00  GMT

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) of Cisco IOS Software running on the Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 6800 Series Switches and Cisco NX-OS Software running on the Cisco Nexus 7000 and Nexus 7700 Series Switches with an M1 Series Gigabit Ethernet Module could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the vulnerable device.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation when a malformed LISP packet header is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed LISP packet on UDP port 4341. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
