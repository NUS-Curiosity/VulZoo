~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The innovaphone IP222 and IP232 are IP telephones with many features.

The manufacturer innovaphone describes the products as follows (see [1], 
[2]):

"The IP222 telephone unites a very modern design with groundbreaking
technological details. It belongs to the innovaphone product family that
won the popular "red dot award: product design".

(...)

The innovaphone IP232 IP phone unites a very modern design with 
groundbreaking technological details. It belongs to the innovaphone 
design telephone product range that won the coveted "red dot award: 
product design"."

Due to a vulnerability in the H.323 network service on the TCP port
1720, the telephone can be restarted in an unauthorized manner by
an attacker causing a denial-of-service condition.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

A not further analyzed vulnerability in the H.323 network service on the
TCP port 1720 of the IP telephone IP222 can be exploited by an attacker on
the same network to reboot the telephone in an unauthorized way.

This vulnerability can be used for denial-of-service attacks against the
IP222 telephone at arbitrary states, for example during a call.

If the IP222 telephone is configured in such a way that its users are
not automatically logged in after a reboot, the impact of this
denial-of-service attack is even bigger as user interaction is required
to restore the IP telephone to the previous working state.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The IP telephone IP222 can be rebooted in an unauthorized way by sending
random data to its H.323 network service on the TCP port 1720, for
example by using the following command:

$ cat /dev/urandom | nc <IP ADDRESS> 1720

Before rebooting, the CPU register state is shown on the telephone's
display (white text on red background).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

According to test results of the SySS GmbH with a newer firmware
version 11r2 sr9, the reported security issue was fixed by the
manufacturer.

Please contact the manufacturer for further information or support.
