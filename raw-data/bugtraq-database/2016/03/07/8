Subject: Re: Apple iOS v9.2.1 - Multiple PassCode Bypass Vulnerabilities (App Store Link, Buy Tones Link & Weather Channel Link)

This is not reproducible.  I tried it on several iPhones.  I believe the user in the video is unlocking the phone via touch ID, hence “bypassing” the lock screen.  In my tests, Siri responds with “You must unlock your iPhone first”.
