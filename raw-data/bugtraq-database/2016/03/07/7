In the Video you can see that he unlock the Phone with his forefinger.

1)In 2:14 mins he show the Lockscreen.
2)Then he Unlock his Screen with his forefinger in 2:17.
3)For the "Exploit" he start Siri in the Lockscreen(2:23) with his !!Forefinger!! At this Time he unlock the Screen with his finger. So he can  use the AppStore and other stuff.


Therefore there is no bug or exploit.
