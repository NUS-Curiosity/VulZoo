*** Preamble ***
Cute Editor for ASP.NET is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL to execute a script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials for example.


*** PoC ***
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in "Template.aspx" in CuteSoft Cute Editor allows remote unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the "Referrer" parameter.

https://localhost/CuteSoft_Client/CuteEditor/Template.aspx?Referrer=XSS"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>
