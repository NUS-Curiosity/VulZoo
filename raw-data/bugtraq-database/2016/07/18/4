Package        : mysql-connector-java
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-2575

A vulnerability was discovered in mysql-connector-java, a Java database
(JDBC) driver for MySQL, which may result in unauthorized update, insert
or delete access to some MySQL Connectors accessible data as well as
read access to a subset of MySQL Connectors accessible data. The
vulnerability was addressed by upgrading mysql-connector-java to the new
upstream version 5.1.39, which includes additional changes, such as bug
fixes, new features, and possibly incompatible changes. Please see the
MySQL Connector/J Release Notes and Oracle's Critical Patch Update
advisory for further details:

 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuapr2015-2365600.html#AppendixMSQL

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.39-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-connector-java packages.
