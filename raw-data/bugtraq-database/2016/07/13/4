Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS XR for NCS 6000 Packet Timer Leak Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160713-ncs6k

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2016 July 13 16:00 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the management of system timer resources in Cisco IOS XR for Cisco Network Convergence System 6000 (NCS 6000) Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a leak of system timer resources, leading to a nonoperational state and an eventual reload of the Route Processor (RP) on the affected platform.

The vulnerability is due to improper management of system timer resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), and Secure FTP (SFTP) management connections to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a leak of system timer resources, leading to a nonoperational state and an eventual reload of the RP on the affected platform.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.
