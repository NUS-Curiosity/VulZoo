Subject: [CVE-2016-5000] XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability in Apache
 POI's XLSX2CSV Example

CVE-2016-5000: XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability in Apache POI's XLSX2CSV Example 

Severity: Important 

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation 

Versions Affected: POI 3.5-3.13 

Description: 

Apache POI's XLSX2CSV example uses Java's XML components to parse OpenXML files. Applications and users that use XLSX2CSV and accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which allow remote attackers to bypass security restrictions and read arbitrary files via a crafted OpenXML document that provides an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference.

Mitigation: Upgrade to 3.14 or higher
