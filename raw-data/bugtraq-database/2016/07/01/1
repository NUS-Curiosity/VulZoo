CA20160627-01: Security Notice for Release Automation

Issued: June 27, 2016
Last Updated: June 27, 2016

CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to multiple potential risks
with CA Release Automation. Three vulnerabilities exist that can allow a
remote attacker to potentially gain sensitive information or cause a
denial of service condition. CA has fixes available.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2015-7370, occurs due to the inclusion of a
vulnerable 3rd party component, Open Flash Chart. A remote attacker
can conduct cross-site scripting attacks. CA technologies assigned a
Medium risk rating to this vulnerability.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2015-8698, occurs due to insufficient
verification of requests to the web server, which can lead to limited XML
external entity attacks. An authenticated attacker in the local network
can potentially gain sensitive information or cause a denial of service
condition. CA technologies assigned a Medium risk rating to this
vulnerability.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2015-8699, occurs due to insufficient
verification of requests to the web interface, which leads to multiple
reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and one stored cross-site
scripting vulnerability. CA technologies assigned a Medium risk rating to
these vulnerabilities.
