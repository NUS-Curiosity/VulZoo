Deserialisation resulting in remote code execution caused by
insufficient restriction on permitted deserialised classes
(CVE-2016-5229)
Severity:
Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical,
according to the scale published in our Atlassian severity levels. The
scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or
low.
This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its
applicability to your own IT environment.


Description:

Bamboo had a resource that deserialised input from build agents and
did not sufficiently restrict which classes could be deserialised. To
exploit this issue, attackers need to have a valid Bamboo agent
fingerprint or be able to run code on a Bamboo agent.

All versions of Bamboo from 2.3.1 before 5.11.4.1 (the fixed version
for 5.11.x) and from 5.12.0 before 5.12.3.1 (the fixed version for
5.12.x) are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked
here: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-17736


Mitigation:

This issue can be mitigated in Bamboo version 5.10.0 and higher by
setting the XStream Serialization setting to "whitelist" which prior
to the fix versions detailed in this advisory was not the default. See
the Serialization protection methods page
(https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/gJOzLw) for information on
serialization settings.


Fix:

We have taken the follow steps to address this issue:
* Released Bamboo version 5.12.3.1 that contains fixes for this issue.
* Released Bamboo version 5.11.4.1 that contains fixes for this issue.


Remediation:
Upgrade Bamboo to version 5.12.3.1 or higher.

If you are running Bamboo 5.11.x and cannot upgrade to bamboo 5.12.3.1
then upgrade to version 5.11.4.1.


If you are running Bamboo 5.10.x or higher and cannot upgrade to
5.11.4.1 or 5.12.3.1 then you can follow following steps to mitigate
the issue:
1. Log in to Bamboo as an administrator and go to Bamboo
administration > Security > Security settings which is found at
/admin/configureSecurity.action for your Bamboo instance, for example
http://bamboo-host/bamboo/admin/configureSecurity.action
2. Under the Serialization protection methods section, set the XStream
setting to Whitelist.
3. Click Save.
4. Check that XStream is set to Whitelist after reloading the Security
Settings page.

See the Serialization protection methods page
(https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/gJOzLw) for information on
serialization settings.
