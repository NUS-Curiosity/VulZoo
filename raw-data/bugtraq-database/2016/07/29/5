~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

PERIDUO-710W is a wireless desktop set consisting of a mouse and a
keyboard.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"PERIDUO can create flexible, convenient and wireless working
environment with its design. PERIDUO offers a reliable 2.4GHz high
frequency penetration, low interference, and omni-directional signal
transmissions with 10Meters meters [sic] receiving distance." 

Due to an insecure implementation of the encrypted data communication,
the wireless keyboard PERIDUO-710W is prone to replay attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The SySS GmbH found out that the wireless keyboard PERIDUO-710W is prone
to replay attacks.

An attacker can sniff the AES-encrypted data packets of the 2.4 GHz
radio communication sent by the keyboard to the transceiver (USB dongle)
and replay the recorded communication data at will causing the same
effect as the original data communication.

A replay attack against the keyboard can, for example, be used to gain
unauthorized access to a computer system that is operated with a
vulnerable PERIDUO-710W keyboard. In this attack scenario, an attacker
records the radio communication during a password-based user
authentication of his or her victim, for instance during a login to the
operating system or during unlocking a screen lock. At an opportune
moment when the victim's computer system is unattended, the attacker
approaches the victim's computer and replays the previously recorded
AES-encrypted data communication for the password-based user
authentication and thereby gets unauthorized access to the victim's
system.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH could successfully perform a replay attack as described
in the previous section using the USB radio dongle Crazyradio PA (see
[3]) and an in-house developed proof-of-concept software tool.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

The SySS GmbH is not aware of a solution for this reported security
vulnerability.
