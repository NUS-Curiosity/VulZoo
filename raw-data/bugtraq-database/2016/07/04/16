An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered a full path disclosure vulnerability in the OpenDocMan v1.3.5 application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-07-04:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
OpenDocMan DMS
Product: OpenDocMan - CMS (Web-Application) 1.3.5


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A full path disclosure vulnerability has been discovered in the official OpenDocMan v1.3.5 web-application.

An attacker can insert a Array to display a disclosure path, this flaw displays the full path to the vulnerable 
script while indicating the type of vulnerability: Warning: htmlentities ()

However if used in addition to other attacks such as SQL injections or Local File iclusion, it becomes critical.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
