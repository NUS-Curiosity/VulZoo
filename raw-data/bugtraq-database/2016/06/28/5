Alfine IT Solutions Ltd
Product: Alfine CMS - Online Service (Web-Application) 2.6


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:

High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An auth bypass web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Alfine v2.6 Content Management System.
The web vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the basic login protection of the web-application.

The auth bypass web vulnerability is located in the username and password input fields of the admin index.php login file.
Remote attackers are able to inject a classic sql payload to bypass the secure login authentication process.

The security risk of the auth bypass vulnerability is estimated as critical with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.1.
Exploitation of the remote auth bypass web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user accounts.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] ./admin (Login)

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] index.php

Vulnerable Input(s):
				[+] Username
				[+] Password


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The auth bypass vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Vulnerable File: 	index.php
Login: 			admin/index.php
URL: 			http://localhost:7516/admin/index.php


PoC: (Inputs)
