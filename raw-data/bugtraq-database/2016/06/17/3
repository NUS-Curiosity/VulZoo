Subject: [FD] Multiple vulnerabilities in squid 0.4.16_2 running on pfSense

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

I. VULNERABILITY
- -------------------------
Multiple vulnerabilities in squid 0.4.16_2 running on pfSense
Version 2.3.1-RELEASE-p1

II. BACKGROUND
- -------------------------
The pfSense project is a free network firewall distribution, based on the
FreeBSD operating system, with a custom kernel and an array of third-party
free software packages that can be installed for additional functionality.
Through this package system pfSense software is able to provide most of
the functionality of common commercial firewalls, and many times more.

III. DESCRIPTION
- -------------------------
In pfSense, it is possible to configure a third-party package, Squid, to
act as a transparent HTTP proxy. This package uses clamd as an AV
solution.

If clamd detects a piece of malware in one of the proxied requests, the
request is blocked and the user is redirected to the following URL
instead:

https://10.10.10.1/squid_clwarn.php?url=http://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com&source=10.10.10.100&user=-&virus=stream:%20Eicar-TestSignature%20FOUND

Upon inspection of the source code of the Squid package, the file
"squid_clwarn.php" appears to contain several vulnerabilities.
At the start of the file we see that various HTTP GET parameters are
loaded into local variables through the $_REQUEST superglobal:

==========================================================================
$url = $_REQUEST['url'];
$virus = ($_REQUEST['virus'] ? $_REQUEST['virus'] : $_REQUEST['malware']);
$source = preg_replace("@/-@", "", $_REQUEST['source']);
$user = $_REQUEST['user'];
==========================================================================

These variables are later rendered directly into HTML output, without any
form of escaping, thus resulting in a reflected XSS vulnerability.

Proof of Concept:
https://10.10.10.1/squid_clwarn.php?url=xyz&source=xyz&user=&virus=stream:<script>alert('xss')</script>

The information sent in this HTTP GET request is also saved to a log file:
==========================================================================
error_log(date("Y-m-d H:i:s") . " | VIRUS FOUND | " . $virus . " | " .
$url . " | " . $source . " | " . $user . "\n", 3,
"/var/log/c-icap/virus.log");
==========================================================================

An administrator who looks at the logs through the pfSense web-GUI, at
"squid-monitor.php", will be open to a stored XSS vulnerability, because
the variables are rendered directly into HTML output, without proper
escaping:

Finally, there is no authentication present in the "squid_clwarn.php"
file, resulting in possible log manipulation attacks. For example,
requesting the following URL will result in an empty log entry being
added.

Proof of Concept:
https://10.10.10.1/squid_clwarn.php?url=%0A|||||

IV. BUSINESS IMPACT
- -------------------------
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a targeted
user's browser, as well as any administrators viewing the log files
through the pfSense web-GUI.

V. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
- -------------------------
Tested on:
2.3.1-RELEASE-p1 (amd64)
built on Wed May 25 14:53:06 CDT 2016
FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE-p3
