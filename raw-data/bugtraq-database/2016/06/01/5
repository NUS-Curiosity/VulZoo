Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Prime Network Analysis Module Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20160601-prime

Version 1.0:  Final

For public release:  2016 June 1 16:00  GMT

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Network Analysis Modules could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected device with the privileges of the web server.

The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize user input prior to executing an external command derived from the input. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code on the underlying operating system with the reduced privileges of the web server.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 

Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
