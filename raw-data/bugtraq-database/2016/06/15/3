VMware Security Advisory

Advisory ID: VMSA-2016-0009
Synopsis:    VMware vCenter Server updates address an important
             reflective cross-site scripting issue
Issue date:  2016-06-14
Updated on:  2016-06-14 (Initial Advisory)
CVE number:  CVE-2015-6931
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware vCenter Server updates address an important reflective
   cross-site scripting issue.

2. Relevant Releases

   vCenter Server 5.5 prior to 5.5 update 2d
   vCenter Server 5.1 prior to 5.1 update 3d
   vCenter Server 5.0 prior to 5.0 update 3g


3. Problem Description

   a. Important vCenter Server reflected cross-site scripting issue

   The vSphere Web Client contains a reflected cross-site scripting
   vulnerability due to a lack of input sanitization. An attacker can
   exploit this issue by tricking a victim into clicking a malicious
   link.

   VMware would like to thank Matt Schmidt for reporting this issue to
   us.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
   assigned the identifier CVE-2015-6931 to this issue.

   Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
   remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
   available.

   VMware             Product    Running   Replace with/
   Product            Version    on        Apply Patch
   ==============     =======    =======   =============
   vCenter Server     6.0        Any       not affected
   vCenter Server     5.5        Any       5.5 U2d *
   vCenter Server     5.1        Any       5.1 U3d *
   vCenter Server     5.0        Any       5.0 U3g *

   * The client side component of the vSphere Web Client does not need
     to be updated to remediate CVE-2015-6931. Updating the vCenter
     Server is sufficient to remediate this issue.


4. Solution

   Please review the patch/release notes for your product and
   version and verify the checksum of your downloaded file.
