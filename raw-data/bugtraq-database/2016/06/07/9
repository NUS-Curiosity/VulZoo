Package        : expat
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-6702 CVE-2016-5300

Two related issues have been discovered in Expat, a C library for parsing
XML.

CVE-2012-6702

    It was introduced when CVE-2012-0876 was addressed. Stefan SÃ¸rensen
    discovered that the use of the function XML_Parse() seeds the random
    number generator generating repeated outputs for rand() calls.

CVE-2016-5300

      It is the product of an incomplete solution for CVE-2012-0876. The
      parser poorly seeds the random number generator allowing an
      attacker to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML
      file with crafted identifiers.

You might need to manually restart programs and services using expat
libraries.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-6+deb8u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.1-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.
