CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4547
Debian Bug     : 730012

Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team discovered a bug in nginx,
a web server, which might allow an attacker to bypass security
restrictions by using a specially crafted request.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-2.2+wheezy2.

version 1.4.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.
