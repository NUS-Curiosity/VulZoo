Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
7.2


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
AirBeam turns your iPhones, iPods or iPads into a realtime audio and video surveillance system. AirBeam streams 
live video and audio from the cameras and microphones of any number of iPhones, iPods or iPads. You can watch 
the stream on any other iDevice, Mac or Web browser - even on multiple screens simultaneously.

Use your iDevices as luxury babyphones, for serious surveillance, to keep an eye on your pets, a FPV cam in your 
remote control toys…there are hundreds of useful and not so useful things you can do with it. Even if you have 
just a single device AirBeam is an awesome tool for motion controlled video recording.

Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple web vulnerabilities in the Appoligics UG AirBeam v1.9.2 iOS mobile application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2013-11-20:    Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Apple AppStore
Product: AirBeam iOS - Appologics UG 1.9.2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.0
A command/path inject web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Appoligics UG AirBeam v1.9.2 iOS mobile application.
The command/path inject vulnerability allows local attackers to unauthorized inject system commands or path requests to compromise 
the mobile web-application or UI online-service.

The local command/path inject web vulnerability is located in the name value of the iOS device. Local attackers with physical 
device access and restricted user accounts can inject local path requests or execute system specific commands. After the inject 
of the command or path request the code execute occurs in the tab header location with the listed device name on top. The security 
risk of the local command/path inject web vulnerability in the device name is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability 
scoring system) count of 5.2(+)|(-)5.3

Exploitation of the web vulnerability requires a local privileged iOS device account with restricted access and no user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results unauthorized execute of system specific commands and path/file requests.


Vulnerable Service(s):
				[+] Appoligics UG - AirBeam v1.9.2 (iOS)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] device name

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] name

Affected Device(s):
				[+] iPad
				[+] iPhone


2.0
A client-side cross site vulnerability has been discovered in the official Appoligics UG AirBeam v1.9.2 iOS mobile application.
A xss web vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate via GET method inject web-application to browser requests (client-side).

The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the vulnerable name value of the delete function. Remote attackers 
are able to inject own script codes by manipulation of the GET method request to execute the malicious content on the client-side of 
a victims web-browser. The security risk of the non-persistent web vulnerability in the delete function is estimated as medium with a 
cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 2.0(+)|(-)2.1.

Exploitation of the client-side cross site vulnerability requires no privileged web application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerabilities results in session hijacking, client-side phishing, client-side 
unauthorized/open (external) redirects and client-side manipulation of the dhtml editor module context.

                	<div class="recording_controls">
                		<a class="button" href="/delete?name=">View</a>
                		<a class="button" href="/delete?name=">Delete</a>
                	</div>
            	</div>


Note: The script code execute after the inject occurs in the device name on top of the application header.

2.0
The client-side input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account and 
low user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information below.

PoC: Client-Side XSS
http://airbeam.localhost/delete?name=[CLIENT-SIDE CROSS SITE SCRIPTING VULNERABILITY!]


Proof of Concept: delete?name - (view & delete)

       <div class="recording_controls">
                <a class="button" href="/delete?name=[CLIENT-SIDE CROSS SITE SCRIPTING VULNERABILITY!]">View</a>
                <a class="button" href="/delete?name=[CLIENT-SIDE CROSS SITE SCRIPTING VULNERABILITY!]">Delete</a>
       </div>


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1.0
The local command/path inject web vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse of the device-name value on top of the application.

2.0
The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability can be patched by a secure encode of the vulnerable name value in the delete function.


Security Risk:
==============
1.0
The security risk of the local command/path inject web vulnerability via device-name is estimated as high.

2.0
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability in the delete file name value is estimated as medium.
