Public release date: Nov 11, 2013

TITLE

Authenticated code injection vulnerability in ZoneDirector
administrative web interface


SUMMARY

A vulnerability has been discovered in ZoneDirector controllers (ZD)
which may allow an attacker to inject malicious code via controller's
admin web interface. The attacker needs access to an authenticated
admin session with ZD's web interface for carrying out this attack.


AFFECTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS AND DEVICES


    Device                        Affected software
- --------------------------        ------------------
ZoneDirector Controllers         9.3.x, 9.4.x, 9.5.x, 9.6.x


Any products not mentioned in the table above are not affected


DETAILS

A weakness has been discovered in the administrative web interface of
the ZoneDirector controller devices. An attacker may abuse an
authenticated admin session with ZD's web interface for injecting
malicious code via controller's admin web interface. The pre-requisite
of this attack is that attacker has access to an authenticated admin
session with ZD's web interface. This issue does not affect any other
Ruckus devices besides ZoneDirector controllers.        


IMPACT

An attacker may inject authenticated malicious code via the
administrative web interface of the ZoneDirector controller device.

CVSS v2 BASE METRIC SCORE: 7.9 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:N)

   
WORKAROUNDS

Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch(es)
as soon as practical for mitigating this attack.  However, in the
event that a patch cannot immediately be applied, the following
suggestions might help reduce the risk:

- - - Only launch admin web sessions from trusted hosts with no
connectivity to untrusted networks such as the Internet while the
session is active.

 - Do not expose management interfaces of Ruckus devices (including
administrative web interface) to untrusted networks such as the Internet.

 - Use a firewall to limit traffic to/from ZoneDirector's
administrative web interface to trusted hosts.



SOLUTION

Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch(es)
as soon as practical.

The following patches have the fix (any later patches will also have
the fix):


Branch        Software Patch
- - ------        ------------------
9.3.x        9.3.4.0.21
9.4.x        9.4.3.0.22
9.5.x        9.5.2.0.15
9.6.x        9.6.1.0.15
