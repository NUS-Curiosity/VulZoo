RUCKUS ADVISORY ID 111113-2

Customer release date: Sep 9, 2013
Public release date: Nov 11, 2013

TITLE

Authenticated persistent cross site scripting vulnerability in guest
pass provisioning web interface on ZoneDirector controllers


SUMMARY

A persistent cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
guest pass provisioning web interface on ZoneDirector controllers
(ZD). For launching this attack, the attacker needs access to an
authenticated user session with privileges for guest pass generation.


AFFECTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS AND DEVICES


    Device                        Affected software
- --------------------------        ------------------
ZoneDirector Controllers         9.3.x, 9.4.x, 9.5.x, 9.6.x


Any products not mentioned in the table above are not affected


DETAILS

A  persistent cross site scripting weakness has been discovered in the
guest pass provisioning web interface of the ZoneDirector controller
devices. An attacker with access to an authenticated user session with
privileges for guest pass generation may cause certain malicious
javascript code to execute in the user's browser with privileges of
the user or the admin.

The pre-requisite of this attack is that attacker has access to an
authenticated user session with privileges for guest pass generation
on the ZD. This issue does not affect any other Ruckus devices besides
ZoneDirector controllers.

IMPACT

An attacker with access to an authenticated user session with
privileges for guest pass generation may cause certain malicious
javascript code to execute in the user's browser with privileges of
the user or the admin.

CVSS v2 BASE METRIC SCORE: 4.9 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N)


WORKAROUNDS

Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch(es)
as soon as practical for mitigating this attack.  However, in the
event that a patch cannot immediately be applied, the following
suggestions might help reduce the risk:

- - - Only launch web sessions to ZD's guest pass provisioning interface
from trusted hosts with no connectivity to untrusted networks such as
the Internet while the session is active.

 - Do not expose ZD's guest pass provisioning interface to untrusted
networks such as the Internet.

 - Use a firewall to limit traffic to/from ZoneDirector's guest pass
provisioning web interface to trusted hosts.


SOLUTION

Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch(es)
as soon as practical.

The following patches have the fix (any later patches will also have
the fix):


Branch        Software Patch
- - ------        ------------------
9.3.x        9.3.4.0.21
9.4.x        9.4.3.0.22
9.5.x        9.5.2.0.15
9.6.x        9.6.1.0.15
