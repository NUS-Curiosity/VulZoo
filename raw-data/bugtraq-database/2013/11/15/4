Kevin,

Considering ChainsDD Superuser you mentioned.
Unfortunately, your mail describes just potential attack vectors. While 
I can't say for sure, Superuser isn't vulnerable at all, I'd like to 
note that su invokes the am script in the process with the credentials 
of the caller, not root. Thus, by manipulating the environment 
variables, file descriptors, signals, etc, the user can get yet another 
process with the same credentials, perhaps, with a shell or with an 
instance of Davlik VM inside.

Regards,
Gleb.
