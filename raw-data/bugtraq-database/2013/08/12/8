Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] Apache suEXEC privilege elevation / information disclosure

I have been a silent spectator to this drama, and could not resist adding a few thoughts of my own:

1. All software, especially webservers, should ship with secure defaults. Period. It is a fundamental mistake to assume all admins who roll out web apps and maintain servers RTFM before rolling out. The key idea here is "time to market", and there is huge amount of data to prove this.

2. Apache clearly does not ship with secure defaults in favor of convenience? disable_functions is a  example - do you expect an admin to be a unix expert or know what each parameter in there means? Also indicates this was added in reactively, and not accounted for in the core design. Why not enable_functions instead, with everything disabled to begin with? (Oh, that wouldn't help you achieve world dominance and fast!)

3. Secure by design, implementation, and deployment isn't utopia, it's very much an achievable target. But then it wouldn't feed bugtraq anymore or the billion dollar industry called as "security industry" would it?

Huge amount of software today is turd polishing, open source no exception (though it is supposed to have better track record). The blame lies squarely on everyone.
