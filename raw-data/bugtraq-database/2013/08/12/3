Because developers write functions like "system", "symlink" and "suexec"
which can create havoc (and are WELL-KNOWN for creating havoc since
years) and allow everybody to call them in the default configuration of
their software.

It was the developer who created and published this vulnerable software
or the vulnerable default configuration in the first place.

If a user/administrator who installs software has to turn insecure
features OFF its the developer who is to blame, and of course the
testers, the QA and the management too.
