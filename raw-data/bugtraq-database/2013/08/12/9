Package        : swift
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2161 CVE-2013-4155

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Swift, the Openstack
object storage. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-2161

    Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in XML
    handling within Swift account servers. Account strings were
    unescaped in xml listings, and an attacker could potentially
    generate unparsable or arbitrary XML responses which may be
    used to leverage other vulnerabilities in the calling software.

CVE-2013-4155

    Peter Portante from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Swift.
    By issuing requests with an old X-Timestamp value, an
    authenticated attacker can fill an object server with superfluous
    object tombstones, which may significantly slow down subsequent
    requests to that object server, facilitating a Denial of Service
    attack against Swift clusters.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version $squeeze_VERSION.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.8-2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your swift packages.
