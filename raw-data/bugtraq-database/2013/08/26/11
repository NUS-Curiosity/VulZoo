Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : interpretation conflict
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4248
Debian Bug     : 719765

It was discovered that PHP, a general-purpose scripting language
commonly used for web application development, did not properly
process embedded NUL characters in the subjectAltName extension of
X.509 certificates.  Depending on the application and with
insufficient CA-level checks, this could be abused for impersonating
other users.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze17.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.5.3+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
