Cognitive Bias and Dissonance are well known problems in security
engineering. NB's comments are a testament to the disconnect between
the creators of the system and the users of the system. (No offense to
NB).

See, for example, Peter Gutmann's Engineering Security
(www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/book.pdfâ€Ž) or Ross Anderson's
Security Engineering (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html).
