Subject: Update: Linksys EA2700, EA3500, E4200v2, EA4500 Unspecified
 unauthenticated remote access

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vulnerabilities:
An unspecified bug can cause an unsafe/undocumented TCP port to open
allowing for:

- Unauthenticated remote access to all pages of the router
administration GUI, bypassing any credential prompts under certain
common configurations

- Direct access to several critical system files

CVE-ID 2013-5122
CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
CVSS Base Score 10
CVSS Temporal Score 8.1
Exploitability Subscore: 10.0

Affected models and firmware:
Linksys SMART Wi-Fi Router N600 - EA2700 Firmware Version: 1.0.14

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerability Conditions seen in all variations, though not limited too:
- Classic GUI has been enabled/installed
- Remote Management - Disabled
- UPnP - Enabled
- IPv4 SPI Firewall Protection - Disabled

Fixes and workarounds:

*** It is strongly advised to those that have the classic GUI firmware
installed to do a full WAN side scan for unusual ports that are open
that weren't specifically opened by the end user.

It is recommend to upgrade to firmware 2.1.39 on the E4200v2 and
EA4500, though it is uncertain if this resolves the problem in all
cases.

Vendor: We have been working with Linksys/Belkin Engineers on this
problem, and they are still investigating the root cause. We hope to
