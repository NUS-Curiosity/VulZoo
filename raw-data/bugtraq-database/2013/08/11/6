maybe you met the wrong ones............

on the other hand most admins i met did not use "disallow_functions"
a responsilble developer which is at the same time admin has the
knowledge not using dangerous functions and disables them

one config line and the whole topic would be obsolete by not
allowing symlinks from web-applications

disable_functions  = "popen, pclose, exec, passthru, shell_exec, system, proc_open, proc_close, proc_nice,
proc_terminate, proc_get_status, pcntl_exec, apache_child_terminate, posix_kill, posix_mkfifo, posix_setpgid,
posix_setsid, posix_setuid, mail, symlink, link, dl, get_current_user, getmypid, getmyuid, getrusage, pfsockopen,
socket_accept, socket_bind, openlog, syslog"
