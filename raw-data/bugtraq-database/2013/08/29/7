Introduction:
=============
Our vision is for a transport system that is an engine for economic growth, but one that is also greener and safer 
and improves quality of life in our communities. The Department provides leadership across the transport sector to 
achieve its objectives, working with regional, local and private sector partners to deliver many of the services. 
This section contains information on the Department s aims and objectives, its organisational structure, and the 
responsibilities of the various affiliated agencies.

The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOI Act) came into force on 1 January 2005 and aims to make information held 
by public authorities more accessible to the public and allows individuals and companies to request a wide variety 
of material. The Freedom of Information section summarises our request handling procedures and information released 
in response to FOI requests.
