Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
A critical SQL Injection web vulnerability is detected in the famous Arlington Engeneering University in Texas.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject or execute own sql commands to compromise the web-application or web-server dbms.

The vulnerability is located in the engineeringnews module when processing to request ID parameter with own SQL commands.
Remote attackers are able to inject the commands to compromise the web-application and affected database management system.
The flaw is result of the wrong validation of the id value when processing to load the engineeringnews.php file. 


Vulnerable Module(s):
                                                     [+] ../engineeringnews/

Vulnerable File(s):
                                                     [+] engineeringnews.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                                                     [+] id


Proof of Concept:
=================
The remote sql injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction or privileged user account.
