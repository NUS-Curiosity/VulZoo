Introduction:
=============
eTransfer is a tool for you to transfer photos among pc, iPad. eTransfer does not need iTunes. It supports to transfer photo:

- iPad to iPad
- iPad to PC
- PC to iPad

eTransfer does not need extra software. All you need is the device that installed eTransfer and web browser on any os.

Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a persistent web vulnerability in the eTransfer Lite v1.0 application (Apple iOS - iPad & iPhone).

Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
A persistent input validation web vulnerability is detected  in the eTransfer Lite v1.0 application (Apple iOS - iPad & iPhone).
The bug allows an attacker (remote) to implement/inject malicious own malicious persistent script codes (application side).

The vulnerability is located in the `Receive Photos from others` and `Send Photos to others` module of the web-server (http://localhost:8080) 
when processing to request via POST method manipulated `file-names`. The file name will be changed to the path value without secure filter, 
encode or parse. The injected script code will be executed in the main file listing were the attacker injected earlier the code 
and of course also in the index listing of the mobile web application.

There is a security protection to filter random files because only images are allowed. To include own script code the attacker needs 
to manipulate the POST request after the first separate input parse.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a local low privilege mobile application account 
with a password. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (customers), account steal 
via persistent web attacks, persistent phishing or persistent module context manipulation.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] eTransfer Lite v1.0 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] File Listing

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] file name

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir & Path Listing
				[+] Path/Folder Listing



Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers and local privileged application user accounts with 
low or medium user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Reference(s):
http://localhost:8080/


Solution:
=========
To fix the vulnerability the filename needs to be parsed, escaped or separate encoded in the POST method request.
Parse also the affected output listing in the of the filename in the index file dir listing and sub category path folder listing.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).
