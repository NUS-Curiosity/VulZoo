Subject: Mikrotik RouterOS 5.* and 6.* sshd remote preauth heap corruption

Hello lists,

here you find the analysis of a vulnerability I recently discovered.

Mikrotik RouterOS 5.* and 6.* sshd remote preauth heap corruption

http://kingcope.wordpress.com/2013/09/02/mikrotik-routeros-5-and-6-sshd-remote-preauth-heap-corruption/

Additionally it includes a way to drop into a development shell for
recent Mikrotik RouterOS versions.

Cheers :>
