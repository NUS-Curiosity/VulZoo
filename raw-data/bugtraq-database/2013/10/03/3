-=] About RootedCON 2014

RootedCON 2014 is a Security Congress that will be held in Madrid
(Spain) on 6-8 March 2014.

With an estimated capacity of about 1000 people, is one of the
largest specialized conferences that take place in the country and
one of the largest in Europe, with attendees profiles ranging from
students, state forces, to professionals within Security market in IT
or simply technology enthusiasts.

-=] Types of talks

There will be two types of talks:

- Quick talks:    20 minutes.
- Regular talks:  50 minutes.

A limited number of each of the types can even adjust the schedule if
an interesting quick talk extends beyond 20 minutes or, for specific
needs, reducing one of the regular talks.

For this fifth anniversary, we are searching for groundbreaking and
disruptive talks both  from national and international speakers,
including discussions of topics not directly related with security,
but keeping in mind the technology, lifestyle, culture ...

-=] International speakers

This year we will invest a lot of effort to bring international
speakers, incorporating both Spanish-English, English-Spanish
simultaneous translation. Consequently, we also call attendees from
around the world.

RootedCON is always looking for quality sponsors and partners. If you

contact us at:

patrocinadores-AT-rootedcon.es

IMPORTANT: Due to the highly technical subject, and attendees
preferences given in multiple surveys, we encourage potential
sponsors who intend to give a talk as speakers to be adapted as
possible to the different topics liked by the most important
RootedCON assets you have, your general public.

Any help, comments, ideas, proposals or collaborations that we should
do to get will be considered and valued with all its importance: it
is very important for Congress to receive such proposals, we depend
on you to organise the best event possible.

-=] Critical points to consider

1. Time management and the duration of the talks are one of the
critical points in our Congress. It is preferable to ask for a
regular talk than trying to rush a quick talk, without allowing free
time for the audience questions.

2. We appreciate EXCLUSIVE talks, which wasn't previously published
as blog posts, websites, events or any other conferences.

3. We believe in the responsible Full-disclosure so, if your idea is
to present a Zero-Day, we want confirmation that you have contacted
the manufacturer, and if this contact couldn't be made at your own,
we offer to manage it.

4. One of the main reasons for cancelling the contract between
speaker and /RootedCON is not to deliver (all) materials on the
deadline established. Delays could deduct expenses covering congress
and charged to the speaker.

5. PLEASE, it is very important to * CLEARLY * indicates if
accommodation or travel is needed when you submit your paper through
the CFP form. Rooted reserves the right to not cover that kind of
needs if it was not stated initially.
