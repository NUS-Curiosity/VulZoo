May I suggest

rule 1. Don't send html only email

to enable

rule 2. Don't render html email unless you're sure it's what it claims
to be and you are sure it is safe. Actually just don't, you know
someone in your organisation will get phished, putting others at risk.
Just strip the html at your MTA, you can do this because of rule 1.

regards
brandon
