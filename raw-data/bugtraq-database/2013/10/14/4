CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS
====================================

Per Thorsheim, with the support of FRISC (www.frisc.no), the University
of Bergen and Stricture Consulting Group, organize PasswordsCon,
the fifth edition of a technical conference only devoted to passwords
and related authentication methods.

Passwords are the most common authentication method on internet services
and on computers in general, regardless of their form factor (desktop,
laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.).  Dissatisfaction with the robustness
and usability of current approaches has motivated the previous editions
of the Passwords conference, and more recently prompted the organization
of the Password Hashing Competition.

The purpose of PasswordsCon is to gather leading researchers in
passwords security and authentication methods in general, so as to best
understand the challenges posed and to address them adequately.

Details on the conference as they are ready will appear at our website:
passwordscon.org


== TOPICS ==

PasswordsCon asks for submissions on topics including, but not limited to:

- Password hashing functions
  * New algorithms & constructions
  * Cryptanalytic attacks on classical security notions
