WORKSHOP FORMAT

The Iberian Information Systems and Technologies research and industrial community is invited to submit proposals of Workshops for CISTI 2014 � 9th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies to be held at Barcelona, Spain, June 18�21, 2014. Two types of Workshops may be proposed: Regular Workshops and Project Workshops.

Regular Workshops should focus on a specific scientific subject on the scope of CISTI 2014 but not directly included on the main conference areas. Each regular workshop will be coordinated by an Organizing Committee composed of, at least, two researchers in the field, preferably from different institutions and different countries. The organizers should create an international Program Committee for the Workshop, with recognized researchers within the specific Workshop scientific area. Each workshop should have at least 10 submissions and 5 accepted papers in order to be conducted at CISTI.

Project Workshops are intended to promote the dissemination and facilitate the future exploitation of EU Latin-American and national project results such as EU/FP7, CSIC, FCT, QREN, Fund.Gulbenkian, CYTED, CAPES, CNPq, FINEP and other Projects/funding sources. The results to be disseminated may be preliminary project results (for unfinished projects) or the project final results (for already finished projects). Each project workshop should be directly related to a Project funded in a competitive manner by a National/International Science Organization. The Workshop should be coordinated by an Organizing Committee composed by at least two researchers including the Principal Investigator of the project. Each project Workshop will be entitled to at least a paper on the Conference main proceedings (specific details and distinct configurations for the project workshop should be discussed with the conference Workshop chair).

The selection of Workshops will be performed by CISTI 2014 Conference Chairs. Workshops full papers will be published in the conference main proceedings in specific Workshop chapters. Proceedings will be submitted for indexation by ISI Thomson, SCOPUS, INSPEC and EBSCO. Detailed and up-to-date information may be found at CISTI 2014 website http://www.aisti.eu/cisti2014.
