Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4623 CVE-2013-5914 CVE-2013-5915

Multiple security issues have been discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight 
crypto and SSL/TLS library:

CVE-2013-4623

    Jack Lloyd discovered a denial of service vulnerability in the 
    parsing of PEM-encoded certificates.

CVE-2013-5914

    Paul Brodeur and TrustInSoft discovered a buffer overflow in the
    ssl_read_record() function, allowing the potential execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2013-5915

    Cyril Arnaud and Pierre-Alain Fouque discovered timimg attacks against
    the RSA implementation.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed in
version 1.2.9-1~deb6u1 soon (due to a technical limitation the updates
cannot be released synchronously).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.9-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.
