Subject: Results of a XSLT fuzzing effort

Hello,

I published last week a blog post describing the results of the XSLT
fuzzing campaign I did in 2012. Now that most of the discovered
vulnerabilities are patched, I've  chosen to give away a dozen of PoC
regarding Adobe Reader, Microsoft MSXML, Firefox, Webkit, ...

Even if you are not in XML technologies, I think that looking at
pathological XSLT code may be interesting ;-)
