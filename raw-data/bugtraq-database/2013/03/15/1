OS X Lion v10.7 to v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7 to v10.7.5,
OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 to v10.8.2
Impact:  An attacker may be able to access directories that are
protected with HTTP authentication without knowing the correct

CoreTypes
Available for:  OS X Lion v10.7 to v10.7.5,
OS X Lion Server v10.7 to v10.7.5,
OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 to v10.8.2
Impact:  Visiting a maliciously crafted website could allow a Java
Web Start application to be launched automatically even if the Java
plug-in is disabled
Description:  Java Web Start applications would run even if the Java
plug-in was disabled. This issue was addressed by removing JNLP files
from the CoreTypes safe file type list, so the Web Start application
will not be run unless the user opens it in the Downloads directory.
CVE-ID
CVE-2013-0967

International Components for Unicode
Available for:  Mac OS X 10.6.8, Mac OS X Server 10.6.8,

authentication may be bypassed
Description:  An error handling issue existed in Identity Services.
If the user's AppleID certificate failed to validate, the user's
AppleID was assumed to be the empty string. If multiple systems
belonging to different users enter this state, applications relying
on this identity determination may erroneously extend trust. This
issue was addressed by ensuring that NULL is returned instead of an
empty string.
