          CVE Name        CVE-2013-2685                                       

    Description  The format attribute resource for h264 video performs an     
                 unsafe read against a media attribute when parsing the SDP.  
                 The vulnerable parameter can be received as strings of an    
                 arbitrary length and Asterisk attempts to read them into     
                 limited buffer spaces without applying a limit to the        
                 number of characters read. If a message is formed            
                 improperly, this could lead to an attacker being able to     
                 execute arbitrary code remotely.                             

    Resolution  Attempts to read string data into the buffers noted are now   
                explicitly limited by the size of the buffers.
