4. Affected Components Description
==================================

The monitoring architecture provides an infrastructure for monitoring your IT environment and
its components. Monitoring data is stored in the shared memory of every server with a running SAP instance or a running
agent.
Read and write access from the central monitoring system is possible in two different ways:
Using a defined ABAP interface, in the case of an SAP instance
Using the CCMS agent, in the case of any server on which the agent is installed and active CCMS agents are independent
processes with an interface through RFC to a central monitoring system and an interface to the shared memory. ‚Äù[1].

5. Vulnerability Details
========================

The CCMS agent is built as an RFC external server, exposing several RFC functions. One of this functions allows a remote
unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands which are executed with SIDADM privileges (the highest possible in
the SAP world).

Abusing of this RFC function, a remote unauthenticated attacker would be able to compromise the SAP systems that are
monitored by a CEN system (Central Monitoring System).

Technical details about this issue are not disclosed at this moment with the purpose of providing enough time to
affected customers to patch their systems and protect against the exploitation of the described vulnerability.


6. Solution
===========

SAP has released SAP Note 1758450 which provide patched versions of the affected components.
The patches can be downloaded from https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1758450.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related security fixes and apply them to the affected
components in order to reduce business risks.
