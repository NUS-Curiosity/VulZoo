Package        : squid3
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-5643 CVE-2013-0189
Debian Bug     : 696187

Squid3, a fully featured Web proxy cache, is prone to a denial of
service attack due to memory consumption caused by memory leaks in
cachemgr.cgi:

CVE-2012-5643

    squid's cachemgr.cgi was vulnerable to excessive resource use. A
    remote attacker could exploit this flaw to perform a denial of
    service attack on the server and other hosted services.

CVE-2013-0189

    The original patch for CVE-2012-5643 was incomplete. A remote
    attacker still could exploit this flaw to perform a denial of
    service attack.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.6-1.2+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.20-2.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.20-2.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.
