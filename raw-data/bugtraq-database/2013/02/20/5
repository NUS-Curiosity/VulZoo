Subject: Alt-N MDaemon's WorldClient Disclosure of Authentication Credentials Vulnerability

==========================================================================================
   Alt-N MDaemon's WorldClient Disclosure of Authentication
Credentials Vulnerability
==========================================================================================

Software:  Alt-N MDaemon v13.0.3 and prior versions
Vendor: http://www.altn.com/
Vuln Type: Disclosure of Authentication Credentials
Remote: Yes
Local: No
Discovered by: QSecure and Demetris Papapetrou
References: http://www.qsecure.com.cy/advisories/Alt-N_MDaemon_WorldClient_Disclosure_of_Authentication_Credentials.html
Discovered: 01/10/2012
Reported: 19/12/2012
Fixed: 15/01/2013 (http://files.altn.com/MDaemon/Release/RelNotes_en.html)
Disclosed: 18/02/2013

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION:
==========================
Alt-N WorldClient application is prone to an authentication
credentials disclosure via a specially formulated HTTP request. This
is possible because the application replies to the request with a
response that contains the credentials in an encoded (reversible)
format.

Attackers may trick an unsuspecting user into opening a malicious
email message -using the WorldClient application- and stealing his/her
authentication credentials without the user ever noticing.

Alt-N MDaemon v13.0.3 & v12.5.6 were tested and found vulnerable;
other versions may also be affected.
