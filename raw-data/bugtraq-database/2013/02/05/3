Subject: Re: [SE-2012-01] Details of issues fixed by Feb 2013 Java SE CPU


Hello All,

Due to the inquiries received regarding our claims pertaining to
the possibility of exploiting Java SE vulnerabilities on servers,
we've published our Proof of Concept code that illustrates this.

The code relies on RMI protocol [1] to deliver a malicious Java
class file to a target RMI server. It can be downloaded from our
project details page:

Thank You.

Best Regards,
Adam Gowdiak
