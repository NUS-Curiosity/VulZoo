It has been pointed out that in fact the example code is not vulnerable 
due to a subtlety in variable declaration. I have amended the post to 
take this into account, and apologise for the mis-information. However, 
the point about lack of clarity on this issue still stands, and, as 
we've seen, the potential for error still exists.
