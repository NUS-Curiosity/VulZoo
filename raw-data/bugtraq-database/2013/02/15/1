Subject: Re: CFP: InfoSec Southwest 2013

Due to popular request, we've extended the CFW for InfoSec Southwest
through **March 1, 2013**. That's right, your procrastination has paid
off, so make the most of these extra two weeks.

For submission guidelines, please see:

ISSW 2013 will be held in beautiful and likely balmy Austin, Texas,
USA, April 19-21. Please mail your material to
cfp@...osecsouthwest.com .
