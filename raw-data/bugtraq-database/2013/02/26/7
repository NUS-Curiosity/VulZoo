Subject: Denial of Service vulnerability in War FTP Daemon 1.82

Late last week, security researchers at jura.ba reported a Denial of 
Service vulnerability in War FTP Daemon 1.82.

The problem was rooted in the way log messages was relayed from the 
internal log handler to the Windows Event log when the sever was running 
as a Windows service. Theoretically, it could be possible to execute 
remote code using this vulnerability.

I am therefore rating this vulnerability as critical.

A fix for the problem can be downloaded from http://www.warftp.org/?menu=344
