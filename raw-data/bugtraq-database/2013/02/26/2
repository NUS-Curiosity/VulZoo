CVE-2013-0253 Apache Maven

Severity: Medium

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- Apache Maven 3.0.4
- Apache Maven Wagon 2.1, 2.2, 2.3

 Description:
Apache Maven 3.0.4 (with Apache Maven Wagon 2.1) has introduced a non-secure
SSL mode by default. This mode disables all SSL certificate checking,
including: host name verification , date validity,  and certificate
chain. Not validating the certificate introduces the possibility of a
man-in-the-middle attack.

All users are recommended to upgrade to Apache Maven 3.0.5 and Apache
Maven Wagon 2.4.
