Subject: Re: [#1298868584] Copy&paste from web browser considered dangerous

Hi Pavel,

Since Chrome is based on Chromium (an open source project), please file
the report directly in their bug tracker: http://crbug.com

The provides a number of benefits: 
- You get direct access to the same developers that will triage and fix
the issue; and 
- Once it's fixed, the bug will be made public (though if you use the
"Security Bug" template, the bug will be restricted to a small group of
security engineers until this occurs). 

Regards,

The Google Team
