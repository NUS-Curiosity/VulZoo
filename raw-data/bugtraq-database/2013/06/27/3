Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Web Security Appliance

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20130626-wsa


Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2013 June 26 16:00  UTC (GMT)

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance is affected by
the following vulnerabilities:

  * Two authenticated command injection vulnerabilities
  * Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability


These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is affected
by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others.

Successful exploitation of any of the two command injection vulnerabilities
could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on
the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.
Successful exploitation of the Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability
could cause several critical processes to become unresponsive and make the
affected system unstable.


Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available. This advisory is
available at the following link:
