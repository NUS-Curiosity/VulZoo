Hi,

This phpass.php isn't hand-rolled like you stated in your blog post; it's
a copy of a public domain crypt()-workalike: http://www.openwall.com/phpass/
There are several other systems which implement their password hashing
using this library.

Having said that, being able to control the setting looks like a mistake on
the part of Wordpress, so I'm not sure the bug is in phpass, strictly
speaking.  However, have you considered contacting upstream
(Solar Designer/OpenWall) about this?

Cheers,
Peter
