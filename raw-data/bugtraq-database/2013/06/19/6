+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software contain two vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Additionally, Cisco TelePresence TC Software contain an adjacent root access vulnerability that could allow an attacker on the same physical or logical Layer-2 network as the affected system to gain an unauthenticated root shell.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate the Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software SIP Denial of Service vulnerabilities are available. This advisory is available at the following link:
