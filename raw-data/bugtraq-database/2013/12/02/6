1. Summary

   vSphere Update Manager (VUM), ESXi and ESX to address multiple 
   security vulnerabilities.
    

2. Relevant releases

   VMware vCenter Server before 5.0 update 3

   VMware Update Manager before 5.0 update 3
   
   VMware ESXi 5.0 without patch ESXi500-201310101-SG
   VMware ESXi 4.1 without patch ESXi410-201307401-SG

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware ESXi and ESX contain a vulnerability in hostd-vmdb. 

      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must intercept and 
      modify the management traffic. Exploitation of the issue may lead
      to a Denial of Service of the hostd-vmdb service.

      To reduce the likelihood of exploitation, vSphere components 
      should be deployed on an isolated management network.
      
      VMware would like to thank Alex Chapman of Context Information 
      Security for reporting this issue to us. 

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2013-5970 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

      VMware		Product	Running	Replace with/
      Product		Version	on	Apply Patch
      =============	=======	=======	=================
      vCenter Server	any	any	not affected
			
      hosted*		any	any	not affected
      
      ESXi		5.5	ESXi    not affected
      ESXi		5.1	ESXi	not affected
      ESXi		5.0	ESXi	ESXi500-201310101-SG

      ESX		4.0	ESX	ESX400-201305401-SG
   
      * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Fusion.

   b. VMware vSphere Web Client Server Session Fixation Vulnerability
      
      The VMware vSphere Web Client Server contains a vulnerability in
      the handling of session IDs. To exploit this vulnerability, an 
      attacker must know a valid session ID of an authenticated user. 
      Exploitation of the issue may lead to Elevation of Privilege.

      To reduce the likelihood of exploitation, vSphere components 
      should be deployed on an isolated management network.

      VMware would like to thank Alexey Tyurin of DSecRG for reporting
      this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
      has assigned the name CVE-2013-5971 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

      VMware		Product	Running	Replace with/
      Product		Version	on	Apply Patch
      =============	=======	=======	=================

      vCenter Server	4.1	ESXi	not affected
      vCenter Server	4.0	ESXi	not affected
   
      * The affected component is the vSphere Web Client Server.

   c. vCenter and Update Manager, Oracle JRE update 1.6.0_51.
      
      Oracle JRE is updated to version 1.6.0_51, which addresses
      multiple security issues that existed in earlier releases of
      Oracle JRE.
