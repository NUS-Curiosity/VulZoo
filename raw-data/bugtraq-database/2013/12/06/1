Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in Jamroom, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Jamroom: CVE-2013-6804

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data in "search_string" HTTP POST parameter passed to "/search/results/all/1/4" URL. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the JavaScript "alert()" function to display "immuniweb" word:


<form action="http://[host]/search/results/all/1/4" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="search_string"  value='" onmouseover="javascript:alert("immuniweb");'>
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Update Jamroom Search module to version 1.1.1
