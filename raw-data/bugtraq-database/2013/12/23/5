Vulnerability: SQL injection
========================================================================

Description
-----------
An SQL-injection vulnerability was recently discovered and reported to
the Revive Adserver team by Florian Sander. The vulnerability is known
to be already exploited to gain unauthorised access to the application
using brute force mechanisms, however other kind of attacks might be
possible and/or already in use. The risk is rated to be critical as the
most common end goal of the attackers is to spread malware to the
visitors of all the websites and ad networks that the ad server is being
used on.

The vulnerability is also present and exploitable in OpenX Source 2.8.11
and earlier versions, potentially back to phpAdsNew 2.0.x.

Details
-------
The XML-RPC delivery invocation script was failing to escape its input
parameters in the same way the other delivery methods do, allowing
attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code via the "what" parameter of the
delivery XML-RPC methods. Also, the escaping technique used to handle
such parameter in the delivery scripts was based on the addslashes PHP
function and has now been upgraded to use the dedicated escaping
functions for the database in use.

Solution
========

We strongly advise people to upgrade to the most recent 3.0.2 version of
Revive Adserver, including those running OpenX Source or older versions
of the application.

In case the upgrade cannot be performed in a timely fashion, we suggest
to delete the "www/delivery/axmlrpc.php" script (if not in use) as a
temporary fix until the application is upgraded.
