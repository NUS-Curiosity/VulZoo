Debian Bug     : 702526 714541 730189

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Ruby language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-1821

    Ben Murphy discovered that unrestricted entity expansion in REXML
    can lead to a Denial of Service by consuming all host memory.

CVE-2013-4073

    William (B.J.) Snow Orvis discovered a vulnerability in the hostname
    checking in Ruby's SSL client that could allow man-in-the-middle
    attackers to spoof SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a
    trusted certification authority.

CVE-2013-4164

    Charlie Somerville discovered that Ruby incorrectly handled floating
    point number conversion. If an application using Ruby accepted
    untrusted input strings and converted them to floating point
    numbers, an attacker able to provide such input could cause the
    application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
    privileges of the application.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.7.302-2squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.7.358-7.1+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.7.358-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.8 packages.
