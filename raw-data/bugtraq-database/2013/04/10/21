 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:113
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : perl
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated perl packages fix security vulnerability:
 
 It was discovered that Perl&#039;s &#039;x&#039; string repeat operator is vulnerable
 to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to execute
 arbitrary code (CVE-2012-5195).
 
 The _compile function in Maketext.pm in the Locale::Maketext
 implementation in Perl before 5.17.7 does not properly handle
 backslashes and fully qualified method names during compilation of
 bracket notation, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute
 arbitrary commands via crafted input to an application that accepts
 translation strings from users (CVE-2012-6329).
 
 In order to prevent an algorithmic complexity attack against
 its hashing mechanism, perl will sometimes recalculate keys and
 redistribute the contents of a hash. This mechanism has made perl
 robust against attacks that have been demonstrated against other
 systems. Research by Yves Orton has recently uncovered a flaw in the
 rehashing code which can result in pathological behavior. This flaw
 could be exploited to carry out a denial of service attack against
 code that uses arbitrary user input as hash keys. Because using
 user-provided strings as hash keys is a very common operation,
 we urge users of perl to update their perl executable as soon
 as possible. Updates to address this issue have bene pushed to
 main-5.8, maint-5.10, maint-5.12, maint-5.14, and maint-5.16 branches
 today. Vendors* were informed of this problem two weeks ago and
 are expected to be shipping updates today (or otherwise very soon)
 (CVE-2013-1667).
