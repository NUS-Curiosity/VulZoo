Package        : strongswan
Vulnerability  : authentication bypass
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2944

Kevin Wojtysiak discovered a vulnerability in strongSwan, an IPsec based VPN
solution.

When using the openssl plugin for ECDSA based authentication, an empty, zeroed
or otherwise invalid signature is handled as a legitimate one. An attacker
could use a forged signature to authenticate like a legitimate user and gain
access to the VPN (and everything protected by this).

While the issue looks like CVE-2012-2388 (RSA signature based authentication
bypass), it is unrelated.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.6.4-7.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.
