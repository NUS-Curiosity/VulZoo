 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:149
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/

 Package : roundcubemail
 Date    : April 21, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been found and corrected in roundcubemail:
 
 A local file inclusion flaw was found in the way RoundCube Webmail,
 a browser-based multilingual IMAP client, performed validation
 of the &#039;generic_message_footer&#039; value provided via web user
 interface in certain circumstances. A remote attacker could issue a
 specially-crafted request that, when processed by RoundCube Webmail
 could allow an attacker to obtain arbitrary file on the system,
 accessible with the privileges of the user running RoundCube Webmail
 client (CVE-2013-1904).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the 0.8.6 version which
 is not affected by this issue.
