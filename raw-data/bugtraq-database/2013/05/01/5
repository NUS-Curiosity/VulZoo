Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered multiple vulnerabilities in GetSimple CMS, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The application has XSS filter, however it can be bypassed as demonstrated below.


1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in GetSimple CMS: CVE-2013-1420

1.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data passed via the "id" HTTP GET parameter to "/admin/backup-edit.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display administrator's cookies: 

http://[host]/admin/backup-edit.php?p=1&id="><scri<script></script>pt>alert(document.cookie);</scri<script></script>pt>


1.2 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data passed via the "path" HTTP GET parameter to "/admin/upload.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display administrator's cookies: 

http://[host]/admin/upload.php?path="><scri<script></script>pt>alert(document.cookie);</scri<script></script>pt>


1.3 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data passed via the "title" and "menu" HTTP GET parameters to "/admin/edit.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation examples below use the "alert()" JavaScript function to display administrator's cookies:

http://[host]/admin/edit.php?title="><scri<script></script>pt>alert(document.cookie);</scri<script></script>pt>
http://[host]/admin/edit.php?menu="><scri<script></script>pt>alert(document.cookie);</scri<script></script>pt>


1.4 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data passed via the "path" and "returnid" HTTP GET parameters to "/admin/filebrowser.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation examples below use the "alert()" JavaScript function to display administrator's cookies:

http://[host]/admin/filebrowser.php?path="><scri<script></script>pt>alert(document.cookie);</scri<script></script>pt>
http://[host]/admin/filebrowser.php?returnid="><scri<script></script>pt>alert(document.cookie);</scri<script></script>pt>
