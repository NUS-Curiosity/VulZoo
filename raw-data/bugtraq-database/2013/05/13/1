Subject: WASC Announcement: Static Analysis Technologies Evaluation Criteria
 Published

The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) is pleased to announce the
Static Analysis Technologies Evaluation Criteria. The goal of the SATEC
project is to create a vendor-neutral set of criteria to help guide
application security professionals during the process of acquiring a
static code analysis technology that is intended to be used during
source-code driven security programs. This document provides a
comprehensive list of criteria that should be considered during the
evaluation process.

WASC Static Analysis Technologies Evaluation Criteria
http://projects.webappsec.org/Static%20Analysis%20Technologies%20Evaluation%20Criteria


Target Audience:
The target audience of this document is the technical staff of software
organizations who are looking to automate parts of their application
security assurance programs using one or more static code analysis
technology, as well as application security professionals who are
responsible for performing application security reviews. The document will
take into consideration those who would be evaluating the technology and
those who would actually be using it.


Scope:
The purpose of this document is to develop a set of criteria that should
be taken into consideration while evaluating static code analysis tools or
services for security testing. The vendor-neutral criteria defined in this
document are selected using a consensus-driven review process comprised of
volunteer subject matter experts. Every organization is unique and has a
unique software development environment, this document aims to help
organizations achieve their application security goals through acquiring
the most suitable tool for their own unique environment. The document will
strictly stay away from evaluating or rating vendors. However, it will
focus on the most important aspects of static code analysis technologies
that would help the target audience identify the best technology for their
environment and development needs.
