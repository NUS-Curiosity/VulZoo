I. BACKGROUND
---------------------

Mozilla Firefox is a free and open source web browser coordinated by
Mozilla Corporation and Mozilla Foundation. As of October 2012, Firefox
has approximately 20% to 24% of worldwide usage share of web browsers,
making it the third most used web browser. (Wikipedia)


II. DESCRIPTION
---------------------

VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team discovered high risk vulnerabilities
in Mozilla Firefox.

The vulnerabilities are caused by errors in the Mozilla Maintenance Service
on Windows when interacting with local software, which could allow local
unprivileged users to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

It is of course possible to combine these vulnerabilities with a remote
Firefox memory corruption to achieve a remote SYSTEM code execution.


III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS
---------------------------

Mozilla Firefox versions prior to 21.0
Mozilla Firefox ESR versions prior to 17.0.6
Mozilla Thunderbird versions prior to 17.0.6
Mozilla Thunderbird ESR versions prior to 17.0.6


IV. Binary Analysis & Exploits/PoCs
---------------------------------------

In-depth technical analysis of the vulnerability and a private exploit will
be available through the VUPEN BAE (Binary Analysis & Exploits) portal:

http://www.vupen.com/english/services/ba-index.php

VUPEN Binary Analysis & Exploits Service provides private exploits and
in-depth technical analysis of the most significant public vulnerabilities
based on disassembly, reverse engineering, protocol analysis, and code
audit.

The service allows governments and major corporations to evaluate risks, and
protect infrastructures and assets against new threats. The service also
allows security vendors (IPS, IDS, AntiVirus) to supplement their internal
research efforts and quickly develop both vulnerability-based and
exploit-based signatures to proactively protect their customers from attacks
and emerging threats.


V. VUPEN Threat Protection Program
-----------------------------------

Governments and major corporations which are members of the VUPEN Threat
Protection Program (TPP) have been proactively alerted about the
vulnerability
when it was discovered by VUPEN in advance of its public disclosure, and
have received a detailed attack detection guidance to protect national and
critical infrastructures against potential 0-day attacks exploiting this
vulnerability:
