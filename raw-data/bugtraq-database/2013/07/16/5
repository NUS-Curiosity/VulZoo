Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
A client side input validation vulnerability is detected  in Barracuda Networks CudaTel v2.6.002.040 appliance application.
The non-persistent vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate website links to provoke malicious client side (application-side) requests.

The secound vulnerability (client side) is located in the `error:Internal Error` exception handling. When remote attackers provoke to 
load an invalid request the exception-handling will display the earlier inserted bbx_hostname (malicious) web context (exp. script codes). 
The attacker can use the vulnerable bbx_backup_site_host parameter of the test connection listing module to provoke an evil application 
exception-handling request.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in client side phishing, client side session hijacking and client side 
external redirects to malware or evil websites. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires medium application user interaction.

Vulnerable Section(s):
				[+] Test - Connection

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Exception-handling [Internal Error] - Listing

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] bbx_backup_site_host


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low or medium required user interaction and without privileged application user account.

Solution:
=========
The vulnerability can be patched by parsing the vulnerable bbx_backup_site_host parameter request.
Parse the internal error exception-handling when processing to display the error string of the requested parameter. (error context)

Note: Barracuda Networks provided a download in the customer section but also automatic update to patch the issue in the appliance series.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the client side input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium(-) because of the main location in the exception-handling.
