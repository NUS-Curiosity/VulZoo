Vulnerability  : heap corruption
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4113
Debian Bug     : 717139

It was discovered that PHP could perform an invalid free request when
processing crafted XML documents, corrupting the heap and potentially
leading to arbitrary code execution.  Depending on the PHP
application, this vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze16.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.5.0+dfsg-15.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
