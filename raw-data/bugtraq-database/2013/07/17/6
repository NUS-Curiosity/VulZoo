 Vulnerabilities on AiCloud enabled units

Update: The new Firmware tests for the ASUS 66 and 56 series have shown that access to the root share and directory traversal are no longer possible. We'll conduct more testing on the N14 and 16 series when those are released in the next day or two.

It is recommended that all users upgrade as soon as possible to the latest firmware.
