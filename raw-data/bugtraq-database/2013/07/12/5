Subject: Re: Windows 7/8 admin account installation password stored in the
 clear in LSA Secrets

Hi,

I've often found this behaviour during security assessments for corporate 
Clients.

It should indeed be considered a vulnerability, especially in enterprise 
scenarios where for instance it can be leveraged by a regular notebook 
user to escalate privileges and be able to access all other corporate 
user's notebooks (including their bosses';).

Cheers,

MI
