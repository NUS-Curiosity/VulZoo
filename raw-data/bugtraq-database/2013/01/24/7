Subject: IPv6: How to avoid security issues with VPN leaks on dual-stack networks

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Folks,

Techtarget has just published an article I've authored for them,
entitled "How to avoid security issues with VPN leaks on dual-stack
networks".

The article is available at:
<http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-avoid-security-issues-with-VPN-leaks-on-dual-stack-networks>

(Note: There are some banners (?) intermixed... but the whole article
can be viewed without registration... just keep scrolling down!9

Its "Abstract" is:
- ---- cut here ----
The imminent exhaustion of freely available IPv4 addresses has, over a
number of years, led to the incorporation of IPv6 support by most
general-purpose operating systems. However, many applications, such as
VPN client and server software, have been lagging behind to become
IPv6-ready. This results in scenarios in which dual-stacked hosts employ
IPv6-unaware VPN software, thus opening the door to security
vulnerabilities, such as VPN traffic leaks. In this tip, we'll discuss
how these VPN security issues arise and the various mitigation options
available for containing VPN traffic leaks.

P.S.: Any comments will be welcome.

Thanks!

Best regards,
