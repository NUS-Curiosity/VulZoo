Description:
    Previous versions of the openssh package are vulnerable to a
    remote denial of service attack that cause the server to consume
    CPU when presented with certain data.  They also have a bug (not
    a vulnerability) that causes the client to crash harmlessly
    instead of exiting cleanly under some attacks; this is not a
    vulnerability but is also fixed in this update.
