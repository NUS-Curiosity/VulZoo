Risk Level:
Medium; a local attacker can view passwords in plain text. 

Summary:
Verichat is instant messaging software that allows a user to connect to many different instant messaging accounts at once. It supports AOL, Yahoo!, MSN and ICQ on a Pocket PC device.

Details:
Verichat instant messenger does not implement any security measures for user passwords. Usernames and passwords are stored in plain text in the device&#8217;s registry. Although Windows Mobile does not come with a native registry editor, third party software can be used to view these passwords with ease.

Passwords are stored in the following location by default:
\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PDAapps\VeriChat
Each messenger client is represented at this path. For example, if an attacker wanted to find the MSN password, he would simply browse to the MSN registry key and look at the first two values. The first value is the password and the second value is the username. 

Workaround:
None

Vendor Response
Waiting response.
