Summary:
Shape Services IM+ is instant messaging software that allows a user to connect to multiple instant messaging accounts at once. It supports AOL, Yahoo!, MSN and ICQ on a Pocket PC device. http://www.shapeservices.com/eng/im/implus.php

Details:
IM+ does not use any sort of security or encryption to protect the usernames and passwords of the instant messaging accounts. 

A malicious user can navigate to \Program Files\IMPlus and grab the implus.cfg file. This file simply needs to be opened using a text editor to view all the account details, including user names and passwords, in plain text. 
Workaround:
Possibly fixed in later versions (we have not checked).
