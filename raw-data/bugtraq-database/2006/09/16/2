Subject: [Reversemode Advisory] Apple Quicktime FLIC File Heap Overflow 


Hi,

Apple Quicktime <= 7.1 is prone to a heap overflow vulnerability.

This flaw could lead to a remote code execution,if an attacker tricks
the victim to visit a malicious webpage with a specially crafted .fli
animation embedded.

The flaw is located within the "COLOR_64 chunk" Quicktime parser. Since
proper checking is not performed, a large amount of heap can be
overwritten with controlled values.
