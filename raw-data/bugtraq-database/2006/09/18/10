In all of these scripts we have

| include "mclc.php";
|Â include "$langfile";

and in mclc.php we have

| $langfile="english.php";

So $langfile is initialized and there is no way to change it.
Same for Version 1.2 from the Homepage.
Result: No vulnerability.

Where did you tested this?
If you found vulnerable servers, the phpconfig() of these
could be helpful.
