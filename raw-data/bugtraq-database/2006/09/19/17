Synopsis
========

Mailman has multiple vulnerable that can result in Denial of Service,
log file injection and XSS.

Background
==========

Mailman is a Python based mailing list server with an extensive web
interface.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/mailman      < 2.1.9_rc1                    >= 2.1.9_rc1

Description
===========

Mailman fails to properly handle standards-breaking RFC 2231 formatted
headers. Furthermore, Moritz Naumann discovered several XSS
vulnerabilities and a log file injection.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause Mailman to
stop processing mails, to inject content into the log file or to
execute arbitrary scripts running in the context of the administrator
or mailing list user's browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mailman users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/mailman-2.1.9_rc1"
