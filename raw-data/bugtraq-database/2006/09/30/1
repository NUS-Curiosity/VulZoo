Subject: setSlice exploited in the wild - massively

Exploit code is available publicly:
http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/2440

SANS diary:
http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=1742

And this is so massively exploited, it makes VML look cute. There's a
rootkit, some other malware, and haxdor! (a phishing trojan horse)

Thanks to Roger Thompson at explabs.com for first reporting it.
