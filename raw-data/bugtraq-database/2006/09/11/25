If you think about it in terms of how long an attacker has to act, I
think you'll come to a different conclusion.  Two-factor auth is
better than password alone even when the end user is typing OTPs into
a machine that is completely and totally rooted.  The key phrase in
your analysis is "connected token."  Once the token is disconnected,
the malware no longer has access to the authentication data.  When a
password is stolen it could be usable for months.  When an OTP is
stolen it is usable for hours, if that.  Two-factor auth reduces the
risk because it reduces the length of time of the compromise.

That is the big question.  Even if you are willing to pay for
two-factor, transactional authentication might provide better value.
