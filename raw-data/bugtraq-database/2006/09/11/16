No.  It  actually  changes  nothing  -  if attacker trojanes GINA he can
forward  entered  OTP+PIN/password  and  use  it  anywhere while user is
logged  in  locally  without  any warning and without any OTP used. User
will not be able to use transparent authentication for network resources
until  next  logon - but who cares? It's possible to hide this situation
by  making  some  hang-up  or  crash. Alternatively, you can ask user to
re-enter  OTP+PIN  saying  one is wrong and to use this second OTP - how
many users care about that?
