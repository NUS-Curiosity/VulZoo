Subject: tech support being flooded due to IE 0day

For orgs which are not ISP's, I just emailed this to nanog.

Hi guys, several ISP's are experiencing a flood of calls from customers
who get failed installations of the recent IE 0day - VML - (vgx.dll).

If you are getting such floods too, this is why.

This is currently discussed on the botnets@ list, as raised by Cox, and I
figured I will float it out here.

No patch is currently available from Microsoft, workarounds are available.

	Gadi.
