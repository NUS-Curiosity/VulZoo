Subject: Re: CounterPath eyeBeam Handing SIP header Vulnerabilities

A vulnerability was reported on January 17, 2006, for eyeBeam v1.1 (build 3010n). We were able to reproduce this issue and have determined the possible impact on eyeBeam users.

The issue could have caused a temporary Denial of Service. However, it could not have compromised the user's system or caused heap corruption.

CounterPath has rectified the issue and updates for eyeBeam have been provided for both Windows and Mac (builds 3014w of eyeBeam 1.1 or later).

This issue does not affect any versions of eyeBeam 1.5.
