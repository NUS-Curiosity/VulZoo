This version is indeed vulnerable.

But your (latest) in the subject is wrong, latest version
is 1.2i from 2006-06-10, and these is not vulnerable. 
But at least version 1.2g (from 2004-11-10) is vulnerable.

In 1.2h_RC3b (from 2005-06-06) the direct call of the script
is impossible:

|   if (!defined("LOADED_AS_MODULE")) { 
|            die ("You can't access this file directly..."); 
|   } 

But there is no include() anymore.

Older versions not tested.

Regards
  Carsten
