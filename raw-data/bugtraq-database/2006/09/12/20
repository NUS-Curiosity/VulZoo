 Overflow Vulnerability

Apple QuickTime FLIC File Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 09.12.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Sep 12, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Quicktime is Apple's media player product used to render video and other
media.  For more information visit http://www.apple.com/quicktime/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap-based buffer overflow in Apple Computer's
QuickTime Player could allow attackers to execute code under the
privileges of the affected application.

A FLIC file is an animation file consisting of a number of frames, each
of which is made up of an image and may contain other information such
as a palette or a label.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the handling of the COLOR_64
chunk in FLIC format files. QuickTime does not validate that the data
size allocated to store the palette is large enough, allowing a
malformed file to cause controllable heap corruption.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the
context of the currently logged in user. In order to exploit this
vulnerability, attackers must social engineer victims into visiting a
website under their control.

The QuickTime plugin can be forced to load in Firefox and Internet
Explorer. Furthermore, testing shows that either browser can be used as
an attack vector. It is also possible to open this type of file directly
from within QuickTime or from a playlist that QuickTime has opened.

The data being used to overwrite the heap is in the form 0x00XXYYZZ,
where XX, YY and ZZ are controllable. This limits the range of values
that can be overwritten, but does not prevent it.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense Labs confirmed that version 7.1 of the QuickTime player is
vulnerable. It is suspected that all previous versions are also
affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workarounds for this
vulnerability.
