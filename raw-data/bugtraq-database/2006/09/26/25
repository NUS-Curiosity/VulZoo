Subject: Re: Re: Woltlab Burning Board 2.3.X SQL Injection Vulnerability

Hi again,

I had some time to research into this. I tested about ten boards with 
different versions from 2.3.3 to 2.3.5. On some this bug works on some 
it doesn't, independent of the version! On pages this doesn't work you 
will only get an empty thread without any posts as I told, otherwise you 
will get this typical "SQL-DATABASE ERROR" message. So just a small bug, 
nothing special and no really injection. But why does this work on some 
pages and others not? Maybe some PHP/MySQL restrictions?

Regards
Bastian Ahrens
