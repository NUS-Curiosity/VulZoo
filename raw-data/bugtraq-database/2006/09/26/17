Subject: [Whitepaper] - Access over Ethernet: Insecurities in AoE

Access over Ethernet: Insecurities in AoE
------------------------------------------

ATA over Ethernet (AoE) is an open standards based protocol
which allows direct network access to disk drives by client
hosts.
AoE has been incorporated into the mainstream Linux kernel, 
recently been the subject of a Slashdot article, and it
appears that it is a SAN technology which is here to stay.
This paper investigates the insecurities present in the AoE
protocol and suggests how you can deploy AoE infrastructure
without worrying about a wide scale compromise.


The paper can be downloaded from the whitepapers section of
our website.
