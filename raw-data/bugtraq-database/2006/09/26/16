Synopsis
========

Tikiwiki contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability as well as
a second vulnerability which may allow remote execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

Tikiwiki is a web-based groupware and content management system,
developed with PHP, ADOdb and Smarty.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/tikiwiki       < 1.9.5                          >= 1.9.5

Description
===========

A vulnerability in jhot.php allows for an unrestricted file upload to
the img/wiki/ directory. Additionally, an XSS exists in the highlight
parameter of tiki-searchindex.php.

Impact
======

An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user
running the web server by uploading a file and executing it via a
filepath parameter. The XSS could be exploited to inject and execute
malicious script code or to steal cookie-based authentication
credentials, potentially compromising the victim's browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tikiwiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --oneshot --verbose --ask ">=www-apps/tikiwiki-1.9.5"
