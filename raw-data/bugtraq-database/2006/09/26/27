Subject: Re: VML Exploit vs. AV/IPS/IDS signatures

Avivra,

I acknowledge the research you and Ertunga
(http://www.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2006-September/003557.html)
have put up.

Protection against client-side scripting vulnerabilities is the
Achilles' Heel for all network-style IDS/IPS vendors. These languages
offer too much flexibility over the syntax and semantics, thus
becoming the pain-point for the underlying architecture for
network-style IDS/IPS which are better accustomed to analyze
structured data (like protocols and even file-formats). There's is
simply too much you can mutate here and you can't expect vendors to
develop on-the-fly javascript parsers! Thus the protection they
develop is simply a business objective, as they can loose a lot
mileage here if they don't cover vulnerabilities like this one. They
had the same stance for file-format vulnerabilities till they were
forced to add decoding routines for them by the sheer number of new
file-based vulnerabilities which were coming out. AV and local-style
protection is the best defense mechanism here (but even they failed in
this case!).

However, the other way out is to gather the maximum number of exploit
variants as you can (from mutual cooperation between security
companies) and provide real-time exploit-facing protection against
them. This is what they generally do and it provides almost 99%
protection (might surprise many) because most out-in-the-wild exploits
are derived from few sources only.

Thanks,
Pukhraj
