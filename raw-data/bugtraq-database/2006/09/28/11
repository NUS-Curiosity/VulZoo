With any luck, not too much. The point is that there is a way to do it, and
if there is a way, someone will use it in a bad manner eventually.
We can only hope that the users will count more on vulnerability/behavior
based security solutions, and not exploit based security solutions.

And you tell me how many of these variants you will actually find in
the wild. Won't be a significant number I bet.
