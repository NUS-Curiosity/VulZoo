Package:             openssl
Vulnerability:       denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:           Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= openssl-0.9.8c-20060905   >= openssl-0.9.8d-20060928

Description:
  According to a vendor security advisory [0], four security issues
  were discovered in the cryptography and SSL/TLS toolkit OpenSSL [1]:

  1. ASN.1 Denial of Service Attack (1/2)

     During the parsing of certain invalid ASN.1 structures an error
     condition is mishandled. This can result in an infinite loop which
     consumes system memory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
     (CVE) project assigned the id CVE-2006-2937 [2] to the problem.

  2. ASN.1 Denial of Service Attack (2/2)

     Certain types of public key can take disproportionate amounts of
     time to process. This could be used by an attacker in a denial of
     service attack. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
     project assigned the id CVE-2006-2940 [3] to the problem.

  3. SSL_get_shared_ciphers() Buffer Overflow

     A buffer overflow was discovered in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers()
     utility function. An attacker could send a list of ciphers to an
     application that uses this function and overrun a buffer. The
     Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
     CVE-2006-3780 [4] to the problem.

  4. SSLv2 Client Crash
 
     A flaw in the SSLv2 client code was discovered. When a client
     application used OpenSSL to create an SSLv2 connection to a
     malicious server, that server could cause the client to crash. The
     Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
     CVE-2006-4343 [5] to the problem.
