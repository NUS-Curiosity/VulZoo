Package:             bind
Vulnerability:       denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:       Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= bind-9.3.2-20060825   >= bind-9.3.2-20060907
OpenPKG 2-STABLE     <= bind-9.3.2-2.20060622 >= bind-9.3.2-2.20060907
OpenPKG 2.5-RELEASE  <= bind-9.3.1-2.5.0      >= bind-9.3.1-2.5.1

Description:
  Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the DNS server BIND [0]:

  1. SIG Query Processing [1][2][3]: On recursive servers queries
  for SIG records will trigger a assertion failure if more than one
  SIG (covered) RR set is returned. On authoritative servers, if a
  nameserver is serving a RFC 2535 DNSSEC zone and is queried for the
  SIG records where multiple SIG (covered) RRsets (e.g. a zone apex)
  exist, then BIND will trigger a assertion failure when it trys to
  construct the response. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  project assigned the id CVE-2006-4095 [4] to the problem.
  
  2. Excessive Recursive Queries INSIST failure [1][2][5]: It is
  possible to trigger an INSIST failure by sending enough recursive
  queries that the response to the query arrives after all the
  clients looking for the response have left the recursion queue. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2006-4096 [6] to the problem.
