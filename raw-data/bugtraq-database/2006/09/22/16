Overview

The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST,
http://www.first.org/) is a global non-profit organization dedicated
to bringing together computer security incident response teams
(CSIRT's) and includes response teams from 180 corporations,
government bodies, universities and other institutions spread across
the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania.

The annual FIRST conference not only provides a setting for
participants to attend tutorials and hear presentations by leading
experts in the CSIRT community, it also creates opportunities for
networking, collaboration, and sharing technical information. Just as
importantly, the conference enables attendees to meet their peers and
build confidential relationships across corporate disciplines and
geographical boundaries.

FIRST conference participants include not only CSIRT staff, but also
IT managers, network and system administrators, software and hardware
vendors, law enforcement representatives, security solutions
providers, telecommunications organizations, ISPs, and general
computer and network security personnel. FIRST conferences cover a
broad range of security related topics such as (but not limited to):
. Advanced techniques in security incident prevention, detection and
 response.
. Latest advances in computer and network security tools
. Shared views, experiences, and resolutions in the computer security
 incident response field.

The conference is a five-day event, comprised of two days of
