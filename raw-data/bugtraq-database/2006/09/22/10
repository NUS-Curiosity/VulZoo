Subject: Self-contained XSS Attacks (the new generation of XSS)

http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/self-contained-xss-attacks

XSS attacks can be persistent and non-persistent. Persistent XSS is
more dangerous since it allow attackers to control exploited clients
for longer. On the other hand non-persistent XSS is considered less
dangerous although it has been widely used in many phishing attempts.

In this article I will expose some of my findings around a new attack
vector which is of type non-persistent XSS but a lot more dangerous
than the persistent one.

Some of you might be familiar with this attack vector; this subject
has been covered very vaguely in the past and none of its full
potentials has been explored. The impact of this attack is much bigger
today and could affect many web applications.
