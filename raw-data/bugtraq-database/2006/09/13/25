                Pakistan's Underground Hacking Convention
                        <http://www.pakcon.org>


[ +-THEME-+ ]

We are proud to present the third installment of PAKCON, PAKCON III,
an underground hacking convention held annually in Pakistan.

In an age where information is treasure and the treasure house is the
virtual network, security is the first casualty. You are at risk if
your priorities falter. Face the threats, learn the defenses, try it
yourself and be safe. Pak Con lets you witness the virtual contest
LIVE!!!


[ +-SCENE-+ ]

PAKCON III has been planned with focus on introducing the importance of
security in enterprise-level computing and the latest trends in
fortifying enterprise networks against external and internal
threats. A hacking competition always takes place at PAKCON along with
a series of talks presented by renowned national and international
speakers at both amateur and advance levels.


[ +-PAKCON-+ ]

PAKCON is an underground hacking convention, the first initiative of
its kind in the history of the Pakistan IT scene. PAKCON is the
brainchild of a group of capable security professionals who have
employed their genius and aptitude to provide their extensive and
comprehensive experience of information security in the form of a
wide-ranging convention on information security. We at PAKCON aim to
highlight issues related to information security and the problems
faced by IT professionals. Our objective is to examine flaws with new
and current technologies, finding their solutions, covering unique and

interesting developments in all areas such as network security, system
security, application security, web security, database hacking,
trojans, worms, exploits, laws, privacy issues, wireless security,
firmware hacking, hardware hacking, embedded systems hacking, credit
card and financial instrument technologies, surveillance, honeypots,
honeynets, firewalls, IDS, information warfare, and similar fields.

PAKCON has been formed with a mission to bring Pakistan at par with
any developed nation of the world focusing on research and application
of computer security components. PAKCON is geared towards hackers,
programmers, phreaks, administrators, engineers, open source
advocates, military, reporters, and anyone interested in discovering
what's going on in the information security scene today.  This list
is, by no means intended to limit the enrollment of IT professionals;
we would also like to have the involvement of the business, legal and
allied sectors to participate in formulating effective cyber laws and
trade policies to make Pakistan's name synonymous with advanced
research in the IT world.


[ +-EVENT-+ ]

WHO:  If you know what you are doing with your computer, or if you
don't know and would like to know more about what you can do with it,
then you are who we want to meet.

WHAT:  A convention where you can meet and party with security
professionals, consultants, hackers, phreakers, coders, virus writers,
and a whole bunch of freaks who know only how to party all night.

WHEN:  December, 2006

WHERE:  Pearl Continental Hotel, Karachi, Pakistan

[ +-BRIEFINGS-+ ]

PAKCON III will be a 1-day event. There will be a single track with
"normal" talks as well as "lightening" talks presented by renowned,
skilled and knowledgeable computer and information security
professionals from the world over.


[ +-CAPTURE THE FLAG CONTEST (CtF)-+ ]

Break into any of several boxes from within a server farm, find hidden
flags, get CLUES, and move to the next round.  Additionally, deface
web servers and break common services to earn points.

In the famous Capture the Flag contest, six or seven teams will
compete for twelve hours in a level-based environment. Each level will
present an ever-increasing level of sophistication and difficulty. The
team defeating the last level will be declared the
winner. Additionally, teams can break into their opponents' systems
and slow down their pace.

Visit the website for more information regarding this exciting event.


[ +-WAR-DRIVING CONTEST-+ ]

The goal for the teams/individuals will be to detect maximum number of
Wi-Fi wireless access points (AP) in a given area. They are welcome to
bring their war-driving equipment. Visit the website for more
information regarding this exciting event.



[ +-PGP Key-signing-+ ]

A key signing party is a get-together of people who use the PGP
encryption system with the purpose of allowing those people to sign
each others keys.  Key signing parties serve to extend the web of
trust to a great degree. Key signing parties also serve as great
opportunities to discuss the political and social issues surrounding
strong cryptography, individual liberties, individual sovereignty, and
even implementing encryption technologies or perhaps future work on
free encryption software.


[ +-GEEK PARTY-+ ]

We believe that geeks also deserve some fun.  In fact we are not geeks
but smart people who know what to do and how to do it and those who do
not label us as 'geeks'. So, despite the hectic schedule of two
activity-filled days, we will try to have a little time for ourselves
with music, traditional beverages and a casual environment to unwind
ourselves. This will be a strictly restricted event with only
invitational or pre-registered entry.


[ +-COST-+ ]

Cost schedule, mode of payment and transaction procedure for PAKCON III
has been put up on the website. All charges are in Pak Rupees. We will
not be accepting any personal checks for any event related charges.
Payments via cashiers checks or bank drafts are to be made in the name
of PAKCON.

People who do not have to pay are speakers, invitees, event staff, and
VIPs.

Then, gently touching my face, she hesitated for a moment as her
incredible eyes poured forth into mine love, joy, pain, tragedy,
acceptance, and peace.  "'Bye for now," she said warmly.
