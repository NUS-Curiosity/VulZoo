Hacking Convention, happening annually for the past two years in a
row.  And this year, PAKCON will take place sometime in December,
somewhere in Karachi.

Call for papers to be presented at PAKCON III is now officially open.

Requests to present papers at PAKCON have always been accepted
liberally.  However, certain topics have always been and will still be
given preference over certain other topics.  By being liberal, we plan
to increase the number of speakers who will speak at PAKCON, all the
while striving to maintain the quality of papers and talks presented.

[ -L I G H T E N I N G   T A L K S- ]

This year, at PAKCON III, we are introducing "Lightening" talks
in addition to normal 45-minute presentations. These are brief talks,
ranging anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes, that talk about
anything from tips, tricks, to glimpses into technologies, etc. As long
as the topics for these talks are interesting, they will be
entertained.

way too off-topic:

        * 5 minutes for Question and Answer session

Speakers appearing for "Lightening Talks" will be given:

        * 5-to-15 minutes, and
        * Additional 5 minutes for Question and Answer session.

If a presentation requires more time, the speaker should inform the
organizers beforehand.


[ -S P E A K E R S- ]

Speakers should indicate at the time of abstract submission which talk
they are going to present:  "Normal", or "Lightening".


[ -R E S O U R C E S- ]

Any additional presentational requirements should be communicated well
in advance to the organizers.  Speakers will be provided a microphone,
a laptop on which their presentations will have been saved and loaded,
a multi-media projector and a reasonably large projector screen.


[ -S P E A K E R S   F R O M   O U T S I D E- ]

Then, gently touching my face, she hesitated for a moment as her
incredible eyes poured forth into mine love, joy, pain, tragedy,
acceptance, and peace.  "'Bye for now," she said warmly.
