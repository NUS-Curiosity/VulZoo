Subject: Sql injection in BLOG:CMS

Hi,
There are some sql injections in BLOG:CMS v4.1 (and maybe before versions) ,
which can be exploited by both users and non user visitors :

The "xagent", "xpath", "xreferer" and "xdns" parameters are not checked
properly before passed to sql query in /admin/plugins/NP_Log.php .

The "pitem" parameter is not checked properly in /admin/plugins/NP_Poll.php .

The "pageRef" variable is not set properly for logged in users
in /admin/plugins/NP_Referrer.php .

Version 4.1.1 has been released (http://blogcms.com/) .

The original advisory (in Persian) is located at :
