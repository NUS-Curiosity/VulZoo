Synopsis
========

The OpenTTD server is vulnerable to a remote Denial of Service.

Background
==========

OpenTTD is a clone of Transport Tycoon Deluxe.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-simulation/openttd       < 0.4.8                   >= 0.4.8

Description
===========

OpenTTD is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to a flaw in
the manner the game server handles errors in command packets.

Impact
======

An authenticated attacker can cause a Denial of Service by sending an
invalid error number to a vulnerable OpenTTD server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenTTD users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-simulation/openttd-0.4.8"
