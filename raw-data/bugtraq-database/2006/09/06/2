Description:
    Previous versions of the openssl package are vulnerable to a remote
    unauthorized access attack when RSA keys with exponent 3 are used for
    authentication.  While this version of the openssl package resolves
    that vulnerability, it is generally recommended not to use RSA keys
    with exponent 3 for authentication because multiple implementations
    contain this vulnerability.  RSA keys with exponent 3 are not in
    common use.
