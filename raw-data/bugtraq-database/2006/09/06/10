Description:
  According to a vendor security advisory [0], Daniel Bleichenbacher
  described a possible attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures which affects
  the cryptography and SSL/TLS toolkit OpenSSL [1].
  
  If an RSA key with exponent 3 is used it may be possible to forge
  a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature signed by that key. Implementations may
  incorrectly verify the certificate if they are not checking for excess
  data in the RSA exponentiation result of the signature. Since there
  are CAs using exponent 3 in wide use, and PKCS #1 v1.5 is used in
  X.509 certificates, all software that uses OpenSSL to verify X.509
  certificates is potentially vulnerable, as well as any other use of
  PKCS #1 v1.5. This includes software that uses OpenSSL for SSL or TLS.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2006-4339 [2] to the problem.
