3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Internet Explorer, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's 
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a memory corruption error within 
the handling of certain exceptional conditions. This can e.g. be 
exploited by registering an exception handler for an object and then 
trigger a certain condition via e.g. a certain sequence of nested 
"object" HTML tags.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a 
user e.g. visits a malicious web site.

NOTE: This vulnerability is a variant of a browser crash bug 
initially reported by Michal Zalewski.

The vulnerability has been confirmed on a fully patched system with 
Internet Explorer 6.0 and Microsoft Windows XP SP2 (without MS06-021).
Prior versions may also be affected.
