    http://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-396
    http://lists.mysql.com/announce/364

Description:
    Previous versions of mysql server and client libraries contain
    weaknesses parsing certain character encodings (such as SJIS,
    BIG5 and GBK, but not ASCII) which, when using the vulnerable
    encodings, can enable SQL injection attacks against applications
    (particularly web applications) which use non-standard escaping of
    quote characters.
    
    Because vulnerable escaping of quote characters is no longer allowed,
    some existing applications may not function correctly when used with
    the new release of mysql.
