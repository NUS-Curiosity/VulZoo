Subject: [DRUPAL-SA-2006-006] Drupal 4.6.7 / 4.7.1 fixes
	arbitrary file execution issue

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drupal security advisory                                  DRUPAL-SA-2006-006
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advisory ID:    DRUPAL-SA-2006-006
Project:        Drupal core
Date:           2006-05-24
Security risk:  highly critical
Impact:         Drupal core
Where:          from remote
Vulnerability:  Execution of arbitrary files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
-----------
Certain -- alas, typical -- configurations of Apache allow execution of
carefully named arbitrary scripts in the files directory.  Drupal now will
attempt to automatically create a .htaccess file in your "files" directory
to protect you.

Versions affected
-----------------
All Drupal versions before 4.6.7 and also Drupal 4.7.0.

Solution
--------
If you are running Drupal 4.6.x then upgrade to Drupal 4.6.7.
If you are running Drupal 4.7.0 then upgrade to Drupal 4.7.1.

Make sure you have a .htaccess in your "files" dir and it contains this line:

SetHandler This_is_a_Drupal_security_line_do_not_remove

Contact
-------
The security contact for Drupal can be reached at security@...pal.org
or using the form at http://drupal.org/contact.
More information is available from http://drupal.org/security or from
our security RSS feed http://drupal.org/security/rss.xml.
