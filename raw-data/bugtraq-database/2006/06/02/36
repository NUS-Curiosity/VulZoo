Description:
    Previous versions of the firefox browser and thunderbird mail user
    agent have multiple vulnerabilities, some of which allow remote
    servers to compromise user accounts.  The firefox browser is the
    default browser on rPath Linux, and all users are strongly recommended
    to update firefox and thunderbird as soon as possible.
