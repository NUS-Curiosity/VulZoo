4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in MyBB, which can be 
exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

Input passed to the username field when registering isn't properly 
sanitised before being used in a "preg_replace" call with the "e" 
modifier in the "domecode()" function in inc/functions_post.php. This 
can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by first registering 
with a specially crafted username and then previewing a post 
containing the "/slap" string.

The vulnerability has been confirmed in version 1.1.2. Prior versions 
may also be affected.

======================================================================
5) Solution

Update to version 1.1.3.
