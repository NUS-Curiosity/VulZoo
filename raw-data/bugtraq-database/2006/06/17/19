Do you mean the PHP interpreter?  Or applications written in PHP?

I'm not sure how many vulnerabilities were in the PHP interpreter
itself, but it looks like it's about 150 or so.

Applications that are WRITTEN in PHP, however, probably cover 20% or
more of all reported vulns this year.  This is just a hunch - I don't
have any way of proving this.  Most PHP apps don't have "php" in their
name, and I don't know of a vulnerability database that records which
programming language was used for an application.  But the rest of
your email matches on "php" were probably PHP applications.

It's more appropriate to compare the PHP language to the C language,
or to compare Sendmail to various high-profile PHP applications.

>Do we have a new contender for worst security offender ever written

Over the years, the PHP language has made it very easy for
inexperienced application programmers to shoot themselves in the foot,
and it has features that even experienced programmers might not know
to defend against.  Sounds kinda like C, doesn't it?

One thing with PHP though, you don't need much training before you can
put together a usable program.  Powerful features plus lots of
non-expert programmers equals a lot of vulnerabilities, regardless of
the language.  PHP is slowly removing the most dangerous features, or
at least not enabling them by default.

I suspect that a large percentage of vulnerabilities could be fixed
with programming languages with built-in security considerations, and
an API that makes it easy or transparent to do safer programming.
