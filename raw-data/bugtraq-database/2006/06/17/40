Subject: Re: PHP Advanced Transfer Manager Download users password hashes


The phpatm support forum (currently down) advises administrators to put a .htaccess into the users directory with the following content:

# no one gets in here!
 order allow,deny
 deny from all

Furthermore the website recommends to rename the "users" directory and change the corresponding variable in the config-file.

These two things done, it is no longer possible to download the hashes.
