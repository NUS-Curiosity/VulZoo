Synopsis
========

WordPress fails to sufficiently check the format of cached username
data.

Background
==========

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based content management and publishing
system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/wordpress       < 2.0.3                         >= 2.0.3

Description
===========

rgod discovered that WordPress insufficiently checks the format of
cached username data.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
commands by sending a specially crafted username. As of Wordpress 2.0.2
the user data cache is disabled as the default.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All WordPress users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-2.0.3"
