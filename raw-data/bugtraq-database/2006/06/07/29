Subject: Re: IRM 019: MailMarshal 6.1 SMTP MTA Content Filter Bypass


This advisory is rather useless without the actual .reg file information. It's also rather asinine, since any content filter can be "bypassed" in this manner by simply encrypting a ZIP, RAR, or the archive of your choosing. This is the equivalent of saying "we have found a vulnerability in the Logitech wireless mouse, whereby if you double click to execute a malicious file, your system becomes infected. The vendor has advised us that we have a fundamental problem understanding how the internet and computers in general function. The workaround is to remove the batteries from the wireless mouse"

I'm quite disappointed in the recent lack of quality in Bugtraq's entries. Next we'll have end-users submitting bugs because their CDROM isn't a fully-functional coaster for their ale.
