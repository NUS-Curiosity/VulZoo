Classification:
===============
Level: [LOW]-med-high-crit
ID: HEXVIEW*2006*06*06*01
URL: http://www.hexview.com/docs/20060606-1.txt

Overview:
=========
Microsoft NetMeeting is an application that provides multipoint 
audio/video conferencing and supporting services (desktop sharing,
whiteboard, remote control, file transfer) for Microsoft Windows platform.

Affected products:
==================
All tests were performed using Microsoft NetMeeting 3.01
No other products were tested.

Vulnerability Summary:
======================
The application insufficiently validates received data opening a possibility
to overwrite portions of application memory causing exceptions ranging from
null-pointer access to a possible code execution. At the time of writing
there is no working exploit. HexView tests confirmed that it is possible to
remotely terminate an active NetMeeting presentation by either crashing the
hosting application or causing it to consume 100% of CPU resources.

Vendor Status:
==============

the issue. HexView will release more details about the vulnerability
in a separate disclosure.
