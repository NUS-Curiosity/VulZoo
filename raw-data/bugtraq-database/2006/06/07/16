Synopsis
========

Format string vulnerabilities in Dia may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Dia is a GTK+ based diagram creation program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/dia      < 0.95.1                            >= 0.95.1

Description
===========

KaDaL-X discovered a format string error within the handling of
filenames. Hans de Goede also discovered several other format string
errors in the processing of dia files.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted file, a remote attacker
could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Dia users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/dia-0.95.1"
