    http://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-397

Description:
    Previous versions of spamassassin have a remote unauthorized access
    vulnerability only in a non-default and very uncommon configuration.
    It affects only systems where spamd is used with vpopmail virtual
    users, via the "-v" or "--vpopmail" switch, and when the "-P" or
    "--paranoid" switch has been used.  Both switches have to be enabled
    for the vulnerability to exist.
