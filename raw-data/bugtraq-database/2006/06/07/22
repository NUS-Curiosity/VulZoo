Synopsis
========

Pound is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling, which could be exploited
to bypass security restrictions or poison web caches.

Background
==========

Pound is a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTPS front-end. It allows
to distribute the load on several web servers and offers a SSL wrapper
for web servers that do not support SSL directly.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/pound       < 2.0.5                          >= 2.0.5

Description
===========

Pound fails to handle HTTP requests with conflicting "Content-Length"
and "Transfer-Encoding" headers correctly.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending HTTP requests
with specially crafted "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers
to bypass certain security restrictions or to poison the web proxy
cache.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Pound users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/pound-2.0.5"

==========
