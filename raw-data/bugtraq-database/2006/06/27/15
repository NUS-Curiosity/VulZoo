But in the 1990s, Java was created.

Java applications exist.

Java servlets and applets also exist.

There have barely a *handful* of JRE/JVM security problems.

So the point of this is to say that new, modern, development
languages that are secure can be and are being developed and
used.  That PHP is relatively new with respect to computing
and has so many security problems should be an embaressment
to its developers and users.

Or to put it another way, if there are so many security
problems with PHP then the PHP development model or use model
needs to be seriously reconsidered and redeveloped such that
it is immune to such security issues.  This may, of course,
mean throwing away PHP and starting over (see C/C++ -> Java).

Oh, and btw, you forgot to mention fortran.
