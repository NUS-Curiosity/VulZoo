Description:
  According to a vendor security release note [0], a memory allocation
  attack possibility exists in the GnuPG [1] cryptography tool, version
  1.4.3 and earlier. The problem allows remote attackers to cause a
  Denial of Service (DoS) (GnuPG crashes) and possibly overwrite memory
  via a message packet with a large length, which could lead to an
  integer overflow, as demonstrated using the "--no-armor" option. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2006-3082 [2] to the problem.
