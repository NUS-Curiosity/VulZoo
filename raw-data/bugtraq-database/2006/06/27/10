Under Netscape 8.1 the link did nothing using the Firefox rendering
engine. However, when using the Internet Explorer rendering engine
an error window comes up;
Microsoft Visual C++ Debug Library: Debug Assertion Failed!
It has three buttons; Abort, Retry and Ignore.
Hitting Abort or Retry crashes the browser while Ignore closes the
window and nothing further happens.
