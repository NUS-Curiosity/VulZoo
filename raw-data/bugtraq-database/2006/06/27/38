                        Security Advisory

Advisory ID    : SYMSA-2006-006
Advisory Title : Lotus Domino SMTP Based Denial of Service
Author         : Ollie Whitehouse (ollie_whitehouse@...antec.com)
Release Date   : June 27, 2006
Application    : Lotus Notes / Domino
Platform       : Multiple supported platforms.
Severity       : Remote Denial-of-Service
Vendor status  : IBM has resolved this issue in Domino 6.5.4 FP1,
                 6.5.5 and 7.0
CVE Candidate  : CAN-2006-0119
Reference      : http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18020

Overview:

        Lotus Domino is a client/server product designed for
        collaborative working environments. Domino is designed
        for e-mail, scheduling, instant messaging and data
        driven applications.

        There exists a Denial-of-Service condition within
        NROUTER when parsing meeting requests. The result of
        which is that no external or internal mail will be
        delivered during the processing of the malformed
        message.

        This attack can be triggered from the Internet via
        standard mail protocols.

Details:

        When a malformed meeting request (vCal) is sent to a
        Lotus Domino based host via SMTP the routing server
        (nrouter.exe) will consume 100% of the CPU.

        In Symantec's testing on an Intel PIII with 256MB of
        RAM, 24 hours of procesing did not clear the message.
        Shutting down the server and restarting it does not
        resolve the problem due to the message remaining in
        the mail queue. The result of which is that the server
        returns to consuming 100% of the CPU.

        As stated above all e-mail functionality on the server
        will be disabled while the message is being processed.
  
Vendor Response:

        This issue was reported as 'SPR# KSPR699NBP' and has
        been resolved in Domino 6.5.4 FP1, 6.5.5 and 7.0. For
