 	Both of those would work in the case where the charset has
already been set by the server.  The problem is that most servers set a
charset by default.  The other bigger problem is that both of those (and
the META one) require that you inject HTML into the page to get it to
work.  If you can inject a style tag into a page you can embed XSS
