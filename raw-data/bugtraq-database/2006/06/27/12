Msn: I have worked with microsoft on several occassions and found it a huge drag to work with thier slow security response center. I found about 4 - 5 vulnerabilities on various websites in the microsoft network, and reported them in to the Microsoft Security Center. Itï¿½s been almost a year since, and 2 of them are fixed, The others still exist. These are completely exploitable as XSS vulnerabilities too.
