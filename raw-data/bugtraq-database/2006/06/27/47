It's not a meaningless question, it's a quite valid way to look at web
server extensions. You make it sound oh so simple "write secure code" but
I've been a hacker since 1980 when I wrote a bbs program in assembler and
tried to secure it. Writing secure code is anything but simple. It takes a
really good programmer to write code that is secure by design because you
have to understand exactly how the language and in some cases the hardware
you use functions.

A language for websites should never expect to have this level programmers,
heck it's a bunch of artsy web developers who are going to be using it so it
should take that into account and allow the machine administrator to at
least be locked down at the start so he has to enable the features and only
those features the web developers require. It's the only way to make a
powerful web language and still maintain some semblance of security.
