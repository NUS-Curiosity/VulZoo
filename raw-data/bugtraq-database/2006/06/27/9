Hi,

on (Gentoo) Linux with Firefox (same Version) it's quite similar.
Opening the page FF hangs for about 4 seconds with an CPU usage of about
20 up to 40% and than displays the page.
Clicking on the link I get the same behavior. The page source isn't
displayed correctly if you try looking at it.

Cheers.
