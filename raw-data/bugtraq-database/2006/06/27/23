See the RELEASE_NOTES:

	A malformed MIME structure with many parts can cause sendmail to
		crash while trying to send a mail due to a stack overflow,
		e.g., if the stack size is limited (ulimit -s).  This
		happens because the recursion of the function mime8to7()
		was not restricted.  The function is called for MIME 8 to
		7 bit conversion and also to enforce MaxMimeHeaderLength.
		                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
		To work around this problem, recursive calls are limited to
		a depth of MAXMIMENESTING (20); message content after this
		limit is treated as opaque and is not checked further.

For details see sendmail/deliver.c, just search for mime8to7().
