Subject: Re: [MajorSecurity #8]DreamAccount <= 3.1 - Remote File Include
 Vulnerability


Please update my advisory.
After posting up my advisory I have seen that 2 other php-files are also affected by this vulnerability.

Input passed to the "da_path" parameter in "auth.cookie.inc.php", "auth.header.inc.php" and
"auth.sessions.inc.php" is not properly verified, before it is used to include files.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code by including files from external resources.

You can see the updated advisory here:

David Vieira-Kurz
