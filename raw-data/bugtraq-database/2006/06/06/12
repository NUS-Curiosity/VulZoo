Probably because customers are not bugging them to much for it?  I've never 
used vnc-server on Linux or seen it used to be honest, and although it is a 
nasty problem it's easy to deal with (just firewall it to trusted systems or 
wrap a VPN around it). They are obviously aware of this issue (it was fixed 
in Fedora Core 5, reported by Mark J. Cox).
