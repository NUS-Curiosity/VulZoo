How is it that even though this vulnerability has been known now for
some time, Red Hat still has not issued a new package or security update
that addresses this?  On RHN, the most recent package I can find is
4.0.0 beta and the most recent security patch for VNC dates back to
December 2004.  Since Red Hat started distributing the package, why has
it not been kept up with?
