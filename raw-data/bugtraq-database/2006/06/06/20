In the source code for 2.1.1, many files have code like this:

  $mybloggie_root_path = './';

  include_once($mybloggie_root_path.'config.php');
  ...

so at least there isn't any obvious evidence of this issue, based on a
casual inspection.

Also - "scode.php" as mentioned by MHG does not exist in MyBloggie at
all, so maybe the site has been modified.
