Subject: Re: aXentForum II XSS vuLLn



The same executable (viewposts.cfm) and parameter (startrow) was
reported by r0t at 13:49 June 15, 2006, probably Finland time:

  http://pridels.blogspot.com/2006/06/axentforum-ii-xss-vuln.html

In fact, the Bugtraq post contains the following text, which is
exactly the same as r0t's blog entry as of June 21, including the lack
of spaces between the ":"

  vendor:http://www.axent.us/axentforum.cfm

  affected versions:aXentForum II and prior

  ...

  aXentForum II contains a flaw that allows a remote Cross-Site
  Scripting attacks.Input passed to the "startrow" parameter in
  "viewposts.cfm" isn't properly sanitised before being returned to
  the user.

  This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
  user's browser session in context of an affected site.


The Bugtraq reader is encouraged to search the vulnerability database
of his/her choice to determine which researcher is more likely to have
been the original source of this report.
