Synopsis
========

The artswrapper part of aRts allows local users to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges.

Background
==========

aRts is a real time modular system for synthesizing audio used by KDE.
artswrapper is a helper application used to start the aRts daemon.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  kde-base/arts     < 3.5.2-r1                          >= 3.5.2-r1
                                                          *>= 3.4.3-r1

Description
===========

artswrapper fails to properly check whether it can drop privileges
accordingly if setuid() fails due to a user exceeding assigned resource
limits.

Impact
======

Local attackers could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges. Note that the aRts package provided by
Gentoo is only vulnerable if the artswrappersuid USE-flag is enabled.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All aRts users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose kde-base/arts

==========
