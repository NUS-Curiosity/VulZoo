Subject: Re: file include exploits in nucleus 3.23


These files are not vulnerable,
I checked the codes of them and i see that for
action.php,
include('./config.php');			// common functions
include_once($DIR_LIBS . 'ACTION.php');

media.php,
include('../config.php');
include($DIR_LIBS . 'MEDIA.php');	// media classes

server.php->
include("../../config.php");	// include Nucleus libs and code
include($DIR_LIBS . "xmlrpc.inc.php");

DIR_LIBS already defined by config.php..

also for api_metaweblog.inc.php this is not working directly through browser it just have functions and i think you see that and thought its vulnerable.
function _newMediaObject($blogid, $username, $password, $info) {
...
...
...
		// - add file to media library
		include_once($DIR_LIBS . 'MEDIA.php');	// media classes
...
...
...
}
Please post correct vulnerabilities and be a real.
Dont post reports for being famous nowadays we are having this problem in BT mailing list.
Also please dont give me credits about your exploits. (Not for you SWEET) just for who send greetz to me.
