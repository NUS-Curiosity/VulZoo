Subject: Re: Bypassing of web filters by using ASCII


Agreed, nice find. Here are some perl scripts to do the transcoding (I called it asciilate.pl):

#!/usr/bin/perl -n
#enable 8th bit on ascii characters sent to stdin, output to stdout
foreach $c (split//,$_) {print chr(ord($c)+128)}

#!/usr/bin/perl
#as above, add content-type header to make it work in IE at the start of the output
print '<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=US-ASCII">';
while (<>) {foreach $c (split//,$_) {print chr(ord($c)+128)}}

#!/usr/bin/perl
#as previous, but only convert some of the input characters, making it look even
#more obfuscated than complete conversion.
print '<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=US-ASCII">';
while (<>) {foreach $c (split//,$_) {print chr(ord($c)+128*int(rand(1)+.5))} }
