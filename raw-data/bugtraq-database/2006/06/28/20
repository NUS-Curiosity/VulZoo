Subject: Re[2]: Is Windows TCP/IP source routing PoC code available?


Hi All,
At the request Microsoft I have not published the additional
information. I did not think, that the ZARAZA will publish simple POC
without my consent but to that to be, that to not pass. Denis you can
check up you system simple POC code from a site of the ZARAZA, only if
configuration system corresponds Windows 2000 + NAT a server. In all
other cases with services RRAS (Routing, VPN, Dialup Access) it will
not work.
