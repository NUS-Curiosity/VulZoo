Subject: Presentation: AT&T ISNN - "Case Studies in
 Finding Previously Unknown Vulnerabilities in Web Applications."


On Thursday, June 22, 2006, I taped a presentation titled "Case Studies 
in Finding Previously Unknown Vulnerabilities in Web Applications" for 
the AT&T ISNN Lecture Series.

The aim of the presentation is to cover a limited set of web application 
vulnerability types and show the impact of these vulnerabilities via 
real world cases.

For those interested, I have released the slide deck to the 
presentation. It may be found here:

The video lecture may only be seen through AT&T ISNN.

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,
Kenneth F. Belva, CISSP
