Subject: SyScan'06 Highlight - Is Phone Banking Safe?


This is a brand new presentation and its going public for the very first 
time in SyScan'06.


Marek Bialowlowy is a Polish security researcher based in Southeast Asia 
whose expertise is researching into mobile technologies like phone 
banking, wifi and bluetooth etc. In this presentation in SyScan'06, he 
will present his shocking findings in one of the most popular banking 
application.

Use of a telephone in banking is considerably widespread. The most 
popular is certainly the interactive voice response (IVR) technology, 
which has been adopted by nearly all major banks. There is also a new 
successor of this technology that is a mobile banking. It is mainly 
based on SMS or STK (SimToolkit) and the popularity of it is rapidly 
increasing largely thanks to the popularity of mobile phones. Certainly 
with benefits of new technology also come new threats which have to be 
addressed. Meanwhile, the old IVR based technology still lacks security, 
which questions the overall safety of using phone in banking services.

The presentation summarises results of comprehensive analysis into phone 
banking security and introduces never previously presented attack 
scenarios on phone banking systems, reveals the security weakness in 
phone banking systems of a major banks and explains some potential 
methods of minimising the risks.
