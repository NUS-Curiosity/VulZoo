Subject: Re: [funsec] Microsoft's Real Test with Vista is
	Vulnerabilities

Joanna Rutkowska has already found a way to subvert the Vista kernel and 
injecting arbitrary code into it. Guess what? no implementation bug and 
no system reboot required. she will be presenting her finding in 
SyScan'06 (www.syscan.org)
