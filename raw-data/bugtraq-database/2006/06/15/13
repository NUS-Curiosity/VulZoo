However, looking at the source code  as available on
http://scripts.ringsworld.com/chat-scripts/amr-talkbox/ , with source
files dated May 2005 and earlier, we have:


   $direct = "languages";									//--->	The folder/directory that contain the language kits.
   
   if ($lang == "eng") {
     include ("$direct/lang_eng.txt");
   } elseif ($lang =="ita") {
     include ("$direct/lang_ita.txt");
   }


in other words - not exploitable.
