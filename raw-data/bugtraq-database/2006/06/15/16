Synopsis
========

Vulnerabilities in PAM-MySQL can lead to a Denial of Service, making it
impossible to log into a machine.

Background
==========

PAM-MySQL is a PAM module used to authenticate users against a MySQL
backend.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-auth/pam_mysql      < 0.7_rc1                      >= 0.7_rc1

Description
===========

A flaw in handling the result of pam_get_item() as well as further
unspecified flaws were discovered in PAM-MySQL.

Impact
======

By exploiting the mentioned flaws an attacker can cause a Denial of
Service and thus prevent users that authenticate against PAM-MySQL from
logging into a machine. There is also a possible additional attack
vector with more malicious impact that has not been confirmed yet.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PAM-MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-auth/pam_mysql-0.7_rc1"
