Subject: Re: Several flaws in e-business designer (eBD)


A Bug in the eBD HTML editor has been discovered. It will allow an user to modify the images of the /imgfiles folder (the files raised in the option resources > images).

 
Oasyssoft, the producer, has installed the patch in all our servers, so all MyeBD users are updated since the end of may.
 
Anyway, you will find here the emergency Patch instalation http://lists.oasyssoft.com/ebd-devel/200605/binNr7awTFdvt.bin  for being installed at your servers. Althought this patch is for version 3.1.4, it is also available in all eBD versions.

The other mentioned vulnerabilities have no relation to eBD. System Managers are in charge of configuring their servers in a secure way, whether or not they are executing eBD .

If you require further information, please contact us at ebd.soporte@...yssoft.com.
