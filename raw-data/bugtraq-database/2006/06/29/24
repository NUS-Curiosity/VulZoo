====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in phpRaid, which
can be exploited by malicious people to conduct SQL injection attacks or
to compromise a vulnerable system.

1) Input passed to the "raid_id" parameter in view.php is not properly
sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to
manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

The vulnerability has been confirmed in version 3.0.4. Prior versions
may also be affected.

2) Input passed via the URL is not properly sanitised before being used
in a SQL query in the "log_hack()" function in
includes/functions_logging.php. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL
queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

The vulnerability has been confirmed in version 3.0.5. Other versions
may also be affected.

3) Input passed to the "phpraid_dir" parameter in multiple files is not
properly verified before being used to include files. This can be
exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by including files from local or
external resources.

Affected files:
configuration.php
guilds.php
index.php
locations.php
login.php
lua_output.php
permissions.php
profile.php
raids.php
register.php
roster.php
view.php
logs.php (included in version 3.0.5)
users.php (included in version 3.0.5)

Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 3.0.4 and 3.0.5.
Prior versions may also be affected.

4) Input passed to the "phpraid_dir" parameter in announcements.php and
rss.php is not properly verified before being used to include files.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by including files
from local or external resources.

Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 3.0.6. Other versions
may also be affected.

5) Input passed to the "username" and "email" form field parameters in
register.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary
SQL code.

Note: This is only vulnerable if the option "phpraid" is chosen as
authorisation type. Successful exploitation can give an attacker access
to the administration section.

Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is enabled.

The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 3.0.6. Other versions
may also be affected. 

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Vulnerability #1 has been fixed in version 3.0.5, and vulnerabilities 
#2 and #3 have been fixed in version 3.0.6.

Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly verified and
sanitised.
