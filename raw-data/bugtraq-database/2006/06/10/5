Subject: Contensis CMS XSS vunerability


Hello,

I have discovered a XSS vunerability in the Contensis
CMS. 

Input passed to the "search" parameter when performing
a search and various fields when using the search isn't properly sanitised ...

The vendors own site was tested in Windows Internet Explorer - the search funstion did not work at all in my versions of Safari or Firefox:
http://www.contensis.net

Code example: <script>alert('hello world');</script>


thanks
