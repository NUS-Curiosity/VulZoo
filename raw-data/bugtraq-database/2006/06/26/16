This question does not really have any meaning. If you ask, if php
_applications_ are secure by default, the answer is of course "it
depends" (most php applications are broken. Just do a 
"grep -R eval ." and see for yourself)

The php safe_mode is not really safe. magic_quotes_gpc is broken by
design. Where does that leave us? Write secure code, validate all input
or get hacked, as is the case with every other software/language.
