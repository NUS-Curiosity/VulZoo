no, it is definitely not.

with things like allow_url_fopen [1] defaulting to true which allows
remote scripts to be include()d, safe mode being off [2], functions
like system() and shell_exec() allowing the script to execute random
programs on the webserver, things are not quite there yet.

Mrten.

[1] http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.filesystem.php#ini.allow-url-fopen
[2] yes, i know it's an ugly workaround. it's a useful one, though.
