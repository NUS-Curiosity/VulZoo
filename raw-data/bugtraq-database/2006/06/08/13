Subject: Mafia Moblog Full Path Disclosure / SQL injection


Produce : Mafia Moblog
WebSite :http://mafia.pearlabs.org
Version : 6 Full and Prior
Discovred By :Moroccan Security Research Team (Simo64)
IMPACT  : Manipulation of data, System access

[+] Full Path Disclosure :
The problem is that it is possible to disclose the full path to 'big.php','upgrade.php' by accessing directly.

Exemple:

http://localhost/moblog/big.php

Result : 

Warning: mysql_fetch_row(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /home/simo64/www/moblog/templates/match plus/big.php on line 54

[+] SQL Injection :

Input passed to 'img' parameters in 'big.php' is not properly sanitised
before being used in an SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

[-] Vulnerable Code in 'templates/match plus/big.php' :
****************************
52  $query = "SELECT * FROM $table WHERE id=$img";
53  $result = mysql_query($query);
54  $row = mysql_fetch_row($result);
***************************

[-] Exploit : http://localhost//moblog/big.php?img=[SQL]&pg=1
