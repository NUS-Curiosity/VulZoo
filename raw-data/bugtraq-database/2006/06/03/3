Oh, OK - now that makes sense.  This looks like one aspect of the
"globals overwrite" problem as originally documented by Stefan Esser
in the article "$GLOBALS Overwrite and it's Consequences"

  http://www.hardened-php.net/index.76.html

The article mentions extract() as well, and the behavior differs
between PHP4 and PHP5.


With respect to variables that seem to be cleansed - I've seen this
odd behavior once or twice before, but I don't remember the specifics
and can't dig up the Bugtraq post :-(
