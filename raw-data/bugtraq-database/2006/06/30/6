Synopsis
========

A security vulnerability in the iaxclient library could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code by a remote attacker.

Background
==========

Kiax is a graphical softphone supporting the IAX protocol (Inter
Asterisk eXchange), which allows PC users to make VoIP calls to
Asterisk servers.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/kiax     < 0.8.5_p1                          >= 0.8.5_p1

Description
===========

The iax_net_read function in the iaxclient library fails to properly
handle IAX2 packets with truncated full frames or mini-frames. These
frames are detected in a length check but processed anyway, leading to
buffer overflows.

Impact
======

By sending a specially crafted IAX2 packet, an attacker could execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Kiax.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Kiax users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/kiax-0.8.5_p1"
