As a systems administrator, I must say that your methods are 
unacceptable. You are violating your customers' trust by doing this 
without their knowledge. You even made an effort to hide the code that 
sends the information! This is outright deceit and should not be 
tolerated by anyone.

Regardless of your motives, this deceitfulness must be exposed for all 
to know about.

Perhaps you should trust your customers more. As word of this gets out, 
you are likely to have a lot fewer of them. I just feel sorry for those 
who do not find out in time and have their systems compromised because 
login credentials and other information were sent clear-text over the 
Internet.
