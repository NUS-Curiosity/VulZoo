Hello -

The Cisco PSIRT has posted a public response to a vulnerability made
public by a researcher on multiple public mailing lists.

This is the Cisco PSIRT response to the statements made by Darren
Bounds in his advisory: Cisco Secure ACS Weak Session Management
Vulnerability. The original email/advisory is available at
http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2006-06/0618.html
and
http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2006-June/047301.html

This issue is being tracked by Cisco Bug IDs CSCse26754 and
CSCse26719.

The attacks described in the report take advantage of a weakness in
the default configuration of the Cisco ACS.  Cisco is investigating
this issue and further detail will be added to the Cisco Security
Response as it becomes available.

Cisco's statement and further information are available on the Cisco
public website at
