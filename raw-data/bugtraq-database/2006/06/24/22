Subject: Re: Amazon, MSN vulns and.. Yes, we know! Most
	sites have vulnerabilities


Yes, I realize Milw0rm is simply posting exploits sent to them. I didn't
mean to make it sound like I was putting down Milw0rm, I am just concerned
about the number of 0day's coming out.  But, this did make me think.  Maybe
a site like this should take exploit submissions via a web based form where
the submitter has to sign an agreement stating something to the affect of:

If you are submitting an exploit for a vulnerability you discovered and did
not responsibly disclose to the vendor you are a meanie.  If you did and
they chose not to address it you are a cool person.

I agree we need to see these things if they are going to be floating around.
I just wish people would be be more responsible when they discover a
vulnerability and develop an exploit for it. Try to let the vendor know
first.
