Synopsis
========

The JPEG library is vulnerable to a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

The JPEG library is able to load, handle and manipulate images in the
JPEG format.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/jpeg       < 6b-r7                            >= 6b-r7

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Auditing Team discovered that the
vulnerable JPEG library ebuilds compile JPEG without the --maxmem
feature which is not recommended.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to load a specially crafted JPEG image file an
attacker could cause a Denial of Service, due to memory exhaustion.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

JPEG users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/jpeg-6b-r7"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
