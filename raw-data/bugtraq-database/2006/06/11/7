** What is No cON Name 2006 **

This congress is thought for system and network administrators,
programmers, experts and/or security auditors, and also independent
self-taught computer security experts.

All of them with the same objective: to share and understand new and
different systems that actually form the world networks.

Their motivation is curiosity and the need to read again the information
already seen about the computer security field. After the advances and
the modifications of a quest for perfection in a promising field, we
think it's very important to understand all the new information that
accumulates day by day.

In a society that is everyday more computer-dependent, computer security
gets a higher importance in thousands of companies and people.
If we analyze the complexity of a computer system, that is a help resort
or a work tool for this professionals, we easily get to the conclusion
that, when the market requirement increases, this professionals work
tools get affected, what turns into a basic need, improve before the
competitors.
