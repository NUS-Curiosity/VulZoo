Synopsis
========

VNC servers created with LibVNCServer accept insecure protocol types,
even when the server does not offer it, resulting in unauthorized
access to the server.

Background
==========

LibVNCServer is a GPL'ed library for creating VNC servers.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-libs/libvncserver       < 0.8.2                      >= 0.8.2

Description
===========

LibVNCServer fails to properly validate protocol types effectively
letting users decide what protocol to use, such as "Type 1 - None".
LibVNCServer will accept this security type, even if it is not offered
by the server.

Impact
======

An attacker could use this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access
with the privileges of the user running the VNC server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All LibVNCServer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/libvncserver-0.8.2"

==========
