Synopsis
========

GnuPG is vulnerable to an integer overflow that could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The GNU Privacy Guard, GnuPG, is a free replacement for the PGP suite
of cryptographic software.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/gnupg       < 1.4.5                            >= 1.4.5

Description
===========

Evgeny Legerov discovered a vulnerability in GnuPG that when certain
packets are handled an integer overflow may occur.

Impact
======

By sending a specially crafted email to a user running an affected
version of GnuPG, a remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running GnuPG.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GnuPG users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/gnupg-1.4.5"
