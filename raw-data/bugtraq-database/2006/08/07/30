TSRT-06-06: Computer Associates eTrust AntiVirus WebScan Manifest
            Processing Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems with affected installations of the Computer Associates eTrust
AntiVirus WebScan ActiveX component. Successful exploitation requires
that the target user browse to a malicious web page. The vulnerable
component is typically installed as a prerequisite to the free online
WebScan found at:

    http://www3.ca.com/securityadvisor/virusinfo/scan.aspx

The specific flaw exists during WebScan's processing of the actual
manifest files delivered during a scanner update check. It downloads a
'filelist.txt' file from this server, which is used as a manifest file
to describe the updates available. Each line of the file consists of
four fields in the following form:

    [file name] [decimal integer] [decimal integer] [decimal integer]

A lack of bounds checking on the file names specified in update
manifests may lead to a buffer overflow that can be easily exploited to
execute arbitrary code. As WebScan allows the server for update
downloads to be specified on a web page as an initialization parameter,
a malicious manifest can be delivered from any server; it is not
necessary to impersonate a legitimate update server.

-- Vendor Response:
Computer Associates has addressed this issue in the latest version of
their WebScan product. More information from the vendor is available
