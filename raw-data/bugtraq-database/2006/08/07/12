Subject: PHP: Zend_Hash_Del_Key_Or_Index Vulnerability

Hello,

word about this vulnerability is out for several weeks (or months). Because of this I spare you the
advisory and only point you to my little article describing what exactly this vulnerability is,
that I disclosed to the PHP project 6 months ago:

The rating for this vulnerability should be: Very Critical

Greets,
Stefan Esser
