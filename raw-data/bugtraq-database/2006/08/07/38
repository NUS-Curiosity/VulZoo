Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] Attacking the local LAN via XSS

;) absolutely no worries mate, maybe I wasn't clear enough... I was
referring to home routers. In general I am talking about devices that
have http or https communication channels. This is because of
JavaScript's limitations. Although, by using Java you can do all sorts
of other stuff.

regards

BTW, there are quite a lot cisco devices that have http open on local
LAN vulnerable to IOS HTTP Authorization Vulnerability.

It has been always a matter of security vs. accessibility. This is way weak
