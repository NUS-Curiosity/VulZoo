The 1st International Conference on Availability, Reliability and
Security conference (ARES 2006) has been succesfully organized in
Vienna, AUSTRIA from April 20 to April 22, 2006 by the Technical
University of Vienna in cooperation with the European Network and
Security Agency (ENISA). We have attracted 250 participants for this
conference with its 3 keynotes speakers and its 9 workshops held in
conjunction with.

In continuation of the successful 1st ARES conference, The Second
International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security
