Subject: XSS Vulnerability in FTD v3.7.3

There are some XSS Vulnerabilities in FTD v3.7.3 and prior.

XSS attacks (HTML / Javascript codes) will launch if they are submitted as a search in the search bar.

They will also be launched when sent as a mail to yourself or a victim.

Proof of Concept:

To make sure it launches, you just need to add a word or a normal character before your code.

Example: Hello <script>alert(1);</script> !

If you ignore this and you send you mail without adding a character before your code, you could get this problem:
If you send '<script>alert(1);</script>', 
it'll become 'Alert(1);'.
This is because the program wants to correct the first letter, it will try to make the first letter a capital one.
