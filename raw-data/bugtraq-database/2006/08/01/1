Synopsis
========

A flaw in mod_rewrite could result in a Denial of Service or the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet. The Apache module mod_rewrite provides a rule-based engine to
rewrite requested URLs on the fly.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/apache      < 2.0.58-r2                    *>= 1.3.34-r14
                                                            *>= 1.3.37
                                                          >= 2.0.58-r2

Description
===========

An off-by-one flaw has been found in Apache's mod_rewrite module by
Mark Dowd of McAfee Avert Labs. This flaw is exploitable depending on
the types of rewrite rules being used.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit the flaw to cause a Denial of Service
or execution of arbitrary code. Note that Gentoo Linux is not
vulnerable in the default configuration.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose net-www/apache
