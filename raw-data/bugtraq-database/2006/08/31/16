Subject: Compression Plus and Tumblweed EMF Stack Overflow

The Compression Plus library is designed to handle de/compression of
popular archiving formats such as ARC, ARK, PAK, ARJ, CAB, GZ, LBR, TAR,
TAZ, TGZ, Z, ZIP, and ZOO. The code fails to properly validate input
while processing specially crafted ZOO files, which results in a
stack-based buffer overflow. Software products that implement the
Compression Plus library are vulnerable to local or remote code
execution, depending on the nature of the calling process.
