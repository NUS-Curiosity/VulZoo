 Vulnerability

This vulnerability is not that dangerous because, firstly, if you want to exploit it, you must have  exact file tree and correct name of the malicious script because that variable is never used alone but always in concatanation with script name and generic extension and, secondly, if site has register_globals  set to OFF, you cannot use this exploit at all...
