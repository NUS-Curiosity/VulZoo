------------------- DESCRIPTION -------------------

An exploit exists in the above mentioned versions of XennoBB which
can be exploited by malicious users to conduct SQL injection attacks.

Input passed to the "icon_topic" parameter in topic_post.php is not
properly sanitised before being used in an SQL query. This exploit
can lead to manipulation of SQL queries by injecting arbitary SQL code.

--------------------- EXPLOIT ---------------------

Submit a forged POST request to

topic_post.php?action=post&fid={forum ID here}

With the following as the POST data:

form_sent=1&form_user={username here}&req_subject=Subject&req_message=Message&submit=1&icon_topic=[SQL]

Successful exploitation leads would lead to the SQL query in the icon_topic
parameter being run.

--------------------- SOLUTION --------------------

Ensure input is properly sanitized before being used in a database
query.
