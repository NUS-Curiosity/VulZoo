Subject: Re: BlackBoard Multiple Vulnerabilities (XSS)

FYI-

This XSS was discovered in Blackboard 6.2.x (compare to Windows 95 in todayï¿½s language). The current version of Blackboard in GA is 7.1.x

As for Pr0t0n; last I heard, he got expelled from Brevard Community College for messing around with their Blackboard system.
