Subject: Re: RE: linksys WRT54g authentication bypass

I use WRT54g v4 (firmware v.4.20.8)and try to the following command.
But I didn't exploit my router.
When I captured the normal packet with ethereal,
I only saw "POST /apply.cgi ....."
When I captured the exploit packet with curl,
I didn't receive a reply packet according to the exploit request but I received TCP FIN/ACK.
Is not my WRT54g v4 vulnerable?
