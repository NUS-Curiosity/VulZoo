Run the above as a server and connect to it using the in-built IRC
client. The Linux, Windows and OSX versions are vulnerable and others
may also be.

By embedding a redirect to irc://evilhost in a web page the browser can
be easily crashed. This requires the user to enter a nickname if the IRC
client hasn't been previously configured.

Enjoy,
NNP
