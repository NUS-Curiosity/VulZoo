Hi,

After doing a little digging, the Picasa 2.5 Beta only appears to only bind
to the localhost interface.  Outside attack hopefully wouldn't be an issue,
but I can forsee some serious conflicts with other applications running
locally on the user's PC if there's not a simple method of disabling this,
and I'm not seeing an option to disable this in the app itself.  Guess
that's why it's a Beta. :)

Thanks,
