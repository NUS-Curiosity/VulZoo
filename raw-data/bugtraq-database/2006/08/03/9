====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a security issue in PC Tools AntiVirus,
which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated
privileges.

The problem is caused due to the application setting insecure default
permissions (grants "Everyone" group "Full Control") on the "PC Tools
AntiVirus" directory and all child objects. This can be exploited to
remove, manipulate, and replace any of the application's files.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary commands with 
SYSTEM privileges.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Grant only trusted users access to affected systems.

Set proper permissions on the directory and all child objects 
(this may impact the functionality).
