We don't expect to be publishing simultaneous spam for the old flavors every
time we release the main version; essentially it propagates the idea that the
1.3 / 2.0 branches are actively developed and maintained.  We will likely fix
security flaws as they come up, but most of the time a single announcement
suffices.  (Oh, and check out the subject line too :)
