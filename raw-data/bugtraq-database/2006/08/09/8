-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists in the DirectAnimation.DATuple ActiveX control
when improperly calling the Nth() method. By supplying a positive
integer we can control a data reference calculation that is later used
to control execution. The problem is due to the lack of sanity checking
on the index used during a call to TupleNthBvrImpl::GetTypeInfo() in
danim.dll.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
