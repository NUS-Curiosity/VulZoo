Description:
------------

This is my simple one-file guestbook.
It's made of one .php file (the script) and one .txt file (the entrystorage file).
It uses no database just a flat textfile.
It is made so it's easy to include in any page.
It has admin login where you can edit and remove entrys.
Demo can be found at: http://php.xeroxer.com/simple_one-file_guestbook/demo/guestbook.php
Any help needed please mail me at: webmaster@...oxer.com
