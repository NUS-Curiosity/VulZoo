i still insist, it might be a minor glitch to NOT ALLOW even admins to
access a private file directly, but it isn't an issue with windows at
all!!!
I thought the the files should be accessed via "SeTcbPrivilege" BUT it
doesn't. )O;

but hey, most of  "the file undelete utilities" already do this.....
if you try reading/copying a EXISTING file (via sys admin privilage)
using (say Restorer2000 Demo) it effectively bypasses file permission
regardless if it...... & can read the file! there must be another
undocumented? API doing this???

another note, even WINDOWS ONECAIR is pron to this bug.
