Subject: Netgear FVG318 is vunerable to DOS attack

The Netgear FVG318 (http://www.netgear.com/Products/VPNandSSL/WirelessVPNFirewallRouters/FVG318.aspx) is vunerable to a Denial of Service attack where a flood of bad checksum TCP packets will lock the router up, forcing a hard reset.

This can be acheived with a program such as fragrouter or even an innocent program such as Azureus when sending/receiving a lot of bad packets.

I deceided to release this information after netgear seemingly uncaringly for their customers has deceided to not progress on diagnosing this bug for over 2 months.

My Firmware ver. = V1.0.40. Can anyone else confirm this with different or the same versions?
