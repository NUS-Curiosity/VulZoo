Synopsis
========

A flaw in WordPress allows registered WordPress users to elevate
privileges.

Background
==========

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based multiuser blogging system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/wordpress       < 2.0.4                         >= 2.0.4

Description
===========

The WordPress developers have confirmed a vulnerability in capability
checking for plugins.

Impact
======

By exploiting a flaw, a user can circumvent WordPress access
restrictions when using plugins. The actual impact depends on the
configuration of WordPress and may range from trivial to critical,
possibly even the execution of arbitrary PHP code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All WordPress users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-2.0.4"
