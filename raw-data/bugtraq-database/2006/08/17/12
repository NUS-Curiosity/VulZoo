Subject: World Summit on Intrusion Prevention

Dear Colleague,

I invite you to register for the World Summit on Intrusion Prevention
which will take place May 8-9, 2006 at the Hilton Columbia and Inner
Harbor, Baltimore , Maryland.  The Summit is co-located with the 2nd
Annual Web Services Security Conference.

In the past, our conferences

have attracted the cream of the crop. And, next year's conference promises
to be even better in attendance, quality of speakers, presentations and
activities.

For the entire conference information (including information on how to
present at the conference), please visit our conference portal at:

And, I encourage you to register now and take advantage of the early
registration savings.


Best wishes,

Susan Ogezi
Conference Coordinator
