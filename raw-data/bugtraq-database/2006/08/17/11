 - expect problems


Some interesting work.

For those who haven't made the connection yet - concurrency issues
probably go far beyond just web browsers.  It's a safe bet that *any*
software that's multi-threaded, multi-process, event-based, or
asynchronous could have these sorts of issues.  Traditional data
manipulation techniques probably won't be effective in finding them.

In other words - concurrency is a rich area for future research, and web
browser bugs are probably the tip of the iceberg.
