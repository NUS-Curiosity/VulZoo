With other words: You want to use parameter 'type' in 
plugins/plugins.php.

But in plugins/plugins.php we have

| <?
| 
| // add additional types to the below array.
| 
|  $avail_types = array('short', 'long');
|  $_SESSION['avail_types'] = $avail_types;
|  foreach ($avail_types as $type) {
| 	include($type . ".plugin.php");
| }
| 
| 
| ?>

As you can see is $type set to values of $avail_types,
which is intialized two lines above. So there ist no
way to manipulate either $type or $avail_types.

So there is no vulnerability, here.
