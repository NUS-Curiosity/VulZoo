Synopsis
========

ClamAV is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow resulting in a
Denial of Service and potentially remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.88.4                      >= 0.88.4

Description
===========

Damian Put has discovered a boundary error in the pefromupx() function
used by the UPX extraction module, which unpacks PE Windows executable
files. Both the "clamscan" command-line utility and the "clamd" daemon
are affected.

Impact
======

By sending a malicious attachment to a mail server running ClamAV, a
remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service and potentially the
execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
ClamAV.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.88.4"
