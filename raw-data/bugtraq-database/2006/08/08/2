Subject: Announcement: Feed Injection in Web 2.0: Hacking RSS and Atom Feed Implementations [Whitepaper]


"One new feature of "Web 2.0", the movement to build a more responsive
Web, is the utilization of XML content feeds which use the RSS and Atom
standards. These feeds allow both users and Web sites to obtain content
headlines and body text without needing to visit the site in question,
basically providing users with a summary of that sites content.
Unfortunately, many of the applications that receive this data do not
consider the security implications of using content from third parties
and unknowingly make themselves and their attached systems susceptible
to various forms of attack."
