Author: David Litchfield [ davidl@...software.com ]
Date of Public Advisory: 2nd August 2006
Advisory number: #NISR02082006F

Description
***********
Informix Dynamic Server is a database developed by IBM. During a security 
assessment of Informix multiple arbitrary command execution flaws were 
found.


Details
*******
It is possible to inject arbitrary operating system commands into the SET 
DEBUG FILE SQL statement and the start_onpload
 and dbexp procedures. Any commands injected into SET DEBUG FILE will 
execute with the privileges of the informix user; any command injected into 
dbexp or start_onpload will execute with the privileges of the logged on 
user.

Fix Information
***************
IBM was alerted to these flaws on the 6th January 2005. Patches have now 
been made available.

NGSSQuirreL for Informix, an advanced vulnerability assessment scanner 
designed specifically for Informix, can be used to accurately determine 
whether your servers are vulnerable to this flaw. More information about
