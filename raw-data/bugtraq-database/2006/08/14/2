Subject: Informix - Discovery, Attack and Defense

Hey all,
I've just posted "Informix - Discovery, Attack and Defense" to
databasesecurity.com. For those that would like a copy you can download it
from http://www.databasesecurity.com/informix-securing.htm. This paper is
derived from Chapter 11 from the Database Hacker's Handbook. The issues
discussed in the paper were covered at this year's Blackhat.
Cheers,
David Litchfield
