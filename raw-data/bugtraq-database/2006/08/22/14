Here a inclusion is possible. But since you include
your SHELL in a function you hat to start this function
after the inclusion.
And there is no call in this script. So this inclusion
is useles until you find a way to call the function.

>#mtg_homepage.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=    SHELL

There is no such file.
If you mean lmtg_myhomepage.php: This tests for direct
calls und dies. No way to include&excecute.
