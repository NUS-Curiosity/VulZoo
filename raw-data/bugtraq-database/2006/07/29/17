Synopsis
========

The adplug library included in Audacious is vulnerable to various
overflows that could result in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Audacious is a media player that has been forked from Beep Media
Player.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/audacious       < 1.1.0                      >= 1.1.0

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma has found that the adplug library fails to verify the
size of the destination buffers in the unpacking instructions,
resulting in various possible heap and buffer overflows.

Impact
======

An attacker can entice a user to load a specially crafted media file,
resulting in a crash or possible execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Audacious users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/audacious-1.1.0"
