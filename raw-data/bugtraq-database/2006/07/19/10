Subject: Re: XSS phpBB 2.0.21 in administration

I never quite get what the point of these reports are. Unless I'm
mistaken, in order to do *any* of those XSS attacks, you have to be an
admin already. At which point the attacks become pointless (as why XSS
when you can just nab a backup of their database?)

Are you going to go to, say, vB's style editor next and say "OMG you
can put XSS in it?!"

Here's a little secret, database restore options on any forum package
out there allows you to execute any SQL you wish! You just need to be
an admin to do it.

Pointless.
