Synopsis
========

The SHOUTcast server is vulnerable to a file disclosure vulnerability
and multiple XSS vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

SHOUTcast server is a streaming audio server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                           /  Vulnerable  /     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/shoutcast-server-bin       < 1.9.7           >= 1.9.7

Description
===========

The SHOUTcast server is vulnerable to a file disclosure when the server
receives a specially crafted GET request. Furthermore it also fails to
sanitize the input passed to the "Description", "URL", "Genre", "AIM",
and "ICQ" fields.

Impact
======

By sending a specially crafted GET request to the SHOUTcast server, the
attacker can read any file that can be read by the SHOUTcast process.
Furthermore it is possible that various request variables could also be
exploited to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim's
browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SHOUTcast server users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # 
emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/shoutcast-server-bin-1.9.7"
