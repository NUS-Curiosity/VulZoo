Synopsis
========

Multiple remotely exploitable buffer overflows have been discovered in
FreeType, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

FreeType is a portable font engine.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/freetype      < 2.1.10-r2                 >= 2.1.10-r2

Description
===========

Multiple integer overflows exist in a variety of files (bdf/bdflib.c,
sfnt/ttcmap.c, cff/cffgload.c, base/ftmac.c).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these buffer overflows by enticing a
user to load a specially crafted font, which could result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FreeType users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/freetype-2.1.10-r2"
