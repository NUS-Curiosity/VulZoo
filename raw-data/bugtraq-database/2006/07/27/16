Subject: Bypassing Oracle dbms_assert

Hey all,

Today I released a new whitepaper "Bypassing Oracle dbms_assert". This technique makes many already fixed Oracle vulnerabilities (SQL Injection) exploitable again.

URL:
http://www.red-database-security.com/wp/bypass_dbms_assert.pdf 
 
Summary:
By using specially crafted parameters (in double quotes) it is possible to 
bypass the input validation of the security package dbms_assert and inject 
SQL code. This makes dozens of already fixed Oracle vulnerabilities exploitable in all versions of Oracle again (8.1.7.4 - 10.2.0.2, fully patched with Oracle CPU July 2006). I informed Oracle about this problem end of April 2006. Oracle has no problem with the release of this information (�Oracle sees no problem with your publication of the white paper.�)
