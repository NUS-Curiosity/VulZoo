Overview:

A remote stack overflow exists in a range of wired and wireless D-Link
routers. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute privileged
code on an affected device. When a specific request is sent to an
affected device, a traditional stack overflow is triggered allowing an
attacker complete control of the router. With the ability to execute
code on the device, it is then possible to apply modified firmware, and
ultimately compromise the entire network.

The Universal Plug and Play (uPnP) stack on many D-Link devices is
vulnerable to a traditional remote stack overflow. This vulnerability
exists on the Local Area Network (LAN) interface of affected D-Link
devices. Due to the ease in which one can gain access to the LAN
interface of wireless devices, this attack is remote in nature.

Technical Details:

The vulnerability exists within the M-SEARCH function. By issuing an
M-SEARCH request with an overly long parameter (approximately 800
bytes), a stack overflow is triggered and an attacker can reliably
execute code of his/her choosing. This can be accomplished without
affecting network connectivity and without any signs of exploitation.
In some exploitation cases, the payload may require a soft-reset on the
device, interrupting connectivity for a brief moment.

The following request to UDP port 1900 will trigger the stack overflow:

M-SEARCH <800 byte string> HTTP/1.0

Information on exploiting vulnerabilities within embedded systems is
scarce. To successfully debug hardware devices you will generally
require external hardware for the debugging interface.

I will be giving a presentation at SyScan '06 (http://www.syscan.org)
that will demonstrate exactly how to analyze, debug, and exploit
embedded devices.

A previous lecture demonstrates the compromise of a network via an
exploitable router, these slides are available for download from:

Vendor Status:

D-Link has released updates for all affected routers and they are
available for download from the D-Link website. (http://www.dlink.com)
