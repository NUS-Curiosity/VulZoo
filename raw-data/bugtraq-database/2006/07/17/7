Subject: Re: Phorum 5.1.14 XSS SQL injection Vulnerability

About the Phorum security issues as reported by Ellipsis:

This problem was already detected and fixed by ourselves in the recently 
released Phorum 5.1.15.

This is *not* an SQL injection vulnerability. On wrong input for page, 
the internally used value of page would become -1, which was then used 
in a limit clause. This would in turn cause an SQL statement error.
There is no way in which this could be exploited for arbitrary SQL 
injection. Ellipsis probably did not check the code here, but decided 
they found an SQL injection vulnerability based on an SQL error that was 
returned by automatic vulnerability checking.

This problem was fixed in Phorum 5.1.15 as well.
