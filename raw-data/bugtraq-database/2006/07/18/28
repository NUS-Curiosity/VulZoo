Subject: Outpost Firewall Pro secrately fixing security flaws?

hello,
To my knowledge Outpost Firewall Pro 3.5.631 had a security issue
(say: 0-day) that An exception can be passed & then triggered  by a
local system user to the firewall resulting in a SYSTEM CRASH due to a
overflow flaw in filtnt.sys (firewall driver) I was testing it on
winxpsp2 (patchlevel latest) & other possibilities of remote
exploitation.

try experimenting with:

cmd.exe
c:\> mshta.exe longggggggggg string


After upgrading to Outpost Firewall Pro ver. 3.51.759.6511 (462) the
issue seems fixed.

so secret fix huh ?
