Yes, but this is actually in many cases bypassable through services that
do not use PAM, or do not consider a particular operation to constitute a
"session".  This may include Sendmail and other MTAs capable of delivering
to user-specified programs; Apache running scripts; and possibly SSH
executing non-tty commands or authorized_keys directives (though I haven't
checked the last one in a while).
