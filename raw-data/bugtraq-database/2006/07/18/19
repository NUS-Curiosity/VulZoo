Subject: 23rd Chaos Communication Congress 2006: Call for Participation

23C3: Who can you trust?
23rd Chaos Communication Congress
December 27th to 30th, 2006

Berlin, Germany

http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/


Overview
========

The 23rd Chaos Communication Congress (23C3) is the annual four-day  
conference of the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) on technology, society  
and utopia. The Congress offers lectures and workshops on a multitude  
of topics and encourages a critical-creative attitude towards  
technology. Since 1984, the Congress has established itself as the  
"European Hacker Conference" bringing together the brightest heads  
from Europe and all over the world.

We want you to join and be a part of this unique event which serves  
as a public platform for cross-culture inspiration and borderless  
networking. 23C3 is fun!


Topics
======

The 23C3 conference program is roughly divided into five general  
categories. These categories should serve as guidelines for your  
submissions and as a means of orientation for our visitors. However,  
it is not mandatory for your talk to exactly match the descriptions  
below. Anything that is interesting for our audience will be taken  
into consideration.


Hacking
-------

The 'Hacking' category addresses topics dealing with technology,  
concentrating on current research with high technical merit.  
Traditionally, the majority of all lectures at 23C3 revolve around  
hacking.

Topics in this domain include but are in no way limited to: network  
and system security, programming, hardware hacking, cryptography, and  
creative use of technology.


Science
-------

The 'Science' category deals with current or future objects of  
scientific research that have the potential to radically change our  
lives, be it basic research or projects conducted for the industry.

We are looking for talks and papers on the current state of the art  
in this domain, covering subjects such as nano technology, quantum  
computing, high frequency physics, bio-technology, brain-computer  
interfaces, automated analysis of surveillance cctv, etc.


Society
-------

This category deals with the state of society itself. Anything about  
politics and sociology with a relevance for hackers would go in here.

Possible topics could include wire-tapping laws, voting computers,  
surveillance practices, net politics, intellectual property and  
copyright issues, data retention, software patents, effects of  
technology on kids, impact of technology on society in general and more.


Culture
-------

Dealing with cultural mind expansion, this domain addresses the  
fringe of the technoverse. Examples are Discordianism, geek  
entertainment, video game culture, computer music, pixel art, and  
literature for hackers.


Community
---------

The Chaos Communication Congress invites developers, projects and  
activists to present themselves and their topics at the Congress.

Developer groups are also encouraged to ask for support to hold  
smaller on-site developer conferences and meetings in the course of  
the Congress.

Please follow the instructions given there.

Please make sure you have read all information on what to submit

regarding your submission, feel free to contact us at 23c3- 
content@...v.de but do not submit your lecture via e-mail.


Language
========

23C3 is an international event and we want to have a lot of  
interesting talks in English for the benefit of our growing number of  
international guests. So we are looking for speakers who can give  
lectures and/or workshops in either English or German. While we are  
interested in maximum quality of presentation, the topic and its  
relevance to our community are our main concern. The chosen language  
is not a criteria for accepting or rejecting a proposed lecture.

If you feel insecure talking in English, have received criticism on  
your language skills from your audience before, or if you just fear  
that the value and understandability of your lecture might suffer,  
please offer your talk in German. Please tell us if you are a native  
speaker of English or have similar skills, when submitting your lecture.


Lecture Requirements
====================

Lectures should not exceed 45 minutes plus up to 10 minutes for  
questions and answers. Longer timeslots are possible if we feel the  
topic demands it (please tell us if necessary). Workshops should  
include a talk on the basic principles and a practical hands-on section.
