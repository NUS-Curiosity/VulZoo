At my the ISP I used to run, we used a "chroot jail" so that every site had
its own little bubble that could not be broken through.  A cracker could
compromise a site and deface it or whatever, but could not traverse to any
other location on the server.  Therefore a customer could have the most
insecure php app around with a back-door in a "free" PHP module they got off
the Net and could be embarassed by a cracker but no-one else would suffer
including my BSD server.
