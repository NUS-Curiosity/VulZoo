Hi,

it's often difficult to find old versions of vulnerable softwares
it's usefull to have these old versions to test an exploit, study a 
vulnerability or doing a patch analysis...
it's also usefull to test a fuzzer, a scanner... for a course or a 
challenge...

so i think about to build a little reposiroty with old versions of 
little softwares (free or trial)

if interested or could help, please visit this page:

Cheers
