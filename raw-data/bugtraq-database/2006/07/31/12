We tried the Proof of Concept on our test machines and couldn't reproduce the reported exceptional behavior. The scenarios we tested were:
 - Windows XP Service Pack 2, <img> tag in Internet Explorer 6
 - Windows XP Service Pack 2, "Insert picture" in Word 2003
 - Windows XP Service Pack 2, display picture in MSN Messenger 7.0 and 7.5

In all cases, all we got were non-fatal "invalid picture" errors
