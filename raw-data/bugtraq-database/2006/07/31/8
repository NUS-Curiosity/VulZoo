Subject: Re: cpanel login problem

This was reported some months ago on the Cpanel forums:

http://forums.cpanel.net/showthread.php?t=45570

and is registered at Cpanel's bugzilla as bug #3392

http://bugzilla.cpanel.net/show_bug.cgi?id=3392

(Both links require registration.)

Although it seems they will fix it, it's not deemed to be a 
security problem. The username is taken from the hostname and 
access is granted only if the password is good for that user (or if 
you're using the reseller's or root password).

Regards.
