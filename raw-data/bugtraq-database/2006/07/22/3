No. AppArmor ships with SUSE Linux, but ports are available for
Slackware, Ubuntu, and Pardus Linux. I have heard of several ports to
Red Hat, but so far no one has chosen to release it. It is open source,
and you can port it to any Linux you like, as long as it has a 2.6 kernel.

That only jails all of Apache at once into a single large cell. AppArmor
can confine each individual PHP page separately. And each PHP pages'
confinement can overlap with others, allowing the components of the web
site to work together.
