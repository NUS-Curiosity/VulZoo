Subject: Re: XSS phpBB 2.0.21 in administration

I know what XSS is. I'm pointing out the fact that to do any of the
XSS items in the report given, you have to be admin (since they are
all in the admin panel). If you are in the admin panel of any forum,
then there's other things you can do than try fiddle about with XSS.
