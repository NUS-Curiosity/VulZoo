No, but I laughed because you are right. I hadn't thought of that.  

If anyone has any doubts about whether I'm using the right email
address, I'll be glad to send you a signed messaged with my PGP or
Verisign digital ID, or you can call me. I work for InfoWorld, so you
can email me there as well, roger_grimes@...oworld.com.

I assure you I already have the plaintext equivalents.

Roger

You probably are who you say you are, and you probably own the accounts
these passwords are from, but could not someone post a bunch of NTLM
hashes and ask the world to crack them for him? Even if he dint' own the
accounts?

So, is this a social engineering test as well?
