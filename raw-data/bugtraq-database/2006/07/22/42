Subject: Map MS Security Bulletins to MS KB numbers

I'm looking for a resource that maps Microsoft Security Bulletin numbers (such as MS06-033) to Microsoft Knowledge Base numbers (such as KB 917283). I recognize that this may be a one to many mapping since a single SB may point to a set of possible patches depending on OS version or application version.

While this utility <http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wul.html> can determine what hotfixes and patches have been applied to a given machine and displays the relevant KB number, for many folks the reference they more easily remember is to the Security Bulletin number and not the KB number.

For example, if you want to map Microsoft Security Bulletin numbers to CVE numbers you can look at:

<http://cve.mitre.org/cve/refs/refmap/source-MS.html>

or if you want to map Microsoft KB numbers to CVE numbers you can look at:

<http://cve.mitre.org/cve/refs/refmap/source-MSKB.html>
