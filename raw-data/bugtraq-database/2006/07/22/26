This is actually an old vulnerability in that it had been disclosed to 
D-Link for some time now.There were multiple hits,such as: 
Ddos's,exploitable holes in some firmware models,and seemingly,lack of 
response to holes in their firmware.
They do make some fine routers,switches,...But sometimes you need to at 
least admit vuln's to the public ie:If you are a large corporation and 
rely on D-Link to tell you there is a problem and here is a possible 
workaround,or not.
I don't won't to seem like I'm flaming D-Link,'cause I actually use 
their products.I just think a response to say ,"Hey,We have a problem 
with ....etc,etc
But it isn't only D-Link.
Just my HO(and probably more than 2 cts worth)
