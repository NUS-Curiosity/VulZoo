This exploit is bogus.  You are simply flooding the server
with new tcp sessions.  This is a generic attack where by you
open multiple sockets spawning new smbd processes.  An Admin
can easily defend against this "exploit" by banning your IP
or setting the "max smbd processes" option in smb.conf.

Sorry, but this has nothing to do with CVE-2006-3403.






cheers, jerry
