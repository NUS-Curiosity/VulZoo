Hey Martin , 
I agree with u partly but there are vendors out there
in the market who has Dont know DOnt care attitude. If
thats the case after idetifying and exploiting the
vulnerability in the same vendor product , I
personally would not like to waste my and your time
with vendor who did not give us fav response before. 
I would refrain from taking names but I have seen that
happening in the past and still some of those vul are
existing in those products.
However no one can deny Full Disclosure with
responsibility the responsible Disclosure !!!
Regards, 
TCP-FIN
