Subject: Re: Invision Power Board "v1.X & 2.X" SQL Injection


Note, none of these 'exploits' have any chance of working.

The CODE attribute is never present in an SQL query - it's only used in a switch statement to direct incoming 'traffic' to the correct function within a class.

Further more 'act' parameters: 'ketqua' and file 'coin_list.php' are not standard IPB 2.x features and must be third party modifications that IPS does not distrubute, endorse or support.
