Hi Christoph,

I'm not angry at all and I hope you are neither. Thank you for taking time 
and provide us with nice way how to duplicate the issue. Also to give us 
time to fix it before full disclosure which has not been used due to 
communication/organization issues. Anyway, points taken, we (MICO 
community) should provide single email address for all vulnerability 
reports. I've added JacORB notes in my original reply since I've thought 
you were also testing the issue with JacORB, perhaps I've read this in 
some of your files.

Thanks,
Karel
