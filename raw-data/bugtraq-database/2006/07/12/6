Summary
=========

NSFocus Security Team discovered a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft 
Excel's processing of SELECTION record, which allows remote attackers to run 
arbitrary via carefully crafted Excel files. 

Description
============

Excel does not perform sufficient check for certain field when processing 
SELECTION record. During some data copying operation the user-supplied data 
might be used for the copying, resulting in memory corruption and arbitrary 
code execution. 

Attackers can craft an Excel file with malformed SELECTION record and allure 
users to open it via instant messaging tools, e-mail or other vectors, resulting 
in arbitrary code execution with the privilege of the user. If the user is 
the administrator, then attackers might take complete control over the system. 

Workaround
=============

Do not open any Excel file from untrusted sources.
