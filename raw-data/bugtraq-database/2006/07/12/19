SMB Information Disclosure Vulnerability

CVE-2006-1315
_______________________________________________________________________________

�	Vulnerable System or Application

Microsoft Windows 2000
Microsoft Windows XP w/ Service Pack 1
Microsoft Windows XP w/ Service Pack 2
Microsoft Windows Server 2003

_______________________________________________________________________________

�	Vulnerability Information

This issue is caused by the Server protocol driver�s failure to zero out memory before reusing it when constructing SMB response messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request that when processed would result in a response packet being sent that unintentionally contained portions of memory from the target host. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly. It could be used to produce useful information to try to further compromise the affected system.
