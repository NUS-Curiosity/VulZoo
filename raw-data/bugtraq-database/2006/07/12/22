Author: Attila Gerendi (Darkz)
Date: July 12, 2006
Package: TOPo (http://ej3soft.ej3.net/)
Versions Affected: 2.2.178 (Other versions may also be affected.)
Severity: Password Reset

Description:

 It is possible to overide an existing entry posting a new entry with a previous entry ID. 
 The ID can be extracted from the main window links ex:
	http://[host]/[path]/index.php?m=top&s=out&ID=1152699749.6695
 The new entry will overide the original entry, also this will overide the original password.
 Another problem is the ID formath xxxxxx.yyyy where yyyy is the original (initial) password.
