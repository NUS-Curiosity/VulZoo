Package:             freetype
Vulnerability:       denial of service, arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:       Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      N.A.                     N.A.
OpenPKG 2-STABLE     N.A.                     N.A.

Description:
  Multiple security issues exist in the FreeType [1] font rendering
  library before version 2.2:

  An integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a Denial of
  Service (DoS) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors,
  as demonstrated by the Red Hat "bad1.pcf" test file, due to a partial
  fix of CVE-2006-1861. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  project assigned the id CVE-2006-3467 [2] to the problem.

  Remote attackers can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a specially
  crafted font file that triggers a NULL dereference. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2006-2661 [3] to the problem.

  Multiple integer overflows allow remote attackers to cause a
  Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly execute arbitrary code. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the
  id CVE-2006-1861 [4] to the problem. Parts of this issue the
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2006-2493, which is now rejected.

  Integer underflow allows remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service
  (DoS) via a specially crafted font file with an odd number of "blue"
  values, which causes the underflow when decrementing by 2 in a context
  that assumes an even number of values. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CVE-2006-0747 [5] to the
  problem.

  An additional flaw causes some programs to go into an infinite loop
  and this way cause a Denial of Service (DoS) when dealing with fonts
  that don't have a properly sorted kerning sub-table.
