Description:
  According to a vendor announcement [0], a vulnerability exists in the
  mod_rewrite module of the Apache HTTP Server [1]. Depending on the
  manner in which the Apache HTTP Server was compiled, the software
  defect may result in a vulnerability which, in combination with
  certain types of "RewriteRule" directives in the server configuration
  files, could be triggered remotely. The nature of the vulnerability
  can be Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially allow arbitrary code
  execution. This issue only affects installations using a "RewriteRule"
  with the following characteristics: it allows the attacker to control
  the initial part of the rewritten URL (for example if the substitution
  URL starts with "$1") or the RewriteRule flags do NOT include any of
  the flags Forbidden (F), Gone (G), or NoEscape (NE).
  
  This issue has been rated as having important security impact by the
  Apache HTTP Server Security Team. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CVE-2006-3747 [2] to the
  problem.
