The reason Oracle sees no problem with the release of the paper is that for 
your technique to work the DBMS_ASSERT.QUALIFIED_SQL_NAME has to be used in 
the wrong context; you simply wouldn't use QUALIFIED_SQL_NAME in this 
manner - i.e. within quotes. I've just had a quick look through the SYS 
packages and find no instance of DBMS_ASSERT.QUALIFIED_SQL_NAME being used 
this way. If there is such a case, in other words I've missed it, then it 
would be a flaw in the package/procedure/function itslef and not a problem 
with DBMS_ASSERT - with the fix being to use the correct DBMS_ASSERT 
function instead of QUALIFIED_SQL_NAME or alternatively use a bind variable.
