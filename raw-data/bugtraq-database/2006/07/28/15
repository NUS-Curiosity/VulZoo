Sorry to be pedantic but this is not a generic way (concept) of bypassing 
dbms_assert. Your method works only in those cases where the developer has 
misunderstood how to use DBMS_ASSERT and used the incorrect function. That's 
not a generic bypass technique for DBMS_ASSERT, imho. What you've found are 
simply flaws in the way the developer has attempted to sanitize user input. 
A generic bypass techinque for DBMS_ASSERT would work in all cases - even 
where the package is being used correctly. For example, passing the name of 
a VIEW as a parameter which calls nefarious functions could be employed as a 
bypass technique - but even this has its problems.
Cheers,
David
