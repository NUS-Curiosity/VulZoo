Synopsis
========

A large number of share connection requests could cause a Denial of
Service within Samba.

Background
==========

Samba is a freely available SMB/CIFS implementation which allows
seamless interoperability of file and print services to other SMB/CIFS
clients.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /   Vulnerable   /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-fs/samba      < 3.0.22-r3                        >= 3.0.22-r3

Description
===========

During an internal audit the Samba team discovered that a flaw in the
way Samba stores share connection requests could lead to a Denial of
Service.

Impact
======

By sending a large amount of share connection requests to a vulnerable
Samba server, an attacker could cause a Denial of Service due to memory
consumption.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Samba users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/samba-3.0.22-r3"
