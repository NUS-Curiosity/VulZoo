my opinion is that full disclosure is not for vendors .. it's for users.
full disclosure is for us to know how to react on certain threads. i
personally don't care about the vendors , although my company is a
vendor itself . we also produce software and we also care about security
of our software. but i expect users to post to security groups instead
of mailing me personally. If the vendor cares about his users he should
watch the security groups.

I believe in FULL disclosure
And i think this is the better way.
