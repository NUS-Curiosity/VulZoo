I chose those two quite deliberately because I'm pretty sure they
both get pretty good attention from hackers.  Others have mentioned
use some other OS, etc - not interesting.

What I'm looking for are trends.  Absolute numbers are uninteresting.

Or in other words, are people doing development responding (even if
it is delayed) to the number of vulnerabilities found ?

Are developers increasing the QA of their products in response to
increased vulnerabilities, leading to fewer in newer releases ?

And I think vulnerabilities disclosed are a much better indicator
of the changes to QA/development of products than any hyperbole
from those responsible (be it management or developers.)

I fully expect that both the Microsoft and Linux based platforms to
continue to be the most popular for web deployments and thus the most
interesting for hackers to target and vulnerabilities to be found.

What would concern me more here is if one platform was on the up
whilst the other was on the down.
