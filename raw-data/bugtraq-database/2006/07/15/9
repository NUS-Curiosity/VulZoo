Subject: crashing firefox <= 1.5.0.4

hi,

We send any file by the form with ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data"
and method="POST" when file upload successful try refresh page (F5 or
refresh button).

steps:
1) upload file by form
2) refresh page
3) firefox crash

example code:

<form action="" ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" method="POST">
        file name:<input type="file" name="filee">
        <input type="submit">
</form>

P.S. it works with html and php code.
