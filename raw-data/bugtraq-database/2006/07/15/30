There's at least one book out on PHP security.  Is there anyone here who
has used it and has comments?  I'm not experienced enough in PHP to judge:

Pro PHP Security

But that's only available if you're using Suse, right?  What about
hardened PHP, modsecurity, putting Apache in a chroot jail, that sort of
