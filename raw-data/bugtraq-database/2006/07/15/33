	No, I think vulnerabilities disclosed is simply a measure of how much
development and deployment is happening on the platform. period.

	This will always be the case as one platform changes in popularity
for deployments relative to another. 

	The simple fact is most of the MS/PHP/JAVA web development will be
being done by code monkeys, fresh out of school.. I'm pretty certain
they will "inbug" the same average number of bugs per line of code
they write no matter what platform it is. Development is often
outsourced to an external coding haus, written to a spec, without
complete info about what the whole final application is going to do.
Frequently they don't even reuse "mature" code from past releases
because you don't want to release it to the external people, or you're
too busy chasing platform-du-jour (Want a great example of this? I'm
betting Sun One, going from version 5 to version 6 is a good one)
