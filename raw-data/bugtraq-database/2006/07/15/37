Well, if that is what you think, I disagree and I think you're wrong.

And I'm sure the people behind openbsd would have a lot to say about
that statement of yours, too.

There are a lot of holes in that statement you've made there,
with many incorrect assumptions...where to start...
How about if the relative popularity is approximately to stable?

You're confusing what I'm interested in (platform security) with
the people who use the platform to develop on top of.  If the
foundations of what you're using are insecure, then the web
developer has a harder task.
