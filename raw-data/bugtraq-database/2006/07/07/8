Subject: WebEx Downloader Plug-in Multiple Vulnerabilities + rant


All these vulnerabilities were reported to WebEx by NGS Software back on the 
24th February 2005 along with some other issues.

The current Director of the X-Force new about these issues as at the time of 
their discovery, he worked with NGS.

Seeing as I'm the subject, here is another example whereby I found a bug (in 
Skype) except Pentest-Limited were credited with it's discovery - 
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/25/skype_vuln/  An extract from an 
email below from Kurt Sauer (Security Operations / Skype Technologies), 
shows that Mark Rowe of Pentest Ltd for some unknown reason had access to my 
email sent to Kurt.

In reviewing our mail archives, I see that you *DID* report the vuln (the
VCARD aspect) to us -- to ME, directly -- before Mark Rowe did.  However, I
(gulp) mishandled the e-mail.

As you surmised, it appears that Mark Rowe read that mail and found another
instantiation of the same bug, namely the handling of the command-line
parameters.

Completely my fault on that.  It will take one "push" cycle (typically less
than a day) to get a correction posted, but I will both correct our
announcement and also redistribute it with corrected attribution.

I should have asked you to CC security@...pe.net on the actual vuln report,
because mail sent to that address is read by more than just me.

Importantly, I am going to hire a dedicated incident manager (as fast as
our hiring practices will allow) so that there is someone spending full
workdays just handing inbound messages on this topic.


Could never be bothered before to make an issue of it.  But to sit on a 
large number of flaws in a vendors software product for 498 days and see 
other companies credited is a tad annoying :)

All the best

Mark Litchfield

>> DESCRIPTION:
>> Some vulnerabilities have been reported in WebEx Downloader plug-in,
>> which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's

>> site.
>>
>> The vulnerability has been reported in version 2.0.0.7. Other
>> versions may also be affected.
>>
>> 2) Some unspecified boundary errors in an included ActiveX control
