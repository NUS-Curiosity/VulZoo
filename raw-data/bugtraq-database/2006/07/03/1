Subject: Whitepaper: IT (in)security implementation in a real world example


Repost

Greetings to the list,

I have written a short paper on principles and failures of IT security
based on a real-world example of a (yet unpublished) issue with DB
CarSharing - a German car rental company. It discusses how security does 
fail in a flawed implementation.

Extract:

Preface

This paper is not meant to be a disclosure or accusation. Although it is
based on a true story and describes a rather concerning security-related
issue, its focus is the analysis of security issues in projects heavily
dependant on IT. Its primary goal is to serve as a guideline for people
intending to do better than today.

Story

For a couple of months now DB Carsharing is largely advertized as a
convenient car rental service (you can get cars on an hourly basis)
offered by a company named DB Rent – a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn -
throughout all German railway stations. However, this public service
becomes a potential danger to its customers – due to inherent flaws in
handling of sensitive data, insufficient user restrictions and
significant flaws in vulnerability management.

The paper can be found at
