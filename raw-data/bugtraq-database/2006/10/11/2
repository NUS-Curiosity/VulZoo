Description:
    Previous versions of the python package have two weaknesses that
    may trigger vulnerabilities in programs that use python.  Any
    program that uses repr() on arbitrary unchecked user-supplied
    unicode strings was vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack and
    may be vulnerable to a privilege escalation or unauthorized
    access attack, depending on the context in which it is used.
    Additionally, some programs that use email.Utils may have
    vulnerabilities which could have been exposed by a weakness
    in parsing RFC 2231 headers in those previous versions.
