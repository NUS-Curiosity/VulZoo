Subject: Re: phpAdsNew-2.0.8 <= (adlayer.php) Remote File Include

Sorry this report is bogus..
the only require/include statement that utilizes that variable is line 188:
require(phpAds_path.'/libraries/layerstyles/'.$layerstyle.'/layerstyle.inc.php');

The only possibility is local file include, with null byte bug in php interpreter.

But local file include is thwarted with a regular expression.
