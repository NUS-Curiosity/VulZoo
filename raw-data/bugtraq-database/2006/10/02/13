Subject: "POC 2006" by Korean hackers

The first international hacking & security conference by Korean hackers will be held 
in November 16 ~ 17. The conference is "POC 2006". POC means 'power of community'. 
We believe that the power of community can make the world safer. 
"POC 2006" hates just theoretical discussion. "POC 2006" concentrates on technical 
and creative discussion and will show real hacking and security process.
 
There are two sections in "POC 2006". One is 'Open Source' section. Through this,
new hacking and security tools will be introduced.  The other is technical presentation, 
in which new hacking and security techniques will be opened to the world. You won't be
disappointed at them. And you can have a chance to meet brilliant Korean hackers
who are not well-known to the world.
 
 
The keynote speaker is Richard Stallman. He will speak "Copyright vs Community in the 
Age of Computer Networks".
 

Technical section speakers and their topics are as follows:
 
* Jerry, "Virtualization Techinque for the Security of Web and Application"
