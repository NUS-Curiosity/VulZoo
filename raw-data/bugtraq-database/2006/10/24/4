Synopsis
========

ClamAV is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow potentially
allowing remote execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.88.5                      >= 0.88.5

Description
===========

Damian Put and an anonymous researcher reported a potential heap-based
buffer overflow vulnerability in rebuildpe.c responsible for the
rebuilding of an unpacked PE file, and a possible crash in chmunpack.c
in the CHM unpacker.

Impact
======

By sending a malicious attachment to a mail server running ClamAV, or
providing a malicious file to ClamAV through any other method, a remote
attacker could cause a Denial of Service and potentially the execution
of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running ClamAV.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.88.5"
