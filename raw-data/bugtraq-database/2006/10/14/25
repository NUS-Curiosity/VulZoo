Subject: Spoofing security dialog in object packager - 2

A few months ago, I found that in all versions of windows xp are vulnerable: In object packager, if one created a command line, eg "format a: /X" and wanted to hide it, leave the icon and label to anything, really, and change the command line to 'cmd /c format a: /X > ..\security_log.txt'. It will appear as "security_log.txt" in the dialog, and will have the same icon, mime type, description, etc, as a normal text file, but if you were to open it, it would pipe the results of "format a: /X" to something that is probably called "C:\docume~1\%username%\security_log.txt".
