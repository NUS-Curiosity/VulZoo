APPLICATION
  ezOnlineGallery
  http://www.ezonlinegallery.com/



AFFECTED VERSIONS
  Versions 1.3 and below


ISSUES
	ezOnlineGallery allows disclosure of certain data about
	the system it is installed on.
	
	1) Valid Path Disclosures
	By editing the album variable when the "show_album"
	action is called on ezgallery.php, an attacker can verify
	the existance of any directory on a system. The system
	will attempt to display an album if the path is valid,
	and will return	an error if the path is invalid.
	
	EXAMPLE:
	ezgallery.php?action=show_album&album=../../../../../etc/
	
	2) File Disclosure
	By editing both the album and image variables on image.php
	an attacker can view any JPG, BMP, or PNG that the apache
	process has read access to.
	
	image.php?album=../../home/jrluser/girlfriendpics&image=nude.jpg

WORKAROUNDS
	None at this time

SOLUTIONS
	Upgrade to 1.3.2 Beta
