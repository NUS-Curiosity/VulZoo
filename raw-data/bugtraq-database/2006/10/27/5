Insecure storage of passwords in Axalto Protiva


Critical: Less critical
Impact: Exposure of sensitive information
Where: Local system

Software: Axalto Protiva 1.1
http://www.protiva.axalto.com/
(Note: Vendor claims that it impacts only "non-commercial" versions or whatever that means in reality.)

Description: A vulnerability has been identified in Axalto Protiva, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain knowledge and manipulate sensitive information.

The vulnerability is caused due to storing application passwords as plaintext in files that are by default readable by all non-privileged users:

Keystore password in
(application directory)\KeyTool\keytool.config

Keystore password and Active Directory LDAP access credentials in
(Tomcat directory)\webapps\protiva\WEB-INF\classes\authserver.config


The vulnerability has been identified in version 1.1. However, other versions may be also affected.


Solution:
Set proper ACLs on the application directories. Restrict local login rights to privileged users.
