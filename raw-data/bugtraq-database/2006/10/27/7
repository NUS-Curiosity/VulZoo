Subject: Directory Traversal in TorrentFlux 2.1

Dorkfire.com Security Advisory
Discovered By: vooduhal@...il.com
Type of problem: Directory Traversal
Software: TorrentFlux 2.1
Software Description: TorrentFlux is a FREE PHP based Torrent client
that runs on a web server. Manage all of your Torrent downloads
through a convenient web interface from anywhere.

Problem description:
The dir.php script doesn't properly sanitize path passed via the "dir"
GET variable and also doesn't confirm where it's currently creating a
directory list for.

Example:
          http://target/torrentfluxroot/dir.php?dir=\.\./\.\./\.\./etc/
  will produce a directory list of /etc/
