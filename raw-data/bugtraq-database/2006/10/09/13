Subject: HITBSecConf2006 CTF Source code and daemons

Hello everybody HITBSecConf2006 is now over we had a blast and it was 
one of our largest
conferences. Every year along with the conference we run the 
Capture-The-Flag game and this
year we had teams from other parts of the world come and join us, teams 
like Zone-H from italy,
Dokdo-Kor (Padocon) from Korea, SIG2 from Singapore and hopefully next 
year we can have
more foreign teams and everyone is welcome to sign-up for our next 
year's CTF. Anyhow we have
released all the daemons' source code so people can try and write an 
exploit for it. So happy hacking !
and here are the source codes and other articles by the guys who setup 
CTF this year. And lastly all
the daemons was custom written for the game some of it was written by 
our attending speakers and some
by our in-house hackers :).
