Microsoft Word Memmove Code Execution

CVE-2006-3647
______________________________________________________________________

�	Synopsis

An integer bug (stack overflow) exists in the Microsoft Word file format. The file
format allows a attacker to create a malicious Microsoft Word document that when
opened, will execute arbitrary code.

RISK FACTOR: CRITICAL
______________________________________________________________________

�	Affected software

Microsoft Word 2000
Microsoft Word 2002
Microsoft Word 2003
Microsoft Word 2004 for Mac
Microsoft Word v. X for Mac
______________________________________________________________________

�	Vulnerability Information

The specific flaw exists during the processing of a malicious WordDocument file.
The overflow can be triggered during the parsing at offset 0xb4c in the WordDocument
stream. At this offset, there is a WORD size that is used as the third parameter
to a memmove call. If the size passed to memmove is > 0x8000, it will extend to
DWORD(0x8000 = 0xffff8001), and will copy 0xffff8001 bytes to the stack.

This is a code execution vulnerability that may be exploited to compromise users that
open a malformed Microsoft Word document.
