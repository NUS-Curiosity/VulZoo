4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a security issue in Lotus Notes,
which can be exploited by malicious, local users to manipulate
arbitrary files.

The problem is that Lotus Notes sets insecure default permissions
(grants "Everyone" group "Full Control") on the "notes" directory and
all child objects. This can be exploited to remove, manipulate, and
replace any of the application's files.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 7.0.2.
