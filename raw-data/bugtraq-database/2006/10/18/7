Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in Python's "repr()" function can be exploited to
cause a Denial of Service and potentially allows the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, cross-platform
programming language.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/python     < 2.4.3-r4                        >= 2.4.3-r4
                                                          *>= 2.3.5-r3

Description
===========

Benjamin C. Wiley Sittler discovered a buffer overflow in Python's
"repr()" function when handling UTF-32/UCS-4 encoded strings.

Impact
======

If a Python application processes attacker-supplied data with the
"repr()" function, this could potentially lead to the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application or a
Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Python users should update to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/2.4.3-r4"
