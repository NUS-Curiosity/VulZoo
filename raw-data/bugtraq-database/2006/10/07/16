Robert,

It is not illegal to pen-test web applications on your classroom
servers, and then as an exercise, check for web sites running the
vulnerable apps and send emails telling them of the vulnerability. 
This is not like pen-testing the company's web site without permission,
and your students will be thrilled to have something useful to do with
their fledgling skills.

Giving a talk on the vulnerability at the Black Hat convention might
get you fired from ISS though.
