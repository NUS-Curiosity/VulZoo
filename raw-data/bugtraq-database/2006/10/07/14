Subject: RE: Informing Companies about security vulnerabilities...

btw// these "real-world" analogies are like guinea pigs.

They haven't a darn thing to do with the subject.

The subject is the law, which is not clearly defined on
these matters, but in the US you'll get a smattering of
wire-related laws, intention, and intended use interpretations.

If intended use wasn't defined, then we default to California
law where judges have upheld "if you can't define it, you
can't defend it", but if it was defined, then that's a whole
other gray area that I don't think most of us on this pen
test list are qualified to analyze (myself included).

Ask a Jennifer Grannick

Now, the interesting question we SHOULD /be discussing/
on this list, is who is going to be our Ralph Nader?

Some of this stuff is simply unsafe at any speed.

Right now, I get to chose between competent professional
or whistleblower (assuming I am competent). Not both.
