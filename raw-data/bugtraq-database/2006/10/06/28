Synopsis
========

A buffer underflow vulnerability has been reported in ncompress
allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ncompress is a suite of utilities to create and extract
Lempel-Ziff-Welch (LZW) compressed archives.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/ncompress      < 4.2.4.1                      >= 4.2.4.1

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered a static buffer
underflow in ncompress.

Impact
======

An attacker could create a specially crafted LZW archive, that when
decompressed by a user or automated system would result in the
execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user invoking
the utility.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ncompress users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/ncompress-4.2.4.1"
