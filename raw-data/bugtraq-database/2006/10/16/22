Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.15.06: Clam AntiVirus ClamAV rebuildpe
 Heap Overflow Vulnerability

Clam AntiVirus ClamAV rebuildpe Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.15.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 15, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Clam AntiVirus is a multi-platform GPL anti-virus toolkit.  The main
purpose of which is integration into electronic mail servers.  More
information is available from http://clamav.net/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow in Clam AntiVirus allows
attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service condition.

This vulnerability specifically exists within code dealing PE (Portable
Executable) format files. While processing certain PE elements, two
variables can be very large and integer overflow could occur. This would
result in less memory being allocated than was expected by the
programmer and subsequent code would overflow the heap buffer.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation requires an attacker to send a specially
constructed executable file through a mail gateway or personal anti-
virus client utilizing the ClamAV scanning engine.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability on version 0.88.1 and 0.88.4
of ClamAV.  All previous versions are suspected to be vulnerable to this
issue.

V. WORKAROUND
