APPLICATION
  Eazy Cart
  http://www.eazycart.com/
  "Eazy Cart the easy to install shopping cart system"


AFFECTED VERSIONS
  All Verison


ISSUES
  Eazy Cart is vulnerable to authenication bypassing,
  data injection, and XSS attacks

	1) Authenication bypass
	Eazy Cart does not check login credentials past the
	initial login screen of the administration menu.
	
	Example:
	An attacker can access all administrative functions
	without authentication by going to /admin/home/index.php.
	
	2) Data Injection
	Eazy Cart trusts user entered data implicitly, allowing
	an attacker to adjust prices and other values when
	ordering.
	
	Example: A user can craft a malicious URL to submit
	incorrect data to easycart.php telling it to add items
	to its cart for incorrect prices, including negative
	values.
	
	3) XSS
	Eazy Cart trusts user entered data implicitly, not
	sanatizing it for malicious code.
	
	Example: A user can craft a malicious URL to submit
	incorrect data to easycart.php feeding it malicious
	javascript
