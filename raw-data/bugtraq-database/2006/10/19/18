Subject: Re: PhpBB<=2.0.10 (groupcp.php) Remote File Include Vulnerability

phpBB 2.0.10 was released on the 16th of July 2004, making it well over two years old. We are currently on version 2.0.21.

A quick check of the indicated file with the 2.0.10 tags in CVS shows that it is not vulnerable to this attack. Line 24 (which is the second line past the comment block) is $phpbb_root_path = './';
(See: http://phpbb.cvs.sourceforge.net/phpbb/phpBB2/groupcp.php?revision=1.58.2.21&view=markup&pathrev=release_2_0_10 )

Walking backwards through the CVS versions shows that this has never been possible with any version of groupcp.php from 2.0.0 to latest.

I would encourage anyone finding a possible vulnerability in phpBB to report it properly at our security tracker ( http://www.phpbb.com/security/ ), or e-mail it to security at phpbb.com
