this exploit still works with the latest Firefox 2.0 RC3

Hmmm after a quickie check of the website IE 7.0.5600.16384 i386 on
Windows Vista x64 also went down.  The x64 build of IE 7 pegged the CPU
at 100% while the i386 build of IE 7 only hit the machine lightly.
Overall both browser windows appeared to cause a memory leak as the
system required a restart to bring memory usage down to normal levels
again.
