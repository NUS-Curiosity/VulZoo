Subject: [DRUPAL-SA-2006-024] Drupal 4.6.10 / 4.7.4 fixes multiple XSS issues

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drupal security advisory                                  DRUPAL-SA-2006-024
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project:          Drupal core
Date:             2006-Oct-18
Security risk:    Moderately critical
Exploitable from: Remote
Vulnerability:    Cross site scripting
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Description
-----------
Multiple XSS (cross site scripting) vulnerabilities have been discovered.

A bug in input validation and lack of output validation allows HTML and script 
insertion on several pages.

Drupal's XML parser passes unescaped data to watchdog under certain 
circumstances. A malicious user may execute an XSS attack via a specially 
crafted RSS feed. This vulnerability exists on systems that do not use PHP's 
mb_string extension (to check if mb_string is being used, navigate to 
admin/settings and look under "String handling"). Disabling the aggregator 
module provides an immediate workaround.

The aggregator module, profile module, and forum module do not properly escape 
output of certain fields.

Note: XSS attacks may lead to administrator access if certain conditions are 
met.
