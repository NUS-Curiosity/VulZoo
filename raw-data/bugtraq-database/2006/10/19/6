Description:
  According to a vendor security advisory [1], a vulnerability exists
  in the Asterisk Private Branch Exchange (PBX) software [2]. This
  vulnerability would enable an attacker to remotely execute code as
  the user Asterisk is running under. It is not required that the
  "skinny.conf" file contains any valid phone entries, only that the
  "chan_skinny" module is loaded and operational (but which is not the
  default in OpenPKG's default Asterisk configuration).
