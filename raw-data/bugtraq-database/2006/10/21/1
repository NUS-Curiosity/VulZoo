Description:
  According to vendor security advisories [2][3][4], multiple
  vulnerabilities exist in the Drupal content management platform [1]:

  A bug in input validation and lack of output validation allows HTML
  and script insertion on several pages. And Drupal's XML parser passes
  unescaped data to watchdog under certain circumstances. A malicious
  user may execute an XSS attack via a specially crafted RSS feed.
  Additionally, the aggregator module, profile module, and forum module
  do not properly escape output of certain fields. [2]

  Visiting a specially crafted page, anywhere on the web, may allow that
  page to post forms to a Drupal site in the context of the visitor's
  session. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by changing
  passwords, posting PHP code or creating new users, for example. The
  attack is only limited by the privileges of the session it executes
  in. [3]

  A malicious user may entice users to visit a specially crafted URL
  that may result in the redirection of Drupal form submission to a
  third-party site. A user visiting the user registration page via such
  an URL, for example, will submit all data, such as the e-mail address,
  but also possible private profile data, to a third-party site [4].
