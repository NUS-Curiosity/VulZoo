Subject: TorrentFlux user_id Script Insertion

TITLE:
TorrentFlux �user_id� Script Insertion

CRITICAL:
Not Critical
IMPACT:
Cross Site Scripting

WHERE:
>From remote

SOFTWARE:
TorrentFlux 2.x

DESCRIPTION:
I have discovered a vulnerability in TorrentFlux, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks.

Data passed to the �users� array is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in an administrator�s browser session in context of an affected site when the �Activity Log� is viewed.

The vulnerability has been confirmed in version 2.1. Other versions may also be affected.

SOLUTION:

Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.

/admin.php

Line 416:

echo ��.htmlentities($users[$inx], ENT_QUOTES).�";
