Yes. SecuriTeam is currently assisting a researcher with reporting this
issue to Yahoo! security.

Yahoo! security responded in record time, as they often do, and are
working to resolve this potential security vulnerability.

An official report with full credit to the researcher who discovered it
will be released when the incident has been resolved.

A similar vulnerability was reported on the mailing lists a few months
ago, which has not been fixed. SecuriTeam assisted the researcher and
Yahoo! responded and fixed the issue in a matter of a day. Yahoo! are very
capable with security vulnerabilities in their software.

Thanks,

	Gadi.
