Description:
  According to a vendor release announcement [0], a vulnerability
  exists in the privilege separation functionality of the Secure
  Shell (SSH) implementation OpenSSH [1]. The vulnerability is
  caused by an incorrect checking for bad signatures in the sshd(8)
  privilege separation monitor and this way its verification of
  successful authentication is weakened. As a result the monitor and the
  unprivileged process can get out of sync. According to the vendor,
  this bug is not known to be exploitable in the absence of additional
  vulnerabilities. Additionally, OpenPKG's OpenSSH configuration for
  portability reasons has the "privilege separation" functionality not
  enabled by default.
