Cisco Secure Desktop Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 11.08.06
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Nov 08, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Cisco Secure Desktop allows secure VPN connections from remote PCs and
offers functionality to ensure PCs meet administrator approved security
policies as well as having features that securely wipe downloaded data
after disconnect.  More information is available on the vendors site at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6742/prod_release_notes_list.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an insecure permissions vulnerability in Cisco
Systems Secure Desktop product could allow privilege escalation attacks
to be conducted by local users.

When Cisco Secure Desktop Web VPN product is installed on a NTFS formatted
drive, permissions are set on all files to grant full control to all users.
Certain files run as a system service and can be easily replaced.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploiting this vulnerability allows unprivileged local users to gain
system-level permissions to their local PCs. Exploitation is trivial and no
exploit code is required. Binaries for locally running services can be
renamed while they are running, making exploitation straight forward.

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability exists on Cisco Secure Desktop
version 3.1.1.27. Previous versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Correcting the file permissions of the Secure Desktop installation
directory would prevent exploitation.
