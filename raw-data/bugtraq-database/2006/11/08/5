Conference
-----------
The 1st International Conference on Availability, Reliability and
Security conference (ARES 2006) has been succesfully organized in
Vienna, AUSTRIA from April 20 to April 22, 2006 by the Technical
University of Vienna in cooperation with the European Network and
Security Agency (ENISA). We have attracted 250 participants for this
conference with its 3 keynotes speakers and its 9 workshops held in
conjunction with.

In continuation of the successful 1st ARES conference, The Second
International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security
("ARES 2007 – The International Security and Dependability
Conference") will bring together researchers and practitioners in the
area of IT-Security and Dependability.

ARES 2007 will highlight the various aspects of security – with
special focus on secure internet solutions, trusted computing,
digital forensics, privacy and organizational security issues.

ARES 2007 aims at a full and detailed discussion of the research
issues of security as an integrative concept that covers amongst
others availability, safety, confidentiality, integrity,
maintainability and security in the different fields of applications.
