Subject: Lotus Notes pre-login User.ID key leak


Hello,

We have coordinated a vuln disclosure with IBM Lotus Notes security for
today, relating to an info leak issue with Lotus Notes where it is possible
to:

1. Retrieve User.ID keyfiles, without entering a valid passphrase (as is
normally required)
2. Validate existing Lotus Notes users login names

This issue affects Lotus Notes installs where port 1352 is open to an
attacker.

Updated software is available from IBM, and other mitigation strategies
exist.
