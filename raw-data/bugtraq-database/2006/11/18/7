Subject: Drone Armies C&C Report - 17 Nov 2006



This is a periodic public report from the ISOTF's affiliated group 'DA'
(Drone Armies (botnets) research and mitigation mailing list / TISF
DA) with the ISOTF affiliated ASreport project (TISF / RatOut).

For this report it should be noted that we base our analysis on the data
we have accumulated from various sources, which may be incomplete.

Any responsible party that wishes to receive reports of botnet command
and control servers on their network(s) regularly and directly, feel
free to contact us.

For purposes of this report we use the following terms
open	the host completed the TCP handshake
closed	No activity detected
reset	issued a RST

This month's survey is of 4189 unique, domains (or IPs) with
port suspect C&Cs. This list is extracted from the BBL which
has a historical base of 13405 reported C&Cs. Of the suspect C&Cs
surveyed, 649 reported as Open, 947 reported as closed,
and 755 issued resets to the survey instrument. Of the C&Cs 
listed by domain name in the our C&C database, 5847 are mitigated.

Top 20 ASNes by Total suspect domains mapping to a host in the ASN.
These numbers are determined by counting the number of domains which
resolve to a host in the ASN.  We do not remove duplicates and some of
the ASNs reported have many domains mapping to a single IP.  Note the
Percent_resolved figure is calculated using only the Total and Open
counts and does not represent a mitigation effectiveness metric.
