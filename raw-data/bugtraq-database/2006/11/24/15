Synopsis
========

ImageMagick improperly handles PALM and DCM images, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap
images, that can also read, write, and convert images in many other
formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/imagemagick      < 6.3.0.5                   >= 6.3.0.5

Description
===========

M. Joonas Pihlaja has reported that a boundary error exists within the
ReadDCMImage() function of coders/dcm.c, causing the improper handling
of DCM images. Pihlaja also reported that there are several boundary
errors in the ReadPALMImage() function of coders/palm.c, similarly
causing the improper handling of PALM images.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted DCM or PALM
image with ImageMagick, and possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running ImageMagick.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ImageMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/imagemagick-6.3.0.5"
