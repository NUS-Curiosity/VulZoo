Subject: Re: Cracking String Encryption in Java Obfuscated Bytecode

Hi,

If you want to distribute your app without people getting access to the
code itself, being on client or server is not relevant. Whatever the 
reason for wanting to do so.

So have cookies and javascript based web applications. Yet cookies are
used everywhere for anything/everything and "ajax" is the new big boy in
town. It is not because something is insecure that people don't use it in 
the real world, not the perfect secure one. 

You would be amazed of how many times I heard "it's useless to check again
the data on the [php|java|asp|perl] side, we already did it in JS" or "why
add a java middle-tier server side, we can obfuscate the jar file and have
the client PC talk directly to the database" (yeah sure, I'll make a 
public, unencrypted, access for you guys).

>From a security *threat* point of view, I agree that we could/should more 
of these issues.

Same goes with PHP BTW.
