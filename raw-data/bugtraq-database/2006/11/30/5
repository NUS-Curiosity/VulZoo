4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in MailEnable,
which can be exploited by malicious users to cause a DoS (Denial of
service) or compromise a vulnerable system.

1) A boundary error in the handling of arguments passed to the EXAMINE
and SELECT commands within the IMAP service (MEIMAPS.EXE) can be
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long
argument.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

2) An input validation error in the handling of arguments passed to
the DELETE command within the IMAP service (MEIMAPS.EXE) can be
exploited to cause a stack overflow and crash the service by sending
an overly long argument consisting of "*" or "?" characters.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Apply hotfix ME-10020:
