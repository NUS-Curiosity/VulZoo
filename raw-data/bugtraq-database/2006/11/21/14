Synopsis
========

TikiWiki allows for the disclosure of MySQL database authentication
credentials and for cross-site scripting attacks.

Background
==========

TikiWiki is an open source content management system written in PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/tikiwiki       < 1.9.6                          >= 1.9.6

Description
===========

In numerous files TikiWiki provides an empty sort_mode parameter,
causing TikiWiki to display additional information, including database
authentication credentials, in certain error messages. TikiWiki also
improperly sanitizes the "url" request variable sent to
tiki-featured_link.php.

Impact
======

An attacker could cause a database error in various pages of a TikiWiki
instance by providing an empty sort_mode request variable, and gain
unauthorized access to credentials of the MySQL databases used by
TikiWiki. An attacker could also entice a user to browse to a specially
crafted URL that could run scripts in the scope of the user's browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All TikiWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/tikiwiki-1.9.6"
