Subject: Which is more secure? Oracle vs. Microsoft

Hey all,
What started out as a fun project for me turned out some serious results - 
"Which is more secure? Oracle vs Microsoft" is a paper I put together 
looking at the number of security flaws in the Oracle and MS database 
offerings. For those that are interested, you can grab a copy of the results 
here: http://www.databasesecurity.com/dbsec/comparison.pdf
Cheers,
David
