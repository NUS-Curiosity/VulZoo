As far as I can see, the package diff for php4.4.4 
http://packages.dotdeb.org/dists/stable/php4/source/php4_4.4.4-0.dotdeb.1.diff.gz
contains the vulnerable patch as well.

I wasn't unable to find a security contact (or even A contact) on dotdeb's web 
site, nor I could find a version control system from which i could abstract 
easily the security patch in order to easily backport it myself.

As a dotdeb user i'm a bit disappointed, but i also know that's because i 
didn't check when i chose dotdeb as my php4 backporter for sarge, so i have 
very little to complain.

Anyway, will the maintainer provide updated php4 packages as well?

For those of you interested in upgrading today, here is a diff between the 
php4 mail patch and the new php5 mail patch: http://ca.pastebin.com/824455
