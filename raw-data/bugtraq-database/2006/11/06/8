Completely bogus.

If you look closely, the corresponding code in install.php3 is used to create 
a config file which contains a statement setting $repertoire (from a user 
input, so here is your injection attack for an install script, which is 
pretty much what you want, I'd guess). Anyway, if you don't delete 
install.php3 after the installation is complete, it's your own fault.
