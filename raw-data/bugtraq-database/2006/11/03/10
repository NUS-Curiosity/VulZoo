Synopsis
========

Screen contains an error in its UTF-8 character handling code that
would allow a remote Denial of Service or possibly the remote execution
of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1  app-misc/screen       < 4.0.3                            >= 4.0.3

Description
===========

cstone and Richard Felker discovered a flaw in Screen's UTF-8 combining
character handling.

Impact
======

The vulnerability can be exploited by writing a special string of
characters to a Screen window. A remote attacker could cause a Denial
of Service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running Screen through a program being run inside a Screen
session, such as an IRC client or a mail client.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Screen users should upgrade to the latest version:

     # emerge --sync
     # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-misc/screen-4.0.3"
