 IMA Service Invalid Name Length DoS Vulnerability

Citrix Presentation Server 4.0 IMA Service Invalid Name Length DoS
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 11.08.06
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Nov 08, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Citrix Presentation Server is a product designed to allow remote access to
applications over a network.  More information can be found at the Citrix's
web site:
http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/product.asp?contentID=186.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an input validation error in Citrix Systems Inc.'s
Metaframe Presentation Server 4.0 IMA service may allow an attacker to
cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The IMA (Independent Management Architecture) server component Citrix's
Presentation Server (previously known as Metaframe) contains an input
validation error in the handling of certain packet types. By constructing a
specific packet, it is possible to cause the service to reference an
unmapped memory address. This causes an unhandled exception, which in turn
causes the service to exit, resulting in a DoS condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow a remote attacker
to cause the IMA server component of the Citrix Presentation Server to
crash, preventing access to the resources being shared on the server.

IV. DETECTION

This vulnerability has been confirmed to affect Citrix Presentation Server
4.0.  Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is unaware of any effective workarounds for this vulnerability.
