Makes it no less remote.

Not _automatic_ remote, but still very, very much "remote".

You have a really odd view of the security exposure...

Even _Microsoft_ (now) self-rates this type of vulnerability as 
critical and remotely exploitable for execution of arbitrary code (e.g. 
the WMF vuln from late last year).  OK -- so we can quibble over 
whether it released patches quickly enough in that case (no), but at 
least even the traditionally considered slackest of security slackers 
gets the rating of the severity and scope of this kind of vuln right.

Any hope of Linux distro folk getting that clued?
