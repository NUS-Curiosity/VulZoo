Subject: Re: "Which is more secure? Oracle vs. Microsoft" (is it a fair comparison?)

Opinions are still... just that... opinions.

However Mr. Litchfield is in the category of expert that would be deemed 
an "expert witness" in a court of law.  His CV is impeccable, his 
factual research has much merit, his reputation in this area is 
unparalleled.

On the factual evidence of published/known vulnerabilities, the 
historically long time to patch, the revisions to released patches when 
they are found to not protect are clear evidence of a firm that needs to 
perhaps be a tad more security aware.  Those are clear historical facts 
in evidence in the public arena.

However, one cannot merely jump from the fact that Mr. Litchfield is 
beyond reproach to make his mere opinions into facts.

Expert witnesses are bound by the "Daubert test" these days (gotta love 
it when even the wikipedia has a link 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_Standard )

Given his  body of knowledge in database security, his  resume and all 
that, does his opinion hold more weight in persuasion more than 
practically anyone else on the planet?  Oh yeah.  But the parts that are 
true "opinion" are still opinion and not fact.

However, Mr. Stopmakingnoise's comment about Microsoft's extremely 
negative security records is also opinion, not quantified by facts. era, 
nor does in include an acknowledgment of our own responsibility in 
security. 

In databases, probably the most common and public security event 
affecting the database security world, I would argue, was SQL slammer, 
an incident that had a patch available ahead of time.  Granted it may 
not have been the easiest to deploy, but it was there.  In my opinion, 
those of us consumers of databases need to acknowledge own participation 
in security.  Having a vendor that takes security seriously is part of 
the equation, but buyers and implementers of databases need to do their 
part as well.  If our line of business applications won't support the 
newer, more secure databases, our data is still at risk.  And obviously 
if we're not patching those databases, we're even more still at risk.
