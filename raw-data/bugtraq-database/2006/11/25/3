David Litchfield is one of the most predominant security researchers in the
field, particularly in the area of database security.  He and NGS have
discovered more combined security vulnerabilities in leading DBMS products
than anyone else in the world.

Given this fact, I think that not only is it appropriate for David to give
whatever opinions he chooses in his research, but that it is his opinions
that actually give the research real, tangible, applicable value.  With his
indisputable status as an authority on database security and his unwavering
integrity, I have no problem whatsoever in considering Dave's opinions to be
"fact."

Any point that you may have had regarding "FUD" and "comments that are not
factual but one's own" were totally lost by this statement in a sadly ironic
way.
