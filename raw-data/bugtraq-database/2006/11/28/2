Subject: RE: Cracking String Encryption in Java Obfuscated Bytecode

Jim,

With all respect, I (partially) disagree with you:

True, but there are more reasons than just security for using obfuscation -
reducing (but not eliminating!) the risk of reverse engineering, protection
of intellectual property, etc.  So if you're saying "code obfuscation is not
critical FOR SECURITY" I agree, but not necessarily for other reasons.

Well, this is true - but it's the wrong reason.  As just about everyone on
this list knows, relying on the client side to do security enforcement is
inherently a losing proposition.  And obfuscating the bytecode doesn't make
client-side enforcement any more secure.
