Subject: Cursor snarfing - a new class of vulnerability and attack in Oracle

Hey all,
I've just written a paper detailing a fairly common PL/SQL programming error 
related to cursors that leads to a new class of vulnerability in Oracle. You 
can get a copy of the paper from http://www.databasesecurity.com/ .
Cheers,
