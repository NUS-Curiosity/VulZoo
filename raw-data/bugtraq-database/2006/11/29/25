Subject: Re: PHP Event Calendar 1.5.1 (index.php) Remote File Include Vulnerability

Systems that install 1.5.1 (fresh install rather than upgrade) should 
not be vulnerable.

Looking at the few lines prior to that:

   extract($HTTP_GET_VARS);
   if(!@...lude './data/global.php'){
	  echo "Can't open ./data/global.php";
	  exit;
   }

   extract($PATHS);
   include $path_to_calendar."calendar.php";


After successfully running 'install.php', the 'data/global.php' file
will contain something like this:

   $PATHS=array(
   "path_to_calendar" => "/[blah]/cl_files/",
   "path_to_calendar_img" => "/[blah]/cl_files/img/",
   "WEB_path_to_calendar_img" => "http://[site]/[blah]/cl_files/img/",
   "path_to_data" => "/[blah]/cl_files/data/"
   );


The include statement will use "/[blah]/cl_files/" instead of the 
user-supplied parameter in $HTTP_GET_VARS.

And, indeed, testing confirms that the static parameter is used and that
the reported exploit URL does not work.

Systems that have been upgraded from an earlier version in an improper
manner may be a different story.
