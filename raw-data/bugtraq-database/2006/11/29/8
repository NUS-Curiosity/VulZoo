I've been waiting awhile to see someone talk about this! :)

It is good to hear some conversation about XUL and WPF/XAML as these kinds of applications/technologies will change
the way we use the web. For those who know nothing about these technologies picture a windows application running
inside of your browser having the same look/feel as a non web application (a pretty applet). One of the initial concerns involves
the users inability to 'be aware of' application changes initiated potentially via XSS or other types of script injection.
One could XSS a site, change the URL to the sites RIA application to their own, and potentially act as a proxy with
the real application without the users knowledge. Does anyone know of any decent links/tutorials on signing XUL/WPF/XAML apps
to prevent such situations?

One of the neat .NET 3.0 features allows a developer to at compile time decide if an application is web based or standalone. So
for those of you who have written applets instead of modifying code you just change a compile time option.

"Finally, it is worth noting that Windows executables can be hosted in a window (by default) as well as in the browser. In both cases, the code remains the same and only needs to be compiled again with a different project property.
