Subject: Re: ProFTPD mod_tls pre-authentication buffer overflow

Hi

Can i get this straight, vendor was notified on the 16th of November, 
but this vulnerability has been part of VulnDisco since Jan 2006?  Is 
that actually correct?  This was known about ten months ago but not 
disclosed until now?
