Subject: Potentially OT: AJAX article

Dear all,

Please forgive the potentially off topic post, but please find below a link to a recent article concerning AJAX security I composed for Heise UK / c't, in the sincere hopes that it proves useful to anyone still even remotely interested in much hyped Web 2.0 technologies (or DHTML...)

Many thanks.
