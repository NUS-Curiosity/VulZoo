Introduction
============
admin.tool CMS is a content management system.

More Details
============
XSS:
Input passed directly to the "fSid" and "fSrcBegriffe" parameter is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Fix
===
None known

Solution
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
You should work with "htmlspecialchars()" or "htmlentities()" php-function to ensure that html tags
are not going to be executed. Further it is recommend to set off the "register globals" option in the
"php.ini" on your webserver.

Example:
$pass = htmlentities($_POST['pass']);
$test = htmlspecialchars($_GET('test'));
?>
