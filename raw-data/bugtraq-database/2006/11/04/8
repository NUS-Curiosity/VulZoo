Description:
  According to a vendor security advisory [0], the DNS server BIND [1]
  (versions up to and including 9.3.2-P1) is vulnerable to the recently
  discovered OpenSSL RSA signature verification problem for which the
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2006-4339 [2].
  
  BIND uses RSA cryptography as part of its DNSSEC implementation. To
  resolve the security issue, upgrade to the corrected OpenPKG packages
  and for both your KEY and DNSKEY resource record types, generate new
  RSASHA1 and RSAMD5 keys using the "-e" option to dnssec-keygen(8) if
  the current keys were generated using the default exponent of 3. You
  can determine if your keys are vulnerable by looking at the algorithm
  (1 or 5) and the first three characters of the Base64 encoded RSA key.
  RSASHA1 (5) and RSAMD5 (1) keys that start with "AQM", "AQN", "AQO" or
  "AQP" are vulnerable.
