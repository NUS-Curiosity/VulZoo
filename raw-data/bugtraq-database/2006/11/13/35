Subject: Old SAP exploits


For historical purposes only (everything should compile/run fine). An
TGZ archive is attached to this email, and a mirror is available on my
website : http://nicob.net/mirrors/sap_sploits.tgz

o testing users and passwords with RfcOpenEx (account locking bypass) :

- allow networked attack on SAP passwords
- now deprecated in favor of THC Hydra
- need the RFC SDK to compile
- port : TCP/3300+SYSNR
- exploit : sapchk.c

o customized RFC_SYSTEM_INFO (information disclosure) :

- will leak OS type, SAP version, real IP address, ...
- need the RFC SDK to compile
- port : TCP/3300+SYSNR
- exploit : sap-banner.c

o original Win32 gwrd bug by FX (remote command execution) :

- patched in 4.6D patch 1767 and 6.40 patch 4
- partial control on a CreateProcess() call
- can be used for "cmd /c ..." evil
- port : UDP/3300+SYSNR
- exploit : r3mote_win_UDPexec.pl

o linux port of the gwrd bug (remote command execution) :

- patched in 4.6D patch 1767 and 6.40 patch 4
- partial control on a execve() call
- each argument but the first must be max 8 characters long
- exploitable remotely under some conditions
- port : UDP/3300+SYSNR
- exploit : r3mote_unix_UDPexec.pl and r3mote_unix_wrapper.sh

o two bytes UDP crash in enserver.exe (remote DoS) :

- patched in 6.40 patch 6
- port : UDP/64999
- exploit : SAP_WebAS_UDP_DoS.c
- no, that's not related to the DoS published earlier this month

With many thanks to security@....com, the OaiTeam, FX from Phenoelit and
all the valuable Darklab members.
