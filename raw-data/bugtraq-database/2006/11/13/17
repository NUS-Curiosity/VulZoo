Subject: Re: feedsplitter considered harmful

Anyone look at the posted fix to this vulnerability yet?  From the http://chxo.com/software/feedsplitter/ website:

Sep 19, 2006:
    Mandatory Upgrade: Feedsplitter 2006-09-19
    Mandatory upgrade. This fixes the issues articulated in this post. I'm sorry this took so long to fix, the author was unable to contact me (or didn't try), and I don't follow bugtraq closely. Please click through for details and new code.
    This release fixes a damned embarassing directory traversal exploit, whereby an attacker could potentially read any .xml file readable by the webserver user, if they know the exact path.
    This release also fixes a potential cross-site scripting exploit.
    This release also removes a situation where an attacker could potentially inject php code into the RSS feed. I wasn't able to get this exploit to work, but the potential had to be addressed. This release does not eval() any part of the feed, ever.
   Finally, I added a built in test feed to prove that php and xss attacks cannot be embedded in feeds. I heartily welcome any additional tests, please let me know.
