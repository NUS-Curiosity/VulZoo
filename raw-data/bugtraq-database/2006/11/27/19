APPLICATION
  MBoard - PHP message board
  http://www.phpjunkyard.com/php-message-board.php

  "MBoard is a PHP message board script (a simple forum)."


AFFECTED VERSIONS
  Versions 1.22 and below


ISSUES
  MBoard does not check the Post ID for malicious data when replying,
  allowing an attacker to create blank files on the system wherever
  the web server has write access.

  Example: An attacker can reply to a message, and edit the "orig_id"
  variable to something malicious ("../../../../../../tmp/ZOMGHAX")
  mboard will then create the specified file (appending the
  configured extension.

WORKAROUNDS
	Enabling Magic Quotes will negate the issue.


SOLUTIONS
	Upgrade to version 1.3
