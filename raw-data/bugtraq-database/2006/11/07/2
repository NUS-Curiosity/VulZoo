>>From note #994630 : "ABAP customers can find the patches of the
standalone enqueue server on SAP Service Marketplace in the same
directory as the SAP kernel patches (disp+work, dw). J2EE customers will
find the standalone enqueue server for their engine in the same
directory as the SAPEXE package for their engine. The package in which
the standalone enqueue server is delivered has the name enserver.SAR."

I checked the SAP Support Portal, and I was effectively unable to find
patch 66 for version 7.00 (patch 136 for 6.40 is OK). I just send them a
mail about it.
