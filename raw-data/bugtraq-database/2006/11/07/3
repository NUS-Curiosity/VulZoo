Subject: Re: Advanced Guestbook 2.3.1 (Admin.php) Remote File Include

in admin.php we have

..........
$include_path = dirname(__FILE__); // <== 
require_once $include_path."/admin/config.inc.php";
require_once $include_path."/lib/$DB_CLASS";
...........

At line 21 the variable $include_path is setted as 'dirname(__FILE__)' so remote file inclusion is not possible :)

Regards
