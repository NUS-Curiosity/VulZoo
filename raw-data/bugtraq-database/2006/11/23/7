Subject: Re: Big Flaw in Firefox 2: Password Manager Bug Exposes Passwords

Dear fash1on@...il.com,

It  looks like in order to exploit this, attacker must be able to insert
form   in   content   of  exploited  site.  That  is,  to  exploit  this
vulnerability,  e.g.  crossite  scripting  vulnerability is required. In
this  case,  this  is  a  flow,  but not so big one. Is it so, or I miss
something?
