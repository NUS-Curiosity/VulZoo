 2: Password Manager Bug Exposes Passwords

Netscape Browser version 8.1.2 is confirmed as affected too.
Vendor was contacted on 23th november, 2006.

When visiting the PoC address the following URL (Chapin Information Services - Google Search) was generated:
http://www.google.com/search?q=Chapin+Information+Services&loginuser=testuser&loginpass=pass&x=467&y=642
listing the Username 'testuser' and Password 'pass' as part of URL too.

It is required that user will accept the Save New Passcard window with 'OK' and option Fill & Submit when visiting the site again.

Workaround:
Use "Never save login information for this site" option.

Password Manager is known as Passcard Manager in Netscape.
