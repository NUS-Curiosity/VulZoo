Synopsis
========

Bugzilla is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, script injection, and
request forgery.

Background
==========

Bugzilla is a bug tracking system used to allow developers to more
easily track outstanding bugs in products.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/bugzilla      < 2.18.6                         >= 2.18.6

Description
===========

The vulnerabilities identified in Bugzilla are as follows:

* Frederic Buclin and Gervase Markham discovered that input passed to
  various fields throughout Bugzilla were not properly sanitized before
  being sent back to users (CVE-2006-5453).

* Frederic Buclin and Josh "timeless" Soref discovered a bug when
  viewing attachments in diff mode that allows users not of the
  "insidergroup" to read attachment descriptions. Additionally, it was
  discovered that the "deadline" field is visible to users who do not
  belong to the "timetrackinggroup" when bugs are exported to XML
  (CVE-2006-5454).

* Gavin Shelley reported that Bugzilla allows certain operations to
  be performed via HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests without verifying
  those requests properly (CVE-2006-5455).

* Max Kanat-Alexander discovered that input passed to
  showdependencygraph.cgi is not properly sanitized before being
  returned to users (CVE-2006-5453).

Impact
======

An attacker could inject scripts into the content loaded by a user's
browser in order to have those scripts executed in a user's browser in
the context of the site currently being viewed. This could include
gaining access to privileged session information for the site being
viewed. Additionally, a user could forge an HTTP request in order to
create, modify, or delete bugs within a Bugzilla instance. Lastly, an
unauthorized user could view sensitive information about bugs or bug
attachments.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Bugzilla users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/bugzilla-2.18.6"
