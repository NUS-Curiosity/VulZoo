Synopsis
========

Flaws in WordPress allow a Denial of Service, the disclosure of user
metadata and the overwriting of restricted files.

Background
==========

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based multiuser blogging system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/wordpress       < 2.0.5                         >= 2.0.5

Description
===========

"random" discovered that users can enter serialized objects as strings
in their profiles that will be harmful when unserialized. "adapter"
found out that user-edit.php fails to effectively deny non-permitted
users access to other user's metadata. Additionally, a directory
traversal vulnerability in the wp-db-backup module was discovered.

Impact
======

By entering specially crafted strings in his profile, an attacker can
crash PHP or even the web server running WordPress. Additionally, by
crafting a simple URL, an attacker can read metadata of any other user,
regardless of their own permissions. A user with the permission to use
the database backup plugin can possibly overwrite files he otherwise
has no access to.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All WordPress users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-2.0.5"
