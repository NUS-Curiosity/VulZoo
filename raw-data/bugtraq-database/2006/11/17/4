-- CVE ID:
CVE-2006-5819

-- Affected Vendor:
Verity

-- Affected Products:
Ultraseek

vulnerability since April  3, 2006 by Digital Vaccine protection

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to proxy web attacks and scan
internal hosts through vulnerable installations of Verity Ultraseek.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the highlight script used to highlight
search terms on spidered pages. An attacker can directly access the
highlight script at '/highlight/index.html' to pass parameters to and
retrieve content from arbitrary URLs. The same script can also be
abused to enumerate otherwise inaccessible internal addresses and open
ports.

Ultraseek also exposes various information disclosure vulnerabilities
through the following scripts:

    /help/urlstatusgo.html
    /help/header.html
    /help/footer.html
    /spell.html
    /coreforma.html
    /daterange.html
    /hits.html
    /hitsnavbottom.html
    /indexform.html
    /indexforma.html
    /languages.html
    /nohits.html
    /onehit1.html
    /onehit2.html
    /query.html
    /queryform0.html
    /queryform0a.html
    /queryform1.html
    /queryform1a.html
    /queryform2.html
    /queryform2a.html
    /quicklinks.html
    /relatedtopics.html
    /signin.html
    /subtopics.html
    /thesaurus.html
    /topics.html
    /hitspagebar.html
    /highlight/highlight.html
    /highlight/highlight_one.html
    /highlight/topnav.html

Authenticated Ultraseek users can further abuse another vulnerability
to retrieve arbitrary file contents from the underyling server through
the '/admin/logfile.txt' script.
