Description:
  Miloslav Trmac from Red Hat discovered [0] a buffer overflow in GNU
  Texinfo [1]. The flaw was found in a function used by Texinfo's
  texi2dvi(1) and texindex(1) commands. An attacker could construct
  a carefully crafted Texinfo file that could cause texi2dvi(1) or
  texindex(1) to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when opened.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2006-4810 [2] to the problem.
