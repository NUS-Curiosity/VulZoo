Jon,
You failed to explain why would we take the time and knowledge to do this 
for you, especially when you requested the information to be privately sent 
only to you?

Greetings All,

First, I would like to apologize to those who received multiple copies due 
to cross posting -- I just wanted to ensure a variety of opinions.

On to business: I would like to do a little survey among the security 
professionals on this list.

Two Questions:
    1) What do you believe will be the next major new security threat that 
we will face in the next 12 to 18 months?
    2) What do you believe will be the top 5 (or 10, if your list is that 
long) emerging security threats we will face over then next 3 years to 5 
years? (Emphasis on 'emerging' -- threats not on most security people's 
radar today.)
