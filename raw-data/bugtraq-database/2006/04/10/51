Subject: Re[2]: Bypassing ISA Server 2004 with IPv6


Dear Christine Kronberg,

You are not right.

1. IPv6 is not installed by default.
2. If IPv6 is installed, routing is not enabled by default.
3. If  you  install  IPv6,  you  can be bind it to only interfaces it's
required. To prevent IPv6 (or another routable protocol, such as IPX) on
external  interface  you  can (and you should) unbind this protocol from
interface in network connection properties. ISA is not required for this
task and is not supposed for this task.

Again:  IPv4  and  IPv6  are  completely  different network protocol and
usually require different administration tools.

P.S.  offtopic is right, since Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2003 SP1 there
is a limited (in very few features) IPv6 support  for Windows Firewall.
