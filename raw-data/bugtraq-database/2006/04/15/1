Subject: Re: RE: IBM


This information is correct and the first address security-alert [at] austin.ibm.com mentioned is a primary reporting address.
This address is located at OSVDB Vendor database too;
http://www.osvdb.org/vendor_dict.php?section=vendor&id=1215&c=I 
listed as International Business Machines Corporation and IBM.

They will reply to abroad too (I have personal experience).

Juha-Matti
