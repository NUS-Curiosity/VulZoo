VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP-UX
running xterm. The vulnerability could be exploited by a local
user to gain unauthorized access.

References: none

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11, B.11.23.

BACKGROUND

To determine if an HP-UX system has an affected version,
search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
for one of the filesets listed below. For affected systems
verify that the recommended action has been taken.

AFFECTED VERSIONS

HP-UX B.11.00
=============
X11.X11-RUN-CL
action: remove PHSS_32109 if installed

HP-UX B.11.11
=============
X11.X11-RUN-CL
action: install PHSS_34102 or subsequent

HP-UX B.11.23

END AFFECTED VERSIONS

RESOLUTION

 ->For HP-UX B.11.11 and B.11.23

HP has provided the following patches to resolve the issue for
B.11.11 and B.11.23:

B.11.11 - PHSS_34102 or subsequent
 ->B.11.23 - PHSS_34159 or subsequent

The patches can be downloaded from http://itrc.hp.com

 ->For HP-UX B.11.00

To resolve the issue avoid using the potentially vulnerable
versions of /usr/bin/X11/xterm. The following are three methods to
replace the potentially vulnerable xterm.

1. If the patch listed in the Background section (above) is
installed, remove the patch from the B.11.00 system.
The patch listed is the only B.11.00 patch containing the
potentially vulnerable xterm.

2. Use /usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm.
For example:

cp /usr/bin/X11/xterm /usr/bin/X11/xterm.nosuid
chmod 555 /usr/bin/X11/xterm.nosuid
cp /usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm /usr/bin/X11/xterm


3. Use an X11R6 xterm available as a binary file.

The binary file is an X11R6 replacement for the potentially
vulnerable version of xterm, and it contains the same defect
fixes.

Customers who do not require the latest xterm may prefer to remove
the patch listed above instead. Manual action is required to
install the xterm binary file.

 ->For a copy of the B.11.00 xterm binary file please write to
 ->security-alert@...com.



MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
- ->For HP-UX B.11.00
Remove the B.11.00 patch listed in the Background section,
use /usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm,
or install the xterm binary file.
