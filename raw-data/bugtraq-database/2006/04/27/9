Can you confirm this? Doing a quick grep of the 1.0.2 source code finds no 
occurace of "viewpro" at all. The line above also happens to be exactly 
the same as your DevBB disclosure, suggesting this may be a bad cut/paste?

Additionally, in the subsequent posting you refer to additional scripts 
being affected:

/portfolio.php?cat_id=[XSS]
/portfolio_photo_popup.php?id=[XSS]

Secunia apparently wasn't able to validate all of the XSS but instead 
found one SQL injection issue: http://secunia.com/advisories/19813/

Can you confirm or clarify any of the above?
