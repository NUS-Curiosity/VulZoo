Firefox, and IE are not a problem. The problem is the AppleWebKit 417.9, and this is "only" used by Safari.

An example:
TextEdit is also using the WebKit. Post the code into a document and open it with Apple's TextEdit... <- will slow down and crash ;-) the same is with SubEthaEdit... <- both based on WebKit 417.9.
