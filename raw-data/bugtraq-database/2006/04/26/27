Subject: Re: Apple Mac OS X Safari 2.0.3 Vulnerability


All this does is cause Safari to allocate oodles of memory. It won't crash or hang the OS, just cause it to slow down due to VM paging. Wait a bit and the force-quit alert will appear (and/or Safari will crash when it runs out of address space.) Seems more of an annoyance than an actual security problem.

How do Firefox, IE and Opera respond?
