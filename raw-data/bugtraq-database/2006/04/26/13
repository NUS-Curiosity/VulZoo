Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla
Firefox.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2005-4134

    Web pages with extremely long titles cause subsequent launches of
    the browser to appear to "hang" for up to a few minutes, or even
    crash if the computer has insufficient memory.  [MFSA-2006-03]

CVE-2006-0292

    The Javascript interpreter does not properly dereference objects,
    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
    execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-01]

CVE-2006-0293

    The function allocation code allows attackers to cause a denial of
    service and possibly execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-01]

CVE-2006-0296

    XULDocument.persist() did not validate the attribute name,
    allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary XML and JavaScript code
    into localstore.rdf that would be read and acted upon during
    startup.  [MFSA-2006-05]

CVE-2006-0748

    An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day
    Initiative reported that an invalid and nonsensical ordering of
    table-related tags can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
    [MFSA-2006-27]

CVE-2006-0749

    A particular sequence of HTML tags can cause memory corruption
    that can be exploited to exectute arbitary code.  [MFSA-2006-18]

CVE-2006-1727

    Georgi Guninski reported two variants of using scripts in an XBL
    control to gain chrome privileges when the page is viewed under
    "Print Preview".under "Print Preview".  [MFSA-2006-25]

CVE-2006-1728

    "shutdown" discovered that the crypto.generateCRMFRequest method
    can be used to run arbitrary code with the privilege of the user
    running the browser, which could enable an attacker to install
    malware.  [MFSA-2006-24]

CVE-2006-1729

    Claus JÃ¸rgensen reported that a text input box can be pre-filled
    with a filename and then turned into a file-upload control,
    allowing a malicious website to steal any local file whose name
    they can guess.  [MFSA-2006-23]

CVE-2006-1730

    An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day
    Initiative discovered an integer overflow triggered by the CSS
    letter-spacing property, which could be exploited to execute
    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-22]

CVE-2006-1731

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that some internal functions return
    prototypes instead of objects, which allows remote attackers to
    conduct cross-site scripting attacks.  [MFSA-2006-19]

CVE-2006-1732

    "shutdown" discovered that it is possible to bypass same-origin
    protections, allowing a malicious site to inject script into
    content from another site, which could allow the malicious page to
    steal information such as cookies or passwords from the other
    site, or perform transactions on the user's behalf if the user
    were already logged in.  [MFSA-2006-17]

CVE-2006-1733

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that the compilation scope of privileged
    built-in XBL bindings is not fully protected from web content and
    can still be executed which could be used to execute arbitrary
    JavaScript, which could allow an attacker to install malware such
    as viruses and password sniffers.  [MFSA-2006-16]

CVE-2006-1734

    "shutdown" discovered that it is possible to access an internal
    function object which could then be used to run arbitrary
    JavaScriptcode with full permissions of the user running the
    browser, which could be used to install spyware or viruses.
    [MFSA-2006-15]

CVE-2006-1735

    It is possible to create JavaScript functions that would get
    compiled with the wrong privileges, allowing an attacker to run
    code of their choice with full permissions of the user running the
    browser, which could be used to install spyware or viruses.
    [MFSA-2006-14]

CVE-2006-1736

    It is possible to trick users into downloading and saving an
    executable file via an image that is overlaid by a transparent
    image link that points to the executable.  [MFSA-2006-13]

CVE-2006-1737

    An integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service and possibly execute arbitrary bytecode via JavaScript
    with a large regular expression.  [MFSA-2006-11]

CVE-2006-1738

    An unspecified vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service.  [MFSA-2006-11]

CVE-2006-1739

    Certain Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can cause an out-of-bounds
    array write and buffer overflow that could lead to a denial of
    service and the possible execution of arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-11]

CVE-2006-1740

    It is possible for remote attackers to spoof secure site
    indicators such as the locked icon by opening the trusted site in
    a popup window, then changing the location to a malicious site.
    [MFSA-2006-12]

CVE-2006-1741

    "shutdown" discovered that it is possible to inject arbitrary
    JavaScript code into a page on another site using a modal alert to
    suspend an event handler while a new page is being loaded.  This
    could be used to steal confidential information.  [MFSA-2006-09]

CVE-2006-1742

    Igor Bukanov discovered that the JavaScript engine does not
    properly handle temporary variables, which might allow remote
    attackers to trigger operations on freed memory and cause memory
    corruption, causing memory corruption.  [MFSA-2006-10]

CVE-2006-1790

    A regression fix that could lead to memory corruption allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-11]

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.2-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your Mozilla Firefox packages.
