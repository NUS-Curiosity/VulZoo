3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in various SpeedProject
products, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to boundary errors in "CxAce60.dll"
and "CxAce60u.dll" within the handling of an ACE archive that contains
a file with an overly long filename. This can be exploited to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow and allows arbitrary code execution when a
specially crafted archive is extracted.
