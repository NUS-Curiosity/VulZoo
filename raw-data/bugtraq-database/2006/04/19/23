Summary
=======

There are two vulnerabilities that exist in the CiscoWorks Wireless
LAN Solution Engine (WLSE). The first is a cross site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability that may allow an attacker to gain administrative
privileges on the system. The second is a local privilege escalation
vulnerability that can be used by an attacker who already has
authenticated access to the command line interface to obtain access
to the underlying operating system.

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers.

This advisory is available at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20060419-wlse.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

A CiscoWorks Wireless LAN Solution Engine (WLSE) or WLSE Express
running any version of software prior to 2.13 are vulnerable to both
of these vulnerabilities.

Several other Cisco products are affected only by the local privilege
escalation vulnerability, including Cisco Hosting Solution Engine
(HSE), User Registration Tool (URT), Cisco Ethernet Subscriber
Solution Engine (ESSE) and CiscoWorks2000 Service Management
Solution. A separate Cisco Security Response has been published
regarding the impact and the fixes on these products and can be found
at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20060419-priv.shtml

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are affected by both of these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

CiscoWorks WLSE is a centralized, systems-level application for
managing and controlling an entire autonomous Cisco WLAN
infrastructure.

Two vulnerabilities exist in the WLSE appliance that may allow an
attacker to gain complete control of the device or to obtain access
to the underlying operating system.

These issues are documented by the following Cisco bug IDs:

  * CSCsc01095 (registered customers only) - Cross site scripting
    vulnerability in WLSE appliance web interface
    This fix addresses the cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
    in the WLSE appliance web user interface. By exploiting this
    vulnerability, an attacker may obtain the session cookie
    information and further use this information to gain
    administrative privileges on the system.
  * CSCsd21502 (registered customers only) - Privilege escalation to
    Linux shell
    This fix addresses the local privilege escalation from the
    command line interface of the WLSE appliance. By exploiting this
    vulnerability an attacker who already has authenticated access to
    the command line interface may inject a command to obtain a shell
    account on the underlying operating system.

Impact
======

By exploiting these vulnerabilities together, an attacker may obtain
complete control of the WLSE appliance.

Software Version and Fixes
==========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

These vulnerabilities are fixed in the 2.13 version of WLSE software.
Fixed software can be downloaded from the following URL:

http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/wlan-sol-eng

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco will make free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. This advisory will be updated as fixed
software becomes available. Prior to deploying software, customers
should consult their maintenance provider or check the software for
feature set compatibility and known issues specific to their
environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html , or as 
otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or "security-alert@...co.com"
for software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com .

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreement with third-party support organizations
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free
upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested through the
TAC.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml
for additional TAC contact information, including special localized
telephone numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in
various languages.
