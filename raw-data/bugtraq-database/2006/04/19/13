20m.com fixed the vulnerability on 10th April, 2006

System Description
==============
Many web-hosting sites powered by Community Architect offer free as well as paid services to those who want to host a website on their servers. They offer customized Guest-book input form page (http://www.vulnerablesite.com/fsguest.html), Guest-book page (http://www.vulnerablesite.com/fsguestbook.html) along with ready-made script (http://www.vulnerablesite.com/cgi-bin/guest) to the web-designer designing a website on their servers.

A person visiting the website signs the guest-book by filling up the form in http://www.vulnerablesite.com/fsguest.html. On submission, the inputs are submitted to the script, http://www.vulnerablesite.com/cgi-bin/guest on the server. The script processes the input and updates the page, http://www.vulnerablesite.com/fsguestbook.html to reflect the new message submitted by the user.

Vulnerability Description
=================
The script, http://www.vulnerablesite.com/cgi-bin/guest, is vulnerable to XSS since it doesn't validate the input for the presence of HTML tags. As a result HTML tags & JavaScript codes entered as input in the form of http://www.vulnerablesite.com/fsguest.html become a part of the HTML code of http://www.vulnerablesite.com/fsguestbook.html and hence it is executed by the browser when any user visits the page.

It provides the attacker an opportunity to inject HTML formatting elements to tamper with the display of the page or inject JavaScript code to trouble the user visiting this page.
