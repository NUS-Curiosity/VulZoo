After reading your scary message, went to verify your points and confirmed all. Whilst, as I've been running a real software firewall (Sunbelt Kerio Personal Firewall is for free) on top of a router firewall, I've been able to block or force a request as I see fit for each of these sites. On WMP, untick the Automatic Coded update function for starters, but indeed its highly irritating that you have no control over auto update yes/no. As to the MS firewall, that's a joke. It only does partial incoming traffic control and NONE on outgoing!!!!! If you like blocking specific IP's or ranges use for instance Peerguardian 2. I find it stops truly anything you don't want to not to come thru.

The bypassing of the HOSTS file is something i thinks would fall under required disclosure....changing functionality of an intergral part to network control. Think this build in trickery will have interest of the EU commission too!
