In that case, they should allow us to add symantec et al - it's not
much use having Windows Update working while the machine is happily
rootkitted. Grepping hosts files across campus for 127.0.0.1 ...
liveupdate.symantec.com  - or your local equivalent - can prove
interesting.

If it was a feature, I'd expect there to be ways to add to the list of
pass-through domains, or ways to disable it.

cheers,
 Jamie
