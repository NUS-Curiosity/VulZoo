Hello,

For IBM Tivoli products, http://www-306.ibm.com/software/sysmgmt/products/support/Tivoli_Proactive_Notification.html contains our contact information.  I'm not certain of the contact points for the other brands, but if you report involves one of them, we will ensure that the report is provided to the appropriate team.

Regards, Sten Drescher
Advisory Engineer, Access Manager Support
Tivoli Software, IBM Software Group
