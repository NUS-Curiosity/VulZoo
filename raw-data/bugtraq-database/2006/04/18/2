Subject: Re: [Argeniss] Alert - Yahoo! Webmail XSS


reflecting on this...

the offending url you give is http://w00tynetwork.com/x/
which contains a fake yahoo login ( for webmail )
(( and other exploits embedded within the site ))


you state this is a Yahoo Email vulnerability.

stop me if im wrong...
why would anyone be vulnerable to a Yahoo login redirect phish, if in fact 
they are already logged in to read the mail in the first place.

i can appriciate the possibility of XSS within the Yahoo webmail interface, 
just not
with this particular redirect code ( or site url ) you provide.

XSS could be more effectivly used to leverage a browser exploit, rather than 
( trying to )
steal your credentals ala phishing

2cents,
