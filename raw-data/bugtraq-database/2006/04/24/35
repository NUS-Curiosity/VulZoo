We did a test as well and were still blocked. Simply add a "?" question
mark correct? We put www.ibm.com in the "uncategorized" category as a
test. Websense version we are using is 6.1

We block uncategorized and allow dynamic.

All;

We have received this report and are investigating. Our preliminary
tests show that this only works when customers block the uncategorized
URL category and allow the dynamic content category.

If you do not block uncategorized you should not be affected.
