IBM AIX mklvcopy Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability 

Release Date: 2006-04-24

CVE ID: CVE-2006-1246

http://www.nsfocus.com/english/homepage/research/0602.htm

Affected systems & software
===================
IBM AIX 5.3

Unaffected systems & software
===================

Summary
=========

NSFocus Security Team discovered a local privilege escalation vulnerability 
in IBM AIX mklvcopy which allows users of local system group to gain root 
privilege.

Description
============

The mklvcopy shipped with IBM AIX 5.3 is used to increase the number of copies 
in each logical partition in LogicalVolume. By default mklvcopy is set with 
suid root bit, and can be run by system group users.

mklvcopy contains a vulnerability when calling external commands, which allows 
a local attacker to execute arbitrary command as root. Successful exploitation 
requires the attacker should gain system group privilege first. 

Workaround
=============

Remove suid root bit from mklvocpy.

    # chmod a-s /usr/sbin/mklvcopy
    
Vendor Status
