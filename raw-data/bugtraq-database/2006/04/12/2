Isn't this old news?

Your app is a sieve if you run with register globals on (or have developed your own code to do the same thing and replace it). It's a disaster waiting to happen.

In the PHP manual, the developers of PHP have posted a big fat warning about this. It's easier to secure your code than it is to secure register globals. It's possible to eventually finish securing your code with regard to this.

Though it takes some extra work, it's worth it because it takes less work to get it done than it does to continually fix the ever growing flow of vulnerabilities related to this configuration setting being on. They will never stop coming. 

People were trying to fix register_globals 5 years ago and they still are battling this. It took me a month to turn this off, and secure my code on all 4 apps that I am responsible for. What does that tell you?

Sorry for the lecture, but I've seen way to many vulnerabilities here related to this. PHP developers everywhere should know better by now.
