My thoughts exactly.  This attack is possible because of a design limitation of
UDP (and other connectionless protocols).  I realise that DNS is receiving
attention because of it's ubiquity on the Internet, but this type of attack can
leverage any service that responds with a reply packet larger than the initial
query packet where the protocol used is connectionless.  TCP/IP is showing it's
age (again).

Thanks,

Paul
