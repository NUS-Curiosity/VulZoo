Dear Romain.Le.Guen@...ainl.com,

Neither  ISA  Server  2004  nor Windows 2003 Basic Firewall support IPv6
filtering, IPX filtering, etc. This is different network protocol.

RLGrc> When IPv6 is active on an interface of an ISA Server 2004, it
seems that IPv6 packets are not filtered and bypass the firewall.
