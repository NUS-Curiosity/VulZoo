Synopsis
========

The help viewer of the Horde Framework allows attackers to execute
arbitrary remote code.

Background
==========

The Horde Application Framework is a general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP, providing classes for handling preferences,
compression, browser detection, connection tracking, MIME and more.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/horde       < 3.1.1                             >= 3.1.1

Description
===========

Jan Schneider of the Horde team discovered a vulnerability in the help
viewer of the Horde Application Framework that could allow remote code
execution (CVE-2006-1491). Paul Craig reported that "services/go.php"
fails to validate the passed URL parameter correctly (CVE-2006-1260).

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability in the help viewer to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server user. By
embedding a NULL character in the URL parameter, an attacker could
exploit the input validation issue in go.php to read arbitrary files.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Horde Application Framework users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/horde-3.1.1"
