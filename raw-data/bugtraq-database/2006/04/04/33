Are you sure this difficulty is due to the real problem at hand, or due
to poorly designed/implemented software to manage DNS?  Leaving
a single ISP's recursive resolution open to the world is a minor
disservice to the Internet community, but a *major* disservice to it's
own customers.  Cache poisoning really isn't that hard when you can
dictate which records you want to poison and when you want to do it,
from the outside.  Especially with certain softwares' lack of source
port randomization.  An attacker can just wait until the next time a
remotely exploitable IE hole comes out and then poison the records of a
popular website, and *bam* your users are 0wned.

Um... I guess I'm missing something.  If it isn't difficult to limit
_recursive_ query rates from the outside world, how would it be
difficult to disallow them?  This seems like an artifical limitation of
the DNS software in use.  

With that said, I've never ran a very large DNS infrastructure, but I do
know there's a lot of terrible DNS software out there...

cheers,
tim
