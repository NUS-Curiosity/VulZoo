A researcher mentioned to me offline that it takes a lot more time to find
vulnerabilities in such software.  This could be another quantitative
indicator, although it would be highly variable depending on each
individual researcher's methods and tools.

Until we start to collect what we should.  Disclosure timelines weren't
that common a few years ago, and now there's a virtual goldmine of data
waiting for some enterprising person to examine notification-to-patch
timelines as well as overall vendor responsiveness.
