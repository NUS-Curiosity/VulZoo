Um, no, I don't agree with you in the least.  It's not "more for passport
functionality."  Passport does not need to by-pass host entries to function.
We've already gone over what the behavior is for, but that doesn't seem to
matter to you.

Oh, I see now.  It's about tracking users now, is it?  So you're saying that
the exception list in dnsapi.dll is not only there for some super-secret
Passport "functionality" but now Microsoft is using it to protect "their
user tracking information?"  Brilliant.  I suppose that the next argument
will be that dnsapi.dll contains the secret as to where that one sock goes
after it's lost in the dryer, right?  Hey!  Maybe that's what winsock really
is!!

Trivial, huh?  Get right on that, then.  If it's trivial, then write it up
and post it.  Of course, malware would only have to use the same hook that
the GUI does.  But you might have something here.  Let's see, rather than a
simple exception list, you'd rather have a "protected" hosts file that
requires a special GUI for administrators to use to manage host entries and
that would require additional API's for DNS to access it as well as other
3rd party functions, huh?  Administrators would have read/write, but users
would only be able to read it, right?  Yep, all you have to do is whip up a
nifty GUI that performs the proper token permission checking as well as
file-level permissions.  Utterly ridiculous, and it still does nothing to
prevent malware abuse.

Let me get this straight:  After creating the magic GUI for hosts
management, Microsoft is to prompt the user with a pop-up that says
"Attention Stupid Administrator:  We are about to bypass the hosts file
entry for MSDN so that we can track your user information, ensure that
Passport functionality is maintained, as so that we can search for that sock
you lost in the dryer last week.  Are you sure that you don't want us to not
do that? Please click YES, NO, or MAYBE."

That would make it less stupid?
