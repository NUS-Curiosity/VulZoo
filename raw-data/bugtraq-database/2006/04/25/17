At the opposite of what the full advisory hints, this issue is NOT  
exploitable.

On Nessus 2, the program is killed via abort(), on Nessus 3, a  
segfault occurs due to an attempt to read an invalid location of the  
memory (this location is not user-controlled).


There is a denial of service, though. However, the only way to  
exploit it would be to load a rogue plugin in nessusd, which is  
difficult since the plugins downloads are cryptographically signed.


The out-of-memory / bad pointer dereferencement condition will  
nevertheless be addressed in Nessus 2.2.8 / 3.0.3.

ps: OS2A did not contact us prior to releasing this misleading  
advisory. So much for 'responsible disclosure'.
