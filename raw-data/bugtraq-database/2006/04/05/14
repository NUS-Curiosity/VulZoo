---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated pine package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:184074
Issue date:        2006-04-04
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix, Security
CVE Names:         CVE-2003-0297
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated Pine package is now available to fix a denial of service
attack.

Pine is an email user agent.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The c-client IMAP client library, as used in Pine 4.44 contains an
integer overflow and integer signedness flaw. An attacker could create a
malicious IMAP server in such a way that it would cause Pine to crash.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2003-0297 to this issue.

Users of Pine are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
