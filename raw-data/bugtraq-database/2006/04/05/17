Subject: NOD32 local privilege escalation vulnerability


NOD32 local privilege escalation vulnerability

Not affected: > Version 2.51.26
Tested on: Winxp sp2
Risk: Average

To escalate the system privilage, the option 'quarentine a file' in NOD32 can be exploited & a malicious file can be copied to the quarentine and using the 'restore to...' option it can be  dropped to the directory in which the STSTEM user just had read-only permession.

Note: from lower privilege, this trick can write a file to any directory in which the user has read-only access to but can't overwrite a file if the file-name already exists.
