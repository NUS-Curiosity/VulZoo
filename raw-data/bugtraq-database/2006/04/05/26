People tend to forget that authoritative nameservers can also be used if 
you know what zone to query for. How about sending spoofed packets to 
ns1.msft.net asking for microsoft.com?

Amplification attacks can be performed on any UDP service that responds 
with a reply packet larger than the initial query packet.

All DNS servers are at risk, some servers will produce lower 
amplification factors than others.
