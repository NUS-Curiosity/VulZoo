How bypassing blocking of go.microsoft.com affects windowsupdate I
don't know.  Been a while since I looked at windows update at all, but
doesn't it download files from mirrors anyways?  And even if it didn't
are the files actually downloaded from go.microsoft.com?  Either way
it appears Dave is right, which makes me wonder if there isn't another
greater purpose aside form WMP updates.  Like assured tracking of
users for other nefarious and monopolistic purposes.
