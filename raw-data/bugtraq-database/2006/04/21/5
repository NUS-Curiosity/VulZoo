Are you running the latest version of portable OpenSSH? If not, you need to 
upgrade. As far as I know, there should be no more leaks of this sort in 
the current code. If there are, please notify the openssh developers (and 
include your authentication configuration - your PAM modules may be leaking 
the info, and there's nothing OpenSSH can do about that).
