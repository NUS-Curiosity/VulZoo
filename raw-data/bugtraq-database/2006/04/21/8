I agree. I also wish OpenSSH would implement the same security measures
already available in other SSH servers and authentication products --
a dynamic black list. The idea is simple, but effective: connections
from IP addresses that have failed to authenticate X times in the last
Y minutes are refused for Z minutes. For adequate values of Y and Z,
brute force attacks quickly lose feasibility.
