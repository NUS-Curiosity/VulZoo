Subject: Scry Gallery Directory Traversal & Full Path Disclosure
 Vulnerabilites


Software : Scry Gallery
WebSite  :http://scry.org/
discovred by :Moroccan Security Team

[+] Directory Traversal :

A remote attacker may employ directory traversal strings '../'  to access arbitrary files outside of the webroot directory. 
This flaw is due to an input validation error in the "index.php" script that does not properly validate the "p" field

Exemple:
http://localhost/scry/index.php?v=list&i=0&p=../../..

[+] Full Path Disclosure :

The issue is due to an input validation error when processing a non-existing directory passed to the "p" field, which could be exploited by attackers to determine the installation path.

Exemple:

http://localhost/scry/index.php?v=view&i=0&p=simo64

==> /var/www/scry-1.1/../photos/simo64 does not exist or is not readable by the webserver - please verify settings in setup.php
