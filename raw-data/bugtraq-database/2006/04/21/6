Subject: Re: Strengthen OpenSSH security?


Yes I see this all the time. I find it amusing from time to time. I've even taken a 'closer look' at the machines being used in the attacks. Many in Asia I find. As for my solution I was working on a portsentry script til I found Denyhosts, a python script, that adds break-in attempts to my /etc/hosts.deny. Works like a charm. Other sshd tweaks should be made, disallow root logins, max auth attempts, etc., to bloster security.

you at least tell me what this is all about?" I'll say, "No." and shoot him.
No, on second thought, I'll shoot him and then say "No."
