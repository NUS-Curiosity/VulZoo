Geo, the default is bad. However, it is not a Microsoft issue, this is a 
spoofing issue. Many like to bash Microsoft, some hate them. Myself I am 
known as a Microsoft critic at times.

It is true Microsoft has recursion set on default, but so does bind. 
That is how DNS is general is set all around the world. Hopefully the 
very clued guys at both will change it.

Why are we arguing on the colour of bytes when we could be discussing 
making trivial spoofing a thing of the past?
