Synopsis
========

The Crossfire game server is vulnerable to a Denial of Service and
potentially to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Crossfire is a cooperative multiplayer graphical adventure and
role-playing game. The Crossfire game server allows various compatible
clients to connect to participate in a cooperative game.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                        /  Vulnerable  /        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-server/crossfire-server       < 1.9.0              >= 1.9.0

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma discovered a vulnerability in the Crossfire game server,
in the handling of the "oldsocketmode" option when processing overly
large requests.

Impact
======

An attacker can set up a malicious Crossfire client that would send a
large request in "oldsocketmode", resulting in a Denial of Service on
the Crossfire server and potentially in the execution of arbitrary code
on the server with the rights of the game server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Crossfire server users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=games-server/crossfire-server-1.9.0"

References
==========
