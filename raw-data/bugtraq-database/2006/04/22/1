Title:   Symantec Scan Engine Multiple Vulnerabilities
Threat:  Moderate
Impact: Unauthorized access
Product: Symantec Scan Engine

Situation Overview: Three vulnerabilities have been discovered in the
Symantec Scan Engine.  Symantec Scan Engine is a TCP/IP server and
programming interface that enables third parties to incorporate support for
Symantec content scanning technologies into their proprietary applications.
This gateway-level product should not be confused with Symantec's desktop
product.

The Symantec Scan Engine fails to properly authenticate web-based user
logins. Anyone with knowledge of the underlying communication mechanism can
control the Scan Engine server.

Symantec Scan Engine uses a static private DSA key for SSL communications. 
This key cannot be changed by end users and is easily extracted. This opens
the product to a potential man-in-the-middle attack.

There is a vulnerability in Symantec Scan Engine that allows
unauthenticated remote users to download any file located under the
Symantec Scan Engine installation directory. For instance, the
configuration file, the scanning logs, and the current virus definitions
can all be accessed by any remote user using regular or specially crafted
HTTP requests.
