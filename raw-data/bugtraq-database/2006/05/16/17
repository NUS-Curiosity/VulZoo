Errata
======

The previous upstream release failed to take into account an integer
overflow condition when performing bounds checking. Users are urged
to upgrade to 1.4.1 which resolves the issue.

The corrected sections appear below.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/nagios-core       < 1.4.1                   >= 1.4.1

Resolution
==========

All Nagios users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/nagios-core-1.4.1"
