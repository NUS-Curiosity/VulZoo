To the best of my recollection, this is actually an issue on NT4. In the
event that you opt not to install the screen savers during installation, a
normal user is able to create ``logon.scr'' in ``%systemroot%\system32'',
as the default permissions on this directory include Everyone:Change. This
facilitates local privilege escalation from a normal user to LocalSystem.

At least, that's how I remember it working. I think I mentioned this to
Microsoft around 5 years ago, but they didn't consider it to be a problem.
