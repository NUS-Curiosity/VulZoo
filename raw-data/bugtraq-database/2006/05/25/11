AZ Photo Album Script Pro

Homepage:
http://www.php4script.com/php-photo-album-script/

Description:
A powerful PHP/MySQL photo album (photo gallery) script with a lot of features.

Effected files:
index.php

Exploits & Vulns:

Captivate is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input. 

An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the 
attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Proof of Concept:
http://www.example.com/index.php?&gazpart=view<IMG%20"""><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">&<IMG%20"""><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">gazimage=198

I couldn't find a version # on the homepage for this script.
