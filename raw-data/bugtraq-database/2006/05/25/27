That looks a lot like a *nuke (PHPNuke & forks like PostNuke).

The "thold" param has a history of issues, XSS and the like, and
I seem to recall it is handled by the "Sections" module in Nuke.

If it's the code I think it is, there are more issues with other
params which are even listed in the example below.

(Hint: the op param)
