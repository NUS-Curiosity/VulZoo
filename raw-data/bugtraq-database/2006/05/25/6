Subject: [CLOSED] SOE's implementation of Lithium Forums Software allows
 users to log on as each other.


This issue has been resolved as of 5/23/2006.  The problem was related to the customer-specific implementation of the user authentication system and is not a general problem with Lithium�s software.  This does not affect any of Lithium�s other customers.
