Subject: ASLR now built into Vista


Address Space Layout Randomization is now part of Vista as of beta 2 [1] . I 
wrote about ASLR on the Windows platform back in September last year [2] and 
noted that unless you rebase the image exe then little (not none!) is added. 
ASLR in Vista solves this so remote exploitation of overflows has just got a 
lot harder. I've not done a thorough analysis yet but, all going well, this 
is a fantastic way for Microsoft to go and builds on the work done with 
NX/DEP and stack cookies/canaries.

Cheers,
David Litchfield
