PHP AGTC-Membership system <= v1.1a XSS

Discovered by: Nomenumbra
Date: 23/5/2006
impact:moderate (privilege escalation,possible defacement)

Ordinary users can add users to the user management system as well,
or change their own email address, which isn't properly sanitized, thus
allowing XSS as follows (for example):

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
