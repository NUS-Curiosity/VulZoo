Subject: Graph analysis of stolen credit cards

Hi all,

We took one sample of one carding/phishing forum that our Global
Surveillance Center was monitoring and sampled the set into a graph that
lists the top 10 banks and the losses over the last month. As you can
see, it's obvious who the top credit card companies are out there, but
at the same time, we can see an ever increasing on the top targets but
not necessarily an increase on the lower tiers over the entire three
months, but in the first two we see a significant increase in success
with stolen credit cards in general. In this case, the loss that we
captured (which probably isn't nearly the number captured by this forum)
was a little over 21,000 credit cards.

Thought this might interest some, and if this is interesting, we are
going to be providing a graph of the losses of top targets with malware
in the upcoming weeks.

Attached is the chart.
