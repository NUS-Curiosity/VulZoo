Subject: Re: [General-discussion] Graph analysis of stolen
	credit cards


One thing to add:

This is one group, with 21,000 cards per month (that we know about) and
law enforcement estimates about $500.00 per card in average loss. At
that rate, in 3 months, one carding group causes $10,500,000.00 in loss.
And this carding group is at the low end of the totem poll.
