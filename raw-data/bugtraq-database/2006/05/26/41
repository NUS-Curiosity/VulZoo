Description:
    Previous versions of the enscript package have weaknesses that
    may enable vulnerabilities in other applications; in particular,
    some print filters may call enscript while allowing the user to
    provide arbitrary filenames or options.
    
    The print filters in rPath Linux do not expose these weaknesses
    in enscript, and rPath is not aware of any other uses of enscript
    in rPath Linux that would create actual vulnerabilities based on
    these weaknesses in enscript.
