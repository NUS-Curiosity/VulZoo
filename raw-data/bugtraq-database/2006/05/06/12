X7Chat <= 2.0.2 avatar XSS injection

Discovered by: Nomenumbra

impact:moderate (privilege escalation,possible defacement)

X7Chat versions 2.0.2 and below are prone to XSS injection in a user's avatar.
By setting this as the url of your avatar:

javascript:alert('xss')

you'd have some good ol' XSS
