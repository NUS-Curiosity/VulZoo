Synopsis
========

An attacker having write access to an rsync module might be able to
execute arbitrary code on an rsync server.

Background
==========

rsync is a server and client utility that provides fast incremental
file transfers. It is used to efficiently synchronize files between
hosts and is used by emerge to fetch Gentoo's Portage tree.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/rsync       < 2.6.8                             >= 2.6.8

Description
===========

An integer overflow was found in the receive_xattr function from the
extended attributes patch (xattr.c) for rsync. The vulnerable function
is only present when the "acl" USE flag is set.

Impact
======

A remote attacker with write access to an rsync module could craft
malicious extended attributes which would trigger the integer overflow,
potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
rights of the rsync daemon.

Workaround
==========

Do not provide write access to an rsync module to untrusted parties.

Resolution
==========

All rsync users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/rsync-2.6.8"

==========
