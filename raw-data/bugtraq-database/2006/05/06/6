Synopsis
========

The Mozilla Firefox 1.5 line is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the
JavaScript extension which may in theory lead to remote execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation web browser from the Mozilla
project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                         /  Vulnerable  /       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla-firefox          < 1.5.0.3          >= 1.5.0.3
                                                                 < 1.5
  2  www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin      < 1.5.0.3          >= 1.5.0.3
                                                                 < 1.5
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.

Description
===========

Martijn Wargers and Nick Mott discovered a vulnerability when rendering
malformed JavaScript content. The Mozilla Firefox 1.0 line is not
affected.

Impact
======

If JavaScript is enabled, by tricking a user into visiting a malicious
web page which would send a specially crafted HTML script that contains
references to deleted objects with the "designMode" property enabled,
an attacker can crash the web browser and in theory manage to execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.3"

All Mozilla Firefox 1.5 binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.3"
