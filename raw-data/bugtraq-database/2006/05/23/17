Russcom PHPImages lack of validation

Discovered by: Nomenumbra
Date: 21/5/2006
impact:moderate 

Russcom's PHPImages doesn't validate if the uploaded
file is an image, it just checks for the extension, thus 
allowing an attacker to upload php scripts with a .gif extension
for example, potentially allowing him (trough file inclusion vulns for
example) to execute arbitrary code.
