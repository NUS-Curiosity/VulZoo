-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Verisign i-Nav ActiveX control. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious web page.

The specific flaw exists within the "VUpdater.Install" ActiveX control
which is used to provide native support for Internationalized Domain
Names (IDNs) in Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Outlook and
Microsoft Outlook Express. Due to the lack of verification on Microsoft
Cabinet (.CAB) files from the "InstallProduct" routine, an attacker can
specify an arbitrary executable to run under the context of the current
user.

-- Vendor Response:
Verisign has addressed this issue in the latest version of the affected
technology:
