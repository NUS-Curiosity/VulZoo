This is an issue with IP in general. Anyone who can spoof ARP entries in a
network can pretty much do anything they want on you LAN.

If there is a flaw then it is a flaw in your switch not protecting you
from such an ARP spoofing issue. There are tools to detect it at host
level and warn you about it.

Further recommended reading:

http://www.l0t3k.org/security/docs/arp/

And I'm sure there must be a load of other documents out there. These were
picked after a 5 second search with google.

I'm a bit puzzled why this message was in fact released on bugtraq as it
adds nothing new to the arp spoofing story.
