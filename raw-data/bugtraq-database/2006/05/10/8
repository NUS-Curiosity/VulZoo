Synopsis
========

pdnsd is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that may result in arbitrary
code execution.

Background
==========

pdnsd is a proxy DNS server with permanent caching that is designed to
cope with unreachable DNS servers.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/pdnsd       < 1.2.4                              >= 1.2.4

Description
===========

The pdnsd team has discovered an unspecified buffer overflow
vulnerability. The PROTOS DNS Test Suite, by the Oulu University Secure
Programming Group (OUSPG), has also revealed a memory leak error within
the handling of the QTYPE and QCLASS DNS queries, leading to
consumption of large amounts of memory.

Impact
======

An attacker can craft malicious DNS queries leading to a Denial of
Service, and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All pdnsd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/pdnsd-1.2.4-r1"
