Description
===========

landser discovered a vulnerability within the "remapShader" command.
Due to a boundary handling error in "remapShader", there is a
possibility of a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could set up a malicious game server and entice users to
connect to it, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the rights of the game user.

Workaround
==========

Do not connect to untrusted game servers.

Resolution
==========

All Quake 3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-fps/quake3-bin-1.32c"

All RTCW users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-fps/rtcw-1.41b"

All Enemy Territory users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-fps/enemy-territory-2.60b"
