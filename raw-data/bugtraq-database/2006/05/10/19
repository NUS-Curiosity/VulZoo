"Full Path Disclosure" isn't a risk but many systems of PHP or important sites 
are vulnerable to this issues. Of course it is possible to turn off 
display_errors but it isn't changing the fact, that issues should not be. It 
is typical "Full Path Disclosure". 
Yesterday I received the confirmation from phpBB about the acceptance of these 
bug.
PHP is a specific language and are many different possibilities to show full 
path. I will public note about this bugs.
