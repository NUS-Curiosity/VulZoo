Synopsis
========

Ruby WEBrick and XMLRPC servers are vulnerable to Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming. It comes bundled with HTTP ("WEBrick") and
XMLRPC server objects.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/ruby     < 1.8.4-r1                          >= 1.8.4-r1

Description
===========

Ruby uses blocking sockets for WEBrick and XMLRPC servers.

Impact
======

An attacker could send large amounts of data to an affected server to
block the socket and thus deny other connections to the server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.4-r1"
