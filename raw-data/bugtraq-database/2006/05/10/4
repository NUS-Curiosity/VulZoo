Subject: Re: IGNORING SSH CONNECTION USES ARP CACHE POISSONING


Dear King purba,

Could you please provide more details abouve the specifics you see a
problem in here ?

From my point of view, if you poison the cache of a remote machine
the connection will go to the other machine, and if that machine does
no IP forwarding, well the connection dies, or times-out.

What specific SSH issue are you refering to here ?
