This doesn't return anything except copies of the original Bugtraq
post and a reference to a person's web site.

Searching for "Phil's Bookmarks" found a lot of sites by people named
Phil who listed their favorite bookmarks.

Is there an actual product here?  Or was the issue just in a single
web page on someone's web site?
