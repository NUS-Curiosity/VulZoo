3) Artificially late patches -- those which could be made
available ahead of usual schedule to reduce vulnerability window.

I guess regular approach is OK for low-to-moderate but guarantees
enough additional headache for critical updates.  After all, it's
only vendor-found ones that can wait, and that's not exactly
"responsible" too since nobody can tell for sure the particular
problem isn't already known out there.
