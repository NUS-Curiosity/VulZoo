Subject: PBNJ 1.14 released


I have released PBNJ 1.14 ( http://pbnj.sf.net )

PBNJ is a tool for running Nmap scans and diff'ing the results.

It is included in Backtrack http://www.remote-exploit.org/index.php/BackTrack

CHANGLOG for 1.14
----------------
* fixed bug that crashed PBNJ after scanning a machine with no ports open
* fixed --nodiff banner bug
* Added --delim option to allow custom delimination
   --delim <tab> [ default set to comma ]
* quick install script for ubuntu and linux systems
* Makefile.PL setup which will install pbnj properly


Version 2.0 will be released sometime in August.
