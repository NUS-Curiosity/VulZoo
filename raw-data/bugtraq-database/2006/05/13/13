               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated gnupg package fixes security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:185355
Issue date:        2006-05-12
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2006-0049 CVE-2006-0455
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated GnuPG package that fixes signature verification flaws is now
available.

GnuPG is a utility for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386
Fedora Core 3 - i386, x86_64

3. Problem description:

Tavis Ormandy discovered a bug in the way GnuPG verifies
cryptographically signed data with detached signatures. It is possible
for an attacker to construct a cryptographically signed message which
could appear to come from a third party. When a victim processes a GnuPG
message with a malformed detached signature, GnuPG ignores the malformed
signature, processes and outputs the signed data, and exits with status
0, just as it would if the signature had been valid. In this case,
GnuPG's exit status would not indicate that no signature verification
had taken place. This issue would primarily be of concern when
processing GnuPG results via an automated script. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2006-0455 to
this issue.

Tavis Ormandy also discovered a bug in the way GnuPG verifies
cryptographically signed data with inline signatures. It is possible for
an attacker to inject unsigned data into a signed message in such a way
that when a victim processes the message to recover the data, the
unsigned data is output along with the signed data, gaining the
appearance of having been signed. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2006-0049 to this issue.

Please note that neither of these issues affect the way RPM or up2date
verify RPM package files, nor is RPM vulnerable to either of these
issues.

All users of GnuPG are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

These packages are GPG signed by Fedora Legacy for security.  Our key is
available from http://www.fedoralegacy.org/about/security.php

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
