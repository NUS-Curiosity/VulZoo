               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated xloadimage package fixes security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152923
Issue date:        2006-05-12
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2005-0638 CVE-2005-3178
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

A new xloadimage package that fixes bugs in handling malformed tiff and
pbm/pnm/ppm images, and in handling metacharacters in file names is now
available.

The xloadimage utility displays images in an X Window System window,
loads images into the root window, or writes images into a file.
Xloadimage supports many image types (including GIF, TIFF, JPEG, XPM,
and XBM).

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

A flaw was discovered in xloadimage where filenames were not properly
quoted when calling the gunzip command. An attacker could create a file
with a carefully crafted filename so that it would execute arbitrary
commands if opened by a victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2005-0638 to
this issue.

A flaw was discovered in xloadimage via which an attacker can construct
a NIFF image with a very long embedded image title. This image can cause
a buffer overflow. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2005-3178 to this issue.

All users of xloadimage should upgrade to this erratum package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
