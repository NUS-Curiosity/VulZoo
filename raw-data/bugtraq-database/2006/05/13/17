Maybe then you will have to answer to the question: "How skilled are
security researchers?" or better "how well they slept last night?".
I think software security is more measurable than human skill
(deterministic vs. chaotic systems)...

But at this point I have a some thoughts about words semantic ...maybe
there's a real inner tautology thinking that programmers are human
beings...

Correct me if i'm wrong but Rfpolicy didn't say a word about this ;)

This could be a better point of view as David said.
And are really software certifications talking about quality?
IMHO they don't. 
Fake certification expose us to bad developed code, but maybe process
certifications (if applied) could mitigate risks.
