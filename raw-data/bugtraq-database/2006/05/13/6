* Some days ago yesn@...n.com claimed that this was a "code execution
exploit". (LOL)

* Now this guy claims this is a "Denial of Service". (ROTFL)


Maybe someone should explain this people which is the differences
between a security threat, an application bug, and an expected behaviour.

This is a DoS as the following.

I found a new denial of service vulnerability in Windows CMD.EXE that
affects all Windows versions that have the CMD.EXE executable.
The user must execute a new shell and write this text followed by the
Enter button:

for /l %i in (1,1,10000) do explorer.exe
