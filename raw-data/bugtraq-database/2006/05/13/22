Subject: Gphotos Directory Traversal and Cross Site Scripting


Details

The first vulnerability issue is due to an input validation error in "index.php" "diapo.php" and "affich.php" scripts that do not validate "rep","image" variables, which may be exploited to cross site scripting attacks.

http://traget/index.php?rep=[xss]

http://traget/diapo.php?rep=[xss]

http://traget/affich.php?image=[xss]

The second flaw is due to an input validation error in the "index.php" script that fails to properly validate "rep" variable, which may be exploited to disclose the contents of arbitrary folders.

http://traget/index.php?rep=../../../
