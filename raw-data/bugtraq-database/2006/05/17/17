======================================================================
The special interest group Security - Intrusion Detection and
Response (SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI) organizes
DIMVA as an annual conference that brings together experts from
throughout and outside of Europe to discuss the state of the art in
the areas of intrusion detection, malware detection, and
vulnerability assessment. DIMVA is organized in co-operation with
the IEEE Task Force on Information Assurance and supported by the
European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).

The objective of the conference is to give participants an in-depth
and focused insight into the current state-of-the-art in research
and application. In this spirit DIMVA particularly emphasizes the
collaboration and exchange of ideas between industry, academia, law
enforcement and government.

The DIMVA 2006 Program Committee received 41 submissions from 21
countries. Eleven full papers have been selected for presentation
and publication in the conference proceedings. In addition, two
papers have been selected for presentation in the best-practices
track of the conference.

Invited talks will be given by two internationally renowned security
experts: John McHugh, Dalhousie University, Canada, and Michael
Behringer, Cisco Systems, France.

The conference program will be complemented by the following events:

- SPRING (12.07.06): SIG SIDAR invites young researchers to present
their recent results in an informal one-day workshop.

See http://www.gi-fg-sidar.de/spring for details.

- CIPHER2 (14.07.06): The second Capture The Flag (CTF) contest
organized by SIG SIDAR and the Security and Privacy Research Group
of RWTH Aachen will feature several research groups exercising
practical defense and penetration techniques in a virtual
environment. The results will be broadcasted live during the second
day of DIMVA.

See http://cipher-ctf.org for details.

- Rump Session (14.07.06): A new feature at DIMVA this year is a
rump session, a series of short and entertaining talks where
attendees can present recent research results, work in progress, or
other topics of interest to the community. Abstracts (no more than
one page) for these talks can be given to the rump session chair Sven
Dietrich (rump@...va.org), and should include the title and all author
names and affiliations. Submit abstracts by the deadline to the rump
session chair via e-mail.

Rump session abstracts due: 14.07.06, 10:30h (at the conference)

The conference will take place on July 13 - 14, 2006, at the
conference center of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences
located at Gendarmenmarkt in the heart of Berlin, Germany.

The registration of the conference is now open. Please check the
