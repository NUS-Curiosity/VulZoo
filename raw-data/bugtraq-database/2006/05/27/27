Security company says flaw lets hackers steal sensitive data
AP:  May 26, 2006, 7:45pm:

WASHINGTON - Symantec Corp.'s leading antivirus software, which protects
some of the world's largest corporations and U.S. government agencies,
suffers from a flaw that lets hackers seize control of computers to
steal sensitive data, delete files or implant malicious programs,
researchers said Thursday.

Symantec said it was investigating the issue but could not immediately
corroborate the vulnerability. If confirmed, the threat to computer
users would be severe because the security software is so widely used,
and because no action is required by victims using the latest versions
of Symantec Antivirus to suffer a crippling attack over the Internet.

Maiffret said eEye's testing showed the problem affects Symantec
Antivirus Version 10, including its corporate editions. He said
Symantec's consumer antivirus product, known as Norton Antivirus 2006,
and its current security suite - which includes both antivirus and
firewall features - did not appear to be vulnerable.
