Subject: XSS Vulnerability on Vodafone


Some link on the website Vodafone.de contains 
a little vulnerability that could be used for 
illegal purposes.

It could be used for phishing or other purposes.

hxxp:// website /simlock/servlets/sim?IMEI=[XSS-Code Here]

hxxps:// website /simlock/servlets/sim?IMEI=[XSS-Code Here]

Actually it's a page that's used for getting 
your unlock code for a VPA IV.
It's limited to 15 input characters, 
but it's easily bypassed by looking at 
the source of the page and searching for 
the little page where the input goes.

I hope they fix this "little" big problem.

O.G.
