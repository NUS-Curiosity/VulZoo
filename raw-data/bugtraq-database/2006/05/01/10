Subject: Image file crashes Finder, Safari and other apps


The file http://w148.de/~cmertes/nachbarhaus1.exr will crash the Mac OS 10.4 Finder.app when it tries to preview it i.e. when opening the folder containing the file. Safari will crash when opening a html page with an <img> tag referring to this file. Preview.app and other applications are affected, too.

I don't know the reason for the crash (there's no "quit unexpectedly" window for some reason) and I don't know if it will allow code to be injected.

Kind regards,

Christian
