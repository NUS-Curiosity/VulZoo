Summary
=======

Cisco Unity Express (CUE) contains a vulnerability that might allow
an authenticated user to change the password for another user by
using the HTTP management interface, if the password for the user
being modified is marked as expired. This can result in a privilege
escalation attack and complete administrative control of a CUE
module, if the password being changed belongs to an administrator.

There are mitigations for this vulnerability.

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Any CUE Advanced Integration Module (AIM) or Network Module (NM)
running CUE software versions prior to 2.3(1) is affected by this
vulnerability.

The version of software running on a CUE module can be determined
using the show software versions command in the CUE command line
interface or by selecting Help > About in the HTTP management
interface.

    cue-10-0-0-1# show software versions
    Installed Packages:
     - Bootloader (Primary)  2.1.2
     - Global  2.2.0
     - GPL Infrastructure 2.1.2

    Installed Languages:
    - US English  2.1.0
    Installed Languages:
     - US English  1.1.1
    

The CUE version is determined by the Core package.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products, including Cisco Unity, are currently known
to be affected this vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco Unity Express (CUE) is an optional hardware module designed for
use with Cisco modular routers to provide voice mail and automated
attendant services. The HTTP management interface of a CUE module
allows authenticated users to change their password. This
vulnerability allows authenticated users to change the password for
any user with an expired password. If an administrator's account has
expired, the administrator's password can be changed allowing an
unprivileged user to gain complete administrative control of a CUE
module.

There are three ways for a user to have an expired password.

  * Newly created users with blank passwords. CUE treats blank
    passwords as expired. This feature was introduced in CUE software
    version 1.1(1).
  * Newly created users with a randomly selected password.
    Administrators can elect to have a random password assigned when
    creating new users. CUE treats the random passwords as expired.
    This feature was introduced in CUE software version 1.1(1).
  * If the system-wide password expiry feature is enabled, user
    passwords can be configured to expire after a specified number of
    days. Users with expired passwords are required to change their
    password. This feature was introduced in CUE software version 2.1
    (1).

The vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco Bug ID:

  * CSCsd50387 ( registered customers only) Cisco Unity Express
    Expired Password Reset Privilege Escalation

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an
unprivileged user to gain complete administrative control of a CUE
module. This may result in the disclosure of sensitive information
contained in voice mail stored on a CUE module and possible negative
publicity if automated attendant messages are maliciously changed.

Software Version and Fixes
==========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Fixed software can be downloaded at
http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/cue-231?psrtdcat20e2

+---------------------------------------+
|   Affected Releases   |  First Fixed  |
|                       |    Release    |
|-----------------------+---------------|
| All CUE releases up   | 2.3(1)        |
| to 2.2(2)             |               |
+---------------------------------------+

Workarounds
===========

It is possible to mitigate this vulnerability by restricting access
to the HTTP management interface to trusted management hosts with an
access control list (ACL) applied on the router hosting the CUE
module. This will prevent users from accessing some CUE functionality
such as setting their display name. Users can continue to access
their voice mail and perform a limited number of configuration
changes such as updating their personal identification number (PIN).
Management functions can be performed using the CUE command line
interface.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. This advisory will be updated as fixed
software becomes available. Prior to deploying software, customers
should consult their maintenance provider or check the software for
feature set compatibility and known issues specific to their
environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by
the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html , or as
otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center /sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or "security-alert@...co.com"
for software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com .

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreement with third-party support organizations
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free
upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested through the
TAC.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTac.shtml
for additional TAC contact information, including special localized
telephone numbers and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in
various languages.
