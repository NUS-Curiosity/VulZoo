If this is the message that you received, it is NOT the full text of the message that
was posted. In the original message, I indicated that I would post the results of the
survey to each maillist where someone responded to the post. If this is the entire
contents of your message, then someone truncated the original posting.

I am on the road through Wednesday, so I do not have access to my original sent folder,
or I would include the full original message here. The original message also indicated
that you should respond to SURVEY <A T> SURVEY.ASET.COM.

The purpose of the original survey was to see what others were thinking were potential
emerging threats that we needed to consider and share the information so everything
could start discussing where we needed to be a year and more down the road.

Sorry for any confusion from truncated messages. If the moderator didn't cut the message,
then I have no explanation. (And if they did cut the message, I would like to know why!)

Hope tis clears some air!
