Subject: sBlog SQL Injection and Path Disclosure Vulnerability


Summary:
Software: sBlog 0.7.2
Site: http://servous.se/
Description: sBlog is a simple and new PHP Blog. 

Issue: Conducting a security benchmark on this open source software we have found that most of the versions of this software is prone to SQL Injection attack through which an attacker can trigger back sensitive information as well as gain administrative priviledges. The sql injection also discloses path information which may prove additional aid to the attacker.An unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary SQL statements on the web. This may compromise the database and expose sensitive information.
