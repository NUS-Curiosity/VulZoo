3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in TZipBuilder, which
can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when listing the
contents of a ZIP archive that contains a file with an overly long
filename. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow
when a specially crafted ZIP archive is opened.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of an application that uses the library.
