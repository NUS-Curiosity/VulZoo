AngelineCMS API is a PHP framework which was developed for rapid development of AngelineCMS content management system.

===================================================


Issue:

Google Dork : "powered by angelineCMS" . You get a number of sites running this particular web based software. To our surprise even at the presence of 0.8.1 version of the software most of them were found running on previous versions like 0.6.5 or below. On conducting a strict security benchmark on the 0.6.5 versions and less we have come up with the following vulnerabilities.

1. Directory Listing is enabled for /lib by default.
2. Integrated third party softwares which actually leads to the information disclosure bug.
3. Also entire CMS architecure and hiearchy is disclosed aiding the attacker.
