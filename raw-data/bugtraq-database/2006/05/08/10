Subject: Re: BankTown's ActiveX Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


The security module(BankTown Client Control 1,4,2,51817)metioned above currently is not being used anymore.
 For those who did not remove and still have it remained in their PCs, a new security patch has been released so that it is no longer vulnerable to those kinds of attacks.
