The same happened on my Linux Fedora Core 4 workstation with Konqueror 
3.4.2-0.FC4.1 and Java JDK1.5.0_01. It filled the root partitition 
(where /tmp is on my system) with about a 500 mb temp-file in no time. The 
file disappeared while I wrote this report, though, after terminating the 
Konqueror-window.
