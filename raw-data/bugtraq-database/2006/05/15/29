Subject: Soho firewall - OpenWRT -WhiteRussian Question


Hello everyone, 

I have some questions about OpenWRT/WhiteRussian,   

I currently have iRC5 installed on a Linksys WRT 54G version 1 Router, with iptables, snort and tcpdump add.  

Iptables and snort will be configured per the clients requirements.  log files will be sent to a syslog server.

Has anyone ever used it as a soho firewall? i know performance will be tyed to what snort and iptable rules are enabled. Does anyone of any general metrics for performance?

Does anyone know of any known vulnerabilities or issues

I look forward to hearing all or any comments.
Take Care --John

Cureently I only have the virus and malware rules enabled on snort, and the basic config for iptables.
