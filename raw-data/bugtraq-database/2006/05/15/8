I politely disagree... if there are no measurements then there can be
no metrics (or is that the other way around? :-) There has to be a
start some place; i.e. in your examples, David's time can be recorded
to the hour, and even the researcher/analyst could have a rating to
compensate for skill difference.

The suggestions/ideas put forth here in this thread are very
interesting, IMO. Besides rating a software package solely on the
number of vulnerabilities found, it's more accurate to include the
time to patch the vulnerability by the vendor, and the time it takes
a vendor to respond to a vulnerability report. These 2 factors could
get a weighted rating and be combined with the "# of vulnerabilities"
rating. Which would be a more accurate assessment of "how safe is
software X?".

I can think of Windows OS vs. Linux OS, and IE vs. Firefox as perfect
examples. Microsoft and its supporters will reference the number (and
perhaps the criticality) of vulnerabilities, while not taking into
account the patch and response time.

Of course, this leads to other possible factors such as a vendor's
patch delivery mechanism, but we can't not take on the task just
because there isn't an immediate clear solution.
