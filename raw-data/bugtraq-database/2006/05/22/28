We thank Eitan Caspi for his precise analysis of the problem and for 
thoroughly working with us on it. Specifically, we confirm the low 
severity rating of this information leakage, which is why we allow 
ourselves more time than usual to investigate an entirely satisfactory 
solution to the problem. If there will be an update for this issue, our 
customers and users will benefit from it through the regular channels. 
The publication of Eitan's findings is the correct next step - again, we 
thank him for his valuable work.
