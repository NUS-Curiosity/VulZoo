Hiox Guestbook 3.1

Homepage:
http://hscripts.com/scripts/php/gb.php

Description
A free guest book script that can be added in to any html website with php.

Effected files:

index.php

Exploit:

The input forms for signing the guestbook arent sanatized properally. This could lead users to insert malicious code causing XSS.

It should also be noted that this gb uses a flatfile gb.txt to store its info in, and has to be chmodded to 777. There isn't method of obscuring email addresses in this gb script either.
