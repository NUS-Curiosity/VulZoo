Subject: Boastmachine Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability


Advisory      : Cross Site Scripting in Boastmachine (http://boastology.com/)
Release Date  : 17/05/2005
Last Modified : 17/05/2005
Author        : Yunus Emre Yilmaz ( http://yns.zaxaz.com)
Application   : BoastMachine v3.1 ( maybe older versions)
Risk          : High

Problem : Form action values in admin.php and index.php (maybe other pages) isn't properly sanitized before being returned to page.Form action value
is otomatically coming from $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"];.And This is changeable from query string.

If I access page like admin.php/XSS $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] returns as admin.php/XSS.So , an attacker basicly inject malicious
HTML/JS codes into page.

Proof Of Concept : admin.php/"><script>alert('xss')</script>

Solution : Edit the source code , and change it $_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"] or filter it before printing in page.
