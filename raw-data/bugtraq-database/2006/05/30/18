Subject: Re: [Info Disclosure] Diesel PHP Job Site Latest Version


Hello,

To explain this to all visitors, the information is used to prevent any unauthorized copies from running on the web.

All of the php developers that sell products online use this method or even more methods.

Please stop making such a big deal out of this because it's our way of protecting our work and business.

Thank you for understanding !
