Synopsis
========

CherryPy is vulnerable to a directory traversal that could allow
attackers to read arbitrary files.

Background
==========

CherryPy is a Python-based, object-oriented web development framework.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-python/cherrypy       < 2.1.1                        >= 2.1.1

Description
===========

Ivo van der Wijk discovered that the "staticfilter" component of
CherryPy fails to sanitize input correctly.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain arbitrary files from the
web server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All CherryPy users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-python/cherrypy-2.1.1"
