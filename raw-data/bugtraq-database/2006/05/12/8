Subject: Apple QuickTime udta ATOM Heap Overflow


Apple QuickTime udta ATOM Heap Overflow

Vendor:
Apple Inc.


Affected Versions:
Apple QuickTime versions < 7.1


Overview:
We have discovered a critical vulnerability in Quicktime Player.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to  execute arbitrary code
in the context of the user who executes QuickTime.

This vulnerability can be exploited By persuading a user to open
a carefully crafted .mov files or visit a website embedding the
malicious .mov file.


Details:
This vulnerability exists in the way Quicktime process the "udta" Atom of
the .mov files.

The layout of a udta(user data atom) atom:

                           Bytes
   _______________________											
  |    User data atom     |
  |     Atom size         | 4
  |    Type = 'udta'      | 4
  |                       |
  |   User data list      |
  |     Atom size         | 4
  | Type = user data types| 4
  |                       |
   -----------------------



By setting the value of the Atom size to a large value such as 0xFFFFFFFF,
an insufficiently-sized heap block will be allocated, and resulting in a
classic complete heap memory overwrite during the RtlAllocateHeap() function.




Vendor Response:

2006.05.06	Vendor notified via product-security@...le.com
2006.05.07	Vendor responded
2006.05.09	Vendor ask for more information
2006.05.11	Vendor released QuickTime 7.1
2006.05.12	Advisory released


Vendor was contacted in 05/06/2006, and they said:
"This message is being sent to you by a security analyst who has reviewed
your note.  The issue is being  investigated, and we appreciate the time
you have taken to report it to us. "

This vulnerability no longer exists in their new release(7.1),
However the vendor didnt formally inform me about the patch.
