This provides an excellent analysis of the problem. Further, it discusses 
the recommendation made by Vladimir Zakharychev from Webrecruiter. This 
recommendation is to set the "always_describe" / 
"PlsqlAlwaysDescribeProcedure" to "yes" / "on" in the "wdbsvr.app" / 
"dads.conf" file. This is a simple workaround and, as I can confirm, it does 
prevent exploitation. Why on earth didn't Oracle make this simple 
recommendation in the January 2006 CPU?

I hereby withdraw my workaround and would encourage everyone to adopt 
Vladimir's.

Cheers,
