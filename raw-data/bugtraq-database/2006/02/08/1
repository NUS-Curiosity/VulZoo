Subject: eyeOS <= 0.8.9 Remote Code Execution

# Vendor : eyeOS Project

# Version : eyeOS <= 0.8.9
# Risk : Remote Code Execution
##########################################################



Description:
eyeOS is a "web based operating system" written in php, that
lets you access your data and your applications from anywhere
with an internet connection. There is a very easy to exploit
Remote Code Execution issue in one of the core eyeOS files
that affects eyeOS 0.8.9 and earlier. A new version of eyeOS
has been released and all users should upgrade immediately.



Remote Code Execution:
There is a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in eyeOS that
is the result of improperly initializing users sessions.

if (!isset ($_SESSION))
      session_start ();

The above code is taken from desktop.php @ lines 20-21 and is
the reason code execution is possible. The $_SESSION array is
like any other variable until initialized with session_start()
unless session.auto_start is set to 1. What's even worse is that
obviously an attacker does not have to authenticate in order to
exploit this issue, which makes it much more dangerous.

http://eyeOS/desktop.php?baccio=eyeOptions.eyeapp&a=eyeOptions.eyeapp
&_SESSION[usr]=root&_SESSION[apps][eyeOptions.eyeapp][wrapup]=phpinfo();

The above url will successfully execute the phpinfo() command
on the target webserver with privileges of the webserver.



Solution:
A new version of eyeOS (eyeOS v0.8.10) is now available at the
official eyeOS website. Users are encouraged to upgrade as soon
as possible.
