 RTOS crttrap Arbitrary Library Loading Vulnerability


QNX Neutrino RTOS crttrap Arbitrary Library Loading Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.07.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=379
February 7, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

QNX Software Systems Ltd.'s Neutrino RTOS (QNX) is a real-time operating
system designed for use in embedded systems. More information is
available at:

  http://www.qnx.com/products/rtos/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an arbitrary library loading vulnerability in QNX
Neutrino RTOS's (QNX) crttrap command allows attackers to gain root
privileges.

The vulnerability specifically exists because crttrap trusts the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH that a user supplies. A local attacker can create a
malicious replacement for certain libraries and cause the replacement
to be loaded in place of the original by manipulating the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. The crttrap binary is installed
set user id root by default.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation provides local attackers with super-user
privileges on the affected system, allowing for complete control. The
system must be in text mode to exploit this vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities in QNX
Neutrino RTOS version 6.2.1. Earlier versions are also suspected to be
susceptible to exploitation.

V. WORKAROUND

Clear the set user ID or execute bits from the affected binary or remove
it entirely.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor has not responded to communication regarding this issue.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CAN-2005-1528 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for
security problems.
