Subject: Re: MyCO multiple vulnerabilities


Hello.

I foud this post by mistake (google search). I'm the creator of MyCO Guestbook, an i have some mentions to make: this project is a very old one, it is not under development for about 3 years now. It was made in a hurry, with lots of laks in code structure and security bugs. I do not recomend online use of it ! It is not offered anymore to the online community. If the download is found on any other websites but www.punctweb.com it is not my responsability.

Thankyou for your understanding and please excuse my english (i'm not a very good english speaking guy).

With respect,
punctweb.com
