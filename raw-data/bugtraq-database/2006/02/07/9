 	What about using DNS records, either a new kind, or something 
TXT-based (like SPF).  Maybe we could have it so that the domain owner 
could make an allow cookies record, with a list of matching domains, and 
if it doesn't exist, then the browser will only allow the cookie to be set 
for the full domain, not a subset of it.
