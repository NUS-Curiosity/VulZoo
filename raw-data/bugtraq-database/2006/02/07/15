Subject: Re: High Risk Vulnerability in Lexmark Printer Sharing Service


Here is a lexmark related local Security issue... I never got anywhere 
with regard to disclosure... enjoy

Lexmark skins code execution.

Either LEXBCES.exe, LXBKPSWX.exe, LXBKJSWX.exe, or LEXPPS.exe allows 
interaction from the user while running as SYSTEM. This interaction can 
lead to CMD.exe running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. I can not figure out 
which is the cause yet.

This information was tested on Lexmark X1185 all in one printer . Other 
printers and Dell versions of the Lexmark printer line may also be 
affected. Due to the lack of access to the specified devices I can not 
verify this information further.

Print any document. Wait for the voice to come through your speakers and 
say "Printing started". Click the "Appearance" icon on the window that 
has popped up near your systray. Once the next window pops up click 
"Additional styles (skins) are available on the Lexmark web site."

You should now have a browser running as SYSTEM.

Navigate to c:\windows\system32\ right click on cmd.exe and click execute.

This can obviously be automated via shatter style messaging ala 
SendMessage() and PostMessage().
