Subject: Internet Explorer remotely exploitable vulnerability in JScript's
 document.write() method


There is a remotely exploitable vulnerability in the Internet Explorer in the JScripting/Flash plugin section.

The problem lies in bad scripting of document.write() method being executed trough VBscript procedure triggered from ActionScript code within the crafted flash animation.
While exiting the IExplorer's jscript.dll call it causes a null pointer assignment in IE leading to the memory access violation and browser crash.

The following configurations has been tested and found vulnerable:
Windows 2000 sp4 with all MS patches
Windows XP sp2
Windows XP64
Windows 98 SE

An example DoS exploit exists at:
