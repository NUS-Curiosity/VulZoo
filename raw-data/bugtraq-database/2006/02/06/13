Synopsis
========

Apache can be exploited for cross-site scripting attacks and is
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

Background
==========

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet. mod_imap provides support for server-side image maps; mod_ssl
provides secure HTTP connections.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/apache      < 2.0.55-r1                      >= 2.0.55-r1
                                                        *>= 2.0.54-r16
                                                          == 1.3.34-r2
                                                        *>= 1.3.34-r11

Description
===========

Apache's mod_imap fails to properly sanitize the "Referer" directive of
imagemaps in some cases, leaving the HTTP Referer header unescaped. A
flaw in mod_ssl can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the site uses
a custom "Error 400" document. These vulnerabilities were reported by
Marc Cox and Hartmut Keil, respectively.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit mod_imap to inject arbitrary HTML or
JavaScript into a user's browser to gather sensitive information.
Attackers could also cause a Denial of Service on hosts using the SSL
module (Apache 2.0.x only).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version, depending on
whether they still use the old configuration style
(/etc/apache/conf/*.conf) or the new one (/etc/apache2/httpd.conf).

2.0.x users, new style config:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/apache-2.0.55-r1"

2.0.x users, old style config:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "=net-www/apache-2.0.54-r16"

1.x users, new style config:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "=net-www/apache-1.3.34-r11"

1.x users, old style config:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "=net-www/apache-1.3.34-r2"
