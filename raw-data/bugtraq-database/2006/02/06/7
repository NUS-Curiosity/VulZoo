[PoC usage]

# ./reset_display_sonyericsson 00:12:EE:XX:XX:XX

[Details]

A short raw L2CAP packet such as :

08 01 01 00

It represents the following L2CAP header fields :

code L2CAP_ECHO_REQ;
ident 1
length 1

The "real" packet sent is, in fact, 4 bytes long.

The DoS can be triggered when the length sent in the L2CAP field is equal to the real length minus 3 (which is the size of the L2CAP header here).
