Synopsis
========

ADOdb is vulnerable to SQL injections if used in conjunction with a
PostgreSQL database.

Background
==========

ADOdb is an abstraction library for PHP creating a common API for a
wide range of database backends.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-php/adodb       < 4.71                                >= 4.71

Description
===========

Andy Staudacher discovered that ADOdb does not properly sanitize all
parameters.

Impact
======

By sending specifically crafted requests to an application that uses
ADOdb and a PostgreSQL backend, an attacker might exploit the flaw to
execute arbitrary SQL queries on the host.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ADOdb users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/adodb-4.71"

References
==========
