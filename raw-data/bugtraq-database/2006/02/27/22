Subject: Mail Transport System Professional--Open Relay Hole



What: Mail Transport System Professional is a RFC compliant mail server 
for Windows.

Who: http://www.mtsprofessional.com/

Problem: Open relay hole when forwarding all outgoing mail through an ISP.

When configured to forward all outgoing mail through an ISP MTS Pro will 
accept and forward all messages that are claimed to be from a local 
domain as specified in the MAIL FROM:<.....> verb of the SMTP 
conversation regardless of point of origin.

All versions to date are affected.

Fix: MTS Pro is a pay for play solution, please contact the vendor for 
an upgrade. The issue has been resolved.
