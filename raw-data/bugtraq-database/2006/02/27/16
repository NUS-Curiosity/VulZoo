Vulnerable Systems:
Tested on zip.lib.php v 1.1

Detail :
Directory traversal while extracting (.ZIP) 

What is  Directory traversal in archivers?

that allowed one to create malicous archive files,
which would overwrite system files or place dangerous
files in defined directory(example :shell.php in
wwwroot directory)
This could be abused by sending an archive to a local
user who would unzip / untar an archive, the archive
would then be able to overwrite any file to which the
user has write permissions, thus it could also be
abused if a system ran som antivirus software which
automatically opened archive files.

harmless exploit:
use HEAP [Hamid Evil Archive Pack]
