Norton Internet monitoring tools issues
Versions Affected : *
Fix : No

What im writing about is how to stop the internet of some user that is
using the norton tools and IRC / any other chat at the same time.

By default norton monitor checks for words like "keylogger" , "start
keylogger" , "key logger" and etc.etc.

Example for irc :
Start a mIRC or any other IRC client that u like and connect to some server.
Type down /ctcp yournick start keylogger . By default norton monitors
your mIRC Process and your logs of it so it sees "star keylogger" and
automaticly blocks mIRC.exe from starting and automaticly blocks port
6667 or whatever port ure using to connect to IRC. Nice eh ?
