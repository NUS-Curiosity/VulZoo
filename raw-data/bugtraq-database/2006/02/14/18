SQL injection in PHP Classifieds 6.20
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author: Audun Larsen (audun dot larsen at lkonsult dot no)
Date: February 14, 2006

Affected software:
==================
Name: PHP Classifieds
URL: http://www.deltascripts.com/phpclassifieds
Version: 6.20 (older versions not tested)
Released: December 10, 2006

Vendors description:
====================
PHP Classifieds is one of the most customizable Classified ad program that
exist for PHP and MySql.


Discussion:
===========
In member_login.php the POST data is only escaped using htmlspecialchars(),
wich fails to remove SQL specific characters. This enables an attacker to
login using only the e-mail address of a valid user. No password required.

Exploit:
========
To login without a password you need a valid users e-mail address (often 
displayed in a users profile). In the E-mail address field enter:

some@...l.com' -- '


Tested with:
============
Apache 2.0.55 (running on windows xp)
PHP Classifieds 6.20 Released 10.12.2005
PHP 5.0.5.5 (magic_quotes_gpc = Off)

Solution:
=========
Vendor notified February 13, 2005.
Reported fixed by vendor February 14,2005.
