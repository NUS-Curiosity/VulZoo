Subject: Amazon phishing scam on Yahoo servers


We just got some emails for amazon phishing scams.  Turns out the scam 
domain was registered just today (same day).  Internic and others aren't 
reporting it, but Melbourne IT does.  Phishing site resides on Yahoo's 
servers, but their Abuse department closed at 5pm.  A full 6 or so hours 
to run before they open back up.
