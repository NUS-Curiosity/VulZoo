   I know. The first time I got that "double" was on 15.12.2004.
   Actually there four components to most of the attacks. There are
   the two programs you are talking about. And there are two scripts
   acting as helpers to download the stuff.

   As I'm not familiar with php I'm not sure if php is the problem.
   To me it seems more likely that problem lies in the way people
   "program" their webapplications.

   I do not see so much php vulnerabilities but vulnerabilities in
   application written in php - written by people not thinking about
   input validation, not thinking about buffer overflows.

   See above. The second part was in there since at least 15th of December
   last year.
