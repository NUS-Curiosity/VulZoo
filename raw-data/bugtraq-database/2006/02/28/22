VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP
System Management Homepage (SMH) versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.4
running on Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could be exploited
remotely to allow unauthorized access to files via directory
traversal.

References: None

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP System Management Homepage (SMH) versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.4

BACKGROUND

RESOLUTION

HP is providing the following workaround for this issue until such
time as another resolution is available. At that time this
Security Bulletin will be re-released with the latest information.

This workaround involves manually editing the ".namazurc" file in
the HP SMH installation as described below:

This requires a single line modification to the resource file. The
affected file is located in the "installdir\data\help\web_cgi"
directory and is called ".namazurc".

NOTE:<installdir> is the base directory where HP SMH is installed.
A typical default installation would be "C:\hp\hpsmhï¿½ for
<installdir>

First, copy the ".namazurc" file to a backup location. If there
are problems during the editing process, the original file can be
restored.

Next, edit the ".namazurc" file. Search for #Lang in the file to
find the following text:

#Lang ja

Depending on the language and version of HP SMH installed, use the
appropriate method below to edit the file:

 * If the HP SMH installation is an English language installation,
   change the line to:

Lang en

 * If the HP SMH installation is a Japanese language installation
   AND
   the version of HP SMH is 2.0.0 through 2.1.3,
   change the line to:

Lang ja

 * If the HP SMH installation is a Japanese language installation
   AND
   the version of HP SMH is 2.1.4,
   change the line to:

Lang ja_JP.SJIS

NOTE: The "#" at the beginning of the text must be removed.

To complete the change, save the edited ".namazurc" file and
restart HP SMH.
