	security issue

---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated udev packages fix a security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:175818
Issue date:        2006-02-27
Product:           Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2005-3631
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated udev packages that fix a security issue are now available.

The udev package contains an implementation of devfs in userspace using
sysfs and /sbin/hotplug.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 2 - i386
Fedora Core 3 - i386, x86_64

3. Problem description:

Richard Cunningham discovered a flaw in the way udev sets permissions on
various files in /dev/input. It may be possible for an authenticated
attacker to gather sensitive data entered by a user at the console, such
as passwords. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has
assigned the name CVE-2005-3631 to this issue.

All users of udev should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

You can verify each package with the following command:

    rpm --checksig -v <filename>

If you only wish to verify that each package has not been corrupted or
tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
