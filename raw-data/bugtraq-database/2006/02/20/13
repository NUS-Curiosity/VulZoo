Indeed, it has become an annoying trend everybody talks about but nobody 
writes about. Trojan horses, worms, etc. exploiting PHP bugs. Either 
vulnerabilities in know applications such as WordPress, PHPBB, Drupal, 
etc. or actually trying different permutations to attack the site.

Many of these are indeed based on the old kaiten code. As someone 
mentioned previously in this thread or another, it can even be found on 
packet storm.

Still, this one has a kick in the second payload with a worm that also 
attacks other systems and I can say is not just yet another PHP worm, 
but actually what I'd call linux malware.

Anyone else seeing their web server logs going crazy with new patterns 
every day? Email me, I am starting a sharing system where these can be 
shared mutually so we can better protect ourselves, create signatures, etc.
