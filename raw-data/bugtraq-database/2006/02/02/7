Subject: SoftMaker Shop is vulnerable to XSS


Inputs in the SoftMaker Shop is not properly sanitized, and XSS is possible in a lot of the systems input fields and url parameters.

Some fields have been filtered in a basic form, so that simple scripting like "<script>alert('XSS')</script>" is not possible. However, since the filtering is not based on white listing you can conduct successful XSS attacks with code like "<IMG SRC=javascript:alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))>".

PoC: http://www.example.example/shop/handle/varer/sok/resultat.asp?strSok=%3CIMG+SRC%3Djavascript%3Aalert%28%26quot%3BXSS%26quot%3B%29%3E&valg=varer
