I'm not sure of what version, as I am awaiting the IT folks here at
Cornell's response to that question.  I do indeed realize everything
you've said.

That's true.  What I think it is, though, is a session id problem that
fails to do any authentication at all.  We'll figure that out in due time.

Nope, the Kerberos authentication timed out.  It was a library computer,
so it's set to a very low time, but apparently it doesn't matter one way
or the other how low it's set to, because it doesn't protect from anything
at all.

I realize this.  This isn't a problem.

Right, but that's not the point at all.  The point is that people can get
into BB and do whatever has been allowed to someone else's account.  It's
really irrelevent, IMO, what they can do... I was just putting those there
as examples, and to show the severity in my case, and - judging by the
emails I've received - many other peoples'.

I think you're right, and I think the people here have not updated it.  It
has been reported to them before, I've learned, a few months ago, and
they've done nothing about it.

It may not be that issue at all, though, but it certainly could be. 
Likewise, the information I heard about them not having updated it could
be untrue as well, though I *did* hear this from a higher-up IT person.

Thank you for the presumption, and I have already emailed Blackboard (from
another email address) with the issue's details.

The fact that people can't easily call in and report things to Blackboard,
and you need to be a "known contact," I'd also call a flaw in their
system, albeit in a bit of a different way.

I actually work at Cornell's helpdesk, and this is not an issue we deal
with.  The higher up Cornell IT folks had been contacted, though, before I
submitted this bit to bugtraq.
