Synopsis
========

A flaw in the parsing of Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) has been
discovered in libtasn1, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Libtasn1 is a library used to parse ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation
One) objects, and perform DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) decoding.
Libtasn1 is included with the GNU TLS library, which is used by
applications to provide a cryptographically secure communications
channel.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/libtasn1      < 0.2.18                         >= 0.2.18
  2  net-libs/gnutls        < 1.2.10                         >= 1.2.10
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Evgeny Legerov has reported a flaw in the DER decoding routines
provided by libtasn1, which could cause an out of bounds access to
occur.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could cause an application using libtasn1 to crash
and potentially execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted
input.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libtasn1 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libtasn1-0.2.18"

All GNU TLS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/gnutls-1.2.10"
