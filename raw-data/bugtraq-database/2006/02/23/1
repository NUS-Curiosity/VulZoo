Subject: Re: Multiple Injection Vulnerabilities in PHP PEAR::Auth Module


Thanks for the advisory.

Just out of curiosity, is there a reason why you did not specify which 
backends are vulnerable?

Yeah, I can go dig it up (and will) but the advisory would have been far 
more useful if it included the list of vulnerable backends; end users 
could know at a glance if they _need_ to upgrade.

Thanks again,

Ben
