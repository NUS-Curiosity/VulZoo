Ok, I should have been a little more specific; my fault.  I've 
discovered what looks like an interesting vuln in one of their
products and I'm not sure who to fwd the info to.  I've
searched and Googled, but to no avail.  Any info would be good,
preferably something that doesn't involve filling out a survey :-)
