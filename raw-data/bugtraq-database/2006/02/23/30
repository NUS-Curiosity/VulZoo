Your sage wisdom on the subject of helping people respond appropriately 
to attacks, crime and fraud (insider/outsider/etc) is duly acknowledged.

We all have 'knowledge' that our systems have been attacked based on the 
fact that software originating from Microsoft is present on our boxes, 
and the fact that microprocessors designed only for stand-alone use 
(absent data communications or other untrustworthy I/O) have been 
improperly and irresponsibly thrust onto the marketplace by Intel, AMD, 
et al -- companies with the technical awareness of the proper solution 
to the problem who withhold not only the solution but also withhold 
disclosure of their knowledge of the problem.

Sincerely,

Jason Coombs
