Description
===========
The IronMail C-class is designed to handle the email traffic of the most demanding email environments in the world,
including ISPs and multinational corporations with several geographically dispersed gateways. 

Vulnerability Description
=========================
A vulnerability was reported in IronMail. A remote user can cause denial of service conditions.
If the target IronMail service is configured with "Denial of Service Protection" enabled, then a remote user can 
generate a TCP SYN flood, sending malformed packets via multiple connections to cause the server to become busy.


Proof of Concept
================
You can use hping or perl scripts to created malformed packets and multiple connections. The service remains busy
and not blocks the DoS DDoS attacks.
