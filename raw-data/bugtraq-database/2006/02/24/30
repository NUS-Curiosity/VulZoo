Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0010

Package names:	   sudo, tar  
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-02-24
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

Package description:
  sudo
  Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain
  users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands
  as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo operates on a
  per-command basis.  It is not a replacement for the shell.  Features
  include: the ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a
  per-host basis, copious logging of each command (providing a clear
  audit trail of who did what), a configurable timeout of the sudo
  command, and the ability to use the same configuration file (sudoers)
  on many different machines.

  tar
  The GNU tar program saves many files together in one archive and can
  restore individual files (or all of the files) from that archive. Tar
  can also be used to add supplemental files to an archive and to update
  or list files in the archive. Tar includes multivolume support,
  automatic archive compression/decompression, the ability to perform
  remote archives, and the ability to perform incremental and full
  backups.

Problem description:
  sudo < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - New Upstream
  - SECURITY Fix: Tavis Ormandy has reported a vulnerability in Sudo caused
    due to an error within the environment cleaning. This can be exploited
    by a user with sudo access to a python script to gain access to an
    interactive python prompt via the "PYTHONINSPECT" environment variable.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name  CVE-2006-0151 to this issue. 

  tar < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
