Subject: SSH bypassing in Phishing


Here is a bit of "new stuff" (now old) that now becomes partially 
public, and is very disturbing.

Financial organizations that rely on encryption for security of web 
transactions can contact me for details on who to actually contact on 
answers if they haven't been contacted by now, as this is the least of 
their worries.

Thanks,

	Gadi.
