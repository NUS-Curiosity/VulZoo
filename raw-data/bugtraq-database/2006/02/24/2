Subject: Administrivia: New Bugtraq moderator



Bugtraq Subscribers,

Due to a recent lateral shift I've made, I am no longer moderating 
the Bugtraq mailing list.  I haven't moderated full time for a  
while, and now it's time to hand the list over to a new manager.  
David McKinney <dm@...urityfocus.com> will be taking over Bugtraq 
as primary moderator as of today.  I have worked with Dave since 
the early SecurityFocus days and am confident that he will do an 
excellent job.

I wish to personally thank all of you for an enjoyable 
four-and-a-half years or so.
