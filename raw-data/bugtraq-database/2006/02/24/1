There's a LOT of phishing domains on Yahoo.  Apparently all you need to
do setup an account is a fake address and phone number.  I routinely
report it to them.  You can always send an email to
phishing-abuse@...yahoo-inc.com as well as anyone else you can find.

Thanks for the reply, I'm seeing all sorts of strange URLs being used
for the popular sites such as banks and ebay, amazon, paypal.  Amazing
isn't it?
