Subject: announcement: reporting and mitigating botnets


Hi guys. There have been numerous queries about the subject of reporting 
and mitigating botnets in the last few mounths.

I promised I would get back to all of you, here we go.

We started a new PUBLIC and OPEN mailing list where anyone can join in 
and report a botnet command and control (C&C) server they see.

The mailing list will serve as as place:
*. Where you can discuss detection techniques.
*. Where you can report the botnets.
*. Where all relevant private groups will get your reports.
*. Where the relevant ISP will be automatically notified.
*. Where you can see action taken on your reports.

To subscribe, go to the following page:
http://www.whitestar.linuxbox.org/mailman/listinfo/botnets

Otherwise, to report a botnet C&C PRIVATELY and reach all relevant 
groups, please send email to:
c2report@...tf.org

Thanks,

	Gadi.
