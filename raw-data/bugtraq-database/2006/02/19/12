while I agree with you that for learning and practicing it would suffice
to build your own systems to tamper with, I have to disagree on the part
that hacking into other people's systems *without* doing any damage
should be illegal.

Why is that? Well, first of all because the definition of what is and
what isn't hacking is very blurry. Is a portscan hacking? Is directory
traversal as in the case of Daniel Cuthbert [1] hacking?

In addition to that some vulnerabilities can be discovered only ITW,
simply because you cannot rebuild that environment in your lab. Two
years ago we had a case like that over here in Germany [2] (the article
is in german, but maybe an online translator will help). The OBSOC
(Online Business Solution Operation Center) system of the Deutsche
Telekom AG did not do proper authentication, so by manipulating the URL
you could access other customers' data. How would you detect such a
vulnerability without actually hacking the system? Is one supposed to
not notice these things? Will that really make them go away?
