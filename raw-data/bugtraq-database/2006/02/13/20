Subject: Folder Guard password protection bypass


tested on Folder Guard v4.11
bypassing the Folder Guard password is done by renaming(or moving) the password file.
the file is FGuard.FGP, after we rename it the Folder Guard will run and wont ask for a password

for questions or currections please contact me at

thank you.
