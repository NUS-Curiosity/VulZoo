Of course it is a real threat.

ZIP(500 empty text files + 1 KB VIRUS) = not detectable

Does not it make any sense? What if somebody uses a portal server and
secure that portal with secure protect and let users upload and
download files?

If it is a server protect it has to secure server.

And the logical way for detecting must be checking both size and file
count then skip instead of just counting files and skip.
