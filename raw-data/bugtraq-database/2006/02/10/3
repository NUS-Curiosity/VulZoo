It is also almost always worth trying: abuse@ (though come to think of
that, one at least one network that I'm on, that email is unchecked.
I'll have to fix that.)

Also, I used Sam Spade to grab the information on that IP block and
got a the technical contact's address: nic-tech@...os-inc.com

Hope those help.
