3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Lotus Notes, which
can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system. 

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in kvarcve.dll
when constructing the full pathname of a compressed file to check for
its existence before extracting it from a ZIP archive. This can be
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when the 
user extracts a compressed file with a long filename from within the
Notes attachment viewer.

4) Solution 

Update to version 6.5.5.
