Subject: Internet Explorer Phishing mouseover issue


Greetings and Salutations:

See below for the entire phishing e-mail I received.  When I hover the mouse over the link "https://secure.ebay.com/eBayISAPI.dll?action=verify&id=00626654&user=" in Internet Explorer at the bottom of the page I see:
https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn

When I click on the link it takes me to:
http://216.81.70.14/phpBB2/.eBay/index.htm?SignIn&co_partnerId=2&pUserId=&siteid=0&pageType=&pa1=&i1=&bshowgif=&UsingSSL=&ru=&pp=&pa2=&errmsg=&runame=&ruparams=&ruproduct=&sid=&favoritenav=&migrateVisitor=

In Firefox it also shows "https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn" but when I click on the link two pages pop up, both taking me to "https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn"

Has anybody seen this before?  I know that the mouseover issues have been discussed before but I was under the impression that they had all been fixed.

Ken
