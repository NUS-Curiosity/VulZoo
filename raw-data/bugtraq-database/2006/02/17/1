Even if rootkits aren't actually installed and information isn't
actually revealed, the victim cannot be sure of that. Once they
discover that unauthorised access has occurred, they have to act
accordingly (e.g. notify customers, issue new cards, re-install the
system etc).

Anyone who manages to obtain unauthorised access may have already done
harm, regardless of what (if anything) they do with that access
thereafter.

Regarding new "hacking" laws, a more serious threat to overall
security is the idea of criminalising the posession of "hacking
tools", which will make even legitimate pen-testing difficult. It may
not be possible to simply outsource pen-testing to a country where
such tools are legal (e.g. due to laws restricting the transfer of
sensitive data abroad).
