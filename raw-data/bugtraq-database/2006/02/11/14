3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Lotus Notes, which
can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security
restrictions. 

The vulnerability is caused due to directory traversal errors in
kvarcve.dll when generating the preview of a compressed file from 
ZIP, UUE and TAR archives. This can be exploited to delete arbitrary
files that are accessible to the Notes user.

Successful exploitation requires that the user is e.g. tricked into
previewing a compressed file with directory traversal sequences in
its filename from within the Notes attachment viewer.

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Update to version 6.5.5 or 7.0.1.
