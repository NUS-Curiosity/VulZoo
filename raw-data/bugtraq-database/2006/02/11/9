Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0006

Package names:	   fcron, kernel, unzip  
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-02-10
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  fcron
  Fcron is a scheduler. It aims at replacing Vixie Cron, so it implements most
  of its functionalities.

  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.

  unzip
  The unzip utility is used to list, test, or extract files from a zip
  archive.  Zip archives are commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  The zip
  utility, included in the zip package, creates zip archives.  Zip and
  unzip are both compatible with archives created by PKWARE(R)'s PKZIP
  for MS-DOS, but the programs' options and default behaviors do differ
  in some respects.

Problem description:
  fcron < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Adam Zabrocki and Karol Wiesek has reported vulnerabilities
    in fcron, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain
    escalated privileges. The issue exits in convert-fcrontab when handling
    an overly long username supplied via the command line and due to missing
    validation of username. (SA18719)

  kernel < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Linux kernel before 2.6.15.3 down to 2.6.12, while
    constructing an ICMP response, does not properly handle when the
    ip_options_echo function in icmp.c fails, which allows remote attackers
    to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors such as (1) record-route
    and (2) timestamp IP options with the needaddr bit set and a truncated
    value.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-0454 to this issue.

  - SECURITY Fix: Linus Torvalds: Fix outstanding gzip/zlib security issues.
  - SECURITY Fix: Disallows local users to write to privileged IO ports
    via OUTS instruction isofs driver ignore parameters.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2005-0204 to this issue.
  
  unzip < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Fixes Buffer overflow vulnerability which allows local
    users to execute arbitrary code via a long filename command line argument.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2005-4667 to this issue.
