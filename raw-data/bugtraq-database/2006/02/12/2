Synopsis
========

KPdf includes vulnerable Xpdf code to handle PDF files, making it
vulnerable to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

KPdf is a KDE-based PDF viewer included in the kdegraphics package.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  kde-base/kdegraphics     < 3.4.3-r4                   >= 3.4.3-r4
  2  kde-base/kpdf            < 3.4.3-r4                   >= 3.4.3-r4
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

KPdf includes Xpdf code to handle PDF files. Dirk Mueller discovered
that the Xpdf code is vulnerable a heap based overflow in the splash
rasterizer engine.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF file
with Kpdf, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the rights of the user running the affected application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All kdegraphics users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdegraphics-3.4.3-r4"

All Kpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kpdf-3.4.3-r4"
