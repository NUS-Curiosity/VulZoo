Subject: Re: Stack overflow vulnerability in Internet Explorer exploitable trough VBScript and JScript scripting engines.


Dear porkythepig@...pi.pl,

This  is  a  case  of  'real' stack structure overflow, not stack buffer
overflow  (stack  overrun)  as  you  maybe  think. The process' stack is
exhausted  because  of recursive call. Exploitation of this situation to
execute code may be hard, if possible.
