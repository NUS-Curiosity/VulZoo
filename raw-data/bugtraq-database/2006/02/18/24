Description:
  Ulrich Drepper discovered [0] a weakness in OpenSSH [1] version 4.2p1
  and earlier, caused due to the insecure use of the system(3) function
  in scp(1) when performing copy operations using filenames that are
  supplied by the user from the command line. This can be exploited to
  execute shell commands with privileges of the user running scp(1). The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2006-0225 [2] to the problem.
