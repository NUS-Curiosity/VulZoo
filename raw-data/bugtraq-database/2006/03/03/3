 Retrospect 7 Backup client DoS Vulnerability


EMC Dantz Retrospect 7 Backup client DoS Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.02.06
http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?type=vulnerabilities
March 02, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

EMC Dantz Retrospect is a network backup client designed for small
to mid-sized businesses. Dantz protects millions of computers world
wide by providing enterprise class backup protection for servers,
notebooks, and business critical applications.

More information on this software package can be found on the
vendors site:

  http://www.dantz.com

II. DESCRIPTION

The Dantz Retrospect 7 backup client listens on TCP port 497 for
commands from the central backup server. Sending a specially crafted
malformed  packet to this socket can force the backup client to
terminate.

This allows for an unauthenticated attacker to effectively disable the
network backup services for a target network.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation appears to be limited to a DoS only condition. From debug
log information it appears that the packet corruption is detected by
the application which then decides to terminate rather than discard the
data. The following type information may be found in debug logs of
exploited machines

Assertion failure at \retroclient\Win\winutil.c-1201
DebugFail: Client Terminated
Retrospect Client Terminated.

IV. DETECTION

This exploit has been tested with the Dantz Retrospect Client version
7.0.107. This is the latest available on the vendor's website.

The version available for Mac is 6.0 has also been tested
and is not vulnerable to the issue described in this document.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is unaware of any workaround for this issue.
