Subject: Arin.net XSS

Title
ARIN.NET input validation holes in "?queryinput=" allows remote users conduct cross-site scripting attacks

Notification
Multiple attempts to contact Arin site administrators went unanswered

Exploit Included:  Yes

Description
The "?queryinput=" script does not properly validate user-supplied input in several parameters to filter HTML code. A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. 

Some demonstration exploit URLs are provided:
