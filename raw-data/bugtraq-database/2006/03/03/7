Or perhaps cache the images along with the message, to be deleted when
the message is.  That way one can open an email many times without
accessing a web resource each time. 

It would also allow someone to forward a message, and include the
content as it is currently, as opposed to how it may be in several
hours.

Hmmm. I didn't realise the "Show Images" setting got stored, and I
don't think that's the best strategy from a privacy point of view.  I
take it you mean "stored for that one message", and not "stored for
all messages from that sender", or "stored for all messages" - but
still .... it would be better to not store it at all, IMHO.  Users can
always add senders to their Address Book if they want to evade the
"block-images" feature.

How about displaying more option buttons when remote images have been
blocked ?
e.g. :
    Show remote images this time only
    Always show remote images when this message is viewed
    Always show remote images from this sender
    Always show remote images
