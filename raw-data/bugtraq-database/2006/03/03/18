Steve et al.,

I'm most reminded of the adage 'never attribute to malice what can 
adequately be explained by a dumb regex [sic]'.

We here at IntelliContact had no idea that our software was applying the 
tracking we provide to our customers onto CSS references, much less that 
Thunderbird loaded these links regardless of general-user accessible 
security settings.   The tracking information we put in emails is part 
of the value we provide to our customers (since our inception, always 
under the name of IntelliContact), but had/have no intention of 
exploiting security problems such as this to gain such information on 
their behalf.  The foundation of our product is to facilitate 
communication between our customers and willing recipients 
(http://www.intellicontact.com/terms/anti-spam.php).

I've filed the issue mentioned above as a bug with my team and we'll get 
it fixed as soon as possible. I laud your attention to detail with this 
discovery and invite anyone with further concerns to contact me directly.

Thanks
