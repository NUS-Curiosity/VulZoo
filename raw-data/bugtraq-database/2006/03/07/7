TITLE:
======

phpBannerExchange 2.0 Directory Traversal Vulnerability


SEVERITY:
=========

High


SOFTWARE:
=========

phpBannerExchange 2.0 and prior


INFO:
=====

phpBannerExchange is a PHP/mySQL script that allows virtually anyone with minimal knowledge of PHP, mySQL and web hosting to run their own banner exchange. This script was inspired by some of the greatest ad rotation scripts on the Internet such as Webadverts and phpAdsNew.

Support Website : www.eschew.net


DESCRIPTION:
============

A vulnerability has been identified in phpBannerExchange 2.0 and prior versions, which may be exploited by remote attackers to access arbitrary files outside of the webroot directory. This flaw is due to an input validation error in the script "resetpw.php" that does not properly sanitize the user-supplied input, which may be exploited by remote attackers to retrieve arbitrary files from a vulnerable system.


POC:
====

Go to the lost password script (resetpw.php) and type in ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd as your email address. This shows us the contents of the /etc/passwd file of the system hosting the vulnerable script.


VENDOR STATUS:
==============

Vendor was contacted repeatedly through email and on the support forums but no response received till date.


FIX:
====

No fix available as of date.
