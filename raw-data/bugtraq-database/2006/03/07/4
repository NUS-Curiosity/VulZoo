Subject: histhost v1.0.0 xss and possible rmdir


��� summary
	software: HitHost
	vendors website: http://daverave.64digits.com/index.php?page=hithost
	versions: <= 1.0.0
	class: remote
	status: unpatched
	exploit: available
	solution: not available
	discovered by: retard
	risk level: medium

��� description
	hithost uses $_GET variables in crucial parts of their code causing
	xss vulnerabilities and _possibly_ allowing users to rm dirs chmoded
	to 0777

	in ./admin/deleteuser.php:
15	else
16	{
17	unlink("users/$deleteuser/password.php");
18	unlink("users/$deleteuser/counter.php");
19	rmdir("users/$deleteuser/");
20	echo "The user <b>$deleteuser</b> has been deleted";
21	}
	
	as you see line 19 raises suspision of the possibility of rming 0777 dirs
	i've tried it on on my personal server with no sucess, if someone knows
	of a way let me know.
	
	in ./admin/viewuser.php:
6	$viewuser = $_GET['user'];
7	include("users/$viewuser/counter.php");
8	echo "Username: <b>$viewuser</b><br><br>";
9	echo "Number of counter hits: $hits<br><br>";

	this code is self explanitory, the script does not sanitise the $_GET['user']
	allowing users to easily shove xss into the variable.
