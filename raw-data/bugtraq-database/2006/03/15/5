Subject: Re: histhost v1.0.0 xss and possible rmdir


and my manpages for rmdir(1) [the utility] and rmdir(2) [the system
call] both say that the directory must be empty (ie, have no entries
other than "." or "..").

rmdir(2) should fail and errno should be set to ENOTEMPTY if the
directory is not empty.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
