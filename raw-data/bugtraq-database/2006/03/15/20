Subject: WebVulnCrawl searching excluded directories for hackable web servers


A misguided person is using the robots.txt exclusion file to search for
vulnerable web applications. What he plans on doing with this list of
vulnerable web applications is up to debate.

What he is doing is a violation of the RFC's (governing robots.txt..
Yes, hackers do that also)

The robots.txt file is NOT AN ACCESS CONTROL LIST, and SHOULD NOT BE
USED TO 'HIDE' DIRECTORIES. AALL DIRECTORIES SHOULD BE PROTECTED AGAINST
Directory listing.

The only files and directories in the robots.txt file should be files
and directories that are already exposed on the web, and not include any
hidden or private directories.

Take this opportunity to review your web logs, and robots.txt file to
see what normally unpublished information and hints it may expose.

If you see WebVulnCrawl.blogspot.com in your logs, you may wish to lodge
complaints (after tightening up your security)

Further, dshield shows them portscanning the net also, looking for
unpublished information on unpublished servers.

Spammers harvesting email addresses? (illegal under federal can-spam
law) Hackers looking for credit card info? Hackers looking for
vulnerable web servers? (WebVuln Crawl?)

Either case, illegal under FEDERAL 1990 computer abuse and fraud act,
'attempted access beyond authorization'

Several other people also think this is illegal:
