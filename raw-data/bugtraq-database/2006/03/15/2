Overview:
=========
A vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel which can be exploited to run
a code of attacker's choice on user's PC.

Affected products:
==================
All tests were performed using Microsoft Excel 2003 (11.6560.6568) on
Windows XP and Windows 2000 Pro platforms. It is likely that all MS Excel
products are vulnerable.

Cause and Effect:
=================
Sufficient data validation is not performed when parsing "Named Range" 
definitions in the document file, which makes possible to produce a negative
32-bit value that is later used as a length parameter for msvcrt.memmove()
function. As a result, a large chunk of memory is copied overwriting
critical memory ranges, including the stack space. 

Demonstration:
==============
Below is a fragment of the empty XLS file containing a named range definition
"Sheet1!TEST1". Two bytes marked with asterisks cause exception to occur
when set to 0xFF.
