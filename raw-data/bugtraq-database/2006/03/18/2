Something strange...

I tried under FireFox 1.0.7 and seems that when you check the sources, it's crashing.

I tried also under FireFox 1.5.0.1, it's also crashing when i check the sources... but that one depend, another friend tried it under the same version and it's also crashing ... is it exploitable..?

Regards
