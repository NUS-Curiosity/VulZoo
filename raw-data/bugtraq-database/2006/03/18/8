Hmm. I'm running a Windows 98 SE box and just tried what you said. Didn't 
effect me "instantly" or after a time period. You sure you're not just 
seeing shit? :P

Plus, keeping it real, there's a fair difference between a BoF that you can 
perform easily remotely, and a BoF you have to talk people into. "Hey, 
dude... can you just type <command> and if it don't work, hit refresh a few 
times?" ... can you see it?
