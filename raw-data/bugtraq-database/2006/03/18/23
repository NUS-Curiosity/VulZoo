Which RFC? If you mean http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots-rfc.html ,
that's not an RFC, it's an Internet Draft that expired in 1997.

Yup, definitely.

As you already pointed out "the robots.txt file is NOT AN ACCESS CONTROL LIST".
In fact, with HTTP you can only tell if you're authorized to access a
document by attempting to access it and looking at the HTTP response code.
Unless you're clairvoyant, of course.

Well, then go ahead an sue him.


I really don't see what you're complaining about here. This guy seems
to be pretty open about what he's doing, so I doubt he will be doing
something evil with the information he gains... in contrast to all the
really bad guys who're doing just the same *right now*, *without*
telling anyone about it.

If you have confidential information on your webserver, then secure it
instead of complaining about people who happen to stumble over it.
If you have potentially vulnerable code on your site, pay someone to
audit it and fix the bugs instead of complaining about someone who
simply requests a few URLs.


Bye,
	Peter
