Subject: Re: Remote overflow in MSIE script action handlers (mshtml.dll)


Confirmed on XP SP2, latest greatest, etc.

"Unhandled exception at 0x7dcfa61d in iexplore.exe: 0xC0000005: Access
violation writing location 0x002911d8."

I had to shut all (Windows) explorer and Internet Explorer windows first though.

cheers,
 Jamie
