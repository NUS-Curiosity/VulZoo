Hey Andrea,

Based on your tests, this device shows the standard incremental IP ID 
behaviour: so, nothing special here.

Yeah, you're right. Also closed ports (returning a TCP RST to both SYN and
SYNACK) show the flawed behaviour i've observed, and can of course be used
to perform an idle scan with nmap, e.g.:

root@...dora:~# hping -S research.mediaservice.net -p 563 -c 1
HPING research.mediaservice.net (eth0 82.56.144.13): S set, 40 headers + 0 
data bytes
len=46 ip=82.56.144.13 ttl=59 DF id=31911 sport=563 flags=RA seq=0 win=0 
rtt=83.9 ms

--- research.mediaservice.net hping statistic ---
1 packets tramitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 83.9/83.9/83.9 ms
root@...dora:~# nmap -sI research.mediaservice.net:563 target -p 21-25

After further testing, i confirm that Linux 2.6 seems to be vunerable in
every configuration i've seen so far. Since i didn't get any feedback yet
from the Linux kernel developers nor from Cisco (other vendors may also be
affected) i've the feeling they're not going to fix this any soon: in the
next days i'll see if i can find some spare time to dig a bit into kernel
code to identify the cause and maybe even provide a patch.

Cheers,
