3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in 
Microsoft Internet Explorer, which can be exploited by malicious 
people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the processing of the 
"createTextRange()" method call applied on a radio button control. 
This can be exploited by e.g. a malicious web site to corrupt memory 
in a way, which allows the program flow to be redirected to the heap.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
