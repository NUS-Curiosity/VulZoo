Well, it may be related to GR security. 

SinFP[1] exploits a difference in IP ID generation to detect
(to some extent) the use of GR security inside a Linux kernel. 

In fact, last time I checked, there was an option in GRsec
configuration to alter IP ID generation behaviour. You can try
to play with this.
