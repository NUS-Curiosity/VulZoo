  Same goes for any other executable.  This isn't news and it isn't unique
to firefox.  If you download and install programs, or extensions, or
plugins, or active x objects, or any other kind of executable code, it can
be malicious.  Why aren't you issuing a report about a vulnerability in
cmd.exe?

  No, that's not the worst of all.  Anyone who has physical access to your
computer can do ANYTHING they want to it.  " If a bad guy has unrestricted
physical access to your computer, it's not your computer anymore."

  Should it also prevent your bookmarks being changed, or your proxy
settings?  Should Windows not let you install software without a password?
Should everything on your computer be read-only?

  It's unfair to blame Firefox for this problem that is inherent to and 
generic across every single computer, operating system and application in 
the entire world, and trying to tackle just one particular instance of the 
problem in one particular feature of one particular browser is a) 
ineffective and b) missing the point.
