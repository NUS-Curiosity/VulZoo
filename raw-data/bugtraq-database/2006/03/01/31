Not on a multi-user system. For example, on this Linux workstation, I
can install extensions for myself, but other users can't use them
because they are installed into my ~/.mozilla/firefox/blah/extensions
directory. If they are installed by root, then everyone can use them
because they are installed into /opt/firefox/extensions. If you give
everyone full access to your workstation, you deserve the
consequences.
