Subject: Re: Evil side of Firefox extensions



This is definitely a good idea, although I don't think it should be a
compulsory feature (optional would be nice). If more people than just you
have access to a machine at the end of the day there's no way to guarantee
security. This is just another method of stealing information like a
keylogger would (although admittedly, more intelligent).
This isn't so much a bug as it would be user error (in my opinion), you
choose what extensions you want to install and if you're foolish enough to
install an extension from an untrusted source then you can expect horrible
things to happen.
