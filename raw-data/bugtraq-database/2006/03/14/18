Subject: RE: Re: recursive DNS servers DDoS as a

I had an off-list request for a packet capture or log entries of
examples.

Only the IP of our affected DNS server is sanitized.  But this should
put to rest questions about fragmentation, etc...

The DNS server providing the cached response is pretty typical of DNS
servers out there in the world.

There clearly is an attack amplification factor.  The exact magnitude
can be gleaned from the packet capture.
