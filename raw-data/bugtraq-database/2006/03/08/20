Sorry, I don't see this as amplification in your example, because YOUR 
dns servers are 100% of the traffic.  1:1 ratio.

Now, if you get the world to cache your text records, and have THEM 
flood with source-spoofed UDP (unrelated to the victim's DNS servers), 
that'd work, and is actually a good example of amplification.  There's 
plenty of open DNS servers out there that'll do this, but each one of 
them is going to hit your local dns server initially.

I have now sent two very small packets and you have received 200K of traffic. That's the amplification, one small udp packet, one large text record in return.
