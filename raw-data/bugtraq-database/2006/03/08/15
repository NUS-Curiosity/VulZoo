Subject: Re: recursive DNS servers DDoS as a growing DDoS
	problem

Are you sure about that amplification process??

Actually if the packet reaches huge sizes it will be fragmented at the
attacker's own place cuz of the network equipment's mtu... or won't be
transmitted at all...

The concept of the smurf attack is in sending large amount of spoofed
packets to the sub-network's broadcast address. Thus resulting in a enormous
amplified traffic back to the spoofed address, which happens to be the
victim.

In the scenario you describe, I cannot see any actual amplification... Just
fragmentation. Either I misunderstood your words, of which I apologise if
the case, or you've got something wrong there...

Anyway.. i do not question the DDoS attack on the recursive DNS servers, but
find it not so scary as some folks may say.

Take care and best wishes,
Ventsi
