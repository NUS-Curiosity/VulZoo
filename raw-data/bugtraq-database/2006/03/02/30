The Netgear WGT624 v3 is clean, however, some days ago i was searching
on how to put openwrt on this devices and they described that the serial
interface had that username and password, in other words, YES they have
that account but you have to solder pins on the motherboard of the
router and then establish a serial interface between the router and the
pc to get in, follow this link to find the entire info[1]

Hope this helps
