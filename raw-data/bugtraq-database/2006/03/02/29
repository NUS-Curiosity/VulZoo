requests and forums.

http://localhost/Nexus/forgotten_password.php

in this address If you fill the private email address
that you used while creating your account into the
form , the server will send you an email to that
address with your login details
Input passed to the "email" parameter in

before being used in a SQL query. This can be
exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
arbitrary SQL code.

already know about it.

if ($_POST["submit"]!=""){
	$con = db_connect();
	$sql = "SELECT cUsername,cPassword,cEMailPrivate FROM
nexus_users WHERE
cEMailPrivate='".$_POST["email"]."'";
$result = mysql_query($sql,$con);
	if ($result!=false){
		if (mysql_num_rows($result)>0){
			$row = mysql_fetch_array($result);
			$from = $site_admin_email;
			$to = $row["cEMailPrivate"];
			$subject = "Reminder Username/Password from
".$site_long_name."";
			$body = "This email has been sent following a
request for a reminder username/password in the
".$site_long_name." website.\n\n"
				."Your account details are as follows;\n"
				."  Username : ".$row["cUsername"]."\n"
				."  Password : ".$row["cPassword"]."\n\n"
				."If you did not request this reminder message,
