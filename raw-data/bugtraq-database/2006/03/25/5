How would you suggest that they release this?

I think that they did it in a pretty responsible way.  They where
notified of the problem, they fixed it and gave vendors who use/ship
the product some time to create and test patches, then it became public.
This was done in a month, any longer and I would think that they would be
putting us at risk, but I think that this is a very reasonable response.
0Day full-disclosure eith a 'sploit would have been more trouble for me
;-)  (I'm probably not alone with that).
