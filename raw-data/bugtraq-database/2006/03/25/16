Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem here (but I don't think so). It
seems to be the issue is not DNS -- recursive or not, but rather a failure
to adhere to BCP 38.

One may get easier/larger amplification from a recursive DNS server,
but the same problem exists for a non-recursive server. DNS, then, isn't
really where the problem needs to be fixed.
