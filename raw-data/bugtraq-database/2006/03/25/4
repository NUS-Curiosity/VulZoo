I see, so why don't you go work for commercial vendors? With that kind 
of security attitude I wonder why anybody believes OpenBSD is the most 
secure OS around.

Most arguments against open source in big organizations are that they 
have no backing, serious tech support, etc. That brought about a myriad 
of third-party companies which provide with this service.

I often find open source to be a lot more responsive than many 
commercial companies, but it's still done based on good will and free 
time. That doesn't scale well in the board room.

You better quit now as you are making a horrible attempt at protecting 
open source, which I strongly believe in.

If a commercial giant ***** up, or an open source product does, makes no 
difference to me.
When people say: you can't comment unless you go and do on your own, 
move along. People will move along.

Sometimes I will ignore input from non-contributors,. but ignoring 
input, especially of the critical type, from your users makes you not 
suitable for these users or to grow and scale as something for the 
infrastructure.
