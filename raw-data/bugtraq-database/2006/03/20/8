Software updates for the Apache-based Web Server are available
from:
http://h20293.www2.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/
displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE


HP-UX B.11.00, B.11.11 and HP-UX B.11.23 require the Apache-based

Apache Update Procedure

 Check for Apache Installation
 ----------------------------

To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on your
system, use Software Distributor's swlist command. All three
revisions of the product may co-exist on a single system.

For example, the results of the command

swlist -l product | grep -i apache

hpuxwsAPACHE B.2.0.54.00 HP-UX Apache-based Web Server

 Stop Apache
 -------------
Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary.
Otherwise, the previous binary will continue running, preventing
the new one from starting, although the installation would be
successful. After determining which Apache is installed, stop
Apache with the following commands:

for hpuxwsAPACHE: /opt/hpws/apache[32]/bin/apachectl stop

 Download and Install Apache
 -----------------------------
Download Apache from Software Depot:
http://h20293.www2.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/
displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE
Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the value
specified on the installation web page.

Use SD to swinstall the depot.
Installation of this new revision of HP Apache over an existing HP
Apache installation is supported, while installation over a non-HP
Apache is NOT supported.


 Removing Apache Installation
 ----------------------------
If you prefer to remove Apache from your system instead of
installing a newer revision to resolve the security problem, use
both Software Distributor's "swremove" command and also "rm -rf"
the home location as specified in the rc.config.d file "HOME"
variables.
 %ls /etc/rc.config.d | \
 grep apache hpapache2conf hpws_apache[32]conf

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - Update plus other actions
Install the revision of the product.
