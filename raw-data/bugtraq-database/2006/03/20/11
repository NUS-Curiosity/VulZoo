Nazca,

I think that may be something with your system.  I have checked with
FF 1.5.0.1 (both page rendering and viewing source) on WIn2000, XP SP2
(both on an IBM T40), XP Sp2 VmWare and Linux.  In none of those
environments did FF crash.

It could be related to a FF extension, perhaps?

Regards,
Phil
