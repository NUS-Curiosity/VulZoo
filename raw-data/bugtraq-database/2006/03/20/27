Upon close examination of the report, and after exhaustive testing, it's 
been determined that the cases in which this flaw can be exploited are 
limited to users sharing a NAT egress point, usually a home DSL or cable 
modem gateway. Session IDs that involve a combination of user supplied 
token (usually from a cookie) and a second factor that can't be easily 
forged (IP address) are susceptible to a slightly technical 'sneaker net' 
style attack, usually in concert with the common 'biobreak' attack, which 
leverages socially engineering against known user habits.

In many cases, the exploit becomes evident very quickly.

Users are encouraged to engage in the application of a Nerf Bat, or a more 
sophisticated LART, if needed, to correct the behavioral vector of this 
attack.
