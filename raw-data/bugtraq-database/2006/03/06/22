Synopsis
========

A stack-based buffer overflow in zoo may be exploited to execute
arbitrary code through malicious ZOO archives.

Background
==========

zoo is a file archiving utility for maintaining collections of files,
written by Rahul Dhesi.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/zoo      < 2.10-r1                            >= 2.10-r1

Description
===========

Jean-Sebastien Guay-Leroux discovered a boundary error in the
fullpath() function in misc.c when processing overly long file and
directory names in ZOO archives.

Impact
======

An attacker could craft a malicious ZOO archive and entice someone to
open it using zoo. This would trigger a stack-based buffer overflow and
potentially allow execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the
victim user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All zoo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/zoo-2.10-r1"
