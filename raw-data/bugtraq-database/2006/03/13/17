Subject: Re: Coppermine exploit used by a Chase Phish?


Coppermine is subjectable to multiple exploits, for the most part 
exploiters do not need to have much knowledge of it's working. There is 
a script called nst.php which is saved as a rar file and uploaded into 
the coppermine (unless coppermine is properly configured to now access 
anything bt image files) this nst.php script allows them to run a local 
acct on the system and browse through directories,upload new files even 
access sql u/p and the sql database. there is a good possablity this is 
what happened

some kid hacked the coppermine using a script simular to the "nst.php" 
uploaded it, got into the sever, and simply uplaoded the phish script. 
pretty easy to do actually, and a simple google search for 
"[subject],powered by coppermine" will give a extended list of possible 
targets for the exploiter to attack.
