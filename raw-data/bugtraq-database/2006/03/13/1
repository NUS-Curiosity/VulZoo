Synopsis
========

Cube is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, invalid memory access and
remote client crashes, possibly leading to a Denial of Service or
remote code execution.

Background
==========

Cube is an open source first person shooter game engine supporting
multiplayer via LAN or internet.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-fps/cube      <= 20050829                       Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma reported that Cube is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in
the sgetstr() function (CVE-2006-1100) and that the sgetstr() and
getint() functions fail to verify the length of the supplied argument,
possibly leading to the access of invalid memory regions
(CVE-2006-1101). Furthermore, he discovered that a client crashes when
asked to load specially crafted mapnames (CVE-2006-1102).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running cube. An attacker
could also exploit the other vulnerabilities to crash a Cube client or
server, resulting in a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

Play solo games or restrict your multiplayer games to trusted parties.

Resolution
==========

Upstream stated that there will be no fixed version of Cube, thus the
Gentoo Security Team decided to hardmask Cube for security reasons. All
Cube users are encouraged to uninstall Cube:

    # emerge --ask --unmerge games-fps/cube
