Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in zoo may be exploited to execute arbitrary when
creating archives of specially crafted directories and files.

Background
==========

zoo is a file archiving utility for maintaining collections of files,
written by Rahul Dhesi.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/zoo      < 2.10-r2                            >= 2.10-r2

Description
===========

zoo is vulnerable to a new buffer overflow due to insecure use of the
strcpy() function when trying to create an archive from certain
directories or filenames.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this issue by enticing a user to create a zoo
archive of specially crafted directories and filenames, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user
running zoo.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All zoo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/zoo-2.10-r2"
