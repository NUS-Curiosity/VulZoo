But many of us *love* to argue about taxonomies and word meanings (it's 
cheaper than booze anyway).  *8)

To my mind, if the attacker needs to be logged into an account on the 
machine being attacked then the vulnerability is local; if the attacker 
just has to be able to push bits to a port then it's remote.  If the 
attacker has to trick a legitimate user into doing something (including 
going to a particular remote site) then it's a Trojan horse.  Not hard and 
fast boundaries (what if the attacker has to first push some bits to a 
port and then fool a user into clicking on a link in some email and then 
log into a local account?), but to first order...

Calling an SQL injection a "Trojan horse vulnerability" sounds a little 
odd, I admit.  But until something better comes along?
