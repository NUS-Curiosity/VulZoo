Subject: Smurfable Linux Kernel


Hi list,

A couple of months ago I pointed out to the Linux Kernel networking 
maintainers an oversight which caused the kernel to be vulnerable to 
some form of smurf attack.

The problem lay in the kernel's inability to ignore icmp timestamp 
broadcast requests, thus IP networks with Linux boxes on board could 
lend themselves to possible DoS attacks.

The problem was fixed straight away and is now missing from the 2.6.13 
branch. Described misbehavior can now be controlled via 
icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts sysctl.
