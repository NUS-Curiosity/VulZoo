Subject: Fedora Legacy Server Outage

As we sent out today's security advisories, one of our servers
experienced an outage before completely syncing to the mirrors.

As a result, the updates repository contains missing packages.

This situation should be corrected shortly. I apologize for any problems
this may cause.

Marc.
