What is your point exactly? How secure are Verisign, Thawte or
anyone elses servers outside of them just stating "We take X
Precautions". Look at just about all of the top companies,
Microsoft, Sun, Yahoo, Citibank. They've all been hit at some point
because "X" wasn't secure. Right now I could register at
Comodogroup.com for a free signing cert for email. It means
nothing. Servers storing keys mean little since there is no
authority body to verify the validity of a security claim. So your
point is moot.
