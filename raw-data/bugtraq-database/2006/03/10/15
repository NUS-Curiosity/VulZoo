Subject: RE: Purple Paper: Exegesis Of Virtual Hosts Hacking


Hello,
A quick peer review of the paper. First it is too simplistic. 
 
You have not provided a detailed methidology nor any way of repeating/verifying the data.
 
You have defined no method of detailing where virtual hosts are on separate virtual machines, CHROOT environments, hardware cards, through accelerators etc.
 
"All these techniques are absolutely legal." Without detailing the techniques this can not be determined. Also accessing a host without permission even if they have not secured is still illegal (right or wrong)
 
Your conclusion may be one I agree with, but for the wrong reasons. The conclusion does not follow from the evidence in the paper.
 
Lastly the tools you have used included have a high level of false positives. No mention of this nor of any measures to reduce error have been mentioned.
 
Regards
Craig
