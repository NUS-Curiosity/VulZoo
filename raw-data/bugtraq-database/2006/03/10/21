Synopsis
========

GnuPG may erroneously report a modified or unsigned message has a valid
digital signature.

Background
==========

The GNU Privacy Guard, GnuPG, is a free replacement for the PGP suite
of cryptographic software that may be used without restriction, as it
does not rely on any patented algorithms. GnuPG can be used to
digitally sign messages, a method of ensuring the authenticity of a
message using public key cryptography.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/gnupg      < 1.4.2.2                         >= 1.4.2.2

Description
===========

OpenPGP is the standard that defines the format of digital signatures
supported by GnuPG. OpenPGP signatures consist of multiple sections, in
a strictly defined order. Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security
Audit Team discovered that certain illegal signature formats could
allow signed data to be modified without detection. GnuPG has
previously attempted to be lenient when processing malformed or legacy
signature formats, but this has now been found to be insecure.

Impact
======

A remote attacker may be able to construct or modify a digitally-signed
message, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication systems, or
impersonate another user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GnuPG users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/gnupg-1.4.2.2"
