Synopsis
========

CSTeTeX, pTeX, and teTeX include vulnerable XPdf code to handle PDF
files, making them vulnerable to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

teTex is a complete TeX distribution. It is used for creating and
manipulating LaTeX documents. CSTeX is a TeX distribution with Czech
and Slovak support. pTeX is and ASCII publishing TeX distribution.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/tetex       < 2.0.2-r8                       >= 2.0.2-r8

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     3 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.

Description
===========

CSTeX, teTex, and pTeX include XPdf code to handle PDF files. This XPdf
code is vulnerable to several heap overflows (GLSA 200512-08) as well
as several buffer and integer overflows discovered by Chris Evans
(CESA-2005-003).

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF file
with teTeX, pTeX or CSTeX, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the affected
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All teTex users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/tetex-2.0.2-r8"

All CSTeX users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/cstetex-2.0.2-r2"

All pTeX users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/ptex-3.1.5-r1"
