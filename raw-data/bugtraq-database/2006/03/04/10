Subject: AVG 7 granting Everyone Full Control to updated files... even its
 drivers


There is more here: http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,15601404

Basically, a first time install of AVG 7 will have default permissions. \Program Files\Grisoft\AVG Free has inherited permissions from \Program Files. This is preferred, because lower privileged accounts can't damage it.

Once any files are updated, the permissions are changed to "Everyone" with "Full Control" on the updated files, and will change the owner to whomever is logged in. Even limited users become owners. That does not stop at \Program Files\Grisoft\AVG Free, it will even do that to AVG's drivers in %windir%\system32\drivers.
