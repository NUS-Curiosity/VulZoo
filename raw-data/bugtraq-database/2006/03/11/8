About:
=====
A few days ago I discovered a little 'Local Privilege Escalation' Bug
in the current version of AntiVir PersonalEdition Classic.


Description:
=====
Part of AntiVir PersonalEdition Classic is a service called 'AntiVir
PersonalEdition Classic Planer' which runs with SYSTEM rights. If you
start the update process using the GUI, AntiVir will show you a status
window. After finishing the process AntiVir offers you a report. Open
the report using the button 'Report' and AntiVir will open the report
in the well known application 'notepad.exe'. Well, since the update was
initiated by the service 'AntiVir PersonalEdition Classic Planer',
which runs with SYSTEM rights, notepad.exe inherits these rights now.
Use 'notepad.exe' to *run* 'compmgmt.msc' for example and...
Well, you know what might happen now.
