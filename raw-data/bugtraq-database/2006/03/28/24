I don't quite understand the complaints about "obscure" patches;
intricate bugs require elaborate patches; it's not a one line
sprintf->snprintf change that is easy to understand.

Because of the way the bug was addressed, ripping out setjmp/longjmp,
a lot of change is needed which is not immediately obvious.

But such is the nature of complicated bug fixes; sometimes one also needs
to rewrite parts in a more natural way or code will become increasingly
"patchy" and less maintainable.
