I got lot of mails about topic, so I try to make FAQ here.

Q: Is it remote or local exploit?
A: Both. Works 100% for local and less for remote.

Q: Looking weird ascii WHERE?
A: in $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE and $_REQUEST. This should help in most cases.

Q: Why did you posted so few information?
A: More seems to be dangerous. I hope this case it is possible to fight 
problem before real 0day is coming out.

Q: Which exact PHP versions are affected?
A: I believe ALL of them. I am running 5.0.4 coming with SuSE 10 and all 
updates but I received reports for other distributions and PHP 4 and 5 both 
are vulnerable.

One more thing - many people mail me from public webmail accounts telling "I 
am the admin of big bank, can you tell details?". Sorry, I do not know if you 
are real or not.
