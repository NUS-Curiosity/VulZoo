CastleCops, a globally oriented security and privacy site, and Sunbelt 
Software, a leading provider of Windows security software, announced today 
a new anti-phishing task force designed to help consumers and businesses 
combat the unending scourge of phishing scams and online identity theft. 

The task force, called the Phishing Incident Reporting and Termination 
(PIRT) Squad, is a community at CastleCops solely dedicated to taking down 
phishing sites. The community consists of members who report new phishing 
scams as well as highly experienced security researchers ("handlers") that 
handle incoming reports of phishing websites and are responsible for 
performing immediate action to terminate the criminal activity.
