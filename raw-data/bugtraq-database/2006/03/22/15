[snip]

this advisory, along with the 2 other ones released this morning, are
still not visible on the project FTP server at noon US eastern. a "550:
Failed to change directory" error is encountered.

this same issue happened with the last batch, as well. there's a noticable
delay between posting to the website, mailing lists, and even the projects
security RSS feed and actually posting the advsiories to the FTP server to
be read.
