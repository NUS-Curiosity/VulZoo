Vulnerable Systems:
WinHKI 1.6 and Below

Detail :

The vulnerability is caused due to an input validation
error when extracting files compressed with RAR (.rar)
or TAR (.tar) or  ZIP (.zip) or TAR.GZ (tar.gz)
This makes it possible to have files extracted to
arbitrary locations outside the specified directory
using the "../" directory traversal sequence.


Solution:
resolved issue and fix will be available in next
release .

Do not extract untrusted  RAR and TAR and ZIP and
TAR.GZ files.
To reduce the risk, never extract files as an
administrative user.

harmless exploit:
use HEAP [Hamid Evil Archive Pack]
