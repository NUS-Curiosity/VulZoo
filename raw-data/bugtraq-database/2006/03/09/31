and edit all options.
Level: Critical

How&Example:
Security control in admin panel's index did not sanitized properly.
GET/EXAMPLE -> http://[victim]/[JBPSDir]/files/ wtih this example remote attack
bypasses security control,
but s/he will get some errors because ; s/he did not logged in system and doesnt
have admin cookies so lets add a new
admin account :)
GET/EXAMPLE -> http://[victim]/[JBPSDir]/files/addadmin.asp so with this example
remote attacker can make admin account
succesfully and when he logins via http://[victim]/[JBPSDir]/files/login.asp can
take whole system control.
