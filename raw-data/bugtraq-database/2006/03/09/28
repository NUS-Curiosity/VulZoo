Subject: Aluria/WhenU Troubled Past and Whitewashing History


I realize this may not be a bug report in the classic instance, but I do 
feel the community needs to be advised of what is going on with Aluria and 
their apparent WhenU delisting coverup.  We're all supposed to be in this 
security thing together, but the recent actions on Aluria's part leaves 
much to be desired.  Information and links are provided so you can 
determine for yourself what is really transpiring.  One thing is certain, 
this cannot be silenced.

The breaking news story on the whitewashing of Aluria certifying WhenU as 
spyware safe is here:

At the moment, a discussion with Aluria's Rick Carlson is ensuing here:

Some take away items that Eric Howes has highlighed (of the Rogue 
Application list fame) wrt to Rick Carlson from Aluria:
 
* your continuing misrepresentations of the historical handling of WhenU by Aluria 
* Aluria's removal of key documents related to the WhenU relationship from its web site 
* your own refusal to squarely confront Robin's responses to you 
* your astroturfing of Download.com

This last comment speaks to catching Rick giving a thumbs up to his 
product (Aluria's software) at download.com without ever disclosing he's 
the product's vendor.

However, the main discussion is continuing in the SWW thread above.
 
The point of this is to spread awareness of the issues surrounding 
Aluria/Earthlink at the moment, and their stupid decision to certify WhenU 
as spyware safe a couple years ago which caused a lot of press and bad 
publicity for Aluria.

America Online was partnered with Aluria at the time and made very clear 
they did not want any part of that Aluria/WhenU arrangement:

At the time Aluria delisted WhenU, 20 questions were put forth in which 
they (including Rick) responded:

Enjoy the reading.  Unfortunately, the SWW thread Rick seems to be dancing 
and skirting the foundational questions at hand wrt the WhenU history 
deletion.
