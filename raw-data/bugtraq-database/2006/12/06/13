Subject: Oracle PL/SQL Fuzzing Tool

Hi to all,

In the past I wrote a python tool to fuzz PL/SQL procedures, functions
and packages. With this wonderfull tool I found many vulnerabilities,
many crashes and many-many interesting issues.

I decided to release it to the public because it's a part of an Oracle
specific Vulnerability Assesment Tool I will release when it's
completely finished. It will be licensed under the GPL.

To use the attached python tool you will need a valid Oracle database
account with, at least, the CREATE SESSION privilege granted. You will
need to adapt it to your feets to fuzz a database under your control. At
least: username, password, Oracle SID and IP address.

It only fuzzes 'VARCHAR2', 'RAW', 'NCHAR', 'BINARY_INTEGER',
'BINARY_FLOAT', 'CHAR', 'NVARCHAR2', 'NUMBER', 'FLOAT' and 'LONG RAW'
datatypes, at the moment, but you can easily adapt it to fuzz other
Oracle datatypes, even user defined.

Well, if you find it interesting or if you have any question about, any
criticism, etc... Don't heasitate to contact me. Take fun.
