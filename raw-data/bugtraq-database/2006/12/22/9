Subject: SQID v0.2 - SQL Injection Digger.

SQL injection digger is a command line program that looks for SQL
injections and common errors in websites.Current version looks for SQL injections and common errors in website urls found by performing 
a google search.

The use of google search SOAP API has been removed due to no more issuing of keys. Now it directly performs search over the web.

Sqid can be downloaded from http://sqid.rubyforge.org.
