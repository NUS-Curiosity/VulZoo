    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-824

Description:
    Previous versions of the libpng package are vulnerable to a denial
    of service attack when an application that uses libpng attempts to
    decode certain malformed PNG files.
    
    4 December 2006 Update: previous versions of the doxygen package
    include internal copies of the libpng and zlib libraries, and the
    libpng library contained multiple vulnerabilities.  The doxygen
    package has been modified to use system shared libraries for
    libpng and zlib, resolving these vulnerabilities for doxygen.
