Subject: Multiple bugs in TFT-Gallery


Script Name: TFT-Gallery
Authors: Mike Scalora, Eric Thelin, Sascha Lorenz & Jan Berndt
Website: http://tftgallery.sourceforge.net
Bug Report: NetJackal (nj[AT]hackerz[DOT]ir & nima_501[AT]yahoo[DOT]com)
Status: Patch not released

First i should apologize for my bad english.

Intro:
	TFT-Gallery is a PHP-based Web image gallery & does n't require databse.
	
Bugs Description:
First bug)
	Look at admin`s index page(/admin/index.php)

	if(file_exists("passwd")) {
			$fd = fopen("passwd", "r");
			$givenpw = fgets($fd,15);
			fclose($fd);
			if(isset($_REQUEST['password']) and
				isset($_REQUEST['username']) and
					$_REQUEST['username']=='admin' and
						crypt($_REQUEST['password'], "tftgallery") == $givenpw) {
				$_SESSION['admin']=true;
			} else {
				include_once "login_form.inc";
				exit;
			}
		}

	TFT-Gallery stores admin's password in "passwd" file at admin folder, so everyone has access
to it by going to:
											http://victim/admin/passwd
TIP: Password hashed by DES algorithm.
TIP: Username is "admin".
Second Bug)
	TFT-Gallery doesn't check file extension so if somebody who has gain access by First bug can 
upload any file extension (ex. evil.php).

Solution:
	Edit code and store passwd some where else (out of wwwroot).
