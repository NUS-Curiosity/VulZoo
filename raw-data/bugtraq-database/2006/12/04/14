This update covers packages for the little endian MIPS architecture
missing in the original advisory.

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and
derived products such as Mozilla Firefox.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2006-4310

    Tomas Kempinsky discovered that malformed FTP server responses
    could lead to denial of service.

CVE-2006-5462

    Ulrich KÃ¼hn discovered that the correction for a cryptographic
    flaw in the handling of PKCS-1 certificates was incomplete, which
    allows the forgery of certificates.

CVE-2006-5463

    "shutdown" discovered that modification of JavaScript objects
    during execution could lead to the execution of arbitrary
    JavaScript bytecode.

CVE-2006-5464

    Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered several crashes in
    the layout engine, which might also allow execution of arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2006-5748

    Igor Bukanov and Jesse Ruderman discovered several crashes in the
    JavaScript engine, which might allow execution of arbitrary code.

This update also adresses several crashes, which could be triggered by
malicious websites and fixes a regression introduced in the previous
Mozilla update.


For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge13.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
the current iceweasel package 2.0+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mozilla-firefox package.
