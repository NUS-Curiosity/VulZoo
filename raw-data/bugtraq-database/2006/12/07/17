Subject: phpbb 2.0.x [xss]

vendor site:http://phpbb.com/
product:phpbb
bug:xss
risk:low

A xss post has been discovered in phpbb ,the impact of this attack is very low ,because it's more a bug , than a vulnerability .
An authentificated user can excute some html code in his private message box , by sending a message to an inexistant user .

here's a proof of concept about this xss :
- log in
- get in your private message box
- send a message to someone who doesn't exist with the following message :
</textarea>'"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
