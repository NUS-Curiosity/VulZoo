Subject: Linksys WIP 330 VoIP wireless phone crash from Nmap scan

Vulnerability Description
==================
The Linksys WIP 330 VoIP wireless phone will crash when a full
port-range Nmap scan is run against its IP address.


Linksys WIP 330 Firmware Version
==========================
1.00.06A


Nmap scan command
================
nmap -P0 <WIP 330 ip address> -p 1-65535


Impact
=====
The crash is only after Nmap has finished. The Nmap scan also seems to
disrupt updating of the display as the clock is not updated. The crash
appears related to PhoneCtl.exe running on the phone's Windows CE 4.2
operating system.
