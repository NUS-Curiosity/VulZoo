At this point in time, development has determined this is a very low priority and apparently it will be some time before the issue is addressed. I have reported this to our Security Review Board so development's claim can be re-examined. As such, you certainly have every right to publish your findings at this time. The bug will remain open against the product. &nbsp;Hopefully this can be fixed in the near future ==================================================
