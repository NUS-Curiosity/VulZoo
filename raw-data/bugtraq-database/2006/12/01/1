Synopsis
========

ProFTPD is affected by mutiple vulnerabilities allowing for the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ProFTPD is a highly-configurable FTP server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-ftp/proftpd      < 1.3.0a                           >= 1.3.0a

Description
===========

Evgeny Legerov discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the
s_replace() function in support.c, as well as a buffer overflow in in
the mod_tls module. Additionally, an off-by-two error related to the
CommandBufferSize configuration directive was reported.

Impact
======

An authenticated attacker could exploit the s_replace() vulnerability
by uploading a crafted .message file or sending specially crafted
commands to the server, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running ProFTPD. An
unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted data to the
server with mod_tls enabled which could result in the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running ProFTPD. Finally,
the off-by-two error related to the CommandBufferSize configuration
directive was fixed - exploitability of this error is disputed. Note
that the default configuration on Gentoo is to run ProFTPD as an
unprivileged user, and has mod_tls disabled.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ProFTPD users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/proftpd-1.3.0a"
