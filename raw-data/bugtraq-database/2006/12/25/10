Package        : squirrelmail
Vulnerability  : cross-site scripting
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2006-6142

Martijn Brinkers discovered cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the
the mailto parameter of webmail.php, the session and delete_draft
parameters of compose.php and through a shortcoming in the magicHTML
filter. An attacker could abuse these to execute malicious JavaScript in
the user's webmail session. 

Also, a workaround was made for Internet Explorer <= 5: IE will attempt
to guess the MIME type of attachments based on content, not the MIME 
header sent. Attachments could fake to be an 'harmless' JPEG, while they
were in fact HTML that Internet Explorer would render.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.4.4-10.

For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 2:1.4.9a-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.4.9a-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.
