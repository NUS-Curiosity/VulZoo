Package description:

  Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose of
  this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning).
  The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a
  command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet.
  The programs are based on a shared library distributed with package,
  which you can use with your own software. Most importantly, the virus
  database is kept up to date .

Problem description:
  clamav  < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Hendrik Weimer has reported a vulnerability in ClamAV,
    which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of
    Service). The vulnerability is caused due to a stack overflow when
    scanning messages with deeply nested multipart content. This can be
    exploited to crash the service by sending specially crafted emails
    to a vulnerable system.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-6481 to this issue.
