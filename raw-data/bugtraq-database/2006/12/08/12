Subject: Re: Internet Explorer 6 CSS "expression" Denial of Service Exploit (P.o.C.)

(waiting for the deluge of other lemmings who go:
"it works on blahblah with SPblahblah"
"confirmed on blahblah with blahblah language"
"blablah did not work for me blahblah"

can't you just find out the cause and not test EVERY version of IE
that you have? I mean, yeah, ok, so you tested it on IE7 yeah big
deal. he reports it on IE6.

you know why it is "putting iexplore.exe at 100% CPU"?

It's like when a truck crashes into a car and everyone goes out and
tests the truck against their own cars:
"Hey, the truck also totally destroyed my Ford Explorer!"
"Oh, it also totalled my Toyota!".
"Nope, it had no effect on my tank"

yeah i mean i COULD test it, but i'm too busy with... ehrm... cooking.
yes cooking.

cooking,

"i like my noodles boiled, not fried. well, sometimes fried"
