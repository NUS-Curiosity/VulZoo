Novell ZENworks Asset Management Collection Client Heap Overflow
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.01.06
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Dec 01, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Novell Inc's ZENworks is a set of tools used to automate IT management and
business processes across the various computing resources within an
organization.

The Collection Client provides functionality, as a service, that will
supply the Collection Server with information regarding the managed
machine's hardware and software configuration.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in Novell Inc.'s
ZENworks Asset Management could potentially allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on Windows or root on the various
supported UNIX based operating systems.

A heap overflow may occur when processing specially crafted packets sent
to the Collection Client daemon. The root cause of this vulnerability is
identical to that of the vulnerability in Msg.dll. For more information
please consult the Msg.dll advisory.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker
to take complete control of the affected system.

While researching this vulnerability, iDefense Labs found that the Task
Server and Collection Server components were also affected. It seems that
the Collection Client is statically linked with the Msg.dll library.
