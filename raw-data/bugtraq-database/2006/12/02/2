I. BACKGROUND

Novell Inc's ZENworks is a set of tools used to automate IT management and
business processes across the various computing resources within an
organization.

The Task Server and Collection server daemons provide functionality to
manage a distributed network of machines. These daemons will typically
only be running on the machine that is being used to manage assets.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in Novell Inc.'s
ZENworks Asset Management could potentially allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the administrator.

A heap overflow may occur when processing specially crafted packets sent
to the Task Server or Collection Server daemons.  This problem
specifically exists due to an integer overflow when allocating memory for
remotely supplied data.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker
to take complete control of the affected system.
