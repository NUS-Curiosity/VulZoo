I strongly doubt you found a bug in the software. Your report is missing 
crucial information.
  - Exact Check Point version (fw ver)?
 	(Did you apply the minimal required HFA on NG FP3?)
  - How did you configure this PAT exactly?

At this point this report is in fact pointless and more of FUD message.
