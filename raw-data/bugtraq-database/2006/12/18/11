Subject: Checkpoint NG3 ICMP Flood

Dear All,

I have one checkpoint NG3 in my company and verifying in Tracking i have tousands of events with ICMP type 8 and type 17.

The events has origin in my internal networks, with one problem .. the Source IP is my PAT address for internal hosts to internet. 

Is there any bug of Checkpoint? Anyone already seen this event?

I will go verify with sniffers and other tools, but this IP (Only for PAT) is no routeable in my internal networks...

Thanks for attention.
Poison
