Synopsis
========

imlib2 contains several vulnerabilities that could lead to the remote
execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

imlib2 is an advanced replacement for image manipulation libraries such
as libXpm. It is utilized by numerous programs, including gkrellm and
several window managers, to display images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/imlib2       < 1.3.0                          >= 1.3.0

Description
===========

M. Joonas Pihlaja discovered several buffer overflows in loader_argb.c,
loader_png.c, loader_lbm.c, loader_jpeg.c, loader_tiff.c, loader_tga.c,
loader_pnm.c and an out-of-bounds memory read access in loader_tga.c.

Impact
======

An attacker can entice a user to process a specially crafted JPG, ARGB,
PNG, LBM, PNM, TIFF, or TGA image with an "imlib2*" binary or another
application using the imlib2 libraries. Successful exploitation of the
buffer overflows causes the execution of arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All imlib2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/imlib2-1.3.0"
