-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw exists in the browser's handling of SVG comment
objects. Firefox does not correctly handle requests to append SVG
comments to elements in other types of documents. Attempting such an
operation results in a memory corruption that can be exploited to
execute arbitrary code.
