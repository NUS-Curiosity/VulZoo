Synopsis
========

The Ruby cgi.rb CGI library is vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack.

Background
==========

Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on
simplicity and productivity.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/ruby     < 1.8.5_p2                          >= 1.8.5_p2

Description
===========

The read_multipart function of the CGI library shipped with Ruby
(cgi.rb) does not properly check boundaries in MIME multipart content.
This is a different issue than GLSA 200611-12.

Impact
======

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending the cgi.rb library a
crafted HTTP request with multipart MIME encoding that contains a
malformed MIME boundary specifier. Successful exploitation of the
vulnerability causes the library to go into an infinite loop.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.5_p2"

References
==========
