Subject: MythControl (MythTV remote control) arbitrary code execution

Synopsis:  MythControl (MythTV remote control) arbitrary code execution
Product:   MythControl
Version:   <=1.0


Product:
=======

MythControl makes out of your Windows Mobile 5 Smartphone the 
best remote control ever for MythTV (or similar Media Center Products). 
It uses Bluetooth to communicate with your MythTV box and has a 
flexible, customizable user interface.
 
MythControlServer is a small server application for use with MythControl remote clients.
It uses the Bluez RFCOMM interface to listen for client connections and forwards the received
commands to either MythFrontend or shell. 


Issue:
======

A critical security vulnerability has been found in the product. It is
possible to execute arbitrary code.

Details:
========
In sendToMythTV the command that is to be sent might overflow
the sendStr string.


Affected Versions
=================

MythControl <= 1.0

Solution
=========

The sent command must be small enough to fit in the prepared 
buffer to send.


Exploitation
============

Exploitation might be conducted by using an overflowed command
variable value.




Kind regards,
