Dear ajannhwt@...mail.com,

First, array index overflow is usually very dangerous and is exploitable
to code execution in many cases.

Second, this one is not new. It was reported by Michal Zalewski in March
and is patched in current Internet Explorer versions:

Third,  your  'examle'  is  very like Michal's one except he doesn't use
'lcamtuf'.
