The local administrator can do whatever he wants, including just setting the
startup context of a service to run as LocalSystem.  Any "privileged
escalation" that requires you to already be an administrator is not an issue
at all, period. For the one-millionth-and-second time, any "issue" that
begins with "if you are a local administrator, then you can..."  is a
non-issue and a waste of everyone's time.

That is the skinny on that.
