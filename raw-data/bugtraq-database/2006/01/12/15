Hi:

I think it would be good if Microsoft releases patches a la opensource. But
I think since M$ does the whole thing is their decision after all to do it
one way or another. I understand that sometimes is a matter that customers
have no other choice than take things as they decide. The normal answer
would be fine don't use my systems and they would be right on the other side
you can't stop using their systems. Ahhh but then there are other ppl that
realized the whole trick and started to take action since 1995 and will let
you take action too ;). Take a look at this website [
http://www.reactos.com] and start to taste our freedom in an alpha
stage but close to beta. And
yes I hope to get an avalanche with this since I'm tired of huge downloads,
tons of closed information huge amounts of non documented stuff, licensisng
issues, limits on the number of connections no more RAW sockets and a tons
of more stuff that makes a big chain in my neck and tons of other more ppl.
Some of this chains were set up even before I was born. So I guess that I as
a number of more ppl really had no chances. I expect to break them some day
and surely not alone. In that case I could say that maybe I really was alive
and in this world.

Regards
Waldo
