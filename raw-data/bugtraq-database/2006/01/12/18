Summary
=======

A vulnerability exists in Cisco Aironet Wireless Access Points (AP)
running IOS which may allow a malicious user to send a crafted attack
via IP address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to the Access point which will
cause the device to stop passing traffic and/or drop user connections.

Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability will create a sustained DoS
(denial of service).

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. There are workarounds available to mitigate the
effects of the vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20060112-wireless.shtml .

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

This security advisory applies to all Cisco Aironet Wireless Access
Points that run Cisco IOS Software. The affected device types include:

  * Cisco Aironet 1400 Series Wireless Bridges
  * Cisco Aironet 1300 Series Access Points
  * Cisco Aironet 1240AG Series Access Points
  * Cisco Aironet 1230AG Series Access Points
  * Cisco Aironet 1200 Series Access Points
  * Cisco Aironet 1130AG Series Access Points
  * Cisco Aironet 1100 Series Access Points
  * Cisco Aironet 350 Series Access Points running IOS

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

  * Cisco Wireless devices running a VxWorks based image (Version 12.05
    and earlier)

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to dynamically map
physical hardware addresses to an IP address. Network devices and
workstations maintain internal tables in which these mappings are
stored for some period of time.

An attacker, who has successfully associated with a Cisco IOS Wireless
Access Point, may be able to spoof ARP messages to the management
interface on the Access Point. The attacker could add entries to the
ARP table on the device until physical memory has been completely
exhausted. This will leave the device in a state where it is unable to
pass traffic until the device has been reloaded by cycling the power.

After upgrading the Access Point (see Software Versions and Fixes), add
the command L2-FILTER BLOCK-ARP to each radio interface.

EXAMPLE:

    !
    !
    interface Dot11Radio0
     l2-filter block-arp
    !
    !



This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID
CSCsc16644. 

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a denial of
service (DoS) impacting the availability of the Wireless Access Point.
Management and packet forwarding services will be unavailable.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

This issue is fixed in IOS version 12.3-7-JA2 which is available for
download at http://www.cisco.com/kobayashi/sw-center/sw-wireless.shtml .

It is important to note that in addition to the software upgrade, a
configuration change is also necessary to resolve this vulnerability.
Please see the Details section for information on this configuration
change.

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete update solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

The workaround for this issue is to use Virtual LANs (VLANs) to isolate
wireless clients from the Access Point (AP) management interface. A
wireless VLAN infrastructure can be deployed that places AP management
interfaces in one VLAN and places wireless clients into different VLANs
based on SSID. No wireless clients should be allowed on the same VLAN
as the management interface of the AP. There are several design
considerations that must be accounted for when deploying VLANs on the
wireless network. For a discussion of the prerequisites, design
considerations, and wireless and wired hardware configuration examples
refer to:

Using VLANs with Cisco Aironet Wireless Equipment 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/wireless/ps4570/products_configuration_example09186a00801d0815.shtml

Additional information is available at:

Configuring VLANs 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/wireless/ps4570/products_configuration_guide_chapter09186a0080341d34.html

In this example an existing AP is reconfigured to use VLANs. The AP is
configured in VLAN 10 (the native VLAN) and wireless clients are
configured in VLANS 20 and 30.

Creating VLANs will disable existing SSIDs. So for this example, the
existing SSID was deleted, the VLANs were created, Encryption Mode and
Keys were then set for each VLAN, and SSIDs were created for each VLAN.

    !--------------------------
    ! Consider not configuring an SSID for the native VLAN
    ! which in this example is VLAN 10.  Not configuring an
    ! SSID for the native VLAN will prevent all wireless
    ! clients from estabishing management connections to

Wireless Network Security Best Practices
+---------------------------------------

In addition to the above workarounds and example, Cisco recommends
deploying Wireless network security best practices which are discussed
in the references below:

Mitigation
+---------

The risk of this issue can be mitigated by requiring all wireless
clients to authenticate with an EAP based authentication protocol such
as EAP-FAST, PEAP, or EAP-TLS. However authenticated users could still
exploit this vulnerability as the mitigation cannot completely
eliminate the vulnerability.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets they
have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or otherwise
using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by the terms
of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-license-agreement.html, or as otherwise
set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml .

Do not contact either "psirt@...co.com" or "security-alert@...co.com"
for software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
================================

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third-party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreement with third-party support organizations such as
Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for guidance and assistance with the
appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point of
sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free upgrades
for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml
