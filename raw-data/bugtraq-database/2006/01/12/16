  Yes he is.  He's polluting sanitized data with tainted data.  It's a 
fairly reasonable description if you ask me.

  NO!  You've /completely/ failed to understand the post.

  The underlying issue is not that the user-supplied data is trusted, 
because it isn't, it gets validated.  The _underlying_ issue is that the 
*same* location is used to store both trusted and non-trusted data, and 
there's no way for the application to know which kind of data was last 
stored in that location.

    cheers,
