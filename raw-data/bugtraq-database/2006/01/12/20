CanSecWest/core06 CALL FOR PAPERS 
--------------------------------

VANCOUVER, Canada -- The seventh annual CanSecWest
applied technical security conference - where the
eminent figures in the international security
industry will get together share best practices
and technology - will be held in downtown Vancouver
at the the Mariott Renaissance Harbourside on
April 3-7, 2006.  The most significant new discoveries
about computer network hack attacks and defenses,
commercial security solutions, and pragmatic real
world security experience will be presented in 
a series of informative tutorials.

The CanSecWest meeting provides international researchers
a relaxed, comfortable environment to learn from informative
tutorials on key developments in security technology, and
collaborate and socialize with their peers in one of the 
world's most scenic cities - a short drive away
from one of North America's top skiing areas.

In addition to the usual one hour tutorials, panel sessions
and highly entertaining 5 minute "lightning" talks, this 
conference will also feature a new session called 
"Elevator Focus Groups". Featuring several short 
sessions, these commercial presentations will showcase 
new, significantly used, or dramatically innovative 
new products in the information security realm.
Each selected vendor will have a short 10 minute 
presentation ("elevator pitch"), after which 10 minutes 
of audience Q&A and interactive discussion amongst 
the expert security practitioners attending will follow. 
In this session both the audience and the vendors can
get valuable feedback from world leading experts and
the attendees can get user evaluations and learn 
from sharing experiences and real world security 
applications about practical uses of the products - the 
"focus group." Hence the name: Elevator Focus Groups.

The CanSecWest conference will also feature the availability
of the Security Masters Dojo expert network security sensei
instructors, and their advanced, and intermediate, hands-on
training courses - featuring small class sizes and practical
application excercises to maximize information transfer.

We would like to announce the opportunity to submit papers, 
lightning talk proposals, and elevator focus candidate products 
for selection by the CanSecWest technical review committee.

Please make your paper proposal submissions before January 30th, 2006.
Slides for the papers must be submitted by March 15th, 2006. 

Some invited papers have been confirmed, but a limited 
number of speaking slots are still available. The conference is 
responsible for travel and accomodations for the speakers. If you 
have a proposal for a tutorial session then please email a 
synopsis of the material and your biography, papers and, 
speaking background to core06@...secwest.com. Only slides
will be needed for the March paper deadline, full text
does not have to be submitted - but will be accepted if
available.

The CanSecWest/core06 conference consists of tutorials on technical
details about current issues, innovative techniques and best 
practices in the information security realm. The audiences are a 
multi-national mix of professionals involved on a daily basis 
with security work: security product vendors, programmers, 
security officers, and network administrators. We give 
preference to technical details and new education for a 
technical audience.

The conference itself is a single track series of presentations
in a lecture theater environment.  The presentations offer
speakers the opportunity to showcase on-going research
and collaborate with peers while educating and highlighting
advancements in security products and techniques. 
The focus is on innovation, tutorials, and education
instead of product pitches. Some commercial content 
is tolerated, but it needs to be backed up by a technical 
presenter - either giving a valuable tutorial and best 
practices instruction or detailing significant new 
technology in the products. 

Paper proposals should consist of the following information:

1) Presenter, and geographical location (country of origin/passport)
   and contact info (e-mail, postal address, phone, fax).
2) Employer and/or affiliations.
3) Brief biography, list of publications and papers.
4) Any significant presentation and educational experience/background.
5) Topic synopsis, Proposed paper title, and a one paragraph description.
6) Reason why this material is innovative or significant or an 
    important tutorial.
7) Optionally, any samples of prepared material or outlines ready. 
8) Will you have full text available or only slides?
9) Please list any other publications or conferences where this
    material has been or will be published/submitted.

Please include the plain text version of this information in your email
as well as any file, pdf, sxw, ppt, or html attachments.

Please forward the above information to core06@...secwest.com to
be considered for placement on the speaker roster, have your lightning
talk scheduled, or submit your product for inclusion in the focus
groups.

Advance Registration is now available for CanSecWest
