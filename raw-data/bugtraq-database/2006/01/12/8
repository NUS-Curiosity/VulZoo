Hi Stelian, thanks for the reply.  The article addresses the Google XSS 
vulnerability by way of Securiteam.  The article is not focusing on the 
Google XSS itself per se, but rather that new phishing scams are 
exploiting this to snare unsuspecting PayPal users.

Unfortunately, these attacks are going further than that by concealing the 
true address location in the browser.  The article and video reveal all of 
this in the hopes that no one will fall prey.  Not to mention there are at 
least two real world scams using all of these techniques and glitches.

Yes there are other sites vulnerable to this kind of XSS, but none of them 
carry the same brand name.

The newest domain I'm seeing involved in this trickery on top of the first 
one from last night is: 210.110.166.167

These phishing scams need to be shut down, whether they use XSS or not.
