Subject: WMF SETABORTPROC exploit


Hi Moore et al (and All):
I was trying to understand the wmf setabortproc exploit code. I got 
confused over one point. In the code, under the point "StandardMetaRecord - 
Escape()", you have given the value of WORD function as 0x0026 and other 
possible values can be (according to the code) 0x0626, 0xff26 etc. And the 
value of the parameter is 9, which is call to SETABORTPROC. But, instead of 
finding these definitions in WINDOWS.H, as stated in the code, I found them 
in wingdi.h. Now my question is, from where I can get the other values of 
escape functions (like those stated by you)? In wingdi.h, i got only 
0x0626. Please any clue from anybody will be appreciated.

Regards
Sanjay
