Synopsis
========

pinentry is vulnerable to privilege escalation.

Background
==========

pinentry is a collection of simple PIN or passphrase entry dialogs
which utilize the Assuan protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/pinentry     < 0.7.2-r2                     >= 0.7.2-r2

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team has discovered
that the pinentry ebuild incorrectly sets the permissions of the
pinentry binaries upon installation, so that the sgid bit is set making
them execute with the privileges of group ID 0.

Impact
======

A user of pinentry could potentially read and overwrite files with a
group ID of 0.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All pinentry users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/pinentry-0.7.2-r2"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
