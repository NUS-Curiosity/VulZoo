Oh really? Do you have any more information on this or do you just like to
throw bricks? I have a hard time believing you're right, because it would
mean that there are variations of the attack that don't use its fundamental
mechanism.

All that said, it's clear to me that the rush to adopt this patch is
precipitous. For instance, it's largely unnecessary on Windows 9x, NT, and
2K, unless you rely on a specifically vulnerable app, like Notes.
