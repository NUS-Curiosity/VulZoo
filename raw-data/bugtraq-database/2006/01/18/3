Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 01.17.06: EMC Legato
 Networker nsrd.exe Heap Overflow Vulnerability


EMC Legato Networker nsrd.exe Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.17.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=373
January 17, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

EMC Legato NetWorker is a cross-platform backup and recovery
application.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in EMC Corp.'s
Legato Networker allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on Windows
platforms.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper handling of
malformed RPC requests to RPC program number 390109. When such a request
is sent by an attacker, it is possible to overwrite portions of heap
memory, thus leading to arbitrary code execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to gain access to a
targeted machine. As nsrd.exe is installed on backup client machines
and server machines, an attacker may rapidly compromise a network using
this vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in Networker 7.2 build 172.
All previous versions are suspected vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

"Complete resolutions to the vulnerabilities are available today in
NetWorker 7.1.4 and 7.3. EMC has created a hot-fix to protect against
vulnerabilities for 7.2.1 customers.  No fixes are planned for previous
NetWorker releases."
