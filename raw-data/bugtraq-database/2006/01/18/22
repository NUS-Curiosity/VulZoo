Subject: Re: Linksys VPN Router (BEFVP41) DoS Vulnerability


I still havent tested the device from the WAN-side.

The packet does not crash the router if it is addressed to the router.  To the crash the router (from the LAN-side, anyway), it must be addressed to an external (WAN-side) IP address.

example:  

router is 192.168.1.1
evil_pc is 192.168.1.101  (evil_pc is a PC attached to one of the ethernet ports on the router.)

evil_pc sends the magic packet to ANY external IP address, for example, www.google.com.  The router will then crash, and need to be rebooted.

magic packet:
