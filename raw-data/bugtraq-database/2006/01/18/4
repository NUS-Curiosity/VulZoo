Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 01.17.06: EMC Legato
 Networker nsrexecd.exe Heap Overflow Vulnerability


EMC Legato Networker nsrexecd.exe Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.17.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=374
January 17, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

EMC Legato NetWorker is a cross-platform backup and recovery
application.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in EMC Corp.'s
Legato Networker allows attackers to execute arbitary code on windows
platforms.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper handling of
malformed RPC requests to RPC program number 390113. When such a request
is sent by an attacker, it is possible to overwrite portions of heap
memory, thus leading to arbitrary code execution by way of a function
pointer overwrite. If an attacker can populate memory so that his data
is in a predictable location, arbitrary code execution is possible. It
is possible to populate memory in several ways, including by utilizing
memory leaks.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to gain access to a
targetted machine. As nsrd.exe is installed on backup client machines
as well as server machines, an attacker may rapidly compromise a
network using this vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in Networker 7.2 build 172.
All previous versions are suspected vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

"Complete resolutions to the vulnerabilities are available today in
NetWorker 7.1.4 and 7.3.  EMC has created a hot-fix to protect against
vulnerabilities for 7.2.1 customers.  No fixes are planned for previous
NetWorker releases."
