Why do you call a .scr you have to manually install a "worm"? Why not
"BlackVirus"

the worm moniker is very misleading (actually got me worried for a
sec). The "email worm" is also misleading, because it only propagates
through port 25, but that is not the point of entry. The point of
entry is the user running a visual basic script _willingly_.

Just so I know, what would you guys classify a real worm (blaster,
slammer, nimda, etc) as? Or would you just call it an "internet worm"
instead of an "email worm" and leave it at that?

thanks for the mis-info,
