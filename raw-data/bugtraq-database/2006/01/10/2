Service: Web

Vendor: AOL.com

Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting / Cookie-Theft / Relogin attacks

Severity: Medium/High

Tested on: Microsoft IE 6.0 and FireFox 5.1

Details:

AOL.com search engines are created with AOLserver Dynamic Pages (or ADP).
ADP are a set of web server extensions for designing dynamically created
documents. Utilizing AOLserver, ADP return a document to the user based on
running a set of Tcl code with arguments provided by the user. They are
based on Microsoft's own Active Server Pages. AIM.com ADP scripts are
prone to cross-site scripting attacks. This problem is due to a failure in
the applications to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Impact:

an attacker can exploit the vulnerable scripts to have arbitrary script
code executed in the browser of an authentified AIM user in the context of
the AIM webpage. resulting in the theft of cookie-based authentication
giving the attacker temporary access to the victim's account (email box,
etc) as well as other type of attacks.
