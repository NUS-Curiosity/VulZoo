Hi folks,

I have recently conducted an independent research on the current,
and future trends on the malware scene. Basically, my publication
answers, what are the driving forces behind the rise of malware?
Whoï¿½s behind it, and what tactics do they use? How are vendors
responding, and what should organizations, researchers, and end
users keep in mind for the upcoming future?

Its purpose is to assist in more constructive discussions on the
topic, and speculate on the future. Feedback is greatly
appreciated.
