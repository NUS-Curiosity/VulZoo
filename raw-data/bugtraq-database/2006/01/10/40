Synopsis
========

xine-lib and FFmpeg are vulnerable to a buffer overflow that may be
exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

xine is a GPL high-performance, portable and reusable multimedia
playback engine. xine-lib is xine's core engine. FFmpeg is a very fast
video and audio converter and is used in xine-lib.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /      Vulnerable      /          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xine-lib         < 1.1.1-r3                >= 1.1.1-r3
  2  media-video/ffmpeg       < 0.4.9_p20051216     >= 0.4.9_p20051216
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.

Description
===========

Simon Kilvington has reported a vulnerability in FFmpeg libavcodec. The
flaw is due to a buffer overflow error in the
"avcodec_default_get_buffer()" function. This function doesn't properly
handle specially crafted PNG files as a result of a heap overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to run an FFmpeg based
application on a maliciously crafted PNG file, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.1-r3"

All FFmpeg users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/ffmpeg-0.4.9_p20051216"
