*** SUMMARY ***

Hummingbird Collaboration is a Web-based collaborative groupware for 
teams across and beyond the enterprise.
It integrates different works on single projects accessed by several 
concurrent users, improving efficiency, organization and automated workflow.

Regular and registered users can easily access to all project information,
documents, discussion threads, tasks list through the Web.

It includes several utilities like messaging system, project and
file manager and a Web calendar.

(a) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), (b) improper file handling and (c) information disclosure
vulnerabilities are present and can be exploited remotely.

*** VULNERABILITY DETAILS ***

(a) Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

A second-order XSS have been found. It allows permanent scripting by uploading
malicious client side scripts by embedding them in a HTML page.
Hummingbird Collaboration does not verify the content of HTML files during the
uploading process. 
In addition, the collaborative groupware does not force the HTML to be downloaded
(e.g. forcing the "Content-Disposition" property): As a result, the HTML page
and embedded scripts are normally interpreted and rendered by the user browser.
An attacker could (1) plan session hijacking attacks, (2) prepare phishing
(a regular user could be tricked by presenting him/her with a fake login page)
and (3) affect the usability and the availability of the service.

(b) Improper file handling

Using a crafted URL, a user could force the download of a previously uploaded 
file changing its original name.
By exploiting this vulnerability, a regular user can be tricked about
file content and filename of what he/she's downloading.

(c) Information disclosure

By inspecting some application responses it is possible to get more information
about the parameters type and format. Instead of displaying generic error 
messages, detailed information are sent to the client (e.g. the parameter must be TRUE or FALSE).
Moreover, by inspecting the application cookies is it possible to get internal 
network information about the IP address of the application server.

*** EXPLOIT ***

(a) An attacker can simply upload an HTML file with embedded malicious 
scripts (e.g. Javascript) using the file manager utility.

(b) An attacker would need to trick the user into downloading a certain
file with a crafted URL, like the following one: 
https://mySite/hc/hc/fake.doc?d=fc&o=dwnd&fid=1189762&did=89777&x=16080&doc_ext=.txt
In this example, the file with id equal to 1189762 is downloaded, 
changing the name and the type of txt file in "fake.doc".
 
Other techniques (e.g. XSS) make it easy to create a fake link 
similar to the previous one.

(c) In most cases it just involves the inspection of server responses.
The following URL shows an example of improper error handling
https://mySite/hc/hc?d=mes&x=20433&ntb=[numericParam] 
using [numericParam] instead of a string parameter.
The internal IP address is "encoded" into the cookie name
(e.g. com.peopledoc.rhum.JURA_SESSION_ID_192.168.1.1_0.71221182=972323;).

*** FIX INFORMATION ***

The vendor suggests that updating the software solves this
vulnerability, however we have not been able to test the latest 
versions and to confirm this.

Future versions will also integrate a scan engine to detect malicious Javascript.

*** WORKAROUNDS ***

It should be noted that the server may only be accessed by users 
who have accounts and who have been correctly authenticated. 
Users may be restricted to be read-only so that they cannot upload files.
