Subject: Call For Paper - SyScan'06 Singapore


*CALL FOR PAPER

ABOUT SYSCAN’06*
The Symposium on Security for Asia Network aims to be a very different 
security conference from the rest of the security conferences that the 
information security community in Asia has come to be so familiar and 
frustrated with. SyScan’06 intends to be a non-product, non-vendor 
biased security conference. It is the aspiration of SyScan’06 to 
congregate, in Singapore, the best security experts in their various 
fields, to share their research, discovery and experience with all 
security enthusiasts in Asia.

The speakers that will be at SyScan’06 are among the best, and 
brightest. These experienced security professionals at the vanguard of 
leading information security technology have assembled unique new 
material that they will present at this conference to help you maintain 
your technological leadership and stay abreast of the latest 
developments in this rapidly moving technological field.

This two-day symposium will be held in a relaxed and informal 
atmosphere, allowing all participants to enjoy themselves whilst 
expanding their knowledge on information security.

SyScan’06 will be held in Singapore in the month of July, 2006.
