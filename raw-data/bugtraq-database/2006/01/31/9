Subject: BrowserCRM vulnerable for XSS


Inputs in the BrowserCRM is not properly sanitized, and XSS is possible in a lot of the systems input fields and url parameters.

Some fields have been filtered in a basic form, so that simple scripting like "<script>alert('XSS')</script>" is not possible. Howevere, since the filtering is not based on white listing you can conduct successful XSS attacks with code like "<IMG SRC=javascript:alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))>".

PoC: http://www.SITE.example/modules/Search/results.php?query=%3CIMG+SRC%3Djavascript%3Aalert%28String.fromCharCode%2888%2C83%2C83%29%29%3E
