Synopsis
========

Trac is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack that could allow
arbitrary JavaScript code execution.

Background
==========

Trac is a minimalistic web-based project management, wiki and bug
tracking system including a Subversion interface.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/trac       < 0.9.3                              >= 0.9.3

Description
===========

Christophe Truc discovered that Trac fails to properly sanitize input
passed in the URL.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this to inject and execute malicious
script code or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials,
potentially compromising the victim's browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Trac users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/trac-0.9.3"

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.
