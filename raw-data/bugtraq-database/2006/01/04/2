	Manager [Suspected]


I can repro this on Windows XP Pro with IE7. However, it does not appear to
be exploitable. Internet explorer terminates after attempting to execute the
following statement:

034ED914   8C82 60770100    MOV WORD PTR DS:[EDX+17760],ES
EDX=0

So it's a null pointer bug.

Crash dump would be nice too.

I have seen this once before but had issues replicating it with other
display drivers.
