KDE Security Advisory: kjs encodeuri/decodeuri heap overflow vulnerability
Original Release Date: 2006-01-19
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20060119-1.txt

        CVE-2006-0019


1. Systems affected:

        KDE 3.2.0 up to including KDE 3.5.0


2. Overview:

        Maksim Orlovich discovered an incorrect bounds check in kjs,
        the JavaScript interpreter engine used by Konqueror and other
        parts of KDE, that allows a heap based buffer overflow
        when decoding specially crafted UTF-8 encoded URI sequences.


3. Impact:

        Remotely supplied Javascript code can perform a heap overflow
        and crash the web browser or execute arbitrary code.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
