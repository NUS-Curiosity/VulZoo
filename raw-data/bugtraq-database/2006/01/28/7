 "
A worm is similar to a virus by its design, and is considered to be a sub-class of a virus. Worms
spread from computer to computer, but unlike a virus, it has the ability to travel without any
help from a person. A worm takes advantage of file or information transport features on your
system, which allows it to travel unaided.
"

BlackWorm has a LAN infection vector.

No action on the part of the user of the 
box on the LAN must happen for them to "get got",
thus this is a worm.
