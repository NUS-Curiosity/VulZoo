mysec.org Security Advisory : Xmame buffer overflow, with a 
possibility of privilege escalation 

Xmame buffer overflow, with a possibility of privilege escalation 

mysec.org Security Advisory 11 Jan 2006
http://www.mysec.org

I. BACKGROUND

Xmame and xmess are ports of MAME, the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator 
and MESS, the Multi Emulator Super System. They run primarily on Linux 
and various flavors of UNIX, although some other operating systems, 
such as BeOS, are supported to some degree.

II. DESCRIPTION

Several functions in src/fileio.c and src/unix/fileio.c did not handle 
large input propely. These can cause buffer overflow.

Most of the distros install xmame  with suid root. There is a possibility 
for a local user to gain root privilege.

Exploitation requires an attacker to send a specially
constructed input for these few arguments.

-lang
-ctrlr
-pb
-rec

For Ubuntu default installation, which is version 0.86 there is a
option which infaceted.

-jdev


III. POC

POC for -pb and -rec options , 
other options will be base on these info.
