Subject: BlackWorm: statistics and numbers


The guys over at LURHQ (Joe Stewart) produced some amazing statistics 
from the logs provided to the TISF BlackWorm task force by the more 
whitehat than whitehat RCN (.com/.net) ISP with the cooperation of the FBI.

By country, de-duping, removing DDoS and other counter-poisoning 
attempts as best as can be done, etc.:
