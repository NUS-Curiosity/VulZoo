Subject: Re: [security] What A Click! [Internet Explorer]


HTA runs applications from HTML documents. Like I mentioned, never broke 
anything in my experience. And yes, I sometimes develop stuff on this old 
windows box, including webstuff. HTA is a MS invention,  Firefox has 
followed. But the main thing HTA has been, and IMHO will remain, is a 
security flaw.

A lengthy quote <quote> HTAs are Windows applications that can access and 
use ActiveX components, COM objects, the Windows Scripting Host and 
scripting languages, to form easy to develop and maintain, yet powerful 
solutions for business and personal tasks. The simplest of all HTA 
applications can be created and executed by making a blank text file on your 
desktop and giving it an ".hta" extension then clicking its icon. Although 
the main window of an HTA is technically Internet Explorer, the window that 
appears has no default menu, toolbar or status bar. These "child windows" 
however can be created for your HTA by using DHTML and scripting so that 
your HTA looks like a normal Windows application. You can even create a 
library of HTCs, or Hypertext Components, to act in place of the Windows 
Common Control Library."</quote> See, ideal for popups and tons of yet to be 
discovered nasty things. Never had an active scripting host, and that had 
also never had an adverse effect.

'Everything web' includes worms, spyware and the like. Dunno, I prefer my 
web a bit cleaner. Sandboxing is possible, just like anything web, by 
running the browser in a citrix or terminal server box. They, being windows, 
based might be compromised as well, so maybe a better idea is to run a java 
based browser in a JVM and have it over with, use something like JREX or 
Opera.  If corporate, you might prefer server side java.. Run the JVM on a 
tomcat or websphere on nix or even use the old big iron, open a sandboxed 
browser in a normal browser.....  et voila, a sandboxed browser. Some say 
Tarantella might do the trick neatly, have not looked into that yet.
