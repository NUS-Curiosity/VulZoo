Subject: Re: [security] What A Click! [Internet Explorer]


There is an easy trick to avoid a .HTA related 'thingie' such as this one: 
tell your windows to open .HTA files in notepad.  It broke the beautifull 
PoC I guess, had it in place as long as this particular machine (2 years or 
so), it never broke anything before.

Second hint for people protecting lusers: design a nice corporate colors 
standard theme and disable the standard theme. Exit this kind of attack 
(since there are more ways to cover windows with malicious lookalikes).

regards,

yossarian

> Using custom Microsoft Agent characters it is possible to cover any kind

> The PoC is designed for Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP SP2 in Windows

> Microsoft Agent character which fakes a button (basicly a large white

> underlying dialog through the button space. Transparent areas in 
> characters are really "not there", meaning you can click through them.

> When you click that button you execute arbitraty code in the hta file, in 
> this case you create the folder "c:\booom!". The button in the upper left 
> corner is only need to get around the "drive by download" protection of 
> Windows. When this protection is not in place (e.g. on Windows 2000) this 
> PoC could be reduced to a single click interaction to execute arbitrary 
> code.

> __Status
>
> The bug got fixed as part of the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-032 
> (yeah, last summer).
>
> The patch adds an additional security dialog before loading a custom agent 
> character. Be aware that in trusted zones that dialog might not raise.
