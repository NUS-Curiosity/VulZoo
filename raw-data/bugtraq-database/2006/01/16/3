Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0002

Package names:	   clamav, cups, fetchmail, mod_auth_pgsql, sudo 
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-01-13
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  clamav
  Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose of this
  software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning).
  The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon,
  a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet.
  The programs are based on a shared library distributed with package,
  which you can use with your own software.

  cups
  The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for
  UNIX(R) operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software Products
  to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors and users.
  CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

  fetchmail
  Fetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended
  for use over on-demand TCP/IP links, like SLIP or PPP connections.
  Fetchmail supports every remote-mail protocol currently in use on the
  Internet (POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, all IMAPs, ESMTP ETRN, IPv6,
  and IPSEC) for retrieval. Then Fetchmail forwards the mail through
  SMTP so you can read it through your favorite mail client.
  
  mod_auth_pgsql
  The mod_auth_pgsql module consists an authorization handler that uses
  an PostgreSQL server as the basis for authorizations.

  sudo
  Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain
  users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands
  as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo operates on a
  per-command basis.  It is not a replacement for the shell.  Features
  include: the ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a
  per-host basis, copious logging of each command (providing a clear
  audit trail of who did what), a configurable timeout of the sudo
  command, and the ability to use the same configuration file (sudoers)
  on many different machines.

Problem description:
  clamav < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Fixes possible heap based buffer overflow in libclamav/upx.c.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-0162 to this issue.

  cups < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Chris Evans has reported some vulnerabilities in xpdf,
    which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS.
  - Integer overflow error exists in "Stream.cc:StreamPredictor::StreamPredictor()"
    and "Stream.cc::CCITTFaxStream::CCITTFaxStream()" when calculating buffer
    sizes for memory allocation. This can potentially be exploited to
    overflow the allocated heap memory.
  - An infinite loop error exists in "Stream.cc::DCTStream::readMarker()"
    when handling certain malformed input files. This can potentially be
    exploited to cause a DoS.
  - Missing validation of input parameters in
    "Stream.cc:DCTStream::readHuffmanTables()" and
    "Stream.cc:DCTStream::readScanInfo()" can cause out-of-bounds memory access.
    This can potentially be exploited to overwrite certain memory.
  - Some potential integer overflow error exists in "JBIG2Stream.cc".

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2005-3624, CVE-2005-3625, CVE-2005-3626 and CVE-2005-3627
    to these issues.

  fetchmail < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in Fetchmail caused due
    to a null pointer dereferencing error when handling a message without
    email headers. This can be exploited to crash Fetchmail when the
    upstream mail server sends a message without headers.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2005-4348 to this issue.

  mod_auth_pgsql < TSL 3.0 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: iDEFENSE has reported a format string flaw in
    mod_auth_pgsql. This could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to
    execute arbitrary code as the httpd process.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2005-3656 to this issue.
  
  sudo < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY FIX: A vulnerability has been reported in Sudo caused due to
    an error within the environment cleaning. This can be exploited by a
    user with sudo access to a perl script to load and execute arbitrary
    library files via the "PERLLIB", "PERL5LIB" and the "PERL5OPT"
    environment variables.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2005-4158 to this issue.
