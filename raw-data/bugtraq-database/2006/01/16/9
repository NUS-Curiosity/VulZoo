Subject: Virata-EmWeb DSL modems

Greetings,

    A couple of days ago updating my blog for the beauty of non secure dsl 
modems in the .gr domain, i notice that beauty is extented beyond that 
domain. Dsl implementations running on Virata-EmWeb interfaces seems to 
disclose login information and more ( 
http://cheeky.globalnetworks.gr/~krasn/web-dsl-cli.txt ) allowing attackers 
easy bruteforcing methods.

Modems currently found, jetpseed 500 series, jetspeed 520 series from 
Intracom http://www.intracom.gr/ and CopperJet 810 RouterPlus from Allied 
Data Technologies http://www.allieddata.com/ .

More details @ http://blog.globalnetworks.gr/
