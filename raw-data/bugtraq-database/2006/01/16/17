Apache Geronimo 1.0 - CSS and persistent HTML-Injection vulnerabilities
========================================================================

Product:
========

Apache Geronimo is the J2EE server project of the Apache Software Foundation.

Version:
========

Apache Geronimo 1.0, Jetty 5.1.9 

Vulnerabilities
===============

The first one is a classical cross-site scripting in the
jsp-examples:

http://10.10.10.10:8080/jsp-examples/cal/cal2.jsp?time="/><script>alert('Gotcha')</script>

The second one is a persistant html-/script-Injection vulnerability
which is a little more critical than the first one:

The Web-Access-Log viewer does no filtering for html-/script-tags, and
therefore allows attacks against the user of the admin-console.

For example the request:

http://10.10.10.10:8080/script-that-dont-has-to-exist.jsp?foobar="/><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

is stored without sanitizing inside the logfile and the script part is
executed, if the geronimo-admin is accessing the web-access-log-viewer.
An example attack can steal the current session-id of the admin, which
is stored as a cookie.

Vendor:
