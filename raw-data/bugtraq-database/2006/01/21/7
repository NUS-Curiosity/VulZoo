That is the most comprehensive answer you would ever need.

IMO, GRC deserves respect for trying to do good, as well as raising 
awareness. Other than that he usually is:
1. Ill informed.
2. Informed of things that happened 3 years ago.
3. Does "disinformation campaigns" on us whenever he is wrong, which is 
often (quote taken from him).
4. LOVES TO TALK TO THE MEDIA.

In other words, he is often wrong -- bases little on fact, and does it 
in the media.
