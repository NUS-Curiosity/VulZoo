That XSS attack was solved some time ago. This is simply using the well
known google.com/url?q=http://YOURURLHERE trick.
I wouldn't call this a security vulnerability, and google is certainly
not the only one affected. It's rather a social engineering scam: the
users clicks on a google link and does not expect to end up someplace
else...
A possible "solution" would be to deny redirection for http requests
with a refereer outside google.xxx (however, links from the email client
would not generate any refereer). Or maybe pause for a few seconds and
display a warning "you are leaving google...".
