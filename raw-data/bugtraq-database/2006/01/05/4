Subject: Dumb IE6/XP denial of service found on the web


Wow, a simple big jpeg completely crashes (and reboots) Windows XP SP2 with all the latest patches when viewed in IE6.

-> DON'T GO with Internet Explorer if you don't want to crash: http://www.geocities.com/teh_kids/index.html (no problems whatsoever in Firefox or Opera).

Is this a known unpatched vulnerability?
