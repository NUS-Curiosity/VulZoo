Subject: WMF Exploit Patch Released


Microsoft has released a patch for the WMF exploit a couple of days
early, apparently due to a faster-than-expected testing process, and,
at least I hope, some consumer pressure.  It can be downloaded via
Windows Update, or as a standalone install at:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-001.mspx

As a note, it appears that all of the attempts to circumvent the
problem via disabling SHIMGVW.DLL were irrelevant, and that those who
discovered that GDI32.DLL and WGDI32.DLL were the culprits were
correct.

Happy crawling.
