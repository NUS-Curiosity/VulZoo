Title: Microsoft Security Response Center Bulletin Notification
Issued: January 05, 2006
********************************************************************

Summary
=======
Important Information for Thursday 5 January 2006

Microsoft announced that it would release a security update to help 
protect customers from exploitations of a vulnerability in the 
Windows Meta File (WMF) area of code in the Windows operating system 
on Tuesday, January 2, 2006, in response to malicious and criminal 
attacks on computer users that were discovered last week.
  
Microsoft will release the update today on Thursday, January 5, 2006,
earlier than planned. 

Microsoft originally planned to release the update on Tuesday, 
January 10, 2006 as part of its regular monthly release of security 
bulletins, once testing for quality and application compatibility 
was complete.  However, testing has been completed earlier than 
anticipated and the update is ready for release.
 
In addition, Microsoft is releasing the update early in response to 
strong customer sentiment that the release should be made available 
as soon as possible. 

Microsoft's monitoring of attack data continues to indicate that the 
attacks are limited and are being mitigated both by Microsoft's 
efforts to shut down malicious Web sites and with up-to-date 
signatures form anti-virus companies.
 
The security update will be available at 2:00 pm PT as MS06-001. 

Enterprise customers who are using Windows Server Update Services 
will receive the update automatically.  In additional the update is 
supported Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 2.0, Systems 
Management Server, and Software Update Services.  Enterprise 
customers can also manually download the update from the Download 
Center.

Microsoft will hold a special Web cast on Friday, January 6, 2006, 
to provide technical details on the MS06-001 and to answer questions.
Registration details will be available at 
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/default.mspx. 

Microsoft will also be releasing additional security updates on 
Tuesday, January 10, 2006 as part of its regularly scheduled release 
of security updates.

What is this alert?

As part of the monthly security bulletin release cycle, Microsoft 
provides advance notification to our customers on the number of new 
security updates being released, the products affected, the 
aggregate maximum severity and information about detection tools 
relevant to the update. This is intended to help our customers plan 
for the deployment of these security updates more effectively.

In addition, to help customers prioritize monthly security updates 
with any non-security updates released on Microsoft Update, Windows 
Update, Windows Server Update Services and Software Update Services 
on the same day as the monthly security bulletins, we also provide:

.	Information about the release of updated versions of the 
Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool.
.	Information about the release of NON-SECURITY, High Priority 
updates on Microsoft Update (MU), Windows Update (WU), Windows 
Server Update Services (WSUS) and Software Update Services (SUS). 
Note that this information will pertain ONLY to updates on Windows 
Update and only about High Priority, non-security updates being 
released on the same day as security updates. Information will NOT 
be provided about Non-security updates released on other days.

On 10 January 2006 Microsoft is planning to release:

highest Maximum Severity rating for these is Critical. These updates 
may require a restart. These updates will be detectable using the 
Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA).

Microsoft Office. The highest Maximum Severity rating for these is 
Critical. These updates may require a restart. These updates will be

Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool on Windows Update, 
Microsoft Update, Windows Server Update Services and the Download

change until released.
