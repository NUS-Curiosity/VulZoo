 File:  	 MSN-Password-Recovery.exe
Status: 	
MIGHT BE INFECTED/MALWARE (Sandbox emulation took a long time and/or
runtime packers were found, this is suspicious. Normally programs
aren't packed and don't force the sandbox into lengthy emulation. Do
realize no scanner issued any warning, the file can very well be
harmless. Caution is advised, however.) (Note: this file has been
scanned before. Therefore, this file's scan results will not be stored
in the database)

Packers detected:  UPX

The link on that site to the Skype recovery tool domain leads to a completely
unrelated ad for a website building software package
