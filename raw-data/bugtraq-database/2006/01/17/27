Inge Henriksen (inge.henriksen@...leansoft.com) http://ingehenriksen.blogspot.com/

Vendor Status: 
Notified 30. December 2005, no fix at present.

Arbitrary Code Injection:
This is a null pointer dereference, so no arbitrary code injection is likely. Thanks to H D Moore from Metasploit for help on this issue.

Overview:
I have found that Microsoft(R) Internet Explorer 5 and Microsoft(R) Internet Explorer 6 are vulnerable 
to a Denial of Service. So far all combinations of OS's and IE versions I have tested are vulnerable. 
The exploit is triggered by a bad IMG element combined with a bad XML block, this html code can by hidden 
inside a webpage etc. to cause a Denial of Service for all that tries to view that webpage.
