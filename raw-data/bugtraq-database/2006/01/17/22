Subject: Announcement: The Web Application Firewall Evaluation Criteria v1 Released


The Web Application Firewall Evaluation Criteria project is proud
to announce v1.0 of The Web Application Firewall Evaluation Criteria
(WAFEC), its first official release.

WAFEC is a result of a collaboration between web application
firewall vendors and independent security professionals to create a
comprehensive, vendor-neutral, web application firewall evaluation
criteria. The resulting framework can be used to evaluate and
and compare web application firewalls.

WAFEC v1.0 can be downloaded from the project home page:

  http://www.webappsec.org/projects/wafec/


Participation in WAFEC is open to the interested parties. To comment
on the work done so far or join the effort contact Ivan Ristic, the
WAFEC project leader.
