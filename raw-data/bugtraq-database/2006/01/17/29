Subject: Reverse Engineering WMF Exploit Code


Websense has done a lot of work on WMF since first alerting about it 
publically (yep, that was them), and in fact, along with many others, 
helped with alerting us to many malicious sites hosting bad WMF files so 
that they can be taken down.

Their latest blog entry is:

As we have reported, there are still thousands of websites hosting WMF 
exploit code.Since we have been analyzing several of these, we thought 
we would share some stepsin researching the behavior of the what the 
exploit code is doing.

This video displays malicious WMF Files debugging. It shows how you can 
easily locate and debug the embedded shell code of WMF files, to find 
out what it was supposed to do.
