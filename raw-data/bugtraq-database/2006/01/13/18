Subject: Re: industry standards - current status [was:  what we REALLY learned from WMF]

I track this list to keep abreast of new bugs so I can try to take pro-active 
steps with the systems I run. In this case I've been ignoring this thread 
until now... About what I've seen of the five points in discussion here - 
certainly. It does seem to be flame-bait.

Now onto the content...

Agreed. MS is a company that has the resources and should be able to deal with 
critical patches in this manner a great deal of the time. The same goes for 
all other major software companies, as well - in concurrence with your note 
below.

False positives should be handled in a quiet manner by vendors, IMHO. If they 
do otherwise it causes a drop in quality of information available. Not that 
this is a feasable solution re: most software companies. In a number of 
cases, as demonstrated by events at MS during the developement cycle of 
Windows 95, there is a large amount of legacy code that isn't clearly 
documented or isn't documented at all. For applications that are recent and 
not prey to the ravages of poorly understood legacy code it can work.

Ah, I see. Makes my previous statement a bit pointless, other than the truth 
about my belief that software companies should actively work to eliminate 
those false positives to increase the quality of information available to the 
community.

Agreed. Critical security patches should have a shortened development and 
testing cycle so they can reach the end-users as fast as possible. Although, 
in light of my (somewhat limited) knowledge of corporate practices and 
policies this might take work to get any number of the larger companies to 
understand.

I do agree. See above section.

In conclusion all I can say is that you addressed the seeming inconsistencies 
noted in a clear manner and I happen to agree with it all. If the software 
industry can change it's paradigms for inherent security - trying to make the 
products harder to exploit from the design phase on - and change it's 
handling of extremely critical security patches (Like MS did about the recent 
WMF vuln) then the work of I[DP]S (to borrow your shorthand) professionals 
will be made that much easier.

However I am not going to even dream that the industry will change in this 
manner. That is something that I don't see happening unless the community and 
various governmental agencies (in the US and other nations) begin to place 
_serious_ and _continued_ pressure on the industry to change in that manner. 
Since a large number of people across the globe would have to agree for that 
to happen I cannot consider it a real possibility. 

Although, I must say, if MS does for future critical security patches what it 
did for the WMF patch, the rest of the industry may follow MicroSoft. Though 
I like to bash MS as much as the next Linux user, they do have a huge segment 
of the market for Operating Systems and business software. A large enough 
segment that a change they make does have a chance of spreading through the 
rest of the industry.
