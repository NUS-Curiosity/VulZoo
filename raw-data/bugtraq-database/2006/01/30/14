Subject: Winamp 5.12 - 0day exploit - code execution through playlist


The current version of winamp contains an error in its playlist parsing allowing malicious users to
execute code via a prepared playlist.

This bug can even be triggered through a website - without user interaction - by linking to a pls
file in an IFRAME tag.

Windows DEP (Data Execution Prevention) will stop this bug. If you dont have DEP its strongly
advised to delete Winamp until a non vulnerable version is released.
