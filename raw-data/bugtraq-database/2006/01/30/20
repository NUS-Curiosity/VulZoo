Subject: XSS flaw in MG2 Image Gallery (v.0.5.1)


Users can inject XSS into the form field "Name", when adding a comment on a picture. This will lead to the execution of XSS code.

Simple scripting like <script>alert('hello')</script> , and more advanced document.location, and document.cookie works.

This has been tested on version 0.5.1. Other versions might be flawed too.
