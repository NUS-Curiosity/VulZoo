  Then your report should have been titled "Maybe DAP can be tricked to
download malicious file, maybe not, I haven't got any idea because I haven't
bothered to find out".

  Or even better, you shouldn't have bothered posting it because it has zero
content.  "There might or might not be a vulnerability in application X" is
NOT information.  Uninformed speculation is NOT information.

  What you actually observed was DAP not being tricked and not downloading a 
malicious file.  What you wrote was the exact opposite.  Your report is 
fraudulent and utterly dishonest.
