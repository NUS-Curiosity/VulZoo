A question for people who find such exploitable bugs and report them
upstream. 

How many days does it take for upstream to patch and release bugfix?
It would be nice if you could include the severity of the bug as well.
(Vendor and product names, product versions would be nice as well).
Quite a few of us generally get to know only when the fix is released.
