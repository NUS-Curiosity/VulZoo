RESOLUTION

 ->For HP-UX B.11.11

 ->HP has provided the following patch to resolve the issue for
 ->B.11.11:

 ->B.11.11 - PHSS_34102

 ->The patch can be downloaded from http://itrc.hp.com

 ->For HP-UX B.11.00 and B.11.23

Until patches are provided to resolve the issue avoid using the
potentially vulnerable versions of /usr/bin/X11/xterm. The
following are three methods to replace the potentially vulnerable
xterm.

1. One solution is to remove the patches listed in the Background
section (above).  The patches listed are the only patches
containing the potentially vulnerable xterm.

2. An alternative to removing the patches is to use
/usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm.
For example:

cp /usr/bin/X11/xterm /usr/bin/X11/xterm.nosuid
chmod 555 /usr/bin/X11/xterm.nosuid
cp /usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm /usr/bin/X11/xterm


3. Preliminary xterm Binary Files

Preliminary xterm binary files are available to resolve the issue.
These binary files are X11R6 replacements for the potentially
vulnerable versions of xterm, and they contain the same defect
fixes.  Customers who do not require the latest xterm may prefer
to remove the patches listed above instead. Manual action is
required to install the preliminary binary xterm files.

To install the preliminary xterm download README.txt and the
appropriate xterm file via ftp from hprc.external.hp.com
(192.170.19.100).  The ftp account is 'xterm', and the password
is 'xterm'.

Browser ftp access:
ftp://xterm:xterm@...c.external.hp.com/
ftp://xterm:xterm@....170.19.100/

README.txt contains instructions for installing the preliminary
files.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
- ->For HP-UX B.11.00 and B.11.23
Remove the patches listed in the Background section,
use /usr/contrib/bin/X11R5/xterm,
or install the preliminary xterm files.
