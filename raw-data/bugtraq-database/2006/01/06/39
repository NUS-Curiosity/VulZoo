Way to go, Gadi.  Nicely put. 

The opensource guys almost always have different repositories for preview 
and testing.  Ubuntu currently has Dapper available for download and the 
repositories are available, even though it's not due for release until 
April.  Debian has multiple levels of testing platforms, depending on how 
insane you happen to be.  On the consumer end, many customers will also 
maintain two repositories.  One for production, the other to test what 
they're about to push out. 

While Microsoft doesn't open their code to the world early, they could 
selectively involve key customers which are willing to have a couple of 
their PC's run with a different update site.  A 
"test.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" if you will (or the SUS equivalent).

Why should the OSS people have all the fun!?  ;)
Or rather, why should the pay-for customers get the shaft when the free 
stuff is doing it "More Right".
