Subject: Re: what we REALLY learned from WMF


Don't release a beta patch ....

1. it would get patches into reverse engineering faster [hello look what 
happened to the leaked patch]

and 2.

Don't ask for an untested patch if you are not willing to be there in 
the newsgroups, communities and listserves helping the dead bodies after 
a bad patch sir.

Do you do/handle change management in your firm?  Even in my small firm 
I could not handle the 'any time/any day' that patches used to come out 
before.

Be careful of what you ask for sir...because if you get what you 
want.... ensure your firm has the resources to test/deploy/change 
management on a 24 hours a day 7 days a week schedule because exploits 
can be built in less than 20 minutes.

If the security issue has been responsible disclosed, there is a process 
that is needed to build a patch and test the patch.  Some issues take 
more than 'days' sir.  And testing takes time as well, sir.

For my community I want tested patches sir, and I will argue until 
doomsday on that point.  Don't hurt my community with a bad patch or a 
beta patch, sir.
