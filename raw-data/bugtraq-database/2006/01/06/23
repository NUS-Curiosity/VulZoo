With all the misinformation and theorizing going around, I figured the
community might be interested in some... you know, accurate information.
It's really refreshing, sometimes.

So, SecuriTeam blogs has posted an interview with Ilfak Guilfanov
(author of the interim fix for the WMF vulnerability) about all things
WMF.  We covered in detail, three main topics:

    * The nature of the vulnerability
    * The details of Ilfak's interim fix
    * The other workarounds that are available

The URL for that blog post is:

A big thanks is in order to Ilfak for taking the time to do the interview.
