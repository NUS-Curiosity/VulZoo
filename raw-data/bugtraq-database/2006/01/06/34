Had MS issued that patch immediately it seems to me that you would have criticised them for putting out a "half-assed" patch. Had they issued their actual patch untested and it broke a couple of percent of their user base's installs you probably would have castigated them for being irresponsible and not testing the patch.

I am not criticizing Microsoft over the patch. I am happy.

I am just saying that we as an industry got used to False Positives, 
slow responses, etc. We should demand more and this situation proved it 
is possible.
