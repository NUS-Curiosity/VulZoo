Status and Recommendation: 
Customers with vulnerable versions of the iGateway component 
should upgrade to the current version of iGateway (4.0.051230 or 
later), which is available for download from the following 
locations:
http://supportconnect.ca.com/
ftp://ftp.ca.com/pub/iTech/downloads/


Determining the version of iGateway:
To determine the version numbers of the iGateway components:

Go to the igateway directory:

On windows, this is %IGW_LOC%
Default path for v3.*: C:\Program Files\CA\igateway
Default path for v4.*: 
C:\Program Files\CA\SharedComponents\iTechnology

On unix, 
Default path for v3.*: 	/opt/CA/igateway
Default path for v4.*: 	the install directory path is contained in 
opt/CA/SharedComponents/iTechnology.location.
The default path is /opt/CA/SharedComponents/iTechnology

Look at the <Version> element in igateway.conf.

The versions are affected by this vulnerability if you see 
a value LESS THAN the following: 
<Version>4.0.051230</Version>  (note the format of v.s.YYMMDD)
