Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in LibAST may result in execution of arbitrary code
with escalated privileges.

Background
==========

LibAST is a utility library that was originally intended to accompany
Eterm, but may be used by various other applications.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/libast        < 0.7                               >= 0.7

Description
===========

Michael Jennings discovered an exploitable buffer overflow in the
configuration engine of LibAST.

Impact
======

The vulnerability can be exploited to gain escalated privileges if the
application using LibAST is setuid/setgid and passes a specifically
crafted filename to LibAST's configuration engine.

Workaround
==========

Identify all applications linking against LibAST and verify they are
not setuid/setgid.

Resolution
==========

All users should upgrade to the latest version and run revdep-rebuild:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose >=x11-libs/libast-0.7
    # revdep-rebuild
