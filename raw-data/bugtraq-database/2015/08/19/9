Some spammer (Asher995@...il.com?) wrote to bugtraq:

This made it to their web archive:

What is happening: did they "stuff up" their spam filter,
is the moderator losing focus?

Lately there are also some "empty" messages e.g.:

http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/536230
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/536231
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/536247
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/536249
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/536257
Is that issue related?

Cheers, Paul
