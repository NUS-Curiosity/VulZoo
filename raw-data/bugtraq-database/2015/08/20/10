Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Ubiquiti Network
Product: Ubnt Store - Web Application (Online-Service) 2015 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Cisco Newsroom online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions data by client-side manipulated cross site requests.

The vulnerability is located in the `bridgename` value of the store.ubnt.com/skin/adminhtml/default/default/media/ service module. The injection point 
of the issue is the vulnerable uploader.swf file. Remote attackers are able to inject own script codes to the vulnerable GET method request of the 
uploader.swf module.  The attack vector of the vulnerability is located on the client-side of the ubnt store web-application. The request method to 
inject the script code to the client-side is `GET`. The execution of the script code occurs in the same swf files context.

The security risk of the non-persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 2.8.
Exploitation of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability requires low user interaction (click) and no privileged application user account. 
Successful exploitation results in client-side account theft by hijacking, client-side phishing, client-side external redirects and non-persistent manipulation 
of affected or connected service modules.

Request Method(s):
						[+] GET

Vulnerable Service(s):
						[+] Ubnt Store - (store.ubnt.com/skin/adminhtml/default/default/media/)

Vulnerable Module(s):
						[+] uploader.swf

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] bridgeName


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote cross site vulnerability in the swf file can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account and with low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

PoC: Example
string attack uploader.swf?bridgeName=1``]));}catch(s){alert('hadjisamir')}//

PoC: Payload
https://store.ubnt.com/skin/adminhtml/default/default/media/uploader.swf?bridgeName=1``]));}catch(s){alert('hadjisamir')}//Hadji Samir

Reference(s):

http://store.ubnt.com/skin/adminhtml/default/default/media/uploader.swf?


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Encode the bridgeName value in the uploaded swf files to prevent client-side script code injection attacks or cross site scripting.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting web vulnerabilities in the swf file is estimated as medium. (CVSS 2.8)
