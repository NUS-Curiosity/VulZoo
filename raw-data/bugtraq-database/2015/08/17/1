Subject: Re: Windows Platform Binary Table (WPBT) - BIOS PE backdoor

Hi - just with regards to this, the CERT advisory is for a slightly
different issue.  The software Lenovo were delivering in this case has
known security issues (including updating purely over http)..

But it just goes to show, bundling software into the BIOS/UEFI
firmware can go wrong, pretty much as soon as the issue is
highlighted.
