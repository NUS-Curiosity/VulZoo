Subject: Re: Windows Platform Binary Table (WPBT) - BIOS PE backdoor

Hi Dimirti,

The specification says it is supported (and slightly expanded) in
Windows 10, and I can confirm through testing the method still works
on Windows 10 - I was successfully able to extract files from a
Windows BitLockered drive.

More so, that Microsoft does not provide a good measure to control WPBT: in the official doc there's some watered down paragraph about "good security measures", but there's no way to enforce binary signing, or CA-like validation of the signature. One thing is not clear is whether Windows 10 is vulnerable to the same functionality, and whether the malicious actors can write to WPBT directly, or, like the case with Lenovo, have to hijack "trusted" OEM apps that are allowed to do so.
