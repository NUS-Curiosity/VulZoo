the admin-installed extensions would be installed for every user
you can restrict yourself doing so by just only use packed extensions

frankly, a lot of people hate my security-first attitude but in case of 
browser extensions i just don't want run to every machine for every 
extension update and hand out the admin-password is a no-go

well, depending on the extension (noscript) as example there are very 
often updates - you are in danger to train users to always and 
everywhere anter their root-password or skip updates which may be 
security relevant

Mozilla is solving most of the issues by just only install signed 
extensions - let's wait how many people switch to the developer version 
without that restriction because 1 or 2 of their favorite extensions are 
only available directly from the developer
