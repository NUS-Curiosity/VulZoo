 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:198

 Package : java-1.8.0-openjdk
 Date    : April 9, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in
 java-1.8.0-openjdk:
 
 Multiple flaws were found in the way the Hotspot component in OpenJDK
 verified bytecode from the class files, and in the way this component
 generated code for bytecode. An untrusted Java application or applet
 could possibly use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions
 (CVE-2014-6601, CVE-2015-0437).
 
 Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the
 JAX-WS, Libraries, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java
 application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox
 restrictions (CVE-2015-0412, CVE-2014-6549, CVE-2015-0408).
 
 A flaw was found in the way the Hotspot garbage collector handled
 phantom references. An untrusted Java application or applet could
 use this flaw to corrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and,
 possibly, execute arbitrary code, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions
 (CVE-2015-0395).
 
 A flaw was found in the way the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules)
 decoder in the Security component in OpenJDK handled negative length
 values. A specially crafted, DER-encoded input could cause a Java
 application to enter an infinite loop when decoded (CVE-2015-0410).
 
 A flaw was found in the way the SSL 3.0 protocol handled padding bytes
 when decrypting messages that were encrypted using block ciphers in
 cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. This flaw could possibly allow a
 man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to decrypt portions of the cipher
 text using a padding oracle attack (CVE-2014-3566).
 
 Note: This update disables SSL 3.0 by default to address this
 issue. The jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property can be used
 to re-enable SSL 3.0 support if needed. For additional information,
 refer to the Red Hat Bugzilla bug linked to in the References section.
 
 It was discovered that the SSL/TLS implementation in the JSSE component
 in OpenJDK failed to properly check whether the ChangeCipherSpec was
 received during the SSL/TLS connection handshake. An MITM attacker
 could possibly use this flaw to force a connection to be established
 without encryption being enabled (CVE-2014-6593).
 
 An information leak flaw was found in the Swing component in
 OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw
 to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2015-0407).
 
 A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MulticastSocket
 implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. An untrusted
 Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass
 certain Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2014-6587).
 
 Multiple boundary check flaws were found in the font parsing code
 in the 2D component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could
 allow an untrusted Java application or applet to disclose portions
 of the Java Virtual Machine memory (CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6591).
 
 Multiple insecure temporary file use issues were found in the way the
 Hotspot component in OpenJDK created performance statistics and error
 log files. A local attacker could possibly make a victim using OpenJDK
 overwrite arbitrary files using a symlink attack (CVE-2015-0383).
 
 The updated packages provides a solution for these security issues.
