Package        : inspircd
Debian Bug     : 780880

adam@...pe.org discovered several problems in inspircd, an IRC daemon:

  - an incomplete patch for CVE-2012-1836 failed to adequately resolve
    the problem where maliciously crafted DNS requests could lead to
    remote code execution through a heap-based buffer overflow.

  - the incorrect processing of specific DNS packets could trigger an
    infinite loop, thus resulting in a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.5-1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.0.16-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your inspircd packages.
