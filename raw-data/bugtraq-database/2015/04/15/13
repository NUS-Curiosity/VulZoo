Conference Background
=====================
IT security is an integral aspect in operating IT systems today. Yet, as
even high-end precautionary measures cannot prevent every attack or
security mishap, the capabilitiy to quickly respond to IT security
incidents, to secure infrastructure operations and data, as well as
forensic capabilities in investigating  such  incidents  in both
technical and legal aspects are paramount. Capable incident response and
forensic procedures have thus gained essential relevance in IT
infrastructure operations and in law-enforcement, and there is ample
need for research and standardization in this area.  Since 2003, the IMF
conference has established itself as one of the premier European venues
for presenting research on IT security incident response and management
and IT forensics. The conference provides a platform for experts from
throughout the world to present and discuss recent technical and
methodical advances in the field. It shall enable collaboration and
exchange of ideas between industry (both as users and solution
providers), academia, law-enforcement and other government bodies.


Conference Goals
================
IMF's intent is to gather experts from throughout the world in order to
present and discuss recent technical and methodical advances in the
fields of IT security incident response and management and IT forensics.
The conference provides a platform for collaboration and exchange of
ideas between industry, academia, law-enforcement and other government
bodies.


Conference Topics
=================
The scope of IMF 2015 is broad and includes the areas of IT forensics
and IT security incident response.  This year's widened focus includes
special sessions on malware analysis and malware forensics, digitized
forensics using the example of crime scene trace forensics, and teaching
IT forensics.
