~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Panda Internet Security 2015 is an endpoint protection software with
many features defending users against different threats.

The vendor Panda Security describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Panda Internet Security 2015 is designed to ensure you can enjoy your
online life with complete peace of mind. It provides maximum antivirus
and online fraud protection for your PC, the firewall and wi-fi
protection."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The endpoint protection software Panda Internet Security 2015 offers
a password protection in order to restrict access to the management
console. With an enabled password protection, changing settings or
deactivating the protection features requires the set password.

By analyzing the password-based authentication of the implemented
password protection, the SySS GmbH found out, that the password
comparison is done within the process PSUAMain.exe (actually within the
used module PSUNConsole.dll), which runs in the context of the current
Windows user, who can also be a standard, limited user.

This fact allows a further analysis and the manipulation of the password
comparison during runtime without administrative privileges, as every 
user is able to debug and manipulate the processes running with her user
privileges.

In order to bypass the password-based authentication, for example to
deactivate the protection of Panda Internet Security 2015 in an
unauthorized manner, an attacker only has to patch this password
comparison, so that it always returns true, for example by comparing
the correct unload password with itself or by modifying the program
control flow.

The SySS GmbH also found out, that the actual set password for the
password protection can be extracted as cleartext during runtime from
the process PSUAMain.exe.

Thus, a limited Windows user or malware running in the context of such a
user is able to deactivate Panda Internet Security 2015 in an
unauthorized manner and furthermore to extract the actual password as
cleartext.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH developed a proof-of-concept software tool named
UnloadPanda for deactivating the Panda protection in an unauthorized
manner.

The following output exemplarily shows a successful bypass of the
password-based authentication and of the cleartext password extraction:

>UnloadPanda.exe
