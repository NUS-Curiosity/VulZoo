Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA Software

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20150408-asa

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2015 April 8 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities:

    Cisco ASA Failover Command Injection Vulnerability
    Cisco ASA DNS Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability
    Cisco ASA VPN XML Parser Denial of Service Vulnerability

Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Failover Command Injection Vulnerability would allow an attacker to submit failover commands to the failover units,  which may result in an attacker taking full control of the systems.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA DNS Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability may result in system instability and dropped traffic.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA VPN XML Parser Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in a crash of the WebVPN process, which may lead to the reset of all SSL VPN connections, system instability, and a reload of the affected system.


Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available for the Cisco ASA Failover Command Injection Vulnerability and Cisco ASA DNS Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:
