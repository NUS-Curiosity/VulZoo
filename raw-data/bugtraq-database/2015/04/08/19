         CVE Name       CVE-2015-3008                                         

   Description When Asterisk registers to a SIP TLS device and and verifies the 
               server, Asterisk will accept signed certificates that match a    
               common name other than the one Asterisk is expecting if the      
               signed certificate has a common name containing a null byte      
               after the portion of the common name that Asterisk expected. For 
               example, if Asterisk is trying to register to www.domain.com,    
               Asterisk will accept certificates of the form                    
               www.domain.com\x00www.someotherdomain.com - for more information 
               on this exploit, see                                             
               https://fotisl.com/blog/2009/10/the-null-certificate-prefix-bug/ 

    Resolution  Asterisk has been patched to verify that the common name      
                length of the certificate matches the common name that        
                Asterisk actually reads. Asterisk will not accept             
                certificates with common names that contain null bytes.
