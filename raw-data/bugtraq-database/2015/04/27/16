 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:208
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : setup
 Date    : April 27, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated setup package fixes security vulnerability:
 
 An issue has been identified in Mandriva Business Server 2&#039;s setup
 package where the /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow files containing
 password hashes were created with incorrect permissions, making them
 world-readable (mga#14516).
 
 This update fixes this issue by enforcing that those files are owned
 by the root user and shadow group, and are only readable by those
 two entities.
 
 Note that this issue only affected new Mandriva Business Server
 2 installations.  Systems that were updated from previous Mandriva
 versions were not affected.
 
 This update was already issued as MDVSA-2015:184, but the latter was
 withdrawn as it generated .rpmnew files for critical configuration
 files, and rpmdrake might propose the user to use those basically empty
 files, thus leading to loss of passwords or partition table. This new
 update ensures that such .rpmnew files are not kept after the update.
