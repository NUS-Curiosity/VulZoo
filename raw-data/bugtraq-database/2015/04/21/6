Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Magento is an open source e-commerce web application that was launched on March 31, 2008 under the name Bento. It was developed 
by Varien (now Magento, a division of eBay) with help from the programmers within the open source community but is now owned 
solely by eBay Inc. Magento was built using parts of the Zend Framework. It uses the entity-attribute-value (EAV) database model 
to store data. In November 2013, W3Techs estimated that Magento was used by 0.9% of all websites.

Our team of security professionals works hard to keep Magento customer information secure. What`s equally important to protecting

inside our system, please tell us right away.

Exploitation Technique:

Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Ebay Xcom online-service content management system.
The issue allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable module or affected web-service.

The persistent input validation web vulnerability is located in the `item description` value of the `preview` module. The affected context is 
requested through the vulnerable eBayISAPI.dll file. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject script codes by usage of the vulnerable 
editor spell checker to execute the persistent script codes in the valid preview page link of the item description. The attack vector of the 
vulnerability is persistent (application-side) and the request method to inject is POST. The valid preview link can be exchanged with an exisiting 
users session because of no secure implemented cookie restriction. 

To bypass the validation of the editor it is required to use the spell checker code execution in the lithium forum discovered in 2012 by me to paypal.
After the inject of the script code the replace, parses the context the frame gets injected. Regular the preview disallow an user to preview with item 
descriptions with persistent injected script code. To proof we injected a regular frame and used the editor to replace regular texts with script codes 
in the description. After the unsuccessful proof we tried the same and splitted the tag to bypass the validation successfully.

The security risk of the application-side validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.1. 
Exploitation of the persistent input validation vulnerability requires a low privileged ebay magento application user account and low user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirect and persistent manipulation 
of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s): (Inject)
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Editor > Spell Check

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] item description

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Item Preview - Description Context


Proof of Concept (PoC):
