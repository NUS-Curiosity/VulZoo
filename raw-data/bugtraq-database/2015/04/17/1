## Advisory Information

Title: 112 ipTIME Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls models vulnerable
with RCE with root privileges
Advisory URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/2015-iptime-0x00.txt.asc
Date published: 2015-04-17
Vendors contacted: KrCERT, ipTIME
Release mode: Released
CVE: no current CVE



## Product Description

EFMNetworks ipTIME is the largest Korean brand of SOHO/small/middle
entreprise Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls in South Korea
with millions of devices deployed in the country. EFMNetworks ipTIME
is occupying more than 60 percent of personal network devices.
There are =~ 10 000 000 of ipTIME devices deployed in South Korea.



## Vulnerability Summary

This vulnerability allows to bypass the admin authentication and to
get a direct RCE as root from the LAN side with a single HTTP request.

This is a direct RCE against the Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls
which gives a complete root access to the embedded Linux from the LAN
side.
The exploit doesn't work by default from the WAN (no HTTP or UPNP
access from the WAN by default unless activated).
If enabled on the WAN, the remote admin interface exposes the devices
to this vulnerability.

It affects 112 ipTIME products from 2009-era firmwares to the 9.52
firmware (built time 2015-03-23)) with the default configuration:

Concerning the high CVSS score (10/10) of the vulnerability, the
number of affected devices and the longevity of this vulnerability (6+
year old), we urge users to apply the new 9.58 firmware.



## Details

The HTTP server allows the attacker to execute some CGI files.

Many of them are vulnerable to a command inclusion which allows to
execute commands with the http daemon user rights (root).

Considering the huge potential impact against the South Korea
networks, we are not currently planning to release working exploits.



The exploits will be posted on my blog located at
