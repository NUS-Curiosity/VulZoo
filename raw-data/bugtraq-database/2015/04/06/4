Package        : arj
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-0556 CVE-2015-0557 CVE-2015-2782
Debian Bug     : 774015 774434 774435

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in arj, an open source
version of the arj archiver. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2015-0556

    Jakub Wilk discovered that arj follows symlinks created during
    unpacking of an arj archive. A remote attacker could use this flaw
    to perform a directory traversal attack if a user or automated
    system were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.

CVE-2015-0557

    Jakub Wilk discovered that arj does not sufficiently protect from
    directory traversal while unpacking an arj archive containing file
    paths with multiple leading slashes. A remote attacker could use
    this flaw to write to arbitrary files if a user or automated system
    were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.

CVE-2015-2782

    Jakub Wilk and Guillem Jover discovered a buffer overflow
    vulnerability in arj. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause
    an application crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
    privileges of the user running arj.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.10.22-10+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 3.10.22-13.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.10.22-13.

We recommend that you upgrade your arj packages.
