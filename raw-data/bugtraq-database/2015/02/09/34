Package        : ruby1.9.1
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-4975 CVE-2014-8080 CVE-2014-8090

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the interpreter for the Ruby
language:

CVE-2014-4975

    The encodes() function in pack.c had an off-by-one error that could
    lead to a stack-based buffer overflow. This could allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code
    execution.

CVE-2014-8080, CVE-2014-8090

    The REXML parser could be coerced into allocating large string
    objects that could consume all available memory on the system. This
    could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.3.194-8.1+deb7u3.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9.1 packages.
