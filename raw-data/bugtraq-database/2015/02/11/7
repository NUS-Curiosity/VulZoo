Subject: [ANN] MSKB 3004375 available for Windows 2000 and later too (but NOT from Mcirosoft)

Hi @ll,

yesterday Microsoft published the security advisory 3004375
<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/3004375>
announcing an update which enables Windows 7 and newer to log
the command lines used to start processes to the event log.

If you want to have this functionality on older versions of
Windows too see <http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/appinit.html>
(but notice the license terms).

Limitation: command lines of processes that dont load USER32.DLL
are not logged. Fortunately almost all Win32 applications but
load USER32.DLL

JFTR: APPINIT.DLL works since 20 years.

regards
Stefan Kanthak
