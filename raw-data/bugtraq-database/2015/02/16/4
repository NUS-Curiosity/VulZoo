Subject: Cosmoshop - XSS on Admin-Login Mask

author: l0om

Cosmoshop is a simple webshop designed for the german market.

There is a simple XSS flaw at the admin-login panel in probably all cosmoshop versions. The admin login can be found at

http://www.shop-site.de/cgi-bin/cosmoshop/admin/index.cgi

This page will show a typical login screen. The username field is filled with the value of "u_name". Since this parameter isn't filtered you can inject javascript code and trick someone to execute it.

http://www.shop-site.de/cgi-bin/cosmoshop/admin/index.cgi?u_name=><script>alert("hello")</script>

nothing special but better to know.

Greetings and so long,
