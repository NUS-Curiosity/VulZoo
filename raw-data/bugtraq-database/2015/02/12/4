Vulnerability Details:
Publications allow sharing files with external data consumers. Access to those is secured with a random hash and publications allow access to the shared directory or file only. However, since the folder identifier has not been properly taken into consideration when calculating permissions, a user that obtained access to the publication is able to access other files which are not intentionally published by the owner.

Risk:
External users that have valid access to a publication may access files that are not intended to be shared with them.

Solution:
Users should update to the latest patch releases 7.4.2-rev42, 7.6.0-rev36 and 7.6.1-rev14 (or later).
