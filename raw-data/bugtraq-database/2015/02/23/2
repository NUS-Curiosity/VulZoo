Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS XR Software IPv6 Malformed Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20150220-ipv6

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2015 February 20 16:30  UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======
A vulnerability in the parsing of malformed IP version 6 (IPv6) packets in Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco Network Convergence System 6000 (NCS 6000) and Cisco Carrier Routing System (CRS-X) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of a line card that is processing traffic.

The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed IPv6 packets carrying extension headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed IPv6 packet, carrying extension headers, through an affected Cisco IOS XR device line card. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the line card on the affected Cisco IOS XR device.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
