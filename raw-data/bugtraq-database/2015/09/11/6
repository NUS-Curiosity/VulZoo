Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Magento is an open source e-commerce web application that was launched on March 31, 2008 under the name Bento. It was developed 
by Varien (now Magento, a division of eBay) with help from the programmers within the open source community but is now owned 
solely by eBay Inc. Magento was built using parts of the Zend Framework. It uses the entity-attribute-value (EAV) database model 
to store data. In November 2013, W3Techs estimated that Magento was used by 0.9% of all websites.

Our team of security professionals works hard to keep Magento customer information secure. What`s equally important to protecting 
this data? Our security researchers and user community. If you find a site that isn`t following our policies, or a vulnerability 
inside our system, please tell us right away.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side web vulnerability has been discovered  in the official Magento Commerce online service web-application.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker to inject own script code to the application-side of the affected application module.

The web vulnerability is located in the `filename and files` value of the `/products/bug-tracking/report/saveIssue/` module. 
Remote attackers are able to inject own files with malicious `files & filename` value via `upload` POST method request to 
compromise the magento commerce web-application. Remote attackers are also able to exploit the filename issue in combination 
with persistent injected script codes to execute different malicious attack requests. The attack vector is located on the 
application-side of the magento service and the request method to inject is POST. The issue is remotly exploitable after 
approval with two test accounts. The sender and receiver of the ticket is affected by the issue itself. Another issue is that 
the filename upload has no secure restriction of the name value. Thus can result in upload of multiple malicious file extensions 
to remotly elevate user privileges by malicious interaction. (arbitrary file upload - multiple extensions)

The security risk of the application-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.9. 
Exploitation of the application-side validation web vulnerability requires no user interaction and only a low privileged web-application user account. 
Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability results in the ubnt community web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Domain(s):
				[+] www.magentocommerce.com

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] /products/bug-tracking/report/saveIssue/

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename
				[+] files

Affected Module(s):
				[+] /saveIssue/


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privilege application user account and only low user interaction (click).
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Login in magento website
2. Go to http://www.magentocommerce.com/bug-tracking/report
3. Create to Report an Issues
4. Upload a file with a payload script code (code injection) as filename via POST

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable files and filename values in the send POST method request.
Restrict the input disallow special chars and setup an own exception that prevents multiple extensions in filenames on upload to block arbitrary file execution.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side input validation web vulnerability in the magento commerce application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.9)
