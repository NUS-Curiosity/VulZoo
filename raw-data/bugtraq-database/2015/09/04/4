Subject: Oracle Hyperion password disclosure...

Hi, all.

Oracle Hyperion Rapid Deployment installer leaves plaintext passwords in config files and logfiles.  Oracle has known about this for 2 years, and has decided not to patch any of the product versions prior to the latest version.  I have additional details if anyone is interested.
