(2) Vulnerability Details:
--------------------------
The GetResource servlet, a vestige of the old platform UI, allows
unauthenticated access to resources in the pentaho-solutions/system
folder. Specifically vulnerable are properties files that may reveal
passwords.

The servlet allows access to files with the following extensions:

.xsl
.mondrian.xml
.jpg
.jpeg
.gif
.bmp
.properties
.jar
The vulnerability allows unauthenticated access to properties files in
the system solution which include properties files containing
passwords. The offending code was heavily used in our previous version
of our web UI but has since then been deprecated and is only being
used in an old deprecated plugin (JPivot).

For example, unauthenticated access to the
defaultUser.spring.properties is allowed with the following URL:
http://localhost:8080/pentaho/GetResource?resource=system/defaultUser.spring.properties
