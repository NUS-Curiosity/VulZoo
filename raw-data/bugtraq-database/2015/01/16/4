Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the official WiFi File Browser Pro v2.0.8 (Android) mobile application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-01-14:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
ByteLounge
Product: WiFi File Browser - (Android) Web Application 2.0.8


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An arbitrary code execution vulnerability has been discovered in the official Wifi File Browser Pro v2.0.8 (Android) mobile application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute malicious codes on the application-side of the vulnerable browser app to compromise 
the target mobile device.

The vulnerability is located in the `path` value of the `browse` module. Remote attackers are able to manipulate the path value in the 
browse GET method request to compromise the application, user session information or connected device components. The vector of the issue 
is located on the application-side. Successful exploitation requires a client-side GET method request.

The security risk of the arbitrary code execution vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.1.
Exploitation of the arbitrary code execution vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects and persistent 
manipulation function or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [GET]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] browse

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] path

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index of Documents (http://localhost:8080)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The arbitrary code execution vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction or privileged application user account.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure restriction of the path value in the browse GET method request.
Encode and parse the input and filter with an own exception-handling to prevent arbitrary code execution in client-side requests.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the wifi browser is estimated as high. (CVSS 7.1)
