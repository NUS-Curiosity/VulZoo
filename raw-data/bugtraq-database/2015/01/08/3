 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:008
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : pwgen
 Date    : January 8, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated pwgen package fixes security vulnerabilities:
 
 Pwgen was found to generate weak non-tty passwords by default, which
 could be brute-forced with a commendable success rate, which could
 raise security concerns (CVE-2013-4440).
 
 Pwgen was found to silently falling back to use standard pseudo
 generated numbers on the systems that heavily use entropy. Systems,
 such as those with a lot of daemons providing encryption services,
 the entropy was found to be exhausted, which forces pwgen to fall
 back to use standard pseudo generated numbers (CVE-2013-4442).
