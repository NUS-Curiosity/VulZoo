 Injection Vulnerabilities

Hi,

I'm from Montala - we head up ResourceSpace development.

Just to add an update - we believe all issues have been fixed in the ResourceSpace Subversion repository. In fact the majority were fixed some time ago however the original submitter was checking against an older version.

We aim to release by the end of January, this will contain all fixes.

Regards,

Dan
