Debian Bug     : 775165

In DSA 3123 the binutils package was updated for several security issues.
This update adds rebuilt packages for binutils-mingw-w64, so these will
take advantage of the fixes. For reference the original advisory text
follows.

Multiple security issues have been found in binutils, a toolbox for 
binary file manipulation. These vulnerabilities include multiple memory 
safety errors, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation 
errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of
security restrictions, path traversal attack or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your binutils-mingw-w64 packages.
