Package        : php5
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8142

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development.

As announced in DSA 3064-1 it has been decided to follow the stable
5.4.x releases for the Wheezy php5 packages. Consequently the
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading PHP to a new upstream version
5.4.36, which includes additional bug fixes, new features and possibly
incompatible changes. Please refer to the upstream changelog for more
information:

 http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.36

Two additional patches were applied on top of the imported new upstream
version. An out-of-bounds read flaw was fixed which could lead php5-cgi
to crash. Moreover a bug with php5-pgsql in combination with PostgreSQL
9.1 was fixed (Debian Bug #773182).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.36-0+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
