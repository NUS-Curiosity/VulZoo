Package        : eglibc
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-6656 CVE-2014-6040 CVE-2014-7817 CVE-2015-0235

Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in eglibc, Debian's version of
the GNU C library:

CVE-2015-0235

    Qualys discovered that the gethostbyname and gethostbyname2
    functions were subject to a buffer overflow if provided with a
    crafted IP address argument.  This could be used by an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code in processes which called the affected
    functions.

    The original glibc bug was reported by Peter Klotz.

CVE-2014-7817

    Tim Waugh of Red Hat discovered that the WRDE_NOCMD option of the
    wordexp function did not suppress command execution in all cases.
    This allows a context-dependent attacker to execute shell
    commands.

CVE-2012-6656
CVE-2014-6040

    The charset conversion code for certain IBM multi-byte code pages
    could perform an out-of-bounds array access, causing the process
    to crash.  In some scenarios, this allows a remote attacker to
    cause a persistent denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.13-38+deb7u7.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), the CVE-2015-0235 issue has been fixed in version
2.18-1 of the glibc package.

We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.
