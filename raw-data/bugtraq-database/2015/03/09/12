 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:056
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : rpm
 Date    : March 9, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated rpm packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 It was found that RPM wrote file contents to the target
 installation directory under a temporary name, and verified its
 cryptographic signature only after the temporary file has been
 written completely. Under certain conditions, the system interprets
 the unverified temporary file contents and extracts commands from
 it. This could allow an attacker to modify signed RPM files in such
 a way that they would execute code chosen by the attacker during
 package installation (CVE-2013-6435).
 
 It was found that RPM could encounter an integer overflow, leading to
 a stack-based buffer overflow, while parsing a crafted CPIO header
 in the payload section of an RPM file. This could allow an attacker
 to modify signed RPM files in such a way that they would execute code
 chosen by the attacker during package installation (CVE-2014-8118).
