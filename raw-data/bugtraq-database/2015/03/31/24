Package        : openldap
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4449 CVE-2014-9713 CVE-2015-1545
Debian Bug     : 729367 761406 776988

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in OpenLDAP, a free implementation
of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.

CVE-2013-4449

    Michael Vishchers from Seven Principles AG discovered a denial of
    service vulnerability in slapd, the directory server implementation.
    When the server is configured to used the RWM overlay, an attacker
    can make it crash by unbinding just after connecting, because of an
    issue with reference counting.

CVE-2014-9713

    The default Debian configuration of the directory database allows
    every users to edit their own attributes. When LDAP directories are
    used for access control, and this is done using user attributes, an
    authenticated user can leverage this to gain access to unauthorized
    resources.
    .
    Please note this is a Debian specific vulnerability.
    .
    The new package won't use the unsafe access control rule for new
    databases, but existing configurations won't be automatically
    modified. Administrators are incited to look at the README.Debian
    file provided by the updated package if they need to fix the access
    control rule.

CVE-2015-1545

     Ryan Tandy discovered a denial of service vulnerability in slapd.
     When using the deref overlay, providing an empty attribute list in
     a query makes the daemon crashes.
