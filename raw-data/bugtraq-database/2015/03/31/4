 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:168
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/

 Package : glibc
 Date    : March 30, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated glibc packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Stephane Chazelas discovered that directory traversal issue in locale
 handling in glibc.  glibc accepts relative paths with .. components
 in the LC_* and LANG variables.  Together with typical OpenSSH
 configurations (with suitable AcceptEnv settings in sshd_config),
 this could conceivably be used to bypass ForceCommand restrictions
 (or restricted shells), assuming the attacker has sufficient level
 of access to a file system location on the host to create crafted
 locale definitions there (CVE-2014-0475).
 
 David Reid, Glyph Lefkowitz, and Alex Gaynor discovered a bug where
 posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen fails to copy the path argument
 (glibc bz #17048) which can, in conjunction with many common memory
 management techniques from an application, lead to a use after free,
 or other vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-4043).
 
 This update also fixes the following issues: x86: Disable x87 inline
 functions for SSE2 math (glibc bz #16510) malloc: Fix race in free()
 of fastbin chunk (glibc bz #15073)
 
 Tavis Ormandy discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the
 transliteration module loading code. As a result, an attacker who can
 supply a crafted destination character set argument to iconv-related
 character conversation functions could achieve arbitrary code
 execution.
 
 This update removes support of loadable gconv transliteration
 modules. Besides the security vulnerability, the module loading code
 had functionality defects which prevented it from working for the
 intended purpose (CVE-2014-5119).
 
 Adhemerval Zanella Netto discovered out-of-bounds reads in additional
 code page decoding functions (IBM933, IBM935, IBM937, IBM939, IBM1364)
 that can be used to crash the systems, causing a denial of service
 conditions (CVE-2014-6040).
 
 The function wordexp() fails to properly handle the WRDE_NOCMD
 flag when processing arithmetic inputs in the form of &quot;$((... ))&quot;
 where &quot;...&quot; can be anything valid. The backticks in the arithmetic
 epxression are evaluated by in a shell even if WRDE_NOCMD forbade
 command substitution. This allows an attacker to attempt to pass
 dangerous commands via constructs of the above form, and bypass the
 WRDE_NOCMD flag. This update fixes the issue (CVE-2014-7817).
 
 The vfprintf function in stdio-common/vfprintf.c in GNU C Library
 (aka glibc) 2.5, 2.12, and probably other versions does not properly
 restrict the use of the alloca function when allocating the SPECS
 array, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass the
 FORTIFY_SOURCE format-string protection mechanism and cause a denial
 of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
 format string using positional parameters and a large number of format
 specifiers (CVE-2012-3406).
 
 The nss_dns implementation of getnetbyname could run into an infinite
 loop if the DNS response contained a PTR record of an unexpected format
 (CVE-2014-9402).
 
 Also glibc lock elision (new feature in glibc 2.18) has been disabled
 as it can break glibc at runtime on newer Intel hardware (due to
 hardware bug)
 
 Under certain conditions wscanf can allocate too little memory
 for the to-be-scanned arguments and overflow the allocated buffer
 (CVE-2015-1472).
 
 The incorrect use of &quot;__libc_use_alloca (newsize)&quot; caused a different
 (and weaker) policy to be enforced which could allow a denial of
 service attack (CVE-2015-1473).
