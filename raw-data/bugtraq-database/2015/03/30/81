 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:154
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : gnupg
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated gnupg, gnupg2 and libgcrypt packages fix security
 vulnerabilities:
 
 GnuPG versions before 1.4.17 and 2.0.24 are vulnerable to a denial
 of service which can be caused by garbled compressed data packets
 which may put gpg into an infinite loop (CVE-2014-4617).
 
 The libgcrypt library before version 1.5.4 is vulnerable to an ELGAMAL
 side-channel attack (CVE-2014-5270).
 
 GnuPG before 1.4.19 is vulnerable to a side-channel attack which can
 potentially lead to an information leak (CVE-2014-3591).
 
 GnuPG before 1.4.19 is vulnerable to a side-channel attack on
 data-dependent timing variations in modular exponentiation, which
 can potentially lead to an information leak (CVE-2015-0837).
 
 The gnupg and gnupg2 package has been patched to correct these issues.
 
 GnuPG2 is vulnerable to these issues through the libgcrypt library.
 The issues were fixed in libgcrypt 1.6.3.  The libgcrypt package in
 Mandriva, at version 1.5.4, was only vulnerable to the CVE-2014-3591
 issue.  It has also been patched to correct this issue.
