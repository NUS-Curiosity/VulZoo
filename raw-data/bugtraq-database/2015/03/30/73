 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:145
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libxfont
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated libxfont packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Ilja van Sprundel discovered that libXfont incorrectly handled font
 metadata file parsing. A local attacker could use this issue to cause
 libXfont to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code in order to
 gain privileges (CVE-2014-0209).
 
 Ilja van Sprundel discovered that libXfont incorrectly handled X Font
 Server replies. A malicious font server could return specially-crafted
 data that could cause libXfont to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary
 code (CVE-2014-0210, CVE-2014-0211).
 
 The bdf parser reads a count for the number of properties defined
 in a font from the font file, and allocates arrays with entries for
 each property based on that count.  It never checked to see if that
 count was negative, or large enough to overflow when multiplied by
 the size of the structures being allocated, and could thus allocate
 the wrong buffer size, leading to out of bounds writes (CVE-2015-1802).
 
 If the bdf parser failed to parse the data for the bitmap for any
 character, it would proceed with an invalid pointer to the bitmap
 data and later crash when trying to read the bitmap from that pointer
 (CVE-2015-1803).
 
 The bdf parser read metrics values as 32-bit integers, but stored them
 into 16-bit integers.  Overflows could occur in various operations
 leading to out-of-bounds memory access (CVE-2015-1804).
