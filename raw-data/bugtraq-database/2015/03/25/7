Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software Common Industrial Protocol

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20150325-cip

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2015 March 25 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

The Cisco IOS Software implementation of the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) feature contains the following vulnerabilities when processing crafted CIP packets that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition:

  Cisco IOS Software UDP CIP Denial of Service Vulnerability
  Cisco IOS Software TCP CIP Packet Memory Leak Vulnerability
  Cisco IOS Software TCP CIP Denial of Service Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others.

Successful exploitation of any of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the forwarding plane, resulting in an interruption of services on an affected device. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.

Additionally, successful exploitation of Cisco IOS Software TCP CIP Packet Memory Leak Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak on an affected device.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

Note: The March 25, 2015, Cisco IOS & XE Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Cisco Security Advisories. The advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software.
