Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco ASR 1000 Series, Cisco ISR 4400 Series, and Cisco Cloud Services 1000v Series Routers

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20150325-iosxe

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2015 March 25 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

  Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers (ASR), Cisco 4400 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISR), and Cisco Cloud Services Routers (CSR) 1000v Series contains the following vulnerabilities:
  Cisco IOS XE Software Fragmented Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability
  Cisco IOS XE Software Crafted TCP Packet Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
  Cisco IOS XE Software Crafted IPv6 Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability
  Cisco IOS XE Software Layer 4 Redirect Crafted Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability
  Cisco IOS XE Software Common Flow Table Crafted Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others.

Successful exploitation of any of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of the forwarding plane, causing an interruption of services. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained denial of service (DoS) condition.

Successful exploitation of Cisco IOS XE Software Crafted TCP Packet Remote Code Execution Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute malicious code on the affected device.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
