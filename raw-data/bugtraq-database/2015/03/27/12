 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:072
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/

 Package : gnutls
 Date    : March 27, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated gnutls packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Suman Jana reported a vulnerability that affects the certificate
 verification functions of gnutls 3.1.x and gnutls 3.2.x. A version
 1 intermediate certificate will be considered as a CA certificate
 by default (something that deviates from the documented behavior)
 (CVE-2014-1959).
 
 It was discovered that GnuTLS did not correctly handle certain errors
 that could occur during the verification of an X.509 certificate,
 causing it to incorrectly report a successful verification. An attacker
 could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate that
 could be accepted by GnuTLS as valid for a site chosen by the attacker
 (CVE-2014-0092).
 
 A NULL pointer dereference flaw was discovered in GnuTLS&#039;s
 gnutls_x509_dn_oid_name().  The function, when called with the
 GNUTLS_X509_DN_OID_RETURN_OID flag, should not return NULL to its
 caller. However, it could previously return NULL when parsed X.509
 certificates included specific OIDs (CVE-2014-3465).
 
 A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session ids from Server
 Hello packets of the TLS/SSL handshake.  A malicious server could use
 this flaw to send an excessively long session id value and trigger a
 buffer overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client using GnuTLS, causing
 it to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code (CVE-2014-3466).
 
 An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the way GnuTLS
 parsed certain ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) certificates or
 certificate signing requests (CSR). A malicious user could create a
 specially crafted ECC certificate or a certificate signing request
 that, when processed by an application compiled against GnuTLS (for
 example, certtool), could cause that application to crash or execute
 arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application
 (CVE-2014-8564).
