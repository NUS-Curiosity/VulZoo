 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:065
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : cpio
 Date    : March 27, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated cpio package fixes security vulnerabilities:
 
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the process_copy_in function in GNU
 Cpio 2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via
 a large block value in a cpio archive (CVE-2014-9112).
 
 Additionally, a null pointer dereference in the copyin_link function
 which could cause a denial of service has also been fixed.
 
 In GNU Cpio 2.11, the --no-absolute-filenames option limits
 extracting contents of an archive to be strictly inside a current
 directory. However, it can be bypassed with symlinks. While extracting
 an archive, it will extract symlinks and then follow them if they
 are referenced in further entries. This can be exploited by a rogue
 archive to write files outside the current directory (CVE-2015-1197).
