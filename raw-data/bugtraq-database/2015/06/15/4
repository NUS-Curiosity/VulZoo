Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8176 CVE-2015-1788 CVE-2015-1789 CVE-2015-1790
                 CVE-2015-1791 CVE-2015-1792 CVE-2015-4000

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Sockets
Layer toolkit.

CVE-2014-8176

    Praveen Kariyanahalli, Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert discovered
    that an invalid memory free could be triggered when buffering DTLS
    data. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code. This issue only
    affected the oldstable distribution (wheezy).

CVE-2015-1788

    Joseph Barr-Pixton discovered that an infinite loop could be triggered
    due to incorrect handling of malformed ECParameters structures. This
    could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2015-1789

    Robert Swiecki and Hanno Böck discovered that the X509_cmp_time
    function could read a few bytes out of bounds. This could allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted
    certificates and CRLs.

CVE-2015-1790

    Michal Zalewski discovered that the PKCS#7 parsing code did not
    properly handle missing content which could lead to a NULL pointer
    dereference. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (crash) via crafted ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs.

CVE-2015-1791

    Emilia Käsper discovered that a race condition could occur due to
    incorrect handling of NewSessionTicket in a multi-threaded client,
    leading to a double free. This could allow remote attackers to cause
    a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2015-1792

    Johannes Bauer discovered that the CMS code could enter an infinite
    loop when verifying a signedData message, if presented with an
    unknown hash function OID. This could allow remote attackers to cause
    a denial of service.

Additionally OpenSSL will now reject handshakes using DH parameters
shorter than 768 bits as a countermeasure against the Logjam attack
(CVE-2015-4000).

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u17.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-3+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.2b-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2b-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
