Summary:

The CollabNet Subversion Edge Management does not implement a strong password
policy.  Passwords like "aaaaa" are allowed as the only requirement is that the
password is at least 5 characters long

Fix proposal:

Allow for a configuration option that enforces high password complexity.

Vendor fix:

The new default for passwords is to require at least 3 of the following
character classes: uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters. A
minimum length of 8 characters is also configurable.
