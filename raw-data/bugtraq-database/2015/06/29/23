Summary:

The CollabNet Subversion Edge Management stores passwords as unsalted MD5
hashes. Unsalted MD5 hashes can easily be cracked by brute forcing the password.

Fix proposal:

Use a strong password storage algorithm like scrypt or PBKDF2.

Vendor fix:

We opted to go with bcrypt. It has more usage than scrypt and does not have any
known vulnerabilities; it is  also more easily supported with the subversion
server, not just the Edge admin console. The strength factor is configurable.
