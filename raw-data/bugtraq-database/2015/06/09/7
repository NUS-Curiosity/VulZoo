Potential Security Impact: Local Denial of Service (DoS), arbitrary code
execution

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP Helion
CloudSystem. The vulnerability could be exploited locally resulting in Denial
of Service (DoS) or execution of arbitrary code.

Notes:

This is the vulnerability known as "Virtual Environment Neglected Operations
Manipulation" also known as "VENOM".
This vulnerability exists in the floppy disk controller driver of QEMU, an
open-source virtualization technology used to provision guest Virtual
Machines.
This vulnerability affects all versions of QEMU and could lead to hypervisor
breakout, where a user of the guest VM can gain control of the host. HP
Helion CloudSystem leverages QEMU as a core part of its virtualization
functionality and is therefore affected by this vulnerability.

References:

CVE-2015-3456 (SSRT102076)

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
HP Helion CloudSystem software:

HP Helion CloudSystem 8.x series

Note: Only HP CloudSystem deployment using KVM on RHEL version 6.4 or 6.5 in
the control plane or the data plane are affected by this vulnerability

RESOLUTION

HP recommends following remediation steps to resolve the vulnerability in HP
Helion CloudSystem.

The following steps are recommended by Red Hat (
https://access.redhat.com/articles/1444903 ) and must be applied for each
control plane and data plane node that is using KVM for virtualization:

Login to the node

Upgrade the QEMU package for your system using the command: 'yum update
qemu-kvm'. A full system update may be applied using the command 'yum
update'.

Guest operating systems should be powered off, and started again for the
update to take effect. Refer to the HP Helion CloudSystem administrative
guide ( http://h20564.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/public/kb/docDisplay/?docI
d=c04376928 ) for instructions on restarting appliances.
