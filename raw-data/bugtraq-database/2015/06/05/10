Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Looking for a free tool that can convert audio files from your extensive, wide-ranging collection into a format that plays on your iPhone? 
Or just about any device or player? 1Click Audio Converter is a free software designed for converting audio files from one format to another 
according to your wish and saving them to your hard drive. 1Click Audio Converter supports a wealth of audio formats, including MP3, WMA, WAV, 
M4A, iPhone Ringtone, OGG, AC3, and convert them to MP3, WAV and AC3. Using the program couldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t be easier; you simply select the files they 
want to convert, choose the output format and destination folder, optionally adjust the bitrate or channel options, and Airy does the rest.
It also has the ability to convert only a portion of an audio, instead of the entire file. This is a very basic editing feature, but it’s 
really helpful because you don’t have to download any sound editing software if you want only some parts of the audio.

Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered an activex buffer overflow vulnerability in the official 1 Click Audio Converter v2.3.6 software.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-06-04: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
DVDVideoTool
Product: 1 Click Audio Converter - Software (Windows) 2.3.6


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An activeX buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the official 1 Click Audio Converter v2.3.6 software.
The buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local  attackers to compromise a target system or 
to gain higher access privileges for further exploitation.

The buffer overflow vulnerability is located in the COM component used by the product SkinCrafter.dll (dynamic library).
The vulnerability is available with poc demo code and security video to demonstrate how to exploit the issue via activex component.

The security risk of the buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.1. 
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege system user account and no user interaction. Successful exploitation of the 
vulnerability results in system compromise by elevation of privileges via overwrite of the registers.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The activex buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
