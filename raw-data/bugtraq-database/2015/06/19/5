Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Magento is an open source e-commerce web application that was launched on March 31, 2008 under the name Bento. It was developed 
by Varien (now Magento, a division of eBay) with help from the programmers within the open source community but is now owned 
solely by eBay Inc. Magento was built using parts of the Zend Framework. It uses the entity-attribute-value (EAV) database model 
to store data. In November 2013, W3Techs estimated that Magento was used by 0.9% of all websites.

Our team of security professionals works hard to keep Magento customer information secure. What`s equally important to protecting 
this data? Our security researchers and user community. If you find a site that isn`t following our policies, or a vulnerability 
inside our system, please tell us right away.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Ebay Inc.
Product: Magento - Connect Web Application 2015 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Magento xCommerce web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own script code to the application-side of the affected service module.

The vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the image upload module. The attacker needs to create a `New Message` 
with upload to change the filename to a malicious payload. The attack vector of the issue is located on the application-side 
and the request method to inject the script code is POST. 

The security risk of the persistent web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.7.
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the application-side vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects 
and persistent manipulation affected or connected module context.

Vulnerable Domain(s):
				[+] www.magentocommerce.com/ (Magento Connect)

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] New Message

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The application-side input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged application user account and 
low or medium user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the security vulnerability ...
1. Login to the magento connect service
2. create a new message 
3. Start a session tamper to intercept session data - 

https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/message/message/create/

4. 

Click to Drop the file and upload it with a payload as filename  "><img src="x" onerror=alert(document.cookie)>.png
5. Save the request and the execution occurs in the same location!
6. Successful reproduce of the application-side input validation web vulnerability in the upload POST method request!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure encode and parse of the vulnerable filename value in the new message upload POSt method request.
Restrict the input and disallow special chars to prevent application-side script code injection attacks. Ensure that the execution point redisplays valid context.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side input validation web vulnerability in the magento xcommerce application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.7)
