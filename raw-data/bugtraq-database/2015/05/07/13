Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Grindr, which first launched in 2009, has exploded into the largest and most popular all-male location-based social network out there. 
With more than 5 million guys in 192 countries around the world -- and approximately 10,000 more new users downloading the app 
every day -- you’ll always find a new date, buddy, or friend on Grindr. Grindr is a simple app that uses your mobile device’s 
location-based services to show you the guys closest to you who are also on Grindr. How much of your info they see is 
entirely your call.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
The grindr v2.1.1 & connected account system is vulnerable to the famous `breach attack`. Remote and local attackers can leverage data leaked by compression to recover targeted sections of the plain-text, inject partial plain-text into application-side or client-side victim requests or aeasure the data size of encrypted traffic of the mobile application and connected account system. The following conditions must match to become a target of the issue ...

- Become served from a server that uses HTTP-level compression 
- Reflection of user-inputs in HTTP responses (context body)
- Reflect a secret data  (token, csrf-x) in HTTP response bodies

The vulnerability affects the ./user module of the server online-service. The following issues are matching to grant the successful exploitation ...

- We verified that the page content is served via HTTPS protocol
- We verified that the server is using the HTTP-level compression
- We verified that URL encoded GET input locale was reflected into the HTTP response context body
- We verified that the HTTP response contains in the body a secret token named authenticity_token that is already known as broken of the reports due to the pentest

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Disabling the HTTP protocol compression 
Separating secrets from user input in the application
Randomizing of secrets in separate request 
Masking of secrets (XORing) 
Protecting the vulnerable pages with CSRF issues by usage of a secure token
Length hiding by adding own random numbers of bytes to the responses itself 
Rate-limiting the requests to prevent


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the Breach Attack issue in the iOS application that is connected to the account system is estimated as high. (CVSS 6.7)
