             Information on CVSS is documented

RESOLUTION

HP has provided the following steps to resolve the vulnerability in
sendmail(1M).

Note: The vulnerability is only possible if sendmail is configured to use
STARTTLS. Configurations not using STARTTLS are not

vulnerable so the following steps are not necessary.

Edit the configuration file ./etc/mail/sendmail.cf..
Locate the lines where the STARTTLS options are set.

Add or modify a line containing "D{tls_version}<version>" as follows so that
only TLS version 1 will be used:

D{tls_version}TLSv1

Save the modified file and restart the sendmail service:

# /sbin/init.d/sendmail stop

# /sbin/init.d/sendmail start
