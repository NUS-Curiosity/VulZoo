Package        : owncloud
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3011 CVE-2015-3012 CVE-2015-3013

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ownCloud, a cloud storage
web service for files, music, contacts, calendars and many more.

CVE-2015-3011

    Hugh Davenport discovered that the "contacts" application shipped
    with ownCloud is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site
    scripting attacks. This vulnerability is effectively exploitable
    in any browser.

CVE-2015-3012

    Roy Jansen discovered that the "documents" application shipped with
    ownCloud is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site scripting
    attacks. This vulnerability is not exploitable in browsers that
    support the current CSP standard.

CVE-2015-3013

    Lukas Reschke discovered a blacklist bypass vulnerability, allowing
    authenticated remote attackers to bypass the file blacklist and
    upload files such as the .htaccess files. An attacker could leverage
    this bypass by uploading a .htaccess and execute arbitrary PHP code
    if the /data/ directory is stored inside the web root and a web
    server that interprets .htaccess files is used. On default Debian
    installations the data directory is outside of the web root and thus
    this vulnerability is not exploitable by default.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.4+dfsg-4~deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.0.4+dfsg-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.4+dfsg-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your owncloud packages.
