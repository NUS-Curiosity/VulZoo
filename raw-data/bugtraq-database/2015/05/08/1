Package        : pound
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-3555 CVE-2012-4929 CVE-2014-3566
Debian Bug     : 723731 727197 765539 765649

Pound, a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer, had several issues
related to vulnerabilities in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

For Debian 7 (wheezy) this update adds a missing part to make it
actually possible to disable client-initiated renegotiation and
disables it by default (CVE-2009-3555). TLS compression is disabled
(CVE-2012-4929), although this is normally already disabled by the OpenSSL
system library. Finally it adds the ability to disable the SSLv3 protocol
(CVE-2014-3566) entirely via the new "DisableSSLv3" configuration
directive, although it will not disabled by default in this update.
Additionally a non-security sensitive issue in redirect encoding is
addressed.

For Debian 8 (jessie) these issues have been fixed prior to the release,
with the exception of client-initiated renegotiation (CVE-2009-3555).
This update addresses that issue for jessie.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.6-2+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pound packages.
