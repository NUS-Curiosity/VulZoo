Package        : dnsmasq
Debian Bug     : 784571

The update for dnsmasq issued as DSA-3251-1 introduced a regression for
the armel and armhf builds causing dnsmasq failing to start under
certain configurations. Updated packages are now available to address
this regression. Additionally dnsmasq was patched to handle the case
were the libc headers defined SO_REUSEPORT, but is not supported by the
running kernel. For reference, the original advisory text follows.

Nick Sampanis discovered that dnsmasq, a small caching DNS proxy and
DHCP/TFTP server, did not properly check the return value of the
setup_reply() function called during a TCP connection, which is used
then as a size argument in a function which writes data on the client's
connection. A remote attacker could exploit this issue via a specially
crafted DNS request to cause dnsmasq to crash, or potentially to obtain
sensitive information from process memory.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.62-3+deb7u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq packages.
