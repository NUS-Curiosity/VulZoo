Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
We work with businesses to develop web sites that help grow their bottom line. What if we told you that you could turn one of the most neglected and 
frustrating aspects of your business into your most valuable, lead- and revenue-generating asset? That’s what happens when you hire the 
right web strategy partner. We get that you may not understand or really want to deal with the web. Or maybe you do want to deal with it, 
but don’t know where to begin. That’s where we come in with CRUCMS.

Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An indepndent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered a remote sql injection web vulnerability in the official Crucial Networking - CRUCMS web-application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-05-18:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Crucial Networking LLC
Product: CRUCMS - Content Management System 2015 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple remote sql injection vulnerabilities has been discovered  in the official Crucial Networking - CRUCMS web-application (2015 Q2).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or database management system.

The vulnerabilities are located in the id value of the `projects-cat.php`,`kitchen-chefs-detail.php` and `gallery-view.php` files. 
Remote attackers are able to execute own sql commands by manipulation of the GET method request with the vulnerable id value. 
The request method to inject the command is GET and the issue is located on the application-side.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.2.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privilege web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in dbms, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
						[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
						[+] projects-cat.php
						[+] kitchen-chefs-detail.php
						[+] gallery-view.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
						[+] id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The sql Injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privilege web-application user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Note: use for example SQLMAP to find the (DB NAME) then use this command to get admin username and password
Command: sqlmap -u http://www.site.com/anyinfectedfile.php?ID=[] --dump -D [DB NAME] -T tblAccess

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The sql vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable id value. 
Use a prepared statement to protect the request and restrict the input by disallowing special chars like script code tags and co.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql injection web vulnerability in the content management system is estimated as high. (CVSS 8.2)
