Subject: WISE-FTP Software v8.0.2 - DLL Hijacking Vulnerability

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local dll injection vulnerability has been discovered in the official Wise-FTP v8.0.2 software.
The issue allows local attackers to inject code to vulnerable libraries to compromise the process or to gain higher access privileges.

The windows software is vulnerable to dll hijacking attacks. The vulnerability is located in the Linkinfo.dll , mpr.dll , netutils.dll , secur32.dll , 
wkscli.dll file extensions.  The software does not specify the fully qualified path to a dynamic-linked libraries (Linkinfo.dll , mpr.dll , netutils.dll , 
secur32.dll , wkscli.dll).  The vulnerable version affects the Wise-FTP v8.0.2 software. The security risk of the local file include vulnerability is estimated 
as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.0. 

Vulnerable Software:
[+] Wise-FTP

Vulnerable Version(s):
[+] v8.02

Vulnerable Libraries:
[+] Linkinfo.dll
[+] mpr.dll
[+] netutils.dll
[+] secur32.dll 
[+] wkscli.dll 


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The dll hijack vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted system user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the local vulnerability ...
