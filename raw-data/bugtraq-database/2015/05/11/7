Subject: [oCERT-2015-006] dcraw input sanitization errors


#2015-006 dcraw input sanitization errors

Description:

The dcraw photo decoder is an open source project for raw image parsing.

The dcraw tool, as well as several other projects re-using its code, suffers
from an integer overflow condition which lead to a buffer overflow. The
vulnerability concerns the 'len' variable, parsed without validation from
opened images, used in the ljpeg_start() function.

A maliciously crafted raw image file can be used to trigger the vulnerability,
causing a Denial of Service condition.

Affected version:

   dcraw >= 7.00
   UFRaw >= 0.5
   LibRaw <= 0.16.0, 0.17-Alpha2
   RawTherapee >= 3.0
   CxImage >= 6.00
   Rawstudio >= 0.1
   Kodi >= 10.0
   ExactImage >= 0.1.0

Fixed version:

   dcraw, N/A
   UFRaw, N/A
   LibRaw >= 0.16.1, 0.17-Alpha3
   RawTherapee, N/A
   CxImage, N/A
   Rawstudio, N/A
   Kodi, N/A
   ExactImage, N/A
