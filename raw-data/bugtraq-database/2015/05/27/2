Package        : ntfs-3g
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3202
Debian Bug     : 786475

The patch applied for ntfs-3g to fix CVE-2015-3202 in DSA 3268-1 was
incomplete. This update corrects that problem. For reference the
original advisory text follows.

Tavis Ormandy discovered that NTFS-3G, a read-write NTFS driver for
FUSE, does not scrub the environment before executing mount or umount
with elevated privileges. A local user can take advantage of this flaw
to overwrite arbitrary files and gain elevated privileges by accessing
debugging features via the environment that would not normally be safe
for unprivileged users.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2012.1.15AR.5-2.1+deb7u2. Note that this issue does not affect
the binary packages distributed in Debian in wheezy as ntfs-3g does not
use the embedded fuse-lite library.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2014.2.15AR.2-1+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2014.2.15AR.3-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntfs-3g packages.
