Subject: Security advisory for Bugzilla 5.0.2, 4.4.11 and 4.2.16

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Unfiltered HTML injected into a dependency graph could be used to
  create a cross-site scripting attack.

* Some web browsers incorrectly parse CSV files as valid JavaScript
  code which could lead to data leak.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Versions:    Bugzilla 2.6 to 4.2.15, 4.3.1 to 4.4.10, 4.5.1 to 5.0.1
Fixed In:    4.2.16, 4.4.11, 5.0.2
Description: During the generation of a dependency graph, the code for
             the HTML image map is generated locally if a local dot
             installation is used. With escaped HTML characters in a bug
             summary, it is possible to inject unfiltered HTML code in
             the map file which the CreateImagemap function generates.
             This could be used for a cross-site scripting attack.

CVE Number:  CVE-2015-8508

Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    Bugzilla 2.17.1 to 4.2.15, 4.3.1 to 4.4.10, 4.5.1 to 5.0.1
Fixed In:    4.2.16, 4.4.11, 5.0.2
Description: If an external HTML page contains a <script> element with
             its src attribute pointing to a buglist in CSV format, some
             web browsers incorrectly try to parse the CSV file as valid
             JavaScript code. As the buglist is generated based on the
             privileges of the user logged into Bugzilla, the external
             page could collect confidential data contained in the CSV
             file.
