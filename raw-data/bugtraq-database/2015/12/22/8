Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered a code execution vulnerability in the official Switch v4.68 software.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-11-23:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
NCH Software
Product: Switch 4.68


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local code execution vulnerability has been discovered in the official Switch v4.68 software.
The bug allows a local attacker to execute malicious codes by interaction with a vulnerable software input field.

The security vulnerability is present in the `url` input field when processing to convert the audio stream data. Local attackers are able 
to inject malicious payloads as url input for the audio convert to compromise the software system process. The vulnerability can be exploited 
by local attackers without interaction. The severity of the issue is high and the bug can be exploited because of a misconfigured url input 
validation mechanism.

The security risk of the code execution vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.2.
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege system user account and no user interaction. Successful exploitation of the software
vulnerability results in system compromise by a classic url code execution.

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] Convert

Vulnerable Input(s):
			[+] url

Affected Module(s):
			[+] Audio Stream


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by local network attackers without privileged device user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Launch Switch.exe                
2. Click convert > Convert the audio data stream                      
3. Paste malicious url in input `Enter url of the audio stream`
4. Click start the audio stream
5. PHP code executed successfully!

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the code execution vulnerability in the convert module of the switch software is estimated as high. (CVSS 8.2)
