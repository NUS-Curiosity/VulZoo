Subject: Executable installers are vulnerable^WEVIL (case 14): Rapid7's ScanNowUPnP.exe allows arbitrary (remote) code execution

Hi @ll,

the executable installer [°]['] (rather: the 7-Zip based executable
self-extractor [²]) of Rapid7's (better known for their flagship
Metasploit) ScanNowUPnP.exe loads and executes several rogue/bogus
DLLs eventually found in the directory it is started from (the
"application directory"), commonly known as "DLL hijacking".

For software downloaded with a web browser the application directory
is typically the "Downloads" directory: see

<http://blog.acrossecurity.com/2012/02/downloads-folder-binary-planting.html>
and <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Aug/134>


See the comprehensive write-up on Rapid7's community blog:
<https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2015/12/21/scannow-dll-search-order-hijacking-vulnerability-and-deprecation>

Especially note that Rapid7 removed the now deprecated ScanNowUPnP.exe
and advises all users to remove it from any system that still has it.


stay tuned
