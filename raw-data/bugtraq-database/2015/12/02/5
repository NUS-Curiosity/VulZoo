Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered Cross-Site scripting vulnerability in a popular Role Scoper WordPress plugin, present on more than 10 000 websites. 

The vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous attackers against website administrators. Successful attack may allow to steal administrator's cookies, credentials and browser history, modify web page content to perform phishing attacks, or even to perform drive-by-download attacks by injecting malware into website pages when the website administrator follows a specially crafted link with XSS exploit. 

The vulnerability is caused by absence of filtration of input-data passed via the "object_name" HTTP GET parameter to "/wp-admin/admin.php" script, when "page" is set to value "rs-object_role_edit". A remote unauthenticated attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

A simple exploit below will display JS popup with "ImmuniWeb" word:

http://[host]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rs-object_role_edit&object_name=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28ImmuniWeb%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Update to Role Scoper 1.3.67
