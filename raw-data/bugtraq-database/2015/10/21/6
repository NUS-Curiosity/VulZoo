Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco ASA Software DNS Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20151021-asa-dns1

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2015 October 21 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======
A vulnerability in the DNS code of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected system to reload.

The vulnerability is due to improper processing of DNS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an affected Cisco ASA appliance to cause it to generate a DNS request packet. The attacker would need to spoof the reply packet with a crafted DNS response.


Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available. This advisory is available at the following link:
