~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Windows provides centralized protection
of Windows workstations and Windows servers from malware, potentially
dangerous programs and network attacks. It includes features such as
data encryption functionality for encrypting hard drives and removable
devices, centralized vulnerability flagging and virtual machine support
(see [1]).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Windows software allows users to
disable the offered protection by entering a so-called unload password.
Beside the graphical user interface (GUI) authentication, it is also
possible to manually deactivate the protection over the command-line
interface using the Kaspersky software tool avp.exe.

By analyzing the password-based authentication for unloading the
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Windows protection, the SySS GmbH found
out, that the password comparison is done within the process avp.exe,
which runs or can be run in the context of the current Windows user,
who can also be a standard, limited user.

This fact allows a further analysis and the manipulation of the password
comparison during runtime without administrative privileges, as every 
user is able to debug and manipulate the processes running with her user
privileges.

In order to bypass the password-based authentication to deactivate the 
protection of Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Windows in an unauthorized
manner, an attacker only has to patch this password comparison, so that 
it always returns true, for example by comparing the correct unload
password with itself or by modifying the program control flow.

The SySS GmbH also found out, that by modifying the software tool 
avp.exe, the Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Windows can also be
deactivated completely even when no password was set for protecting
administrative functions. The intended behavior of the software tool
avp.exe in this case is to deny access to the requested function, for
example "exit", due to a disabled password protection.

Thus, a limited Windows user or malware running in the context of such a
user is able to unload Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Windows in an
unauthorized manner regardless of the configured password protection.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The SySS GmbH developed a proof-of-concept software tool named UnloadKES
for deactivating Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Windows in an
unauthorized manner.

The following output exemplarily shows a successful deactivation of
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Windows:
