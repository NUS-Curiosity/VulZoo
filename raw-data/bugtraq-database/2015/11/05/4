Subject: [KIS-2015-07] ATutor <= 2.2 (popuphelp.php) Reflected Cross-Site
 Scripting Vulnerability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATutor <= 2.2 (popuphelp.php) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://www.atutor.ca/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 2.2 and prior versions. 	


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the /popuphelp.php script:

26.	if ($_GET['h']) {
27.	    $h = $_GET['h'];
28.	
29.	    if (is_string($_GET['h'])) { // just a AT_HELP code with no prefix
30.	        $msg->printHelps($h);

User input passed through the "h" GET parameter is not properly sanitized before
being passed to the "Message::printHelps()" method at line 30. This can be
exploited to carry out reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


[-] Solution:

No official solution is currently available.
