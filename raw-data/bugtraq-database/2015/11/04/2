Package        : php-horde
Debian Bug     : 803641

It was discovered that the web-based administration interface in the
Horde Application Framework did not guard against Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attacks.  As a result, other, malicious web pages could
cause Horde applications to perform actions as the Horde user.

The oldstable distribution (wheezy) did not contain php-horde
packages.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.1+debian0-2+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 5.2.8+debian0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-horde packages.
