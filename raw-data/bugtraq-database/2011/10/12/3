Subject: LedgerSMB 1.3.0 released, includes anti-XSRF framework

Hi all;

LedgerSMB 1.3.0 has been released.  One of the important enhancements
this version has is protection against cross-site request forgery
(XSRF), notably missing in past versions.  The codebase we inherited
when beginning the project has not been very conducive to retrofitting
security framework changes, and this is one of the big reasons for the
delay in 1.3.

While the 1.2 series had mitigating measures designed to reduce the
likelihood that XSRF attacks could be successful over a long period of
time, and while critical portions of the application (such as password
resets) had measures in place designed to thwart XSRF attacks on a
per-attack basis, this is the first version to include, as part of the
security framework form id checking.

If anyone is listing
http://secunia.com/advisories/cve_reference/CVE-2009-3580/ as open,
now would be a good time to close it.  Any further XSRF
vulnerabilities should probably have their own advisories.

Best Wishes,
