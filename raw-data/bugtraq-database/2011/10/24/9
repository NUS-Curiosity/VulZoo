Package        : kfreebsd-8
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation/denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4062

Buffer overflow in the "linux emulation" support in FreeBSD kernel
allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) and possibly
execute arbitrary code by calling the bind system call with a long path
for a UNIX-domain socket, which is not properly handled when the
address is used by other unspecified system calls.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.1+dfsg-8+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.2-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-8 packages.
