Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.12.11: Apple MobileSafari Attachment
 Viewing Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.12.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 12, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

MobileSafari is Apple's mobile we browser for iOS devices. For more
information about MobileSafari, please the visit following website:

http://www.apple.com/iphone/built-in-apps/safari.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a cross site scripting vulnerability in Apple
Inc.'s MobileSafari could allow an attacker to view sensitive
information in the context of the targeted domain.

This vulnerability occurs in MobileSafari's handling of the
Content-Disposition header, which is typically used to inform the
browser that an attachment is contained in the current response. Typical
browser behavior is to prompt the user with an Open dialog, asking them
how they would like to handle the attachment content (such as opening an
external program). However, MobileSafari does not prompt the user, and
instead opens the attached content in the browser. If an attacker can
persuade a target to open an HTML attachment (such as by attaching an
HTML file to an email), then this file will open in the context of the
domain serving the file. This allows the HTML attachment full access to
the DOM of the targeted domain, which can allow for cross site
scripting.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the disclosure of
potentially sensitive information, such as document cookies, on the
target domain. To exploit this vulnerability, a targeted user must open
an attachment from an affected domain. An attacker typically
accomplishes this via social engineering or injecting content into
compromised, trusted sites. Note that a user has to open an attachment,
which takes at least one click; however, MobileSafari does not display
an "Open" prompt dialog, so nothing beyond the initial click is
necessary.

IV. DETECTION

iOS versions prior to 5 are vulnerable.
