Subject: DNS Poisoning via Port Exhaustion

Hey,

Today we are releasing a very interesting whitepaper which describes a DNS
poisoning attack against stub resolvers.

It discloses two vulnerabilities:

1. A vulnerability in Java (CVE-2011-3552, CVE-2010-4448) which enables remote
   DNS poisoning using Java applets. This vulnerability can be triggered when
   opening a malicious webpage. A successful exploitation of this vulnerability
   may lead to disclosure and manipulation of cookies and web pages, disclosure
   of NTLM credentials and clipboard data of the logged-on user, and even
   firewall bypass.

2. A vulnerability in multiuser Windows environments which enables local DNS
   cache poisoning of arbitrary domains. This vulnerability can be triggered
   by a normal user (i.e. one with non-administrative rights) in order to
   attack other users of the system. A successful exploitation of this
   vulnerability may lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation,
   universal XSS and more.
