High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Tine 2.0, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting attacks.

1) Input passed via the "lang" GET parameter to /library/idnaconvert/example.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/library/idnaconvert/example.php?lang=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

2) Input appended to the URL after /library/idnaconvert/example.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site

The following PoC is available:

http://[host]/library/idnaconvert/example.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that Apache's directive "AcceptPathInfo" is set to "on" or "default" (default value is "default")
