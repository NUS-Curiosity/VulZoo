Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Tor, the most severe of which
may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Tor is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a
connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/tor                < 0.2.1.30               >= 0.2.1.30

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Tor. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the Tor process or create a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tor users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tor-0.2.1.30"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since April 2, 2011. It is likely that your system is already
no longer affected by this issue.
