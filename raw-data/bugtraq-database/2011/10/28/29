---[Vulnerability description]

Positive Research Center has discovered multiply SQL injection vulnerabilities in OneOrZero AIMS. Application incorrectly validates input data. That allows attackers to conduct SQL injection attack.

"SQL Injection" is a way to bypass network protection and attack the database. Settings transferred to the database through Web applications are specially crafted to modify executable SQL query, for example, an attacker could execute additional query with the first one by adding different symbols to a setting.

An attacker can use the vulnerability to obtain access to data which is normally unavailable or obtain system configuration data which can be used for further attacks. For example, modified query may return hashed user passwords which could be decrypted with brute force attack.

For example, look at the lib\ooz_access.php source code:

Line 136: 
$sql = "SELECT * FROM " . OOZ_SET_TABLE_PREFIX . "users WHERE user_name = '" . $cookieName . "'"; 
$userResult = DB::query($sql, DSN, OOZ_SET_SHOW_SQL);

No filtering for $cookieName variable.

---[How to fix]

Positive Technologies experts recommend to filter user input data
