ZDI-11-307 : Oracle Java MixerSequencer.nAddControllerEventCallback
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-307
October 26, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3545

-- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

-- Affected Vendors:

Oracle



-- Affected Products:

Oracle Java Runtime



-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists because Java does not sufficiently verify
parameters certain functions. The function
MixerSequencer.nAddControllerEventCallback fails to check for negative
index numbers before writing user supplied data into a static array.
This allows a malicious applet to write user controlled data outside the
array boundaries resulting in remote code execution under the context of
the current user.

-- Vendor Response:

Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
