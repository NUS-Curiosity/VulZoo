Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-1452 CVE-2011-3192
Debian Bug     : 639825

The apache2 Upgrade from DSA-2298-1 has caused a regression that
prevented some video players from seeking in video files served by
Apache HTTPD. This update fixes this bug.


The text of the original advisory is reproduced for reference:

Two issues have been found in the Apache HTTPD web server:

CVE-2011-3192

A vulnerability has been found in the way the multiple overlapping
ranges are handled by the Apache HTTPD server. This vulnerability
allows an attacker to cause Apache HTTPD to use an excessive amount of
memory, causing a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1452

A vulnerability has been found in mod_dav that allows an attacker to
cause a daemon crash, causing a denial of service. This issue only
affects the Debian 5.0 oldstable/lenny distribution.


The regression has been fixed in the following packages:

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.2.9-10+lenny11.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.16-6+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed in
version 2.2.20-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.20-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

This update also contains updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which have
been recompiled against the updated apache2 packages. The new version
number for the oldstable distribution is 2.2.6-02-1+lenny6. In the
stable distribution, apache2-mpm-itk has the same version number as
apache2.
