ZDI-11-278: Novell Cloud Manager Insufficient Framework User Validation Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-278

September 2, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-2654

-- CVSS:
9.3, (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Novell

-- Affected Products:
Novell eDirectory

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Cloud Manager. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within how the application implements an RPC
method. Due to incompletely initializing an object, the application will
store a partially initialized session. This partially initialized
session will allow one to make privileged RPC calls to the server. This
can lead to code execution under the context of the service.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
