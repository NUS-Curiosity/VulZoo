Subject: More on IPv6 RA-Guard evasion (IPv6 security)

Folks,

We have posted on the SI6 Networks blog more information about IPv6
RA-Guard evasion, including pointers to the recent presentations at IETF 81.

The post is available at:
http://blog.si6networks.com/2011/09/router-advertisement-guard-ra-guard.html

P.S.: In case you haven't, you may want to join the IPv6 Hackers
mailing-list: http://www.si6networks.com/community/mailing-lists.html

Thanks!

Best regards,
