Subject: Vulnerabilities in trading and SCADA softwares

Considering the current financial and global crysis in which we are
fallen I thought that was enough "funny" to give a quick look at two
particular types of softwares: technical analysis (trading) and SCADA.

The tests have been performed as fast as possible without going deep in
the softwares and spending just some minutes for the majority of the
bugs... a quick disinterested test and nothing else.

The technical analysis softwares are used in the financial and trading
sectors for studying the trend of the market and catching the right
moment to buy and sell for having a profit:

  eSignal

While for the HMI/SCADA, automation and industrial sectors I opted for
some medium/small products:

  Rockwell RSLogix (DoS only)

  Measuresoft ScadaPro (multiple vulnerabilities)
    http://aluigi.org/adv/scadapro_1-adv.txt

  Beckhoff TwinCAT (DoS only)
    http://aluigi.org/adv/twincat_1-adv.txt

  BroadWin WebAccess Client (released over one week ago)
    http://aluigi.org/adv/bwocxrun_1-adv.txt

As already said I performed only a superficial test without wasting time
configuring the softwares or reading manuals and without doing other
checks or analysis so I hope everything is correct although not much
detailed.

If there will be enough interest in these sectors I will release new
vulnerabilities in the next weeks.
