Measuresoft should not stake its security on the hopes that a firewall
is running. There will be plenty of folks who will do dumb things with
it.

Measuresoft should be deploying securely out of the box. Require the
user make manual changes to punch holes in the firewall (or do it for
them after they answer a yes/no with no as the default). Secure out of
the box is a good thing, even if it causes a few immediate hardships.
