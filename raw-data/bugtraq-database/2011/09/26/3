Subject: Hackito Ergo Sum 2012 dates

Hello everyone,

Save the date, Hackito Ergo Sum 2012 will take place in Paris from the
12th April to 14th of April 2012.

As you know, this event is community-driven, not for profit event. We
will try to have a good presentation level, nice challenges and
excellent atmosphere bringing together every side of the hacking and
security research community.

We are open to all good will to help the organize the conference:
organizing workshops, challenges, logistics, organization, speaker
anchor, welcoming, setting up network, art...
If you want to join us, send us an email.

As always, the website for the conference is:

It will be updated as soon as CFP gets out.

There are also many other excellent security conferences in Europe and
elsewhere, if people are interested in a formula such as a cheap "global
conference pass" for students and researchers, we are open to that.

Best regards,
Philippe.
