Finding 1: XML External Entity Injection
CVE: CVE-2011-3579

An external entity is a function of the XML specification which allows XML
documents to reference resources external to the XML document. This
functionality forces the XML parser of the application to access the
resource specified.

In this case it is possible to inject an XML DOCTYPE "SYSTEM" directive to
access local files on the operating system where the IceWarp server is
installed. Using this technique it is possible to retrieve readable files
on the operating system. This attack can also be used to create a possible
denial of service condition.

Proof-of-Concept:

The following POST request was sent to the host A.B.C.D where the IceWarp
mail server was running:

REQUEST
=========
POST /-.._._.--.._1243848280/server/webmail.php HTTP/1.1

RESPONSE:
==========
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: IceWarp/9.4.2
Date: Wed, 20 Jul 2011 10:04:56 GMT
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control:no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0,
pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: text/xml
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Length: 1113

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><iq type="error"><error

....TRUNCATED

The above proof-of-concept would retrieve the c:\windows\win.ini file (the
response in this example has been truncated).


Finding 2: PHP Information Disclosure
CVE: CVE-2011-3580

It is possible to retrieve the PHP information file phpinfo() by accessing
the following URL http://A.B.C.D/server where A.B.C.D is the IP of the
server running the IceWarp software. The response will be a page detailing
the PHP version used and the configuration settings of PHP, including
system details.


Vendor Response: These issues have been addressed as of version 10.3.3

Mail Server in order to address these issues. The above issues have been
