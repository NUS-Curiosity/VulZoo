Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 09.26.11: Novell GroupWise iCal RRULE
 Weekday Recurrence Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 09.26.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Sep 26, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

GroupWise is Novell's messaging platform, and includes support for
email, calendaring, and instant messaging. More information is available
at the following website:

http://www.novell.com/products/groupwise/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in Novell Inc.'s
GroupWise could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the affected service.

This vulnerability is present in the calendar processing code, which
resides within the GroupWise Internet Agent (GWIA) process. The
vulnerability occurs when parsing a malformed calendar recurrence
(RRULE) that recurs on weekdays. A heap based buffer overflow can be
triggered due to the lack of checks to ensure that there is enough space
in the buffer to hold all of the RRULE entry data.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the affected service. On Windows, the GWIA
process runs with SYSTEM privileges. In order to exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker simply needs to send an email to a valid
user, and attach the malicious calendar file to the email. The targeted
user does not need to download or view the email; processing of the iCal
file occurs automatically on the server as soon as the email is received
by the server.

IV. DETECTION

Novell GroupWise 8.0x up to (and including) 8.02HP2 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.
