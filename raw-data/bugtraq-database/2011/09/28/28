Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Smart Install Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110928-smart-install

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 September 28 1600 UTC (GMT)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability exists in the Smart Install feature of Cisco Catalyst
Switches running Cisco IOS Software that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform remote code execution on
the affected device.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability
other than disabling the Smart Install feature.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-smart-install.shtml.

Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories. Nine of the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that
correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as
well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities
in the September 2011 Bundled Publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual
Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the

Affected Products
=================

This vulnerability only affects Cisco Catalyst Switches and Cisco
Integrated Services Routers with the Smart Install feature enabled.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Devices configured as a Smart Install client or director are affected
by this vulnerability. To display Smart Install information, use the
"show vstack config" privileged EXEC command on the Smart Install
director or client. The outputs of the show commands are different
when entered on the director or on the client. The following is the
output of the "show vstack config" in a device configured as a Smart
Install client:

    switch#show vstack config
     Role: Client
     Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.163

The following is the output of the "show vstack config" in a Cisco
Catalyst Switch configured as a Smart Install director:

    Director# show vstack config

    Role: Director
     Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.163
     Vstack Mode: Basic
     Vstack default management vlan: 1
     Vstack management Vlans: none
     Vstack Config file: tftp://10.1.1.100/default-config.txt
     Vstack Image file: tftp://10.1.1.100/c3750e-universalk9-tar.122-
     Join Window Details:
             Window: Open (default)
             Operation Mode: auto (default)
     Vstack Backup Details:
             Mode: On (default)
             Repository: flash:/vstack (default)

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of
C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

    Router> show version
    Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

naming conventions is available in the white paper Cisco
IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide available at
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Smart Install is a plug-and-play configuration and image-management
feature that provides zero-touch deployment for new switches and
Cisco Integrated Services Routers. This means that a customer can
ship a device to a location, place it in the network and power it on
with no configuration required on the device.

A vulnerability exists in the Smart Install feature of Cisco Catalyst
Switches running Cisco IOS Software that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform remote code execution on
the affected device. Smart Install uses TCP port 4786 for
communication. An established TCP connection with a completed TCP
three-way handshake is needed to be able to trigger this
vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCto10165, and
has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
CVE-2011-3271.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability
other than disabling the Smart Install feature. The Smart Install
Feature is enabled by default in client switches. No configuration is
needed in client switches.

If Smart Install feature is not required, and the device supports
the configuration command "no vstack" as introduced by Cisco Bug
ID CSCtj75729, then disabling Smart Install, with the "no vstack"
configuration command mitigates this vulnerability.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the
network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion
document for this advisory, which is available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20110928-smart-install.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be
bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
