Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Network Address
Translation Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110928-nat

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 Sep 28 1600 UTC (GMT)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Cisco IOS Software network address translation (NAT) feature
contains multiple denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities in the
translation of the following protocols:

  * NetMeeting Directory (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol,
    LDAP)
  * Session Initiation Protocol (Multiple vulnerabilities)
  * H.323 protocol

All the vulnerabilities described in this document are caused by
packets in transit on the affected devices when those packets require
application layer translation.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-nat.shtml.

Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories. Nine of the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that
correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as
well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities
in the September 2011 Bundled Publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual
Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable when
they are configured for NAT and contain support for one or more of
the following features:

  * NetMeeting Directory NAT (LDAP on TCP port 389)
  * NAT for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  * NAT for H.323

The preferred method to verify whether NAT is enabled on a Cisco IOS
device is to log in to the device and issue the "show ip nat
statistics" command. If NAT is active the sections Outside interfaces
and Inside interfaces will each include at least one interface. The
following example shows a device on which the NAT feature is active:

    Router#show ip nat statistics

    Total translations: 2 (0 static, 2 dynamic; 0 extended)
    Outside interfaces: Serial0
    Inside interfaces: Ethernet1
    Hits: 135  Misses: 5
    Expired translations: 2
    Dynamic mappings:
    -- Inside Source
    access-list 1 pool mypool refcount 2
     pool mypool: netmask 255.255.255.0
            start 192.168.10.1 end 192.168.10.254
            type generic, total addresses 14, allocated 2 (14%), misses 0

Depending on the Cisco IOS Software release, the interface lists can
be in the lines following the Outside interfaces and Inside
interfaces lines. In releases that support the section filter on show
commands, the administrator can determine whether NAT is active by
using the "show ip nat statistics | section interfaces" command:

    Router> show ip nat statistics | section interfaces
    Outside interfaces:
      GigabitEthernet0/0
    Inside interfaces:
      GigabitEthernet0/1
    Router>

Alternatively, to determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco
IOS Software configuration, either the "ip nat inside" and "ip nat
outside" commands must be present in different interfaces or, in the
case of the NAT Virtual Interface, the "ip nat enable" interface command
will be present.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco
product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the "show
version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco
IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by
"Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices
do not have the "show version" command or may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of
C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

    Router> show version
    Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Reference Guide.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

NAT for NetMeeting Directory (LDAP) Vulnerability
+------------------------------------------------

LDAP is a protocol for querying and modifying data of directory
services implemented in IP networks. NAT for NetMeeting Directory,
also known as the Internet Locator Service (ILS), translates LDAP
packets on TCP port 389. The inspected port is not configurable.

This vulnerability is triggered by malformed transit LDAP traffic
that needs to be processed by the NAT for NetMeeting Directory
feature.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtd10712 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-0946.

NAT for SIP DoS Vulnerabilities
+------------------------------

Four vulnerabilities in the NAT for SIP feature are described in this
document:

NAT of SIP over TCP vulnerability: Crafted SIP packets on TCP port
5060 could cause unpredictable results, including the reload of the
vulnerable device. Translation of SIP over TCP packets will be disabled
by default with the fix for this vulnerability. This vulnerability is
documented in Cisco bug ID CSCso02147 and has been assigned Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE-2011-3276.

Provider edge Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) NAT of SIP over UDP
packets DoS vulnerability: A malformed SIP packet on UDP 5060 that
transits an MPLS enabled vulnerable device that needs an MPLS tag
to be imposed on the malformed packet might reload the device. This
vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCti98219 and has been
assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3279.

NAT of crafted SIP over UDP packets DoS vulnerabilities: There are two
DoS vulnerabilities related to similar crafted packets on UDP port 5060
that require SIP translation: the first is a vulnerability that will
cause the device to reload and the second will cause a memory leak
that could lead to a DoS condition, including reload of the vulnerable
device. The NAT of SIP vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug ID
CSCti48483 and Cisco bug ID CSCtj04672. They have been assigned CVE IDs
CVE-2011-3278 and CVE-2011-3280.

NAT of H.323 Packets DoS Vulnerability
+-------------------------------------

Transit crafted H.323 packets on TCP port 1720 could cause a reload of
the vulnerable device. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID
CSCth11006 and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) ID CVE-2011-3277.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can cause the device
to reload or become unresponsive. For the NAT of UDP over SIP
vulnerability that corresponds to Cisco bug CSCtj04672, it is also
possible that exploitation can cause a memory leak. Repeated
exploitation of the memory leak vulnerability can lead to a DoS
condition in which the device reloads or becomes unresponsive.
Reloading may occur automatically, or the device may require manual
intervention to reload.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Additionally, the Cisco IOS Software Checker is available on
the Cisco Security Intelligence Operations (SIO) portal at
http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x. It provides
several features for checking which Security Advisories affect specified
versions of Cisco IOS Software.

Cisco IOS Software
+-----------------

Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a
Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the
earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed

in the September 2011 bundled publication.

Workarounds
===========

It is possible to mitigate the vulnerabilities in this advisory by
disabling the translation of embedded IP addresses in the payload of
IP packets. Disabling NAT for the different protocols requires
different configurations. For some protocols, a single command can be
used. Other protocols require individual NAT translation rules be
added to the configuration.

NAT LDAP Vulnerability Mitigation
+---------------------------------

To disable NAT of LDAP, port-based address translation needs to be
configured to disable LDAP inspection using the no-payload keyword.
This will still allow the NAT of LDAP packets at Layer 3 (non-port
specific). Translation of other non-LDAP protocols translation will
not be affected. Applications that use embedded IP addresses in LDAP,
such as NetMeeting Directory, will be negatively impacted if the
embedded IP addresses need to be translated.

The following is an example configuration that includes the
mitigation for two NAT rules.


    !-- NAT rule for port TCP/389 to disable IP NAT for LDAP translation
    !-- Takes precedence over the non-port translation rule.

    ip nat outside source static tcp 192.168.0.1 389 192.168.1.1 389 no-payload
    ip nat outside source static tcp 192.168.0.3 389 192.168.1.3 389 no-payload

    !-- Translation rule for all other protocols

    ip nat outside source static 192.168.0.1 192.168.1.1
    ip nat outside source static 192.168.0.3 192.168.1.3

    interface GigabitEthernet0/0
      ip nat inside

    interface GigabitEthernet0/1
      ip nat outside

Each NAT translation rule in the configuration will need to be
updated to include a per-port rule that disables translation of TCP
packets on port 389.

NAT for SIP over TCP DoS Vulnerability Mitigation
+------------------------------------------------

Mitigation for this vulnerability consists of disabling NAT for SIP
over the TCP transport by using the "no ip nat service sip tcp port
5060" global configuration command.

NAT of Crafted SIP over UDP Packets DoS Vulnerability Mitigation
+---------------------------------------------------------------

Mitigation of these vulnerabilities consists of disabling NAT for SIP
over the UDP transport by using the "no ip nat service sip udp port
5060" global configuration command.

NAT for Crafted H.323 Packets DoS Vulnerability Mitigation
+---------------------------------------------------------

Mitigation for this vulnerability consists of disabling NAT for H.323
and H.225.0 using the "no ip nat service h225" global configuration
command.
