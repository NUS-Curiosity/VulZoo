Hi Adam, 

I'm afraid you don't fully understand the issue. This is not about placing your own
DLL on a local machine so that a chosen application will load it (i.e., user
"attacking" an application on his own computer). It is about an application running
on your computer silently grabbing a malicious DLL from attacker-controlled location
- possibly on a remote share - and executing its code (i.e., attacker with zero
privileges on user's computer executing code on that computer).

I hope this helps a little.

Cheers,
Mitja
