In addition, this looks like it could be ripe for abuse (if it is true):
   Even more interesting is the fact that you can specify a
   UNC path in the import section of the PE file. If we specify
   \\66.93.68.6\z as the name of the imported DLL, the Windows
   loader will try to download the DLL file from our web server.
