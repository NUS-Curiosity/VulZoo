Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 09.13.11: Adobe Reader and Acrobat JPEG
 Processing Use After Free Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 09.13.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Sep 13, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Reader and Acrobat are portable document format (PDF) readers and
processors. For more information, please visit the following pages:
http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a use after free vulnerability in Adobe Systems
Inc.'s Reader could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs when parsing a JPEG file embedded inside a PDF
file. When processing specific JPEG markers, Adobe Reader creates an
object on the stack and keeps a pointer to that object in another place.
The pointer is later dereferenced after the object on the stack becomes
invalid. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user opening the file. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker needs to use social engineering techniques to
trick a user into opening a malicious PDF file. Since PDF files can be
embedded into Web pages and parsed without interaction by default, an
attacker can exploit this vulnerability as a typical browser
vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION
