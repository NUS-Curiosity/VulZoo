Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 09.13.11: Microsoft Excel Record Memory
 Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 09.13.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Sep 13, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Excel is the spreadsheet application included with Microsoft Corp.'s
Office productivity software suite. More information is available at the
following website:

http://office.microsoft.com/excel/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Excel could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs when Excel parses a certain specially crafted
record in an Excel file. An invalid value of the length field in the
record header can trigger an error condition and result in using memory
content which has already been freed and may allow arbitrary code
execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user opening the file. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious
file. Attackers typically accomplish this by e-mailing a targeted user
the file or hosting the file on a Web page.
