Package        : python-django
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0696 CVE-2011-0697

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the django web development
framework:

CVE-2011-0696

    For several reasons the internal CSRF protection was not used to
    validate ajax requests in the past. However, it was discovered that
    this exception can be exploited with a combination of browser plugins
    and redirects and thus is not sufficient.

CVE-2011-0697

    It was discovered that the file upload form is prone to cross-site
    scripting attacks via the file name.

It is important to note that this update introduces minor backward
incompatibilities due to the fixes for the above issues.
For the exact details, please see:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/releases/1.2.5/
and in particular the "Backwards incompatible changes" section.
