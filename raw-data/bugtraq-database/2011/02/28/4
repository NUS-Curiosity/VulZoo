Debian Bug     : 603436

It was discovered that pam-pgsql, a PAM module to authenticate using
a PostgreSQL database, was vulnerable to a buffer overflow in supplied
IP-addresses.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.3-2+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.1-4+squeeze1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pam-pgsql packages.
