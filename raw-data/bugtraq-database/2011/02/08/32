ZDI-11-063: Microsoft Visio 2007 LZW Stream Decompression Exception Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-063

February 8, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0092

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Other

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Visio. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Visio handles parsing the
VisioDocument stream. Upon handling a malformed stream, the application
will raise an exception. While handling this exception, the application
will access the vtable of an object that hasn't been completely
initialized yet. Successful exploitation could lead to code execution
under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
