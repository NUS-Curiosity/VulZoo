-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The flaw occurs when parsing a document with a malformed Excel document.
When parsing an office art object, the application will add the
malformed object to a linked list. After this addition, the application
will process each element in the linked list. When handling the object
in question, the application will explicitly trust a function pointer
off of this object. If an attacker can substitute an object of their
choosing in place of this function pointer, code execution under the
context of the application can be achieved.
