Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the eTrust Common Services Transport
(ECSQdmn.exe) running on port 1882. When making a request to this
service a user supplied DWORD value is used in a memory copy operation.

calculated leading to a heap overflow. If successfully exploited this
vulnerability will result in a remote system compromise with SYSTEM
credentials.
