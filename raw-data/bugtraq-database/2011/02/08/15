-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems with vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Domino.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the nrouter.exe service while processing
a malformed calendar meeting request. The process copies the contents of
the name parameter within the Content-Type header into a fixed size
stack buffer. By providing enough data this buffer can overflow leading
to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.
