-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Excel 2007. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the application's support for the office
drawing file format. When parsing shape data within a particular
container, the application will add a reference to an object to a linked
list. If an error occurs during parsing, the application will free each
element yet fail to remove the reference. Afterward, the application
will use this reference. This can lead to code execution under the
context of the application.
