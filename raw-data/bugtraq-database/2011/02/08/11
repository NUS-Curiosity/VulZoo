-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems with vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Domino.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the NRouter service while transporting
malformed e-mails. The vulnerable code copies data from the ATTACH:CID
and Content-ID headers within an e-mail into a fixed length stack
buffer. By providing a large enough file name, this buffer can overflow
leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM
user.
