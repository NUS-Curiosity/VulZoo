Subject: Troopers11 - Security Conference in Germany

We want to announce TROOPERS11, Europe's premium IT Security event. The conference features international top guys/girls, spends a lot of attention to ensure the best experience for every participant and saves a lot on lame marketing presentations, shabby conference sites and overall profit oriented rip-off. You'll like the concept :)
