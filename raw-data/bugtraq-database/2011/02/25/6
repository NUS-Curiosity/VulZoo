Subject: Re: Linksys Cisco Wag120N CSRF Vulnerability

I would like to recommend to people who want to test the code to disable/wipe out unnecessary options such as "remote_management" and "http_wanport" since they could give eventual outside attacker chances of authentication.

Another doubt lies on the possibility that this code implictly relies on a previous form of authentication for being effective.
