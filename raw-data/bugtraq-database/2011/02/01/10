-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Symantec IM Manager. Authentication is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that a logged in user must be
coerced into visiting a malicious link.

The specific flaw exists within the ScheduleTask method exposed by the
IMAdminSchedTask.asp page hosted on the web interface. This function
does not properly sanitize user input from a POST variable before
passing it to an eval call. An attacker can abuse this to inject and
execute arbitrary ASP under the context of the user visiting the
malicious link.

-- Vendor Response:
Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
