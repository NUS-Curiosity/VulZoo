ZDI-11-035: IBM DB2 db2dasrrm validateUser Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-035

January 31, 2011

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
IBM

-- Affected Products:
IBM DB2 Universal Database

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM DB2. Authentication is not required to
exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the db2dasrrm process responsible for
handling queries to the com.ibm.db2.das.core.DasSysCmd function. While
processing a request, the username supplied is copied into a
fixed-length stack buffer. By providing a large enough string the copy
operation can overflow leading to remote code execution.

-- Vendor Response:
IBM states:
v9.1 fp10	
IC69986  https://www-304.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IC66811
