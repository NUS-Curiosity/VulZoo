ZDI-11-073: Adobe Reader ICC Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-073

February 8, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0598

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Reader

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within the ICC parsing component of ACE.dll. It is
possible to cause an integer overflow due to several multiplications of
controlled byte values. This leads to the allocation of a small buffer
which can subsequently be overflowed. A remote attacker can exploit this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user
running Reader.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
