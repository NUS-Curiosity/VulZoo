ZDI-11-071: Adobe Reader BMP RLE_8 Decompression Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-071

February 8, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0596

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Reader

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within the Bitmap parsing component of 2d.dll. When
allocating a destination buffer for handling RLE_8 compressed bitmaps
the process uses the bitmap height and width values directly. Certain
assumptions are made regarding minimum values of these fields during
decompression resulting in a copy user supplied data into a fixed-length
buffer on the heap. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the user.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
