TPTI-11-03: Adobe Shockwave Font Xtra String Decoding Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-11-03

February 8, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0556

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the Font Xtra.x32 asset module
responsible for parsing font structures within Director movie files
(.dir). When parsing data within the PFR1 chunk, the process implicitly
sign-extends a 16-bit size value and seeks pointers accordingly. It then
operates upon the data it has reached which can be abused by an attacker
to corrupt memory and subsequently execute arbitrary code under the
context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
