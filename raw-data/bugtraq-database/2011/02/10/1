Subject: RE: Microsoft Terminal Services vulnerable to MITM-attacks.

If someone 0wns your pipe between you and the Terminal Server(s) then
you got bigger problems then the existing MITM attack. Whether the
attack sets it up via ARP spoofing, or other trickery. 

If you are really worried about this, encrypt your communications via
IPSEC.

Depends on the configuration. Unless configured to require network level
authentication, RDP is still prone to MitM attacks AFAIK.
