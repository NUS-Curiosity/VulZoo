Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following Cisco TelePresence endpoint systems that are running an
affected version of software are vulnerable: Cisco TelePresence
System 500 Series, 1300 Series, 3000 Series, and 3200 Series and
Cisco TelePresence System 1000 and 1100.

To determine the current version of software that is running on the
endpoint, access the device via SSH and issue the show version
command. The output should resemble the following example. The
version that is active on the system will be marked by an asterisk
character (*).

    admin: show version
    primary
       Factory   CTS 1.4.2(2194)
      *Slot 1    CTS 1.7.1(4750) P1
       Slot 2    CTS 1.6.2(2835) P1
    admin:

In the preceding example, the system has versions 1.4.2, 1.6.2, and
1.7.1 loaded on the device and version 1.7.1 is currently active. A
device is affected only by vulnerabilities that are present in the
active software version.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco TelePresence solution allows for immersive, in-person
communication and collaboration over the network with colleagues,
prospects, and partners even when they are located in opposite
hemispheres.

This security advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities in
affected software versions that are running on Cisco TelePresence
endpoint devices.

Unauthenticated CGI Access

Multiple CGI command injection vulnerabilities exist in Cisco
TelePresence endpoint devices that could allow a remote,
authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated
privileges. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must submit
a malformed request to an affected device via TCP port 8082.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * Cisco TelePresence endpoint - CSCtb31640 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0372

CGI Command Injection

Multiple CGI command injection vulnerabilities exist in Cisco
TelePresence endpoint devices that could allow a remote,
authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated
privileges. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must submit
a malformed request to an affected device via TCP port 443.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit these vulnerabilities:

  * Cisco TelePresence endpoint - CSCtb31685 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0373.
  * Cisco TelePresence endpoint - CSCtb31659 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0374.
  * Cisco TelePresence endpoint - CSCth24671 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0375.

TFTP Information Disclosure

An information disclosure vulnerability exists within Cisco
TelePresence endpoint devices that could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to retrieve sensitive authentication and
configuration information. The attacker would need to have the
ability to submit a TFTP GET request via UDP port 69 to the affected
device.

Because the vulnerability is within a UDP based service, the attacker
would not be required to perform a handshake prior to making the
crafted request. However, due to the fact that this is an information
disclosure issue the attacker would need to supply a valid return IP
address to retrieve the information.

  * Cisco TelePresence endpoint - CSCte43876 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0376.

Malicious IP Address Injection

A denial of service vulnerability exists within Cisco TelePresence
endpoint devices that could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker
to cause a denial of service condition. An attacker with the ability
to impersonate a Cisco TelePresence Manager system could remotely
inject an invalid IP address into a configuration file that could
cause a critical service on the device to crash. An endpoint affected
by this issue will remain unusable until it has been manually
restored to a known good state. Restoration of service may require an
administrator to reload software on the affected device. The attacker
would need the ability to submit a malformed SOAP request to an
affected device via TCP port 8081 or TCP port 9501.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * Cisco TelePresence endpoint - CSCth03605 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0377.

XML-RPC Command Injection

An XML-RPC command injection vulnerability exists with Cisco
TelePresence endpoint devices. This issue could allow an
unauthenticated attacker with access to the broadcast domain of the
affected device to execute arbitrary commands with elevated
privileges. The attacker would need the ability to submit a request
to an affected system via TCP port 61441 or TCP port 61445.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability. The issue may require
that the attacker perform an ARP spoofing or other form of
impersonation attack.

  * Cisco TelePresence endpoint - CSCtb52587 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0378.

Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Cisco TelePresence
endpoint devices. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated,
adjacent attacker to trigger a buffer overflow condition. To exploit
this vulnerability, the attacker must submit a malicious Cisco
Discovery Protocol packet to an affected system.

Because Cisco Discovery Protocol functions at the Data-Link (L2)
layer, an attacker must submit an Ethernet frame directly to an
affected device. This scenario may be possible when affected systems
are part of a bridged network or connected to a nonpartitioned device
such as a network hub.

  * Cisco TelePresence endpoint - CSCtd75754 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0379.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------
