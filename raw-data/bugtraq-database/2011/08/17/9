-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses a frame
within an H.264 encoded movie. When processing a particular set of flags
of a structure, the application will use a length that is defined within
the structure to copy data into a statically sized buffer on the stack.
Due to the application failing to check the bounds of this length, the
application will write outside the bounds of the buffer which can lead
to code execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
