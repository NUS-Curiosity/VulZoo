-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way QuickTime handles corrupt Sample
Size atoms. When the value for 'Number of Entries' in this atom differs
from the 'Number of Entries' in the Time-To-Sample atom, QuickTime will
fill the Atom Sample Table with uninitialized data read from memory.
This can later on result in a heap overflow when the data is used to
calculate a loop counter to fill a heap buffer.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
