-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Nortel Media Application Server.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The flaw exists within the cstore.exe component which listens by default
on TCP port 52005. When handling a CONTENT_STORE_ADMIN_REQ packet type
the process trusts length value provided by the 'cs_anams' parameter and
blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the
stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Nortel has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
