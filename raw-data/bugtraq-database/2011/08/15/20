Subject: INSECT Pro - Exploit EChat Server <= v2.5 20110812 - Remote Buffer
 Overflow Exploit

Information
--------------------
Name : EChat Server <= v2.5
Software : E Chat Server
Vendor Homepage : http://www.echatserver.com/
Vulnerability Type : Remote Buffer Overflow Exploit
Severity : High
Researcher : Juan Sacco (Runlvl) <jsacco [at] insecurityresearch [dot] com>

Description
------------------

EChat Server is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability
because it fails to perform adequate boundary-checks on user-supplied
data.
Successfully exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed
exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.


Exploit example as follow
