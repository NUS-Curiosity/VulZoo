ZDI-11-253: Adobe Flash Player BitmapData.scroll Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-253

August 12, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-2138

-- CVSS:
7.5, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Flash Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for evaluating the
scroll method of the Actionscript Bitmap class. The function that uses
the parameters to the scroll method performs arithmetic using data from
the instantiated Bitmap object. By creating a Bitmap with certain
integer values and subsequently calling the scroll method with other
large integer values it is possible to force an integer wrap to occur.
The resulting value is utilized to calculate a pointer which is operated
upon by memory copy operations. By crafting specific values this issue
can be exploited to execute remote code in the context of the user
running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
