Package        : nss
Vulnerability  : comprimised certificate authority
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : not available

Several unauthorised SSL certificates have been found in the wild issued
for the DigiNotar Certificate Authority, obtained through a security 
compromise with said company. Debian, like other software
distributors, has as a precaution decided to disable the DigiNotar
Root CA by default in the NSS crypto libraries.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-0lenny5.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.8-1+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.11-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
