-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of EMC AutoStart. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the Agent Service (ftAgent.exe). The Agent
Service listens on TCP port 8045 for communications between AutoStart
nodes. When handling messages with opcode 0x11 the process performs
arithmetic on an unvalidated user-supplied value used to determine the
size of a new heap buffer, allowing a potential integer wrap to cause a
heap buffer overflow. Remote unauthenticated attackers can exploit this
vulnerability by sending malformed message packets to the target, which
can ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the
SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
EMC has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More

exploit code. Instead, upon notifying the affected product vendor,
TippingPoint provides its customers with zero day protection through
its intrusion prevention technology. Explicit details regarding the
specifics of the vulnerability are not exposed to any parties until
an official vendor patch is publicly available. Furthermore, with the
altruistic aim of helping to secure a broader user base, TippingPoint
provides this vulnerability information confidentially to security
vendors (including competitors) who have a vulnerability protection or
mitigation product.
