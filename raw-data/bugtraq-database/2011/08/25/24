-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of EMC AutoStart High Availability.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the packet error handling of the
application. When building an error message to log an error, the
application will use a user-supplied string from the packet as an
argument to a function containing a format string. The result of this
function is written to a statically sized buffer located on the stack.
This will lead to code execution under the context of the service.

-- Vendor Response:
EMC has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
