Subject: SQL-Ledger patch update for SQL injection

Hi all;

We have been informed that SQL-Ledger 2.8.34 has in fact been released
patching the security hole previously reported in LedgerSMB 1.2.24 and
Lower.  This is an SQL injection issue.

I haven't been been able to find a CVE listing for this yet.  Secunia
has assigned this the id of SA45649 for LedgerSMB.  I expect to send a
full disclosure email discussing the vulnerability in a week.

Best Wishes,
Chris Travers
