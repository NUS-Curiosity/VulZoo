Package        : proftpd-dfsg
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4130
Debian Bug     : 648373

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in ProFTPD, an FTP server:

	ProFTPD incorrectly uses data from an unencrypted input buffer
	after encryption has been enabled with STARTTLS, an issue
	similar to CVE-2011-0411.

CVE-2011-4130
	ProFTPD uses a response pool after freeing it under
	exceptional conditions, possibly leading to remote code
	execution.  (The version in lenny is not affected by this
	problem.)

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-17lenny8.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.3a-6squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.4~rc3-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.
