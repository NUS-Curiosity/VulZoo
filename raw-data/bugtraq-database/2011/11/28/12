- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists when a user attempts to play a malicious video
file containing a malformed codec name. When playing a malformed codec,
the application will incorrectly free an object and then later attempt
to use it by calling a virtual method pointer upon destruction. This can
lead to code execution under the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
