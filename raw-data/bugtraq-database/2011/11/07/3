Package        : man2hhtml
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: yes
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2770

Tim Starling discovered that the Debian-native CGI wrapper for man2html,
a program to convert UNIX man pages to HTML, is not properly escaping
user-supplied input when displaying various error messages.  A remote
attacker can exploit this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks.
