Package        : logwatch
Vulnerability  : shell command injection
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0715
Debian Bug     : 615995

Dominik George discovered that logwatch does not guard against shell
meta-characters in crafted log file names (such as those produced by
Samba).  As a result, an attacker might be able to execute shell
commands on the system running logwatch.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.3.6.cvs20080702-2lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.3.6.cvs20090906-1squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 7.3.6.cvs20090906-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your logwatch packages.
