Vulnerable	Kodak InSite 5.5.2

Kodak InSite is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Kodak InSite 5.5.2 is known to be vulnerable. Other versions may also be vulnerable.

To exploit this issue, an attacker must entice an unsuspecting victim into following a malicious URI, such as the following:

http://SITE/Troubleshooting/DiagnosticReport.asp?HeaderWarning=<script>alert("XSS!")</script>&Language=en&rflp=true#

POST http://SITE/troubleshooting/speedtest.asp
User-Agent= Test";} alert("XSS!"); function a() {//

Kodak report that this issue does not affect the latest version of InSite, available for free with an ongoing support contract.
