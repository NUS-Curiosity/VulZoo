Description
***********
SAP Front End applications (SAPGui.exe) are vulnerable to DLL hijacking attacks. It makes possible to remote code execution.

Details
*******
Attacker can place shortcuts for SAP GUI (.sap) on his share directory. In the same directory he place DLL's with evil code.
Name of DLL will be MFC80RUS.DLL(for Russian systems) or MFC80LOC.DLL for SAPGui.exe. Than attacker get link to shortcut to a victim. When victim try to open shortcuts, SAP application try to load it DLL's from working dir that is attacker share directory. So attacker's DLL's will be loaded by victim and evil code from this libraries will be executed. It is because SAPGui.exe and BExAnalyzer.exe try to find the directory in work path before system directories.
