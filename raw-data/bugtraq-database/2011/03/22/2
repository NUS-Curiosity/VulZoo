the vendors of the affected softwares have not been contacted.

in the security field a public vulnerability is a dead vulnerability,
anyone who has found and released at least one security bug in his life
knows it and knows to what I refer.

90% of the job of fixing a bug is just finding it first, I have even
showed the details, the causes and the ways to replicate them.

I have done it in the exact moment that I have uploaded my advisories on
my website making anyone aware of the problems, included the same
vendors that now can fix them.
