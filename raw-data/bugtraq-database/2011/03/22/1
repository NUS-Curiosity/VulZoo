At what point in time did you try contacting any of the vendors for
these issues?

Analogy: Car owner has his car speed up ending up in almost near
catastrophe. Car owner goes to media outlets condemning the
manufacturer: "How could you be so reckless! Thousand of lives..."
Reality: Car manufacturer was never made aware of the issue. How do you
propose a manufacturer fix an issue?

Where in any of your advisories did you take the time to let a company
know: "hey you guys have some potential issues, here they are!!!"
