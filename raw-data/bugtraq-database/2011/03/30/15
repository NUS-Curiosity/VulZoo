Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Secure Access Control System Unauthorized
Password Change Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110330-acs

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 March 30 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability exists in some Cisco Secure Access Control System
(ACS) versions that could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to
change the password of any user account to any value without
providing the account's previous password. Successful exploitation
requires the user account to be defined on the internal identity
store.

This vulnerability does not allow an attacker to perform any other
changes to the ACS database. That is, an attacker cannot change
access policies, device properties, or any account attributes except
the user password.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110330-acs.shtml.

Details
=======

Cisco Secure ACS operates as a centralized RADIUS and TACACS+ server,
combining user authentication, user and administrator device access
control, and policy control into a centralized identity networking
solution.

A vulnerability exists in some Cisco Secure ACS versions that could
allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to change the password of
any user account to any value without providing the account's
previous password. Successful exploitation requires the user account
to be defined on the internal identity store.

This vulnerability cannot be used to change the password for the
following types of users accounts:

  * User accounts that are defined on external identity stores such
    as a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server, a
    Microsoft Active Directory server, an RSA SecurID server, or an
    external RADIUS server
  * System administrator accounts for the Cisco Secure ACS server
    itself that have been configured through the web-based interface
  * Users accounts for the Cisco Secure ACS server itself that have
    been configured through the "username <username> password <password>"
    CLI command

This vulnerability does not allow an attacker to perform any other
changes to the ACS database. That is, an attacker cannot change
access policies, device properties, or any user attributes except the
user password.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtl77440 and has been
assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0951.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

    Integrity Impact -         Partial
    Availability Impact -      None

CVSS Temporal Score - 4.4
    Exploitability -           High
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed


Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker
to change the password of any user account that is defined on the
internal identity store. After the password has been changed, an
attacker could use those credentials to impersonate the user. Because
the user would not know the new password, the attacker could also
prevent a user from authenticating.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

This vulnerability is first fixed in the following Cisco Secure ACS
software patches:

  * Cisco Secure ACS version 5.1
    File 5-1-0-44-6.tar.gpg - ACS 5.1.0.44 cumulative patch 6
  * Cisco Secure ACS version 5.2
    File 5-2-0-26-3.tar.gpg - ACS 5.2.0.26 cumulative patch 3

These Cisco Secure ACS patches can be downloaded
from the Software Center on Cisco.com by visiting
http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html. The patches are
accessible using the following paths:

  * "Security > Identity Management > Cisco Secure Access Control
    System > Cisco Secure Access Control System 5.1"
  * "Security > Identity Management > Cisco Secure Access Control
    System > Cisco Secure Access Control System 5.2"

Workarounds
===========

There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

The attack surface can be limited by allowing only a known, limited
set of management stations to access the Cisco Secure ACS web-based
management interface. Those access control rules can be configured on
the device itself by following the instructions in the "Configuring
Administrator Access Settings" section of the "Managing System
Administrators" chapter of the Cisco Secure ACS User Guide, which is
available at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/net_mgmt/cisco_secure_access_control_system/5.1/user/guide/admin_admin.html#wp1069174

Cisco Secure ACS provides an optional User Change Password (UCP) web
service. Customers can implement the UCP functionality through either
a web-based front-end application or a scripting interface. In either
case, the computer that offers the UCP services to clients needs
access to TCP port 443 on the ACS server in order to perform such
password changes. Because this access would allow exploitation of the
vulnerability described in this advisory, both of the following
recommendations apply:

  * Stop providing UCP services

  * Do not include any computer that offers UCP services (either
    web-based or scripted) in the set of management stations that are
    allowed to access the ACS server

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be
bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------
