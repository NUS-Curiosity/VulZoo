Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 03.02.11: Apple  CoreGraphics Library
 Heap Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.02.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 02, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Apple's CoreGraphics library is an API used to create and manipulate
graphical elements. This API is used by many Apple applications,
including the Safari browser on both Windows and Mac OS X.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap memory corruption vulnerability in Apple
Inc.'s CoreGraphics library could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. </br></br>

This vulnerability occurs during the processing of an embedded
International Color Consortium (ICC) profile within a JPEG image. A
small block of heap memory may be allocated for processing certain
profile data. An index value is used to reference locations within this
heap block. The index value can be manipulated in a manner that results
in multiple memory writes to locations outside the bounds of the heap
allocated block. This condition may lead to arbitrary code execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the JPEG image. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious JPEG image.
An attacker typically accomplishes this via social engineering or
injecting content into compromised, trusted sites. After the user
visits the malicious Web page, no further user interaction is needed.

IV. DETECTION

Apple iTunes versions prior to 10.2 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of an effective workaround for this
vulnerability, as it is not possible to disable the CoreGraphics
Framework without major functionality loss.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Apple Inc. has released patches which addresses this issue. For more
