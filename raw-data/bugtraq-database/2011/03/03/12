Subject: [USN-1080-2] Linux kernel vulnerabilities

===========================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1080-2            March 02, 2011
linux-ec2 vulnerabilities
CVE-2010-3865, CVE-2010-3875, CVE-2010-3876, CVE-2010-3877,
CVE-2010-3880, CVE-2010-4248, CVE-2010-4343, CVE-2010-4346,
CVE-2010-4526, CVE-2010-4527, CVE-2010-4649, CVE-2011-1044
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

This advisory also applies to the corresponding versions of
Kubuntu, Edubuntu, and Xubuntu.

The problem can be corrected by upgrading your system to the
following package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  linux-image-2.6.32-313-ec2      2.6.32-313.26

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If
you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as
well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you
manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,
linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically
perform this as well.

Details follow:

USN-1080-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. This update provides
the corresponding updates for the Linux kernel for use with EC2.

Original advisory details:

 Thomas Pollet discovered that the RDS network protocol did not check
 certain iovec buffers. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the
 system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user. (CVE-2010-3865)
 
 Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel X.25 implementation did
 not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to
 read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3875)
 
 Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel sockets implementation did
 not properly initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit
 this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
 (CVE-2010-3876)
 
 Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the TIPC interface did not correctly
 initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read
 kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3877)
 
 Nelson Elhage discovered that the Linux kernel IPv4 implementation did not
 properly audit certain bytecodes in netlink messages. A local attacker
 could exploit this to cause the kernel to hang, leading to a denial of
 service. (CVE-2010-3880)
 
 It was discovered that multithreaded exec did not handle CPU timers
 correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading
 to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4248)
 
 Krishna Gudipati discovered that the bfa adapter driver did not correctly
 initialize certain structures. A local attacker could read files in /sys to
 crash the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4343)
 
 Tavis Ormandy discovered that the install_special_mapping function could
 bypass the mmap_min_addr restriction. A local attacker could exploit this
 to mmap 4096 bytes below the mmap_min_addr area, possibly improving the
 chances of performing NULL pointer dereference attacks. (CVE-2010-4346)
 
 It was discovered that the ICMP stack did not correctly handle certain
 unreachable messages. If a remote attacker were able to acquire a socket
 lock, they could send specially crafted traffic that would crash the
 system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4526)
 
 Dan Rosenberg discovered that the OSS subsystem did not handle name
 termination correctly. A local attacker could exploit this crash the system
 or gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-4527)
 
 Dan Carpenter discovered that the Infiniband driver did not correctly
 handle certain requests. A local user could exploit this to crash the
 system or potentially gain root privileges. (CVE-2010-4649, CVE-2011-1044)
