-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Data Protector. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the DBServer.exe process which listens
by default on TCP port 19813. While parsing a request, the process
trusts a user-supplied 32-bit length value and uses it within a memory
operation. By specifying large enough values in a packet sent to the
service, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code under the context
of the SYSTEM user.

a patch in accordance with the ZDI 180 day deadline.

-- Mitigations:
To mitigate this vulnerability an administrator could restrict
communication with this service to known client IP addresses.
