That's fine, but the controversy around the proper mode of disclosure
is here to stay. For every good argument you make, there is an equally
compelling counter-argument that other reasonable people believe in
good faith. It really comes down to personal beliefs, and nothing has
changed here in the past 15 years or so.

Any of us can disagree, but lashing out against other people seems
first of all impolite, and second, somewhat amusing on this particular
forum.
