Package        : tex-common
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitization
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1400

Mathias Svensson discovered that tex-common, a package shipping a number
of scripts and configuration files necessary for TeX, contains insecure
settings for the "shell_escape_commands" directive.  Depending on the
scenario, this may result in arbitrary code execution when a victim is
tricked into processing a malicious tex-file or this is done in an
automated fashion.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem due
to shell_escape being disabled.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.08.1.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your tex-common packages.
