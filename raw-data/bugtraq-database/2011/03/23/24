Actually they have the choice to not run SCADA systems open to the 
Internet. If they are so critical that you are "playing with fire" like 
you mentioned in another email, why would they be accessible via script 
kiddie attack, or any remote over-the-tubes attack? Running SCADA 
systems open to the entire Internet is what I would call irresponsible.

At this point, it is academic anyway. The cat is out of the bag. Thanks 
Luigi, I at least know about these issues now.
