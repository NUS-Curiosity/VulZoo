Package        : wordpress
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0700 CVE-2011-0701


Two XSS bugs and one potential information disclosure issue were discovered
in wordpress, a weblog manager.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


CVE-2011-0700

  Input passed via the post title when performing a "Quick Edit" or "Bulk Edit"
  action and via the "post_status", "comment_status", and "ping_status"
  parameters is not properly sanitised before being used.
  Certain input passed via tags in the tags meta-box is not properly sanitised
  before being returned to the user.


CVE-2011-0701

  Wordpress incorrectly enforces user access restrictions when accessing posts
  via the media uploader and can be exploited to disclose the contents
  of e.g. private or draft posts.


The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.5+dfsg-0+squeeze1

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 3.0.5+dfsg-1

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
