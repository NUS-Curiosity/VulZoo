Subject: [TEHTRI-Security] Quick BlackBerry Security Check


Gents,

If you are a lucky BlackBerry owner, or an administrator of many BB
devices, you can do a quick security check of your smartphone(s), by
browsing this web page from your device (free quick check):

    http://tehtris.com/bbcheck

For now, this will check for you if you are potentially vulnerable
against those exploits:

-> Nov 2007 - US-CERT Advisory VU#282856 - Exploit from Michael Kemp
   http://www.blackberry.com/btsc/KB12577

-> Jan 2011 - CVE-2010-2599 - Exploit found by TEHTRI-Security
   http://www.blackberry.com/btsc/KB24841

-> Mar 2011 - CVE-2011-1290 - Awesome Pwn2own/CSW exploit from Vincenzo
Iozzo, Ralf Philipp Weinmann, and Willem Pinckaers

A workaround for this latest vulnerability (CVE-2011-1290) could be to
disable JavaScript, as explained on RIM resources.

You should definitely read this: http://www.blackberry.com/btsc/KB26132

Have a nice day,
