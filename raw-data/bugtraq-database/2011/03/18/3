Subject: OWASP AppSec USA 2011 Call for Papers

The OWASP AppSec USA 2011 Call for Papers (CFP) is now open. Visit the
following URL to submit your abstract for the September 22-23, 2011
talks in Minneapolis, Minnesota:

http://www.appsecusa.org/talks.html

We're excited to announce that speakers will be in good company with
our first keynote, OWASP founder Mark Curphey, who will run with the
theme of Community - The Killer App, much in the spirit of recent SXSW
keynote Christopher Poole (see
http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/03/christopher-moot-poole/).

The CFP will close June 14, 2011. We look forward to talk submissions
over the coming months from security practitioners, researchers,
thought leaders, and developers in the following content areas:

* Cloud Security
* Mobile Security
* Secure SDLC
* OWASP Projects (turbo talks)
* Software & Architecture Patterns for Security
* Software Development Platform Tutorials
* New Attacks & Defenses
* Thought Leadership (executive panels, interviews, and speeches)

Speakers will receive free admission (nontransferable) to the
conference in return for delivering a 50 minute talk or for delivering
a 25 minute OWASP Projects turbo talk.

Thanks, and have a great weekend!
