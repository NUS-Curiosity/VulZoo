Package        : iceape
Vulnerability  : none in iceape
Problem type   : none in iceape
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : not available

This update for the Iceape internet suite, an unbranded version of
Seamonkey, updates the certificate blacklist for several fraudulent
HTTPS certificates. 

More details can be found in a blog posting by Jacob Appelbaum of the 
Tor project:

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package only
provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.13-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
