Subject: Re: Vulnerabilities in some SCADA server softwares

The correct time for vendors to do their own homework on SCADA was
2003 - that was the wakeup call. Anyone who has programmed for SCADA
has always wondered what would happen if they started poking
undocumented values into undocumented registers, but may not have the
luxury of trying it out.

Having been a security/network admin, there are many things that can
be done when you know of a vulnerability - snort sigs, snort flexible
response (thanks Jeff!), firewall configs, etc. I've done them before
when vulns have been published before patches, and it is much better
knowing that something is up than not. Do not rely on your vendor to
keep you up to date on security issues.

cheers,
 Jamie
