This is a big fact that many are overlooking. Regardless if the vendor
is a complete and utter moron, patches don't come easy for these
systems. Secondly, many of these systems are very old and are being
"propped' up by new software. There is no running out to deploy PLCs
that can fail because of a glitch.

Security wasn't a factor in the 50s, 60s, 70s and so on as it has become
now. No one foresaw that by even sending one too many ICMPs at a modbus
would crash it. THIS is the reality of SCADA systems. It has nothing to
do with "hiding the bugs hoping they will go away." It isn't about:
"they attacked Linux, then Windows, now SCADA" boo-hooisms. Completely
separate playing field.

Sure these need to be designed properly however the reality is, many of
these systems are old. Many of these systems control the quality of the
water we drink, the pollution leaving a plant, the power being
generated. This isn't: "release it... make em fix it fast... that'll
teach them." I wonder how the author would feel if say a water treatment
plant in his area was affected causing all the water around him to be toxic.
