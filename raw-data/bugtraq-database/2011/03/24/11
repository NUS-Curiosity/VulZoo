Due dilligence. If you sell a car that falls apart when someone pokes it
with a finger--or a piece of mission-critical software where someone with
a few days of free time to carry out "a quick experiment" and no prior
knowledge can find a dozen of security vulnerabilities (and do not warn 
your customers that it is absolutely necessary to operate the software in 
an isolated environment), you fail to exercise it in an epic way.
