Synopsis
========

Timothy B. Terriberry discovered that libvpx contains an integer
overflow vulnerability in the processing of video streams that may
allow user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libvpx is the VP8 codec SDK used to encode and decode video streams,
typically within a WebM format media file.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libvpx       < 0.9.5                          >= 0.9.5

Description
===========

libvpx is vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability when
processing crafted VP8 video streams.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libvpx users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libvpx-0.9.5"

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these
packages.
