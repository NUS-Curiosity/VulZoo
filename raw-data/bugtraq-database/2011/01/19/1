Subject: Simploo CMS Community Edition - Remote PHP Code Execution Issue

Details
=============
Product: Simploo CMS Community Edition
Security-Risk: moderated
Remote-Exploit: yes
Vendor-URL: http://www.simploo.de/
Advisory-Status: published

Credits
=============
Discovered by: David Vieira-Kurz of MajorSecurity

Affected Products:
=============
Simploo CMS 1.7.1 and prior

Description
=============
"Simploo CMS is a content management system (CMS)."

More Details
=============
I have discovered some vulnerabilities in Simploo CMS, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
Input passed via the "FTP-Server" field when editing FTP options is not properly sanitised in lib/Simploo/Config/Writer/Ini.php before being saved to the config/custom/base.ini.php file. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code via a specially crafted parameter value. Successful exploitation requires "write" privileges.

Solution
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.

Timeline
================
