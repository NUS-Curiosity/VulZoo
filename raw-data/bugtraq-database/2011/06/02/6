But it *is* worth mentioning that you have to create the malicious dll file, copy it to the system, create folders etc, and all the other mumbo jumbo to "exploit" this in the "default configuration."   So, the answer to Dan's question is actually, "no, you can't."  Which brings into question the actual "worth" of mentioning this in the first place. :)
