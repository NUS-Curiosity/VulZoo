Subject: COM Server-Based Binary Planting Proof Of Concept


We published a remote/local proof of concept for the COM Server-Based Binary Planting
exploit presented at the Hack in the Box conference in Amsterdam.

Feel free to try it out online if WebDAV works through your firewall, or download it
and test it in your local network or simply on your computer.
