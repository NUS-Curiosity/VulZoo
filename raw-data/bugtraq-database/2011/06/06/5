Hello netizens! This is an update about the OWASP AppSec USA 2011 software security conference in Minneapolis this September.

*** CALL FOR PAPERS ***

Have something important to say about software security? The OWASP AppSec USA 2011 Call for Papers is still open. We're looking for hardcore talks in cloud security, mobile security, new attacks & defenses, and straight up software development platforms. Get your submission in before time runs out. And have your developer friends submit a talk!

The AppSec USA 2011 talks will be delivered September 22-23, 2011 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In addition to the talks, we'll have excellent keynotes like Moxie Marlinspike.
