-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses a Matrix
structure within a particular opcode embedded within a .pict file. When
using this Matrix structure to transform image data, the application
will miscalculate an index to represent a row of an object. This will
cause the application to write outside the bounds of the array of
objects which can lead to code execution under the context of the
application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
