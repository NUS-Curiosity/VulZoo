Thor, the "Online Proof of Concept" section of the blog post points you to a *remote*
exploit (without any warning) but let me repeat the link here:

http://www.binaryplanting.com/demo/XP_2-click/test.html

Visit this with IE8 on 32-bit Windows XP.

Please find further information here:

http://blog.acrossecurity.com/2011/05/anatomy-of-com-server-based-binary.html
http://blog.acrossecurity.com/2011/05/silently-pwning-protected-mode-ie9-and.html

In general there are two types of remote binary planting exploits: SMB and WebDAV.
The former works inside (local) networks where firewalls block outbound SMB traffic.
WebDAV attacks work through firewalls too since many firewalls allow outbound WebDAV
traffic and Windows silently fall back to WebDAV if SMB doesn't work. If our online
remote exploit doesn't work for you, you can download the PoC locally and test it in
your local network.

I'll be happy to explain it to you further if need be.

Thanks,
Mitja
