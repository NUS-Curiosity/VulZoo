-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Internet explorer handles the
javascript statement 'selection.empty' during certain onclick events. By
causing a particular sequence of events, an attacker can cause a
CDisplayObject to be freed while it is still in use. This results in an
operation on previously freed memory that can be utilized to achieve
remote code execution.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
