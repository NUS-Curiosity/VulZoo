No. I would have mentioned them explicitly then.

1. Software that is distributed with such outdated libraries is VERY
   likely compiled/produced in an outdated development environment
   TOO, so there may be more errors/vulnerabilities lurking.


2. <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS11-025.mspx>

| In the case where a system has no MFC applications currently installed
| but does have the vulnerable Visual Studio or Visual C++ runtimes
| installed, Microsoft recommends that users install this update as a
| defense-in-depth measure, in case of an attack vector being introduced
| or becoming known at a later time.

   For the above products Microsofts advice is like a self-fullfilling
   prophecy:-(


3. Even if the current MSVC++ runtime is installed later (via Windows
   Update, for example), the vulnerable MSVC++ runtime(s) remain
   installed (side-by-side).
   You have to (and should!) remove them manually to get rid of them
   completely!
