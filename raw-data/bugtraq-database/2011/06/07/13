Subject: OWASP Zed Attack Proxy version 1.3.0

Hi folks,

Version 1.3.0 of the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) has now been released.

ZAP is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding
vulnerabilities in web applications.

This release adds the following main features:

Fuzzing, using the JBroFuzz library
Dynamic SSL Certificates
Daemon mode and API
BeanShell integration
Full internationalization
Out of the box support for 10 languages

For more information and to download this release please visit the ZAP
homepage: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project

I will also be presenting "An Introduction to the OWASP Zed Attack
Proxy" at OWASP AppSec EU on Friday 10th June.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed code, language files,
enhancement requests, bug reports and general feedback.

Psiinon
