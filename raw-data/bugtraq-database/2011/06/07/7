-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within the nipplib component which is used by both the
ActiveX and Netscape compatible browser plugins. When handling the
client-file-name parameter from the user specified printer-url the
process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on
the heap. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the browser.
