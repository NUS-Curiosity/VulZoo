-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the rcsL chunk inside Adobe's RIFF-based
Director file format. The code within the Dirapi.dll is affected by an
integer wrap caused by the size value being calculated from the
difference of two pointers without checking if the first is above the
other and resulting in endless copying. This can lead to memory
corruption which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the
context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
