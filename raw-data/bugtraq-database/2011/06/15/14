-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of the RIFF-based Director
(.dir) files. When handling an undocumented substructure, the code
within dirapi.dll can be forced to incorrectly calculate a destination
pointer if it encounters certain 1-byte opcodes within the .dir file.
The assumptions made by the code can allow for malicious values to
influence a size parameter that is used to calculate a memory address.
This address is then written to with controlled data. This can be abused
by an attacker to corrupt memory and subsequently execute arbitrary code
under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
