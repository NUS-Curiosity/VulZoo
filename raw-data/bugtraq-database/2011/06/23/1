Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered vulnerability in FanUpdate, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting attacks.

Input passed via the GET "pageTitle" parameter to header.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://fanupdate/header.php?pageTitle=%3C/title%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28123%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
