Package        : redmine
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 608397

Joernchen of Phenoelit discovered several vulnerabilities in Redmine,
a project management web application:

  Logged in users may be able to access private data.
  
  The Textile formatter allowed for cross site scripting, exposing
  sensitive data to an attacker.

  The Bazaar repository adapter could be used to remotely execute
  commands on the host running Redmine.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain redmine packages.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.0.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your redmine packages.
