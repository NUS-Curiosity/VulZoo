Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.14.11: Adobe Shockwave Font Asset Heap
 Overflow Vulnerability


iDefense Security Advisory 06.14.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 14, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Shockwave Player is a popular Web browser plug-in. It is available
for multiple Web browsers and platforms, including Windows, and MacOS.
Shockwave Player enables Web browsers to display rich multimedia content
in the form of Shockwave videos. For more information, see the vendor's
site found at the following link:

http://get.adobe.com/shockwave

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in Adobe Systems
Inc.'s Shockwave could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the current user.

This vulnerability occurs when Shockwave processes a maliciously
constructed "DRCF" chunk. Specifically, when parsing a substructure
inside of this chunk, it is possible to trigger a code path that leads
to an incorrect string copy operation. The vulnerable code performs a
certain operation on a heap-based buffer, which has the effect of
overwriting the NULL terminator of the string in the middle of the copy
operation. This will lead to an endless copy loop until the read
operation hits the end of the memory segment. This operation writes
beyond the allocated heap buffer, and can lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the Web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Web page
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted sites.
After the user visits the malicious Web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

IV. DETECTION

Shockwave Player version 11.5.9.620 and prior are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
