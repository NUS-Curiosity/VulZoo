Subject: post-XSS landscape

With the growing enthusiasm about CSP and other script containment
frameworks, I tried to put down some rough notes about the fundamental
exploitation vectors that would be available in absence of the ability
to execute scripts - and tried to see how these attacks correspond to
what XSS attacks are trying to achieve today.

So... this may be of some interest to the list:
