Subject: Introduction to R-sequence public key cryptography attack

Hello,

I have informed the responsible institutions 6 months ago before posting 
this message on public key cryptography. 

Below, I'm presenting an introduction to R-sequence theory, allowing more 
accurate analysis of verification of groups of primes (and more) and 
distribution of primes.

No direct algorithm is enclosed. Equivalence Conjecture might still be 
untrue. The rest of the  analysis has taken over 4 years.
