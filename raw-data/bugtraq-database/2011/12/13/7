ZDI-11-347 : Microsoft Office Word Hidden Border Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-347
December 13, 2011

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-1983

- -- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Microsoft



- -- Affected Products:

Microsoft Office Word



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Word 2007/2010. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application handles a border
containing a specific property. When parsing this property, the
application will incorrectly free it. If the application attempts to
render the object, a use-after-free condition can be made to occur. This
can lead to code execution under the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
