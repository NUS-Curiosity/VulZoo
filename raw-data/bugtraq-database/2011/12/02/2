Subject: FreeBSD ftpd/ProFTPD on FreeBSD Remote Root Exploit

Hello bugtraq,
this is Kingcope,
this is a stripped down version of the FreeBSD ftpd/ProFTPD remote exploit.
No binaries are included, only the source.
You can get the full package by searching for it in google.

The bug affects all known versions of ProFTPD since it is a bug in FreeBSD libc.
The latest version (ProFTPD 1.3.4a) is affected too.

Regards,

Kingcope
