Hi everyone,

It's been over a month since we first announced the CFP for the SANS 
AppSec Summit being held in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 30 - May 1, 2012.

We've received a number of great submissions so far but there's only two 
months left until the deadline on February 1, 2012. If you'd like to 
speak please get your submission in as soon as possible.

Hope to see you in Vegas!

============

The theme for this conference is "Application Security at Scale".

Billions of records in the cloud. Millions of smart mobile devices. 
Millions of developers writing new code. Hundreds of apps in your 
enterprise. Untold numbers of existing bugs. Unknown numbers of 
"sophisticated" attackers exploiting your software. What cutting edge 
techniques are attackers using? How do large enterprises handle these 
problems at scale? And how do small companies manage it all with fewer 
resources?

We invite you to submit presentations in the following areas:

- Cloud Security
- Mobile Security
- Security in the SDLC
- Secure Coding
- Security Architecture
- Securing Legacy Applications
- Securing Open Source Frameworks
- Program Development
- Security Metrics
- Security Testing
- Penetration Testing
- Cutting Edge Attacks
- Cutting Edge Defense
- Case Studies
- Any topic related to Application Security
