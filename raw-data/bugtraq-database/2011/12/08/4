Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

December  7, 2011

- -- CVE ID:
CVE2011-4260

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks



- -- Affected Products:

RealNetworks RealPlayer



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Realplayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the mp4arender.dll module. If the
channel count is altered inside the esds atom, the allocated buffer will
be too small to support the decoded audio data, causing a heap overflow.
This vulnerability can be leveraged to execute code under the context of
the user running the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
