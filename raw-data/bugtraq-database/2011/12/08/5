ZDI-11-344 : RealNetworks RealPlayer RV20 Decoding Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-344
December  7, 2011

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-4253

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks



- -- Affected Products:

RealNetworks RealPlayer



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way that the application allocates
space for parsing sample data encoded with the RV20 codec. After
allocation, the application will partially fill the allocation with
sample data. Upon usage of this sample data, the application will use
the uninitialized data to calculate an index that is then written into.
This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
