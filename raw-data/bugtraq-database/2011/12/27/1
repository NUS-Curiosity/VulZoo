Dear list,

We are proud to present two free XMAS 2011 hacking challenges for you!
The first challenge is just "fun". Hack the file and become a music
hero! The second challenge is about oracle padding. A difficult one,
scratch your head and solve the challenge. A lot to learn, I promise. 

Interested? Please sign-up a Hacking-Lab account and register yourself
(free) to the "Xmas 2011 Challenge" classroom.
