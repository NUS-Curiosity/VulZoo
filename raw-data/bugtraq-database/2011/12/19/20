Overview
--------
NTMS'2012 is the Fifth International Conference on New Technologies,
Mobility and Security that will be held from 7 to 10 May 2012 in
Istanbul, Turkey.

NTMS'2012 aims at fostering advances in the areas of New Technologies,
Wireless Networks, Mobile Computing, Ad hoc and Ambient Networks, QoS,
Network Security and E-commerce, to mention a few, and provides a
dynamic forum for researchers, students and professionals to present
their state-of-the-art research and development in these interesting
areas.

The event will be combined with tutorial sessions and workshops.
Tutorials will precede the main program, aiming at the dissemination of
mature knowledge and technology advances in the field. Two or more
Workshops will immediately follow the main conference, offering the
opportunity for a more focused exchange of ideas and presentation of on-
going research relevant to following tracks (More information and the
full call-for-papers can be found on the conference web):
