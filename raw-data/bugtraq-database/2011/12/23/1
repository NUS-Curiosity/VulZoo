It was discovered that libsoup2.4, a HTTP library implementation in C, is
not properly validating input when processing requests made to SoupServer.
A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to access system files via a

version 2.4.1-2+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
