Package        : qemu-kvm
Vulnerability  : implementation error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1751 

Nelson Elhage discovered that incorrect memory handling during the 
removal of ISA devices in KVM, a solution for full virtualization on
x86 hardware, could lead to denial of service of the execution of 
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
