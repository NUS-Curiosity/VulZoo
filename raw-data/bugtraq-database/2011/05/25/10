Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 05.24.11: IBM Lotus Notes LZH Attachment
 Viewer Stack Buffer Overflow

iDefense Security Advisory 05.24.11
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 24, 2011

I. BACKGROUND

IBM Corp.'s Lotus Notes software is an integrated desktop client option
for accessing e-mail, calendars and applications on an IBM Corp. Lotus
Domino server. More information can be found by visiting the URL below.
<BR> <BR> http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in IBM
Corp.'s Lotus Notes could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the current user. <BR> <BR> The vulnerability occurs
during the processing of header information contained within a LZH
archive file. A length calculation may cause an integer value to
underflow and result in a large length value. A memory copy operation
using the length value may cause LZH data to overflow the bounds of a
stack buffer. This condition may lead to arbitrary code execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code in the context of the user opening an attachment delivered via
email. In order to be successful, an attacker must social engineer the
victim into processing a specially crafted email attachment in a certain
way. Specifically, the victim must open the attachment and click the
view button on the attachment dialog box.

IV. DETECTION

Lotus Notes versions 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0, 8.5 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

A workaround is available to disable LZH archive files within the Lotus
Notes file viewer: <BR> <BR> Open the keyview.ini file in the Lotus
Notes program data directory (C:\Program Files\IBM\Lotus\Notes\Data) and
comment out all references to lzhsr.dll. To comment out a reference,
proceed the line with a semi-colon ';'.
