Subject: The Anatomy of COM Server-Based Binary Planting Exploits


Our new blog post describes in detail how the binary planting exploits we presented
at Hack In The Box Amsterdam work. Watch a user on IE8/XP getting pwned by two single
clicks on a web page, and a user on IE9/Win7 getting pwned by selecting an option
from a context menu.

Last year we launched our Advanced binary planting research project aimed at
exploring the exploitability of various binary planting bugs, and have since gathered
a pile of interesting knowledge, some of which is finally ready to see the light of
day. Enjoy the reading.
