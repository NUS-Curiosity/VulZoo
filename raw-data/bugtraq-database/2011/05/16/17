 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2011:088
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : mplayer
 Date    : May 16, 2011
 Affected: 2009.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed in mplayer:
 
 oggparsevorbis.c in FFmpeg 0.5 does not properly perform certain
 pointer arithmetic, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
 sensitive memory contents and cause a denial of service via a crafted
 file that triggers an out-of-bounds read. (CVE-2009-4632)
 
 vorbis_dec.c in FFmpeg 0.5 uses an assignment operator when a
 comparison operator was intended, which might allow remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via
 a crafted file that modifies a loop counter and triggers a heap-based
 buffer overflow. (CVE-2009-4633)
 
 Multiple integer underflows in FFmpeg 0.5 allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
 crafted file that (1) bypasses a validation check in vorbis_dec.c
 and triggers a wraparound of the stack pointer, or (2) access a
 pointer from out-of-bounds memory in mov.c, related to an elst tag
 that appears before a tag that creates a stream. (CVE-2009-4634)
 
 FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MOV container with
 improperly ordered tags that cause (1) mov.c and (2) utils.c to use
 inconsistent codec types and identifiers, which causes the mp3 decoder
 to process a pointer for a video structure, leading to a stack-based
 buffer overflow. (CVE-2009-4635)
 
 FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (hang)
 via a crafted file that triggers an infinite loop. (CVE-2009-4636)
 
 The av_rescale_rnd function in the AVI demuxer in FFmpeg 0.5 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted
 AVI file that triggers a divide-by-zero error. (CVE-2009-4639)
 
 Array index error in vorbis_dec.c in FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
 code via a crafted Vorbis file that triggers an out-of-bounds
 read. (CVE-2009-4640)
 
 flicvideo.c in libavcodec 0.6 and earlier in FFmpeg, as used in MPlayer
 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
 via a crafted flic file, related to an arbitrary offset dereference
 vulnerability. (CVE-2010-3429)
 
 libavcodec/vorbis_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg 0.6.1
 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via a crafted .ogg file, related to the
 vorbis_floor0_decode function. (CVE-2010-4704)
 
 And several additional vulnerabilites originally discovered by Google
 Chrome developers were also fixed with this advisory.
 
 Packages for 2009.0 are provided as of the Extended Maintenance
 Program. Please visit this link to learn more:
