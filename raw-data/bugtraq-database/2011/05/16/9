Package        : apr
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0419


A flaw was found in the APR library, which could be exploited through
Apache HTTPD's mod_autoindex.  If a directory indexed by mod_autoindex
contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could
send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU
usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.12-5+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-6+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.4.4-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apr packages and restart the
apache2 server.
