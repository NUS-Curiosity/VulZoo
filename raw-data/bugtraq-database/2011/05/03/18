For the third year in a row, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence invites experts from government, military, academia and the private sector to Tallinn to discuss recent trends in cyber security. 

This year the ICCC (www.ccdcoe.org/ICCC) takes place on 7-10 June and will focus on the topic of Generating Cyber Forces. The initial agenda (www.ccdcoe.org/ICCC/agenda.html)  and registration (www.ccdcoe.org/ICCC/registration ) are now available on the ICCC website.

ICCC is divided into two tracks: 

The Concepts, Strategy and Law track addresses the human component of Cyber Forces. This includes talks and discussion on how to best identify, recruit, train and retain the right people, and how to best organize their contribution to national security. The track will address both traditional state-centric concepts, such as specialized units in the active duty military, and more volunteer-based approaches, such as the Estonian Cyber Defence League and cyber security expertise in the reserve forces.

The Technical Challenges & Solutions track includes a significant number of world-renowned experts. Presentations will cover topics ranging from �next-generation� intrusion detection to covert channels, Advanced Persistent Threats, and a tutorial on VoIP exploitation. The cutting-edge nature of these talks will help security professionals to understand not only the current dangers in cyberspace, but also many cyber security challenges of the future.
Technical Track attendees will ideally have a solid computer science or information security background, in order to facilitate both an understanding of the material presented and to take part in subsequent discussion.

ICCC takes place in Tallinn at the same time as the NATO defence ministers� meeting in Brussels, which will  articulate a new NATO cyber defence policy. This policy is likely to be addressed on the last day of the conference.

ICCC 2011 is co-sponsored by IEEE, the world�s largest professional association for advancing technological innovation and excellence. The conference proceedings will be published in hard copy and made available digitally through IEEE Xplore.

In addition, the conference will feature several workshops on 7 June, including a Media workshop (https://www.ccdcoe.org/ICCC/359.html) and the Cyber Security Forum Initiative workshop (https://www.ccdcoe.org/ICCC/360.html).

The conference will be held amidst European Capital of Culture events (http://www.tallinn2011.ee/eng) in the centre of Tallinn in the charming art deco building of the Estonian Drama Theatre.

The conference fee is �495. Discounts apply to students, IEEE members, CSFI members and CCD COE partner organisations.
