VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION:
==========================
The scripts "/common/pages/lib/footer_login.php" and "/common/pages/lib/footer_loggedin.php" are prone to a cross-site-scripting vulnerability because they fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "msg" parameter.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
