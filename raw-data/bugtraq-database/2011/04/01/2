I. BACKGROUND

Helix DNA Server is software that can play audio and video media in
various formats and stream them over a network. It is intended as a
largely free and open source digital media framework that runs on
numerous operating systems. The Helix DNA Server can support various
formats including RealVideo, RealAudio, and MP3.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in
RealNetworks Inc.'s Helix DNA Server could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected service. <BR> <BR>
The Helix DNA Server contains a vulnerability that can be triggered by
an unauthenticated attacker. The vulnerability results due to the

a copy operation that results in the bounds of a stack buffer to be
overflown.
