Subject: Movie Player v4.82 0Day Buffer overflow/DOS Exploit

Hello Team,

I have attached a file MoviePlayerExploit.py which exploits the memory vulnerability in Movie Player v4.82 which can be used to perform a Denial of Service attack :) and to cause a crash.

To run this file, compile the MoviePlayerExploit.py using python and then you may open the generated exploit ".avi" file using Movie Player v4.82. If run properly, many a times, there is a crash every-time whenever the victim opens the folder in which the Exploit is placed.

Thanks and Regards,
^Xecuti0N3r
