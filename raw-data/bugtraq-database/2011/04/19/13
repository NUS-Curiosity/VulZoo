Subject: Windows Synchronization Object Vulnerabilites in Antivirus Suites

Abstract

In 2009 we examined the effects of manipulating synchronization
objects in security software suites frequently found on personal
computers running Windows XP and Vista. The synchronization objects
were mutexes and events, and the security software included products
from AVG, Avast, Avira, BitDefender, BullGuard, CheckPoint, Eset,
F-Prot, F-Secure, Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft (Security Essentials),
Norman, Norton, Panda, PC Tools, Quick Heal, Symantec, and Trend
Micro.

The examinations revealed that nearly all suites suffered non-trivial
faults originating from both standard and administrator accounts. The
faults ranged from simple denial of service affecting the UI console
and definition update service to scanner crashes and surreptitious
suite shutdown.
