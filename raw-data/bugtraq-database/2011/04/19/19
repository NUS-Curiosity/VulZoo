: Vulnerability ID: HTB22750

: The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/LightNEasy.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "handle" variable.

SQL injection vulnerability in common.php in LightNEasy 3.2.1 allows 
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the handle 
parameter to LightNEasy.php, a different vector than CVE-2008-6593.
