    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4180

Description:
    Previous versions of openssl, when
    SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG was enabled, were
    vulnerable to a ciphersuite downgrade attack, which could lead to
    a remote attacker to potentially forcing a client to use a weaker
    cipher.
    
    Additinally, previous versions of openssl did not check for a NULL
    return value from the bn_wexpand function, which could lead to a
    remote denial of service.
