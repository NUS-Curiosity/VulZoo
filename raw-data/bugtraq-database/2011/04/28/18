4. Affected Components Description
==================================

JDENet is a network communication middleware that performs network communications workstation-to-server and server-to-server. It is used to call
remote functions, to authenticate users and transmit information between hosts in a JD Edwards environment.


5. Vulnerability Details

It is possible for a remote and unauthenticated attacker to retrieve passwords of users that are allowed to login to the SAW Kernel (System
Administration Workbench Kernel) in default installations of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne servers.

As SAW users are allowed to, among other things, remotely execute commands on the server, the exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a full
compromise of the server.

their systems and protect against the exploitation of the
described vulnerability.
