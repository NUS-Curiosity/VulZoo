Type of vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored and Reflected

Exploit vectors: Local and Remote
 
Vulnerability description: The applications web interface contains multiple injection points, which allow for execution of Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Arbitrary client side code such as JavaScript can be included into certain parameters throughout the web application. The following parameters and web pages have been tested and verified; however, it is likely more views and parameters within the application are vulnerable: 

Stored XSS myAddressBook.asp (fname, lname, email_edit, email, email2, email3, sms, sms_id, work) parameters 

Reflected XSS (vulnerable on 9.2.11.0 but not on 9.3.14.0) HostLogin.asp (txtConferenceID) parameter ParticipantLogin.asp (txtConferenceID) parameter ForgotPIN.asp (acp) parameter Error.asp (Description, title, Heading) parameters
  
Tested on: Windows Server 2003 RC2 (SP2) with Sonexis ConferenceManager versions 9.2.11.0 and 9.3.14.0.
 
Affected software versions:  Sonexis ConferenceManager versions 9.2.11.0 (Reflected XSS) and 9.3.14.0 (Stored XSS) (previous versions may also be vulnerable)
 
Impact: Successful attacks could disclose sensitive information about the user, session, and application to the attacker, resulting in a loss of confidentiality. Using XSS, an attacker could insert malicious code into a web page and entice naï¿½ve users to execute the malicious code. 
Fixed in: Reflected XSS vulnerabilities appear to have been fixed during our testing of version 9.3.14.0. Please consult the vendor for the specific patch addressing the reflected XSS items discovered.
 
Remediation guidelines: Restrict access to internal network segments and monitor vendor notifications for application updates that may address and fix the issues identified.
