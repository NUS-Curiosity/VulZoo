10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of CA Total Defense Suite. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the UnassignAdminRoles stored procedure,
accessed via the management.asmx console. The Management Web Service
listens for SOAP 1.2 requests on port 34444 for HTTP and 34443 for
HTTPS. Due to a flaw in the implementation of the
UnAssignFunctionalUsers stored procedure, it is possible for a remote,
un-authenticated user to inject arbitrary SQL commands in the SOAP
request which could ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under
the context of the SYSTEM user by invoking an exec function.
 

-- Vendor Response:
CA has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
