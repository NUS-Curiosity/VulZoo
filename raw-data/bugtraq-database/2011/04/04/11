-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM solidDB. Authentication is not required
to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the solid.exe process which listens by
default on TCP ports 1315, 1964 and 2315. The authentication protocol
allows a remote attacker to specify the length of a password hash. By
specifying a minimum length the attacker can force the process to
validate only the first several bytes of the password hash. This can be
abused to bypass authentication to the database.

-- Vendor Response:
IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
