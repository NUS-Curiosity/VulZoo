Subject: Xymon monitor cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been identified in the 
Xymon systems- and network-monitoring tool available at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xymon/

All versions prior to 4.3.1 (released April 3, 2011) are vulnerable.

I would like to thank David Ferrest for notifying me of this issue.


Henrik Størner,
lead Xymon developer.
