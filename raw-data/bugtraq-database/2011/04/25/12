Subject: [TOOL RELEASE] T50 - an Experimental Mixed Packet Injector ( v5.3)

                   \/        \/             All Rights Reserved

Since the previous release version (H2HC), some improvements were introduced to this new version:
1. New License: It is, finally, licensed under GPL Version 2.0. Please, refer to LICENSE document for further information. The new project leader is Fernando Mercês (@FernandoMerces) and, as soon as possible, he will upload the source code to:
    - http://t50.sourceforge.net/

2. CIDR Support: Classless Inter-Domain Routing support for destination IP address, using a really tiny C algorithm. This would allow the new version to simulate DDoS/DRDoS in a laboratory environment.

    [...]

    001 netmask    = ~(0xffffffff>>bits);
    002 __1st_addr = (ntohl(address)&netmask)+1;
    003 hostid     = (1 << (32 - bits)) - 2;

    [...]

3. ELEVEN NEW Protocols: ELEVEN (11) more protocols supported by T50:
    1. IGMPv3: Internet Group Message Protocol v3
    2. EGP:    Exterior Gateway Protocol
    3. RIPv1:  Routing Information Protocol v1
    4. RIPv2:  Routing Information Protocol v2
    5. DCCP:   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
    6. RSVP:   Resource ReSerVation Protocol
    7. IPSec:  Internet Protocol Security (AH/ESP)
    8. GRE:    Generic Routing Encapsulation
    9. EIGRP:  Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
   10. OSPF:   Open Shortest Path First

4. Exotic Protocols: Advanced options and protocol crafting for RSVP, EIGRP, OSPF and GRE were added, allowing users to make any combination while using those exotic protocols. By the way, EIGRP is a proprietary protocol developed by CISCO Systems, Inc.

5. Encapsulation: T50 is capable now to encapsulate all its packet within the Generic Routing Encapsulation, making it the most powerful tool ever.

6. TCP Options Support: TCP Options are now supported to improve the TCP protocol, such as:
    1. TCP End of Option List (RFC 793)
    2. TCP No-Operation Option (RFC 793)
    3. TCP Maximum Segment Size Option (RFC 793)
    4. TCP Window Scale Option (RFC 1323)
    5. TCP Timestamps Option (RFC 1323)
    6. T/TCP Connection Count Option (RFC 1644)
    7. T/TCP CC.NEW Option (RFC 1644)
    8. T/TCP CC.ECHO Option (RFC 1644)
    9. TCP SACK-Permitted Option (RFC 2018)
   10. TCP Selective Acknowledgement Option (RFC 2018)
   11. TCP MD5 Signature Option (RFC 2385)
   12. TCP Authentication Option (RFC 5925)

7. Some T50 statistics (as of April 17th, 2011):
    - 33 code files
    - 13,763 code lines
    - 15 supported protocols
    - 1 socket file descriptor
    - 238 command line interface options

You can download both slide deck announcement and source code for the new version @ http://t50.4shared.com/! 

If you want, you can check the demo videos:
    - H2HC Demo: http://www.videolog.tv/video.php?id=614528
    - Web Security Forum Announcement: http://www.videolog.tv/video.php?id=643819

PS: Be nice when using T50, the authors (myself and Fernando Mercês - as of today) DENY its use for DoS/DDoS/DRDoS purposes.

Best regards.
