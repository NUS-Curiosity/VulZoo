-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office PowerPoint. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the ppcore.dll module responsible for
parsing PowerPoint (ppt) files. When parsing a malformed
TimeCommandBehaviorContainer structure the process raises an exception
that causes an object in memory to be freed prior to being fully parsed.
Due to the lack of a check that this object has been freed, a later
function references an invalid pointer element. This can be leveraged by
a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
user running PowerPoint.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
