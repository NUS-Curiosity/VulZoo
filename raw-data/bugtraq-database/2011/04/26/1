1. You kids can't seem to search a VDB before posting. This was disclosed 
2009-03-12 and assigned CVE-2010-1109.

2. As usual, you leave of important technical details such as the 
requirement of magic_quotes_gpc to be disabled.

3. Predictably, other advisories fall under this. Splitting 
advisories out like this doesn't fool anyone you know.. 
 
http://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/sql_injection_in_phpmysport_1.html
http://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/sql_injection_in_phpmysport_2.html

Both of these are also covered under CVE-2010-1109.
