Subject: NGS00068 Patch Notification: LibAVCodec AMV Out of Array Write

LibAVCodec AMV Out of Array Write

27/04/2011

Dominic Chell of NGS Secure has discovered a high risk vulnerability in LibAVCodec. Opening a malformed AMV file can result in an out of array write and potentially arbitrary code execution when using this library. Whilst the vulnerability may affect multiple applications that use this library, it was only tested on VLC media player.

Versions affected include:
VLC media player 1.1.9 and earlier releases.

This issue is addressed in the latest release of FFMpeg, which can be found at:

NGS Secure is going to withhold details of this flaw for three months. 
This three month window will allow users the time needed to apply the 
patch before the details are released to the general public. This 
reflects the NGS Secure approach to responsible disclosure.
