Introduction
____________

B-Sides Vienna | NinjaCon 11 is a unique hacker conference targeted at
security researchers, system and network operators, application
developers, hardware hackers, hackerspace members, and generally
open-minded folks working or participating in the broad fields between
information warfare and digital art.

It will combine the knowledge of experienced security speakers, hackers,
and information warriors with the fun of a small but 1337 conference.
Its main goal therefore is to help attendees understand the current
state of art in information technology and security, and showcase
projects evolved from the hackerspace movement. The official event
language is English.

After the last years' NinjaCon taglines - A Series of Tubes, and Make a
Good Hack - B-Sides Vienna | NinjaCon 11 will take our approach towards
security, hacking and technological innovation yet another step further,
therefore being sub-entitled:

ON THE PRIVILEGE ESCALATOR TO SHELL
___________________________________

How ever much seriousness or amusement you bring into this, we'll make
sure you get an overview of today's state-of-the-art technologies,
insight into a bunch of the best hackers' mindsets, and learn new
things! Not only will you again have the chance to participate in
workshops and the mainly security and network-focused talks, but also
get your hands on some hardware hacking, and join in to various activities.


NinjaCon 11 goes B-Sides Vienna? I don't get it. What's the big deal?
_____________________________________________________________________

As part of the organizing team is leaving Vienna for good this summer,
NinjaCon will no longer be taking place in Austria, but instead
Germany's capital after this year. However, to ensure the Viennese
community still has an event to gather at and discuss the most
interesting topics in IT security, hacking and hardware, NinjaCon 11 was
merged into Vienna's upcoming NEXT BIG THING event: namely the Security
B-Sides Vienna.

In other words: It will combine the awesomeness of both formats, while
giving our attendees the possibility of voting for their favorite talks
and speakers. Voting will be made possible for anyone holding a ticket
to the conference. Admission to the conference is FREE (as in free beer)!


Save the date: June 18th, 2011
______________________________

Talks, workshops and trainings will be held throughout Saturday, June
18th 2011, at the most wonderful location ever, The Hub Vienna - making
it a full day and night of talks, trainings, hands-on workshops, epic
haXX0r battles and partying afterwards; the perfect combination of
technology, IT security, hardware hacking, art, music, socializing and
good times.
This date also marks the end of 23rd annual FIRST conference in Vienna,
so if you're already participating in FIRST, we'd love to see you come
by to see how the other side lives!
