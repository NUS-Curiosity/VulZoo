Subject: AppSec USA 2011 Open Source Showcase Call for Demos

OWASP is piloting a new initiative to promote open source ideals at our Global AppSec Conferences!

For the first time, we are offering a limited number of free booth spaces to open source projects as part of the OWASP Open Source Showcase at OWASP AppSec USA 2011!

We invite ANY open source project - not just OWASP projects - to apply for a booth at this showcase to demo and promote their project. Showcase participants need to be ticketed attendees and will be responsible for manning their booth.

Learn more about this opportunity, including how to submit projects for consideration, by visiting the following URL:

Applications are due Friday, August 19, 2011, and are considered on a rolling basis - so get moving!

Contact projects@...sp.org if you have any questions.
