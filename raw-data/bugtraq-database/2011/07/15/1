Subject: Static Analysis Tool Exposition (SATE) - Call for Participation


  NIST is preparing the fourth Static Analysis Tool Expostion (SATE IV). Briefly, participating tool makers run their tool on a set of programs. Researchers led by NIST analyze the tool reports. The results and experiences are reported at a workshop. The tool reports and analysis are made publicly available later.

  The draft plan, including a summary of proposed changes since the last SATE, is located at:

  http://samate.nist.gov/SATE.html

  In particular, we plan to provide the test sets by July 31. We plan to hold the wrap-up experience workshop in March 2012. Any suggestions regarding the plan would be appreciated.

  We invite tool makers to sign up. If you would like to participate in the exposition, or if you have questions, please email Aurelien Delaitre (aurelien.delaitre 'at' nist.gov) or Vadim Okun (vadim.okun 'at' nist.gov).

  Thanks,
