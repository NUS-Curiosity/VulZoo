-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of EMC Documentum eRoom Indexing Server.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the bundled implementation of OpenText's
HummingBird Connector. When parsing a particular packet received from a
TCP connection, the application will attempt to copy part of the
packet's contents into a buffer located on the stack. Due to not
completely accommodating for the size of the data in the packet, the
application will overwrite variables positioned after the buffer. This
can lead to code execution under the context of the server.

-- Vendor Response:
EMC has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
