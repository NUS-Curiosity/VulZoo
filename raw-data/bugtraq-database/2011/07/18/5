It was discovered that horde3, the horde web application framework, is
prone to a cross-site scripting attack and a cross-site request forgery.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.2+debian0-2+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.8+debian0-2, which was already included in the squeeze
release.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.3.8+debian0-2.


We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 packages.
