Subject: Wireshark 1.6.1 Malformed IKE Packet Denial of Service

Wireshark 1.6.1 Malformed IKE Packet Denial of Service

------------------------------------------------------------------
I. Summary

A flaw has been identified in Wireshark 1.6.1 concerning IKEv1 protocol dissector and the function proto_tree_add_item() ,when add more than 1000000 items to a proto_tree,that will cause a denial of service (denial of service and memory rising ).

------------------------------------------------------------------
II. Description

Wireshark use the function proto_tree_add_item() to add an item to a proto_tree.When we use filter expression 'isakmp' to look up a malformed IKE packet (Next Payload = DELETE (12), Exchange Type = Information (5) with no actual payload data) and click on the resultant list entry,wireshark will run in the function TRY_TO_FAKE_THIS_ITEM(tree, hfindex, hfinfo),there are more than 1000000 items in the tree, this will cause an infinite loop,then cause denial of service and memory rising.

------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Impact

Denial of service 

------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. Affected

Wireshark 1.6.1, tested with Windows XP SP2. Previous versions may also be affected due to code reuse.

------------------------------------------------------------------
V. Solution

There is no known workaround at this time.
