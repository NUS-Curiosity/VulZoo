Positive Research Center has discovered multiply SQL injection vulnerabilities in OneOrZero AIMS. Application incorrectly validates input data, which allows attackers to conduct an SQL injection attack.

"SQL Injection" is a way to bypass network protection and attack the database. Settings transferred to the database through Web applications are specially crafted to modify executable SQL query. For example, an attacker could execute an additional query along with the first one by adding different symbols to a setting.

Gain access to data that is normally unavailable or obtain system configuration data that can be used for further attacks. For example, a modified query may return hashed user passwords which could be decrypted with the brute-force method.
