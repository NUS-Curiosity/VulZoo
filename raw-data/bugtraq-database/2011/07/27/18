-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Webkit as utilized by either Apple Safari,
or Google's Chrome browser. User interaction is required to exploit this
vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a
malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the library handles implicitly
defined styles. When processing a specific case for a style, the
application will dispatch an event. During this dispatch, code can be
executed that can be used to manipulate the DOM tree causing a
type-switch. This type-switch can lead to code execution under the
context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
WebKit has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
