Safari 5.1 and Safari 5.0.6 are now available and address the
following:

CFNetwork
Available for:  Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later
Impact:  Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-
site scripting attack
Description:  In certain situations, Safari may treat a file as HTML,
even if it is served with the 'text/plain' content type. This may
lead to a cross-site scripting attack on sites that allow untrusted
users to post text files. This issue is addressed through improved
handling of 'text/plain' content.
CVE-ID
CVE-2010-1420 : Hidetake Jo working with Microsoft Vulnerability
Research (MSVR), Neal Poole of Matasano Security

CFNetwork
Available for:  Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later
Impact:  Authenticating to a maliciously crafted website may lead to
arbitrary code execution
Description:  The NTLM authentication protocol is susceptible to a
