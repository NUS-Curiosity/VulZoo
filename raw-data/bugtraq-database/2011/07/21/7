Sebastian Krahmer discovered that opie, a system that makes it simple to
use One-Time passwords in applications, is prone to a privilege
escalation (CVE-2011-2490) and an off-by-one error, which can lead to
the execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2011-2489). Adam Zabrocki and
Maksymilian Arciemowicz also discovered another off-by-one error
(CVE-2010-1938), which only affects the lenny version as the fix was
already included for squeeze.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.32-10.2+lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.32.dfsg.1-0.2+squeeze1

The testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid) do
not contain opie.


We recommend that you upgrade your opie packages.
