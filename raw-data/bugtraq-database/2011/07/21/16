Vulnerability Description: Foxit Reader is vulnerable to a Insecure Library Loading vulnerability. The libraries identified as being vulnerable are dwmapi.dll, dwrite.dll and msdrm.dll. The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Windows loads DLLs. If applications load a library from a specific path and call that path implicitly, Microsoft Windows searches several default paths to find and load the library. A malicious attacker can create a malicious DLL with the same name and place it in a directory where Microsoft Windows searches by default. The application will load the malicious DLL resulting in arbitrary code execution.

Affected software versions: 5.0.1.0523

Impact: Successful exploitation allows local or remote arbitrary code execution.

Fixed in: The vendor has provided a patch to fix this issue. Please upgrade to version 5.0.2.0718.

Remediation guidelines: The vendor has provided a patch to fix this issue. Please upgrade to version 5.0.2.0718.
