Description
-----------
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Securstar DriveCrypt kernel
drivers, the vulnerabilities exist due to several somewhat systemic issues in
the validation of user-supplied pointers and trust thereof, use of user-supplied
parameters to privileged kernel functionality and finally, the lack of bounds
checking in unbounded copy operations resulting in buffer overflows.

Analysis
--------
Numerous vulnerabilities exists due to a complete lack of validation of user- 
supplied pointers contained within structures passed as arguments to the IOCTL 
interface exported from the globally accessible "\\.\DCR" device.
