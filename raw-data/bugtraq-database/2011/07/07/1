-- Scott Cantor

CVE-2011-2516: Apache Santuario XML Security for C++ contains buffer
overflows signing or verifying with large keys.

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Apache Santuario XML Security for C++ library versions
prior to V1.6.1

Description: A buffer overflow exists when creating or verifying XML
signatures
with RSA keys of sizes on the order of 8192 or more bits. This typically
results
in a crash and denial of service in applications that verify signatures
using
keys that could be supplied by an attacker.

Mitigation: Applications using library versions older than V1.6.1 should
upgrade
as soon as possible. Distributors of older versions should apply the
patches
from this subversion revision:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1125752

Applications that can prevent the use of arbitrary keys supplied by an
attacker
(such as within the ds:KeyInfo element of a signature), or limit key
sizes, may
prevent the exploitation of this bug.
