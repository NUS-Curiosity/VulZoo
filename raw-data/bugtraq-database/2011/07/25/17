Subject: OWASP AppSec USA 2011 Pre-conference Challenge #3 - July

OWASP AppSec USA 2011 pre-conference challenge #3 - July is now posted. The first person to solve the challenge earns a ticket to the OWASP AppSec USA 2011 conference September 22-23 (by the way, we've now posted 30+ upcoming talks, with more to come).
