 4

Folks,

The IETF has just published RFC 6274, entitled "Security Assessment of
the Internet Protocol Version 4". It contains a large amount of
information on how to improve the security of IPv4 implementations and
IPv4 deployments.

This document is the result of quite a few years of work, as part of a
project I carried out on behalf of the UK CPNI (http://www.cpni.gov.uk),
and is the product of pursuing the CPNI's technical report on IPv4
security (http://www.gont.com.ar/papers/InternetProtocol.pdf) at the IETF.

The RFC is available at: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6274.txt

Once again, I'd like to thank CPNI for their continued support.

Best regards,,
Fernando
