Seagate Personal Cloud multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yorick Koster, September 2017

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seagate Personal Cloud is a consumer-grade Network-Attached Storage
device (NAS). It was found that the web application used to manage the
NAS is affected by various unauthenticated information disclosure
vulnerabilities. The device is configured to trust any CORS origin, and
is accessible via the personalcloud.local domain name. Due to this it is
possible for any website to gain access to this information. While this
information doesn't allow an attacker to compromise the NAS, the
information can be used to stage more targeted attacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue was tested on a Seagate Personal Cloud model SRN21C running
firmware versions 4.3.16.0 and 4.3.18.0. The software is licensed from
LACIE, it is very likely that other devices/models are also affected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
These issues have been mitigated in firmware version 4.3.19.3. The NAS
no longer accepts CORS requests from arbitrary sites. A number of
endpoints now require the user to be logged in.
