Package        : texlive-bin
CVE            : not yet available

Nick Roessler from the University of Pennsylvania has found a buffer overflow
in texlive-bin, the executables for TexLive, the popular distribution of TeX
document production system.

This buffer overflow can be used for arbitrary code execution by crafting a
special type1 font (.pfb) and provide it to users running pdf(la)tex, dvips or
luatex in a way that the font is loaded.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2016.20160513.41080.dfsg-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your texlive-bin packages.

For the detailed security status of texlive-bin please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/texlive-bin
