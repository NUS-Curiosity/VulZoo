Subject: Call for Papers: USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT '18)

Dear all,

We are pleased to announce the Call for Papers for the 12th USENIX
Workshop on Offensive Technologies! WOOT '18 will be held on August
13â€“14, 2018, in conjunction with USENIX Security in Baltimore, MD, USA.

WOOT provides a forum for high-quality, peer-reviewed work discussing
tools and techniques for attack. Submissions should reflect the state of
the art in offensive computer security technology, exposing poorly
understood mechanisms, presenting novel attacks, or surveying the state
of offensive operations at scale. WOOT '18 welcomes papers in both an
academic security context and more applied work that informs the field
about the state of security practice in offensive techniques.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

    Application security and vulnerability research
    Attacks against privacy
    Attacks on virtualization and the cloud
    Browser and general client-side security
    Hardware attacks
    Internet of Things
    Malware design, implementation, and analysis
    Network and distributed systems attacks
    Offensive applications of formal methods
    Offensive aspects of mobile security
    Offensive technologies using (or against) machine learning
    Operating systems security
    Practical attacks on deployed cryptographic systems

Paper submissions are due by Wednesday, May 30, 2018. Please read
through the complete Call for Papers for additional details and
instructions: https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot18/call-for-papers

We look forward to receiving your submissions!
