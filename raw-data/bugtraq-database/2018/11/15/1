         CVE Name       

    Description  There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in dns_srv and      
                 dns_naptr functions of Asterisk that allows an attacker to   
                 crash Asterisk via a specially crafted DNS SRV or NAPTR      
                 response. The attacker���s request causes Asterisk to          
                 segfault and crash.                                          

        Resolution       Upgrade Asterisk to a fixed version.
