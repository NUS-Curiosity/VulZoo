CVE ID         : CVE-2018-18311 CVE-2018-18312 CVE-2018-18313 CVE-2018-18314

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the implementation of the
Perl programming language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2018-18311

    Jayakrishna Menon and Christophe Hauser discovered an integer
    overflow vulnerability in Perl_my_setenv leading to a heap-based
    buffer overflow with attacker-controlled input.

CVE-2018-18312

    Eiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could
    cause a heap-based buffer overflow write during compilation,
    potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2018-18313

    Eiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could
    cause a heap-based buffer overflow read during compilation which
    leads to information leak.

CVE-2018-18314

    Jakub Wilk discovered that a specially crafted regular expression
    could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.24.1-3+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.
