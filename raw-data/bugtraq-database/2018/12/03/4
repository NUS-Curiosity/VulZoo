# Description:
The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). It is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the
attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request.
An attacker may trick the users of the web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring changing their email address, or any personal preferences.
An attacker could trick the users of the Microstrategy application into clicking on a link that will change the victim's personal information or perform unwanted action on the application.
