Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Redmine, a project
management web application. They could lead to remote code execution,
information disclosure or cross-site scripting attacks.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.1-4+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your redmine packages.

In addition, this message serves as an announcement that security
support for redmine in the Debian 8 oldstable release (jessie) is now
discontinued.

Users of redmine in Debian 8 that want security updates are strongly
encouraged to upgrade now to the current Debian 9 stable release
(stretch).

For the detailed security status of redmine please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/redmine
