Debian Bug     : 889286

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in SimpleSAMLphp, a
framework for authentication, primarily via the SAML protocol.

CVE-2017-12867

     Attackers with access to a secret token could extend its validity
     period by manipulating the prepended time offset.

CVE-2017-12869

    When using the multiauth module, attackers can bypass authentication
    context restrictions and use any authentication source defined in
    the config.

CVE-2017-12873

    Defensive measures have been taken to prevent the administrator
    from misconfiguring persistent NameIDs to avoid identifier clash.
    (Affects Debian 8 Jesse only.)

CVE-2017-12874

    The InfoCard module could accept incorrectly signed XML messages
    in rare occasions.

CVE-2017-18121

    The consentAdmin module was vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting
    attack, allowing an attacker to craft links that could execute
     arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

CVE-2017-18122

    The (deprecated) SAML 1.1 implementation would regard as valid any
    unsigned SAML response containing more than one signed assertion,
    provided that the signature of at least one of the assertions was
    valid, allowing an attacker that could obtain a valid signed
    assertion from an IdP to impersonate users from that IdP.

CVE-2018-6519

    Regular expression denial of service when parsing extraordinarily
    long timestamps.

CVE-2018-6521

    Change sqlauth module MySQL charset from utf8 to utf8mb to
    prevent theoretical query truncation that could allow remote
    attackers to bypass intended access restrictions

SSPSA-201802-01 (no CVE yet)

    Critical signature validation vulnerability.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
