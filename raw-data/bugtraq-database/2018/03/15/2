Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1000120 CVE-2018-1000121 CVE-2018-1000122

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.

CVE-2018-1000120

    Duy Phan Thanh discovered that curl could be fooled into writing a
    zero byte out of bounds when curl is told to work on an FTP URL with
    the setting to only issue a single CWD command, if the directory part
    of the URL contains a "%00" sequence.

CVE-2018-1000121

    Dario Weisser discovered that curl might dereference a near-NULL
    address when getting an LDAP URL due to the ldap_get_attribute_ber()
    fuction returning LDAP_SUCCESS and a NULL pointer. A malicious server
    might cause libcurl-using applications that allow LDAP URLs, or that
    allow redirects to LDAP URLs to crash.

CVE-2018-1000122

    OSS-fuzz, assisted by Max Dymond, discovered that curl could be
    tricked into copying data beyond the end of its heap based buffer
    when asked to transfer an RTSP URL.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u10.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
