Not sure if this is related, but:
https://winbuzzer.com/2018/02/14/microsoft-just-killed-skype-classic-response-unfixable-security-bug-xcxwbn/

Microsoft today squashed a bug that was found in Skype’s updater
process earlier this week. However, it seems the company’s method for
stopping the flaw is to kill off the Skype classic experience. If that
is the case, users of Skype on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 could lose
access to the service.

As reported on Monday, a security vulnerability could give hackers
access to system-level privileges. If properly exploited, attackers
could use Skype as a backdoor to get full system rights and enter all
areas of an operating system.

In response, Microsoft said it was unable to fix the bug immediately
because it would require a lot of work. Indeed, the company said patch
the flaw would take a massive code rewrite. In other words, Microsoft
would need to overhaul the whole underpinning of the classic Skype
program.

It seems Microsoft found an alternative to rewriting code and fixing
Skype… the company has decided to effectively kill off the classic
app. The older version of Skype is no longer available anywhere as a
download.
