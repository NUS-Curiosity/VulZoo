Technical Details & Description:
================================
Insecure File Permissions vulnerability has been discovered in the
official Binance v1.5.0 software.
The vulnerability allows local attackers to exploit insecure permissions
setup for a software or process to exploit by manipulation.

The vulnerability exists due to insecure default permissions set on the
Binance.exe, start.exe and unins000.exe
There are no integrity checks or validation proof to ensure that the
executable file is not modified
during the runtime or after it.
A local attacker could exploit the local vulnerability by replacing
`Binance.exe` and `start.exe` or `unins000.exe` with a
malicious executable file.  The malicious file could execute or modify
with the LocalSystem permissions to followup with
successful exploitation.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
Binance for windows contains a vulnerability that could allow a local
attacker to gain elevated privileges.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below.


-- PoC Session Logs (Permissions) --

 AUTORITE NTSystème:(I)(F)
 BUILTINUtilisateurs:(I)(RX)
 AUTORITE NTUtilisateurs authentifiés:(I)(M)    <--- Modify

Information: 1 files correctly processed; 0 files failed to process


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Include multiple integrity checks for the software files on startup and
during the static runtime.
Change the access permissions for the process of all three executables
files (binance.exe, stat.exe & uninst00.exe).


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the insecure file permissions vulnerability and
missing integrity check in the software core is estimated as low.
