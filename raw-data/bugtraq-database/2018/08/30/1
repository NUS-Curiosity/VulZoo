Introduction:
-------------
ownCloud [1] is a suite of client-server software for creating file hosting services and using them. An app called Impersonate [2] was created to allow administrators to impersonate other users.

According to the documentation [3], group admins should only be able to access users of the groups they are administrator of.

Compass Security discovered that it was possible for a group admin to impersonate any user, except global administrators.

This way, group admins have access to data of users of other groups, even though they shouldn't.


Affected:
---------
Vulnerable:
 * Version 0.1.2

Not vulnerable:
 * Version 0.2.0

No other version was tested, but it is believed for the older versions to be vulnerable too.


Technical Description
---------------------
In order to reproduce the vulnerability, follow the steps below.

Create two groups:
 * group1
 * group2

Create four users as follows:
 * test1; group = group1; group admin = group1
 * test2; group = group1; group admin = no group
 * test3; group = group2; group admin = group2
 * test4; group = group2; group admin = no group

Activate the Impersonate app in Settings > Admin > Apps.

Go to Settings > Admin > Apps > User Authentication, check "Allow group admins to impersonate users from these groups" and add the two groups "group1" and "group2".

Log in with "test1", open the user page and impersonate the user "test2". There, intercept the POST request to /apps/impersonate/user and replace "target=test2" by "target=test3" in the body as shown below.

As a result, the user "test1" will impersonate the user "test3", even though "test1" is only group admin of "group1" and "test3" is not in this group.
