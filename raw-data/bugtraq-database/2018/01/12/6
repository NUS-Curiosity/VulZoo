Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Core Research Team discovered filter bypass and an application-side input validation vulnerability in the official SonicWall GMS v8.1 appliance web-application.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
DELL SonicWall
Product: SonicWall GMS Networks Appliance Application 8.1 (VA)


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent web vulnerability and filter bypass issue has been discovered in the SonicWall GMS v8.1 appliance web-application.
The application-side vulnerability allows remote attacker or privileged user accounts to inject own malicious persistent script codes
to the sonicwall gms appliance web-application. The filter bypass issue allows an attacker to bypass the basic application validation.

The vulnerability is located in the `newName` and `Name` values of the `/sgms/TreeControl` module POST method request. Attackers are 
able to inject own payloads as name in the firewall device name listing to compromise session data or the java module. The method to 
inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side of the sonicwall gms appliance web-application. 

The basic fitler validation of the gms appliance web-application encodes basic strings like frames and other tags by a restriction of 
privileges on execution of for example iframes. Remote attackers can bypass the validation by usage of a double path value with double 
quotes. The way to bypass is very unique to the basic configuration of the appliance web-application.

The security risk of the persistent vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.1. 
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires a low privileged account with restricted access and low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in persistent phishing mails, session hijacking, persistent external redirect 
to malicious sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Section(s):
[+] Firewall (Device List)			

Affected Module(s):
[+] ./sgms/TreeControl                          

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] newName
[+] name


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The filter bypass issue and persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Login to the gms 8.x appliance web-application
2. Click on top the firewall module in the menu
3. Surf to the firewall device listing
4. Change the input name to a script code payload
5. Save the entry
6. Now the no privleges exception occurs, refresh
7. The code executes in the firewall device listing
8. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!


PoC: Payload(s)

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a sanitize of the vulnerable firewall list name input. Restrict the input fields and disallow 
the usage of special chars. Deny to perform requests in the java frames with another java frame or script code. Parse the vulnerable 
output values in the list after saving. Implement a more secure exception-handling that logout the user on malicious interaction with 
the firewall. The code can also be injected with a non administrator account without write permission. Ensure that this config is get 
reset as well.

The vulnerability got patched by the sonicwall developer team during the intragtion process of the 31th october 2016 and was finally 
resolved 2017 Q1 (v8.2). Please update your gms appliance web-application via service update or by manual interaction to prevent attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability and filter bypass issue is estimated as medium. (CVSS 4.1)
