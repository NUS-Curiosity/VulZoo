comments that could lead to arbitrary code execution on the host running
Smarty.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.21-1+deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.31+20161214.1.c7d42e4+selfpack1-2+deb9u1.
