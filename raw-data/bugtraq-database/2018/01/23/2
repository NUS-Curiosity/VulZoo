speculative execution were publicly disclosed. These vulnerabilities may
impact the listed HPE products, potentially leading to information disclosure
and elevation of privilege. Mitigation and resolution of these
vulnerabilities may call for both an operating system update, provided by the
OS vendor, and a system ROM update from HPE.

RESOLUTION

On January 11, Intel announced issues with an increased frequency of reboots
when using the microcodes they released to address Variant 2 of the Spectre
Vulnerability for numerous processors including Broadwell, Haswell, Skylake,
Kaby Lake, Ivybridge, and Sandybridge processors.  Intel has now identified
the root cause of these issues and determined that these microcodes may
introduce reboots and other unpredictable system behavior.  Due to the
severity of the potential issues that may occur when using these microcodes,
Intel is now recommending that customers discontinue their use.  Additional
information is available from Intels Security Exploit Newsroom here:
<https://newsroom.intel.com/press-kits/security-exploits-intel-products/> . 
HPE is in alignment with Intel in our recommendation that customers
discontinue use of System ROMs including impacted microcodes and revert to
earlier System ROM versions.  

All System ROMs including impacted microcodes have been removed from the HPE
Support Site.  This impacts HPE ProLiant and Synergy Gen10, Gen9, and Gen8 v2
servers as well as HPE Superdome servers for which updated System ROMs had
previously been made available.  Intel is working on updated microcodes to
address these issues, and HPE will validate updated System ROMs including
these microcodes and make them available to our customers in the coming
weeks.  

Mitigations for Variant 1 (Spectre) and Variant 3 (Meltdown) vulnerabilities
require only OS updates and are not impacted.

  * HPE has provided a customer bulletin
<https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-a00039267en_us>
with specific instructions to obtain the udpated sytem ROM
  
  - Note:
   
    + CVE-2017-5715 (Variant 2) requires that the System ROM be updated and a
vendor supplied operating system update be applied as well.
    + For CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5754 (Variants 1 and 3) require only
updates of a vendor supplied operating system.
    + HPE will continue to add additional products to the list.
