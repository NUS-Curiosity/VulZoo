With respect to
https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-responds-to-security-research-findings/

The FreeBSD Security Team recently learned of the details of these
issues that affect certain CPUs. Details could not be discussed
publicly, but mitigation work is in progress.

Work is ongoing to develop and commit these mitigations to the FreeBSD
repository as soon as possible, with updates for releases to follow.
