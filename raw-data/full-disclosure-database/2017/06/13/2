#
# t2'17 - Call For Papers (Helsinki, Finland) - October 26 - 27, 2017
#

Do you have a fear of being naked[0] in front of other people? Can you
name a president[1] who has climbed a palm tree during an official state
visit? Do you prefer small and efficient airports? Would you like to
present world class research to a highly technical audience? If not sure
yet, please continue reading.

t2 infosec is warmly welcoming you to Helsinki, on October 26-27 2017 -
CFP is now open, and by submitting a talk, you get a chance to answer
one or more of the previous questions.

Finland, the country in the heart of darkness, has managed to survive
neutral and independent throughout its history despite facing pressure
from the global superpowers due to her geopolitically strategic
location. Dominance over the Baltic sea depends on controlling a handful
of islands, Åland islands being one of the areas of importance. In a
very typical Finnish fashion, we have embraced the 160 years of Åland
islands demilitarization by drinking at home, alone, in our
underwear[2]. Even Vogue[3] approves that.

While many people here would like to officially see us as the gateway
between east and west - either through our land border with Russia or
the fastest flights between Europe and Asia [4], the biggest advantage
comes from the side alleys of the Internet. On the imageboards, the last
sanctions for true freedom of speech, Finnish tactical meme capabilities
hold a special stature - loved, admired, feared and hated, sometimes all
of those at the same time. Classics like Spurdo spärde are shitposted
with an intensity only a country with a long history in developing
Linux, Internet protocols and mobile phones can provide, while new
organic highly viral OC is pushed out at a rate comparable to major
information warfare centers.

In addition to meeting the nation, which produces above average amounts
of hackers, memelords and F1 drivers per capita, Helsinki in October
offers you a mix of modern and classic architecture, saunas, casual
foreign intelligence activities [5], early days of Northern European
winter and cold weather, and chance to visit neighboring countries by
just hopping onto a ferry at one of the harbors.

We organize this conference out of love and do our best to make it a
memorable experience to both speakers and audience alike. If you're in
doubt, just send questions with #t2infosec hashtag on Twitter for an
(un)biased opinion. This is an event from hackers to hackers.

t2’17 offers you an audience with a taste for technical security
presentations containing original content. This is your chance to
showcase the latest research and lessons strategic offensive
capabilities, practical applications for 48 Laws of Power, snakeoil-less
security certifications, scientifically proven remote sensing, dropping
zero days during presentations, scaling defense or buildings, detection
mechanisms and tactics, preventing diamond heists, putting the ASL into
ASLR, new vulnerability classes or something completely different
containing love, happiness and traces of technical security.

The advisory board will be reviewing submissions until 2017-08-01.
First come, first served. Submissions will not be returned.
