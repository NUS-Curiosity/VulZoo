CVSSv3 Base Score: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
 
 
 
•	Information Disclosure Vulnerability– CVE-2017-5000
 
RSA Archer is affected by an information exposure through an error message vulnerability. A remote low privileged attacker may potentially exploit this vulnerability to use information disclosed in an error message to launch another more focused attack.
 
CVSSv3 Base Score : 4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
 
 
 
•	Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability– CVE-2017-5001
