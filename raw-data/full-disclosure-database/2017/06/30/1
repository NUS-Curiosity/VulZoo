Vendor description:
-------------------
"Mit der Spezifikation des Protokolls OSCI-Transport in der Version 1.2 wird
ein sicheres, herstellerunabhängiges und interoperables Datenaustauschformat
beschrieben.

Um die Implementierung für Anwender in der öffentlichen Verwaltung sowie der
Fachverfahrenshersteller zu erleichtern, wird die OSCI 1.2 Bibliothek angeboten:

Die Bibliothek implementiert OSCI-Transport in der Version 1.2 und ist damit
unabhängig von Fachinhalten. Sie ist Bestandteil der OSCI-Transport
Infrastruktur. Die OSCI-Transport-Bibliothek soll in Fachverfahren
(auf Verwaltungsseite) oder Clientsystemen (auf Kundenseite) implementiert
werden."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
During a short security test, SEC Consult found several severe security
vulnerabilities in the OSCI 1.2 Transport library.

The OSCI 1.2 Transport library is intended to provide a secure message exchange
channel over an untrusted network (i.e. the Internet) for German government
agencies for eGovernment.

However, SEC Consult found that multiple vulnerabilities allow attackers to
decrypt encrypted messages as well as modify signed messages. Moreover, a
vulnerability can be used to read arbitrary files from any host that implements
the OSCI 1.2 transport protocol using this library.

SEC Consult recommends KoSIT and its partners to _immediately_ stop using the
OSCI 1.2 Transport library over untrusted networks. Moreover, a forensic
investigation should be conducted on all affected systems to investigate
whether the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the past.

The library should only be used again after a thorough source code security
review has been conducted and all vulnerabilities have been fixed. It is
quite likely that further vulnerabilities exist as there are indications for
potential XML injection flaws.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) External Entity Injection (XXE) [CVE-2017-10670]
By sending manipulated XML data to any communication partner, an attacker is
able to conduct an XXE attack on the receiving system. This attack allows an
attacker to read arbitrary files from the file system of the victim host or to
conduct a denial of service attack.

2) Padding Oracle Attack [CVE-2017-10668]
The OCSI 1.2 Transport library only supports the following encryption
algorithms:
 * http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#tripledes-cbc
 * http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes128-cbc
 * http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes192-cbc
 * http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes256-cbc

All of these algorithms are no longer recommended by the W3C:
"Note: Use of AES GCM is strongly recommended over any CBC block encryption
algorithms as recent advances in cryptanalysis [...] have cast doubt on the
ability of CBC block encryption algorithms to protect plain text when used with
XML Encryption" (https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core1/)

Since the supported cipher algorithms do not provide protection against
modification (malleability) and the library reveals in an error message whether
decryption failed (error code 9202), SEC Consult was able to conduct a padding
oracle attack. This attack allows an attacker to bypass transport encryption.

3) Signature Wrapping attack [CVE-2017-10669]
By moving XML elements within the document tree, a signature wrapping attack can
be conducted. This allows an attacker to modify the contents of a signed message
arbitrarily without invalidating the signature.

4) Definition of a Deserialization Gadget
A class in the library defines the method readObject() that is used by Java to
deserialize a stream into an object. This method uses an XML parser to achieve
this. However, the XML parser used is configured to resolve external entities.
Therefore, an attacker who can influence data that deserialized by an
application can conduct an XXE attack (see finding 1).

Please note that the OSCI-Transport library only needs to be in the
classpath of an application - the vulnerable application does not need to
actually use the OSCI-Transport library! In order for this vulnerability to be
exploitable, an application needs to deserialize data that can be influenced by
an attacker.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
Due to the important role of the OSCI-Transport library in German e-Governemnt
we refrain from publishing proof of concept code at this time.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The OSCI 1.2 Transport library (osci-bibliothek.jar) in version 1.6.1 was found
to be vulnerable. This was the latest version at the time of discovery.


Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2017-01-16: Contacting CERT-Bund for coordination support with vendor and
            German government agencies
2017-01-23: CERT-Bund informed us that vendor has been contacted; vulnerability
            has been discussed; vendor wants to fix vulnerabilities as soon
            as possible
2017-02-10: Requesting status update from CERT-Bund
2017-02-20: Received statement from Governikus detailing their risk estimation
            based on an in-depth analysis of the vulnerabilities
2017-03-06: Proposing conference call to coordinate release of the advisory
2017-03-23: Conference call with BSI, Governikus, KoSIT; Discussing risks and
            mitigating factors; advisory release date set for 2017-06-30; fixed
            version has already been released
2017-03-31: Sending conference call protocol all participants
2017-04-07: Sending document with a list of all known potential attack scenarios
            to BSI and Governikus
2017-06-07: Sending preliminary advisory to Governikus
2017-06-21: Sending updated list of known potential attack scenarios to BSI and
            Governikus (XXE In-band scenario added)
