Subject: [FD] Path traversal in Photo Gallery may allow admins to read most
	files on the filesystem (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Photo Gallery
Version: 1.3.34,1.3.42
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/photo-gallery/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/path-traversal-in-photo-gallery-may-allow-admins-to-read-most-files-on-the-filesystem/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 4 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Description
================
Path traversal in Photo Gallery may allow admins to read most files on the filesystem

Vulnerability
================
The plugin contains a file manager component which allows broad access to the filesystem including deleting files, uploading files, and moving files. In this proof-of-concept we’ll be using path traversal to copy a configuration file from /etc into a web-readable directory in order to allow the attacker to read secrets.

Proof of concept
================

Visit: http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=galleries_bwg
Click Add new then Add Images
Right-click on the file manager overlay, click Inspect, and use the dev tools to get the URL of this iframe
Remove &extensions=jpg%2Cjpeg%2Cpng%2Cgif from the URL
Append &dir=/../../../../../../etc/ to the URL
Visit that URL
Select the passwd file by clicking on it once
Press the copy button in the toolbar
Press the up button repeatedly until you arrive back at wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery
Press the paste button
Visit http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/passwd to read the list of users

The number of ../ you need to add to the URL will vary, and the web server may be configured to only allow reading files with certain extensions.

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 1.3.43 or later.
