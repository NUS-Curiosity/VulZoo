Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
ocProducts Ltd
Product: Composr - Content Management System (Web-Application) 10.0.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the official Composr v10.0.0 content management system web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes to client-side browser to web-application requests for compromise.

The vulnerability is located in the `Error Exception` of the `Delete File` function. The remote attacker is able to inject own malicious code via 
GET method request in the `file` parameter to provoke an execution. The injection point is the `file` parameter and the execution point occurs in 
the error exception that displays the content to confirm a delete. The vulnerability is a classic cross site scripting issue with non-persistent 
attack vector by client-side exploitation. The error message content that is redisplayed is not properly parsed.

The security risk of the cross site scripting vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.3. 
Exploitation of the client-side cross site scripting vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and only low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external redirects to 
malicious sources and non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Delete File

Parameter(s):
[+] file

Affected Module(s):
[+] Error Exception-Handling


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The cross site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low or medium user interaction and without privileged user accounts.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a parse of the output in the error messag for invalid content on delete interaction.
This needs to be recognized during the development process in all the different delete functions.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side cross site scripting vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as medium (CVSS 3.3).
