Subject: [FD] New exploit for new vulnerability in WordPress Plugin +
	tutorial

Hi guys.

 

I fount a new vulnerabiliti in a wordpress plugin called: Direct Download
for WooCommerce.

 

This vulnerability allow you make an Remote LFI download, so, we can
download any in the server where were running this plugin, I fount this
vulnerability the last week and I reported this to Kameleon but i dont know
if this bug is partched right now in a new versión.

 

Ive been written an exploit to this plugin in Python. This exploit allow
you:

 

-          Test if the plugin exists in the server.

-          Download any file from the server where the WordPress plugin is
running.

-         Select any option by default or make your own personalized
download.

 

I published this exploit in my website today, here youve got the direct
link:
