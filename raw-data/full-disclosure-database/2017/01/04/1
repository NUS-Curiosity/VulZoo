Desc:
An independent research uncovered a critical vulnerability in zend-mail, a
Zend Framework's component that could potentially be used by (unauthenticated)
remote attackers to achieve remote arbitrary code execution in the context
of the web server user and remotely compromise the target web application.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website
components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms, password
email resets and others that send out emails with the help of a vulnerable
version of the zend-mail class.
