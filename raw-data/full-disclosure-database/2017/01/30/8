Subject: [FD] Free ebook to learn ethical hacking techniques

Hello List,

As a way of giving back to the community, I want to share an ebook about pentesting and ethical hacking. You can have it for free here :
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTDLGQQ

It illustrates a (fictitious) full hacking scenario: from creating a malicious file in a phishing campaign, all the way to exfiltrating data from a Mainframe (while knocking off some windows domains along the way).
I obviously could not do it without the great tools and authors in this community. Many thanks to all.
If I missed someone when crediting a tool or technique please feel free to write me :-)

Tchuss people !

S. Flow
