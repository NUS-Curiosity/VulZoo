ABOUT THE CONFERENCE

you Sh0t the Sheriff is a very unique, one-day, event dedicated to
bringing cutting edge talks to the top-notch professionals of the
Information Security Community.

The conferenceâ€™s main goal is to bring the attendees to the current
state of the information security world by bringing the most relevant
topics from different Infosec segments of the market and providing an
environment that is ideal for both networking and idea sharing.

YSTS is a an exclusive, mostly invite-only security con.

Getting a talk accepted, will, not only get you to the event, but
after you successfully present your talk, you will receive a
challenge-coin that guarantees your entry to YSTS for as long as the
conference exists.

Due to the great success of the previous years' editions, yes, we're
keeping the good old usual format:

* YSTS 11 will be held at an almost secret location only announced to
whom it may concern a couple of weeks before the con

* the venue will be, most likely, a very cool club or a bar
(seriously, check out the pictures)

* appropriate environment to network with great security folks from
Brazil and abroad

* since it is a one-day con with tons of talks and activities, we make
sure we fill everyone with coffee, food and booze


CONFERENCE FORMAT

Anything Information Security related is interesting for the
conference, which will help us create a cool and diverse line-up.
We strictly *do not* accept commercial/ product-related pitches.
Keep in mind though, this is a one-day conference, we receive a lot of
submissions, so your unique research with cool demos and any other
possible twist you can throw in to keep the audience engaged will
surely stand out to the other papers.


SPEAKER BENEFITS

(and yeah, that applies only to the 30 minute-long talks)

USD 1,000.00 per talk to help covering travel expenses for
international speakers
* Breakfast, lunch and dinner during conference
* Pre-and-post-conference official party (and the unofficial ones as well)
* Auditing products in traditional Brazilian barbecue restaurants
* Life-time free admission for all future YSTS conferences
