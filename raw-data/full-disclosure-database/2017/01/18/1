Subject: [FD] Announce Keypatch v2.1, a better assembler for IDA Pro!

Greetings,

We are happy to release Keypatch v2.1, the open-source award-winning
assembler tool for IDA Pro!

Based on Keystone engine, this new version of Keypatch brings some
important features, as follows.

- Added a new function to search for assembly instructions, so it is easy
to grep for ROP gadgets in the binary. This will be helpful for
exploitation writers.
- Removed the "Assembler" function, which is redundant since now you can
also do that with the "Search" function above.
- Better documentation for Linux & Windows installs.

Get Keypatch with all the source code & documentation at
http://www.keystone-engine.org/keypatch.

A tutorial for Keypatch is available at
http://www.keystone-engine.org/keypatch/tutorial/

Thanks,
Quynh
