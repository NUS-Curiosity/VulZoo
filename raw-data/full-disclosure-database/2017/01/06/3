Subject: [FD] CarolinaCon-13 - May 2017 - Call for Papers/Presenters and
 Attendees

h4x0rs, stuff-breakers, InfoSec pros, g33k girls, international spies, and script kidz,


CarolinaCon-13 will occur on May 19th-21st 2017 in Raleigh NC (USA).  We are now officially accepting speaker/paper/demo submissions for the event.


If you are somewhat knowledgeable in any interesting field of hacking, technology, hacking, infosec, hacking, robotics, hacking, science, hacking, global thermonuclear war, hacking, lock-picking, etc. (but mostly hacking) AND you are interested in presenting at CarolinaCon, we cordially invite you to submit your proposal.  Please send;
- your name or handle/alias
- the presentation name/title
- a brief topic abstract (1-2 paragraphs)
- the estimated time-length of your presentation
- a brief bio (100% optional item, but if your talk is chosen it saves the time and trouble of asking for it later)

....via e-mail to:
speakers<at>carolinacon.org

*NOTE: All submissions are due BY March 31, 2017 (or April 1st at the very, very latest).  However we may be making some early selections again this year from among the submissions, so please be timely if you're committed to being part of the elite cadre of chosen presenters.  We value diversity so please don't hesitate to propose your ideas no matter how outlandish.


If you present at the Con, you will receive;
- free CarolinaCon admission for yourself and one guest
- one free CarolinaCon T-shirt  (l33t)
- free transportation between RDU airport and the conference hotel (if needed)
- fame, glory, and possibly even notoriety
- mad props and much love from our staff and attendees
- 100 brown M&Ms (Ozzy gets 1,000 of them on his tours, but he's Ozzy and we aren't - Van Halen gets zero of them)
- possibly other small perks (details still being hashed out based on budget)


ATTENDEES:
If you are interested in attending please visit our ultra-modern website for more details:

...and don't forget to mark the May 19th, 2017 date on your calendar.


If you have any important (as in not-dumb and not-chinese-spam) inquiries about the event you can send email to:

Peace,
Vic
