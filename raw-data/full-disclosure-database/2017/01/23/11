Subject: [FD] New mailing-list on IoT hacking

Folks,

We have created a new mailing-list: IoT Hackers
(<https://lists.si6networks.com/mailman/listinfo/iot-hackers>).

It is meant to provide forum for security researchers and networking
professionals to discuss low-level networking and security issues
related to IoT.

Subscription to the list is open to the community. However, posts to the
list from new subscribers are moderated, in order to keep an acceptable
signal/noise ratio.

Please subscribe here:
<https://lists.si6networks.com/mailman/listinfo/iot-hackers>

FWIW, the list aims to share the same spirit as the IPv6 hackers list
(<https://lists.si6networks.com/mailman/listinfo/ipv6hackers>), but
focusing on a different topic.

Thanks,
-- 
Fernando Gont
