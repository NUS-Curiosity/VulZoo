Subject: [FD] Hotlinking Vulnerability in PHProxy 0.5b2

A flaw exists in PHProxy 0.5b2 hotlinking feature which allow anyone using
some coding to link to proxified pages.

By default hotlinking is active to prevent users from retrieving pages
directly from the proxy requiring them to use the form. This can be easily
bypassed.

This is the same type of vulnerability found on Glype 1.4.4. Other
webproxies may be vulnerable too...
