Subject: [FD] pev 0.80 released

Hi there!

This is to let you guys know we just released a new version of pev, our
open source, multi-platform toolkit to analyze PE files. We do have a hard
mission: analyze PE files without relaying on Windows API but we've been
achieving this with our own PE library that we called libpe, written
entirely in C, just like all other pev tools.

We'd love to hear your feedback, if you have some.

Code: https://github.com/merces/pev

Thanks a lot!
