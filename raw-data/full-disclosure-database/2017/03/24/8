Subject: [FD] Faraday v2.4: Collaborative Penetration Test and Vulnerability
 Management Platform

March is already rolling and so is our work. Today we feel so happy to
share a new release, Faraday v2.4!

Before preparing an upcoming release, we try to focus not only on
improving the product but also on perfecting the user experience. We
want to go beyond optimizing your everyday work, inspiring you to do
more!

Faraday is the Integrated Multiuser Risk Environment you were looking
for! It maps and leverages all the knowledge you generate in real
time, letting you track and understand your audits. Our dashboard for
CISOs and managers uncovers the impact and risk being assessed by the
audit in real-time without the need for a single email. Developed with
a specialized set of functionalities that helps users improve their
own work, the main purpose is to re-use the available tools in the
community taking advantage of them in a collaborative way! Check out
the Faraday project in Github.

LDAP support:

Yes, Faraday's bucket list is an item shorter as of this release! LDAP
support has been on the horizon for quite some time now, but not
anymore - this brand new version comes with LDAP support out of the
box, no additional modules required, isn't that neat?

Why LDAP? Well, because a great number of companies around the world
use it to centralize their user account management. The protocol
provides total control over the credentials in all the platforms,
which comes in pretty handy when managing large volumes of data. In
fact, LDAP is so popular that some companies have a policy to only use
tools that support LDAP authentication.

By adding LDAP support to Faraday, we give our clients the possibility
to manage larger teams, implement large-scale installations and
maintain a granular and simple control over their user accounts.

In addition, using Faraday over LDAP provides better configuration
than ever, allowing complex credential policies such as password
expiration and quality standards, or credential lockout.

Faraday Plugin:

We made some changes to the Faraday Plugin, improving its
functionality by allowing users to run it through the GTK interface,
performing actions in batch and filtering objects.

One of the best things about this new version of the Plugin is that
you can now use it to script some of the most boring tasks needed in
every assessment.

We also added a menu option to run directly from GTK!

New menu item in GTK allows users to run Fplugin without having to
type anything!

Details are everything

And that is what this release is all about. We believe that correcting
very specific details and introducing small improvements also adds
quality and efficiency to a platform like ours. So it is in those
items that we focused on the last iteration.
