The Event

Balkan Computer Congress is an annual three days gathering of the
international hacker community in the organization of LUGoNS – Linux
Users Group of Novi Sad. The first part of the program has been
envisaged to be a set of presentations, workshops and lectures on the
current topics regarding privacy, technology, software development, free
software & socio-political issues. Hands-on projects and hacking have
been planned for the second part of the program.

The Location:
Novi Sad is the center of Vojvodina, northern province of Serbia, famous
for its multicultural history and active artistic and technological
scene (e.g., music festival Exit and digital-media event Share). With a
prestigious night life combined with the warm and welcoming character,
Novi Sad offers inexpensive prices for lodging and dining, compared to
the neighboring EU. If you’re in Novi Sad or nearby during these dates,
this is the place you want to be!
