Subject: Re: [FD] TS Session Hijacking / Privilege escalation all windows
	versions

So this is a pretty big issue, which it looks like the Mimikatz guys
flagged in an all French blog post in 2011 but it flew under the radar.

I've written about it here:

Now, you might well say 'If you have SYSTEM you already own the box' - and
you're right.  But with one command you can remotely hijack Windows
sessions, including disconnected ones (e.g. RDP sessions where the user is
on holiday).  It even unlocks the workstation if locked, and works for the
physical console.
