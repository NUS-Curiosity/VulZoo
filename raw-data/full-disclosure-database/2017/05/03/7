Vulnerability Class:
====================
Cross Site Scripting - Persistent


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Zenario is a web-based content management system for sites with one or many languages. It's designed to grow with 
your site, adding extranet, online database and custom functionality when you need it. Zenario 7.2 has a new feature 
to add CSS styles and media queries, thereby allowing you to make mobile-friendly "responsive" email newsletters.

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation vulnerability has been discovered in the official Zenario v7.1 - v7.6 content management system.
The cross site scripting vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script code via persistent attack vector.

The persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is located in the `zenario_fbWarning - snippet_warning` parameters of 
the `organizer.php` and `admin_boxes.ajax.php` files. Limited admin accounts and translator accounts are able to takeover 
the full admin account by manipulation of the delete post method request content. The attacker with the low privilege admin 
account injects his code without visible execution to the database management system via web-application. The execution 
point occurs in case of an item delete request by the full admin user account. The request method to inject is POST and 
the attack vector of the vulnerability is persistent on the application-side.

The security risk of the xss vulnerability is estimated as medium with a common vulnerability scoring system count of 3.6. 
Exploitation of the persistent xss web vulnerability requires a limited admin user account and only low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent phishing attacks, session hijacking, persistent external 
redirect to malicious sources and persistent manipulation of affected or connected web module context.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST 

Vulnerable Function(s):
[+] Delete Function (Item)

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] admin_boxes.ajax.php
[+] organizer.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] zenario_fbWarning - snippet_warning

Affected Module(s):
[+] ./zenario/admin/


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation vulnerability can be exploited by restricted user accounts with low user interaction.
For security demonstraton or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce ...
1. Login with the restricted account to the frontend or backend of zenario
2. Add any new function, role, group, module, form or post to the dbms via post
3. Now, logout and login with a high privilege admin user test account 
4. Improve the backend by processing to delete the new entry of the other low privilege user account
Note: A warning occurs that displays the input of the content that should be deleted
4. The execution occurs on each delete request via post of a high privilege admin account in the zerario_fbWarning exception message content
5. Successful reproduce of the persistent cross site scripting vulnerability!

Note: In the security check we used a limited admin account to takeover the full admin account to compromise via backend

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1. Escape the content that is displayed of the database management system in the warning message content
2. Disallow the usage of special chars on in warning messages and replace the content to sanitize


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent cross site scripting vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.6)
