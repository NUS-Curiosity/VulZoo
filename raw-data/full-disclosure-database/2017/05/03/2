Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The vulnerability laboratory core research team discovered an insecure file permission privilege escalation vulnerability in the official Icecream Ebook Reader v4.53 software.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2016-04-27:	Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Icecream Apps Ltd
Product: Icecream - Software (Windows) 4.53 & Pro


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An insecure file permissions vulnerability has been discovered in the official Icecream Ebook Reader v4.53 software.
The vulnerability allows local attackers with system user accounts to elevate the access to higher system privileges.

The issue exists because of an insecure default permissions set in the "unins000.exe" or "ebookreader.exe" files. 
Local attackers are able to elevate the access permission of the software process by successful exploitation.  
Local attackers could exploit the vulnerability by a replace of the "unins000.exe" or "ebookreader.exe" files 
with a malicious executable file. The malicious file is exectuable with the local system user permissions.

The security risk of the issue is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.1. 
Exploitation of the software vulnerability requires a low privilege system user account with restricted access and 
without user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in system process compromise and 
further manipulation or exploitation to compromise the local computer operating system.



Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The local privilege escalation vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers without user interaction and with system user account.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
