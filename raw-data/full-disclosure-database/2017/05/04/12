Subject: [FD] ES File Explorer android app snoops data to China Unicom
 network via insecure HTTP

Hi,

With the ES File Explorer android app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop)) installed on my phone, when I monitored the network connections on my phone via the Network Connections app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antispycell.connmonitor (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antispycell.connmonitor)), I found that it frequently transferred data to an IP address (123.125.114.8) on the Chinese state owned China Unicom network (https://www.whois.com/whois/123.125.114.8 (https://www.whois.com/whois/123.125.114.8)) via insecure HTTP connection. This is a privacy risk, as anyone can monitor the data exchanged over this unencrypted link & also constant data exchange with this IP address raises spying concerns. 

Attached is a screenshot of the Network Connections app showing the insecure HTTP connection used by the ES File Explorer app.

Thanks.
