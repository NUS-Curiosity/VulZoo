The need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques has
been widely recognized. This workshop discusses the problems of
privacy in the global interconnected societies and possible solutions.
The 2017 Workshop, held in conjunction with the ACM CCS conference, is
the sixteenth in a yearly forum for papers on all the different
aspects of privacy in today's electronic society.

The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting
novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of electronic
privacy, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems. We
encourage submissions from other communities such as law and business
that present these communities' perspectives on technological issues.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- anonymization and trasparency
- crowdsourcing for privacy and security

PAPER SUBMISSIONS
-----------------

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings. Regular submissions should be at most 10
pages in the ACM double-column format
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) including
bibliography, but excluding well-marked appendices, and at most 12
pages total. Committee members are not required to read the
appendices, and so the paper should be intelligible without them.
Submissions should not be anonymized. The workshop will also consider
short submissions of up to 4 pages for results that are preliminary or
that simply require few pages to describe. Authors of regular
submitted papers will indicate at the time of submission whether they
would like their paper to also be considered for publication as a
short paper (4 proceedings pages).

Submissions are to be made to the submission web site at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wpes2017. You will be
requested to upload the file of your paper (in PDF format only).
Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without
consideration of their merits. Papers must be received by the deadline
of **August 4, 2016** to be considered. Notification of acceptance or
rejection will be sent to authors by September 8, 2017. The camera
ready must be prepared by September 17, 2017 (firm). Proceedings of
the workshop will be published by ACM on a CD, available to the
workshop attendees. Papers will be included in the ACM Digital
Library, with a specific ISBN. Each accepted paper must be presented
by an author, who will have to be registered by the early-bird
registration deadline.
