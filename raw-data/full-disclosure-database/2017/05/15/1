Subject: [FD] Multiple crashes in OpenEXR

Attached is a zip file of EXR images that cause segmentation faults in the OpenEXR library (tested against 2.2.0). http://www.openexr.com/downloads.html <http://www.openexr.com/downloads.html>

These were reported to ehanway@....com <mailto:ehanway@....com> on January 12, 2017, but no updates or information has been reported back. I have attempted to see what the status is, but no responses from ILM. Since this has surpassed the general 90-day mark as is standard for many disclosures, these are being disclosed. Itâ€™s actually been 120 days exactly.

You can see the last update to the OpenEXR codebase was on January 9. https://github.com/openexr/openexr <https://github.com/openexr/openexr>

Of note is that Adobe Photoshop actually ships with a version of OpenEXR for reading EXR images, so some of these images also crash Photoshop. ImageMagick also can support EXR image by using the OpenEXR library. https://github.com/ImageMagick/exr/tree/master/openexr <https://github.com/ImageMagick/exr/tree/master/openexr>

As of this writing, these issues are unfixed. No CVEs have been requested.
