                        com>                                                  
         CVE Name       

    Description  The multi-part body parser in PJSIP contains a logical       
                 error that can make certain multi-part body parts attempt    
                 to read memory from outside the allowed boundaries. A        
                 specially-crafted packet can trigger these invalid reads     
                 and potentially induce a crash.                              
                                                                              
                 The issue is within the PJSIP project and not in Asterisk.   
                 Therefore, the problem can be fixed without upgrading        
                 Asterisk. However, we will be releasing a new version of     
                 Asterisk where the bundled version of PJSIP has been         
                 updated to have the bug patched.                             
                                                                              
                 If you are using Asterisk with chan_sip, this issue does     
                 not affect you.                                              

    Resolution  We have submitted the error report to the PJProject           
                maintainers and have coordinated a release...........
