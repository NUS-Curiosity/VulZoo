Subject: [FD] CSRF/Stored XSS in MSMC – Redirect After Comment could allow unauthenticated individuals to do almost anything (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: MSMC - Redirect After Comment
Version: 2.1.2
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/msmc-redirect-after-comment/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/csrf-stored-xss-in-msmc-redirect-after-comment/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF/Stored XSS in MSMC – Redirect After Comment could allow unauthenticated individuals to do almost anything

Vulnerability
================
An unauthenticated individual can cause arbitrary JavaScript to execute within /wp-admin/ in the browser of a logged-in admin user. This could be achieved by sending a link to the admin user.
The attacker could use this to create a new user, create posts, add arbitrary PHP code (if the theme/plugin editor component is enabled) – almost anything a logged-in admin user can do.

Proof of concept
================
Step 1: Log in.
Step 2: Visit this URL to store the arbitrary HTML: http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=msmc-comment-redirect&action=1&MSMC_redirect_location=http://localhost/?%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E
Step 3: Visit this URL to execute the JavaScript: http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=msmc-comment-redirect
Step 3 is unnecessary in browsers without XSS filtering (i.e. Firefox).

Mitigations
================
The plugin author has indicated that this plugin is abandonware and has unpublished it from the WordPress directory. Disable and uninstall the plugin as this bug won’t be fixed.
