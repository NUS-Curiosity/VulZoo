Subject: [FD] Faraday v2.5: Collaborative Penetration Test and Vulnerability
 Management Platform

Faraday is the Integrated Multiuser Risk Environment you were looking
for! It maps and leverages all the knowledge you generate in real
time, letting you track and understand your audits. Our dashboard for
CISOs and managers uncovers the impact and risk being assessed by the
audit in real-time without the need for a single email. Developed with
a specialized set of functionalities that helps users improve their
own work, the main purpose is to re-use the available tools in the
community taking advantage of them in a collaborative way!

Data Analysis tools:

Since Faraday allows you to keep all of your pentests in one place, we
thought it would be interesting to add the possibility to see your
assessments come to life, so we added new data analysis reports to the
Web UI:

Tools findings by severity and targets
Vulnerability severity cluster
 Severity timeline
 Service vulnerability timeline
 Target severity pie charts
 OS severity pie charts
 Severity by tool boxplot
 Total vulnerability correlation with price by each OS
 Vulnerability by type chart, ease of resolution and OS
 Vulnerability by year tree

These charts allow you to find new relations between your data and
clarify the state of an assessment.
We will also add new charts in the future, and the possibility to
customize them as well!

* Credentials CRUD:
One of the big goals in every internal pentest is gathering service
credentials to log in to a host, escalate privileges and pivot.
Wouldn't it be great if you could store all your credentials in one
place? Now you can! Save all the found creds in Faraday's DB, query it
using the Faraday Plugin and feed other tools to keep hacking!

* Vuln templates CRUD:
Manually creating vulnerabilities has always been a nuisance, from
getting evidence to wording the descriptions - no one likes it. And
also, explanations vary between testers, so what sounds perfectly
understandable to one person can be gibberish to another.

Knowing this is a continuous issue when reporting, we added the
Vulnerability Templates Database in version 1.0.12. We knew back then
that editing a CSV and uploading it every time a change was needed
wasn't the best approach, but other features came first when
prioritizing.

An improvement on this feature was long overdue so we created a brand
new view in the Web UI just to manage these templates. You can now
upload a CSV file from the Web UI and then edit the templates as
desired.

But wait! The plot thickens! You can also create a template from an
existing vulnerability!
Write your vulns once, and use them forever.

* Hosts revamp:
When users wanted to edit or create hosts in previous Faraday
versions, the only options was through a modal dialog. This was
especially annoying in small screens, when scrolling and cluttered
information became a hassle.

Keeping in mind that managing hosts is a very important task to
pentesters and managers alike we decided to update the hosts manager.
As of this version you can examine, create and edit hosts from the
same full view. Since it is no longer a modal dialog, the whole
browser window is used, allowing to have all of the host details,
along with its services in plain sight. No more scrolling, no more
three clicks to get the host info!

* Plugins Core Improvements:
Faraday's Plugin System is a core piece of the platform and that is
why we constantly work on adding new tools and improving the ones we
already support.
In this iteration we improved the system itself so that plugins can
access the error console and communicate with the user in a simplified
manner.

On the maintenance side, we fixed a bug in the Nessus plugin which
locked the vuln edition after processing and added support for
SQLmap's -r argument that allows adding an HTTP request file instead
of manually loading the URL and headers. We also modified a few other
plugins (Core Impact, Netsparker, Nikto, Propecia, Qualysguard,
SQLmap, Telnet and Wapiti) to improve the content of the
vulnerabilities that are added to the platform, creating better
Executive Reports.

* Misc:
It's not uncommon for our users to switch between versions (for
example, when upgrading from Community to Pro) and some issues arose
in that process. Keeping that use case in mind, we improved how the
Faraday Client verifies its version against the Server to avoid
further issues in the future.

Also, we did some improvements in GTK's link to the Web UI and
corrected a bug that prevented the Web UI from saving changes to
workspaces created using the GTK Client.

Regarding the Executive Report, we fixed a minor bug that generated
inconsistent reports when grouping regular vulns with web vulns.

Target, website, param name and path are grouped correctly
 With the new additions to the Web UI, the left navigation bar was
overloaded so we removed the administrative links (Workspaces, Users
and Licenses) and added them to a new admin menu on the top right,
along with a link to the Help page and an about dialog.

Changes and fixes:

- Added a Data Analysis component to the Web UI
- Fixed a bug in the GTK interface when trying to configure an non-existent URL
- Always redirect to login page when user is not logged in
- Prevent users with role client to login using GTK
- Disable host and vuln edit buttons when logged in as client
- Fixed the server, which was refusing some valid licenses
- Improved grouping in Executive Reports
- Redirect to home page when a logged user visits login page
- Fixed bug when editing workspaces created in GTK
- Improved host search in the WEB UI
- Extended the config to support different searching engines in the WEB UI
- Check that client and server versions match when connecting
- Adds the 'v' and 'version' argument for both the server and the client
- Fixed "refresh" button in the Web UI
- Fix API on /ws/<workspace> with duration object None
- Added a CRUD for Credentials to the Web UI
- Bug fixes on the Burp Online Plugin
- Added a script to connect with Reposify
- Fixed Hostname import in Nessus Plugin
- Make plugin methods log() and devlog() work again
- Fixed bug in SQLMap plugin that made the client freeze
- Improved SQLMap plugin to support more options and to show errors in
GTK log console
- Fixed bug when creating/updating Credentials
- Improve plugins usage of vulnweb URL fields
- Fixed order of Report Plugins in the GTK import list

We hope you enjoy it, and let us know if you have any questions or comments.
