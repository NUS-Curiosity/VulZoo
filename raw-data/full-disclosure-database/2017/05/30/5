Subject: [FD] SSD Advisory – KEMP LoadMaster from XSS Pre Authentication to RCE

Link: https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3194


*Vulnerability Summary*
KEMP’s main product, the LoadMaster, is a load balancer built on its own
proprietary software platform called LMOS, that enables it to run on almost
any platform: As a KEMP LoadMaster appliance, a Virtual LoadMaster (VLM)
deployed on Hyper-V, VMWare, on bare metal or in the public cloud. KEMP is
available in Azure, where it is in the top 15 deployed applications as well
as in AWS and VMWare vCloud Air.

A cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in KEMP
LoadMaster v7.135.0.13245 (latest). A non authenticated user is able to
inject his own malicious Javascript code into the system and use it to
create a new web administrator user.


*Vendor response*We were unable to get an update beyond this statement from
the vendor:
Expect a fix in our new version available Jan 2017.
