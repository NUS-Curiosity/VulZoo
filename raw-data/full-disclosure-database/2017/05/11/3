Subject: [FD] trashbilling.com and Trashflow 3.0.0 Multiple Issues

A blog post with information located here:
https://thenopsled.com/trashbilling.html

============
Introduction
============

This was a basic vulnerability analysis of trashbilling.com (which I am 
required to use to pay my trash bill), and Trashflow 3.0, which updates 
trashbilling.com from the Trash Hauler side.  My disclosure intent was 
to force Ivy Computers Inc to re-assess their security posture as it was 
severely lacking.  This is a full disclosure following their 90 day 
remediation period.

============
List Summary
============

trashbilling.com:

-Account enumeration/PII Leak [major]: trashbilling.com uses client side 
identification without a password to access billing software, revealing 
names/email/address/phone as well as partial CC data.
     >This client side validation is unobfuscated javascript
-SQLI [major]- vulnerability contained in CC update field, giving access 
to billing database, on any user
-XSS [minor]- vulnerability in email update field
-DOS [minor]- no restriction on setting another user's password, could 
block all users from accessing their data

Trashflow 3.0:

-Hardcoded credentials [medium]- FTP hardcoded credentials available in 
plaintext during backup and update software operations
-Hardcoded credentials [medium]- Software billing credentials hardcoded 
in helper binary cash_drawer_cc.exe (allows editing of user billing 
data)
-Public Exploits [medium]- FTP servers run off vsFTPd 2.0.5, risking 
numerous DOS vulnerabilities
