I am curious why the attachment was removed when posted to the FD list. It made it through the OSS list.

Note the application/zip attachment. http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/05/09/8 <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/05/09/8>

If anyone wants the attachment, feel free to ask off list.
