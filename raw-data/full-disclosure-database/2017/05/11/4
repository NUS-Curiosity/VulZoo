3. Brief Vulnerability Description
==================================
During the security analysis, ThunderScan discovered Cross-Site
Scripting and remote Denial of Service vulnerabilities in Tracking
Code Manager plugin. Denial of Service requires only one visit to a
specific URL and whole WordPress becomes completely unresponsive until
restart. DoS is based upon the ability of the user to select and call
a function of it's choice (while safisfying specific conditions). By
making a recursive call to the function that handles the request
(tcmp_do_action()) DoS can easily be accomplished.

Both vulnerabilities can be found in the settings section of the
plugin, and can be remotely triggered due to missing nonce token and
validation. Since the DoS vulnerability relies on GET requests, is
missing the nonce token, the vulnerability is also directly exposed to
attack vectors such as Cross Site request forgery (CSRF).

DoS vulnerability was confirmed on windows OS.

  URL Parameter:    tcmp_action
  Vulnerable URL:
