Vendor description:

"InvoicePlane is a self-hosted open source application for managing your
quotes, invoices, clients and payments."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory, an attacker can
fully compromise the web server which has InvoicePlane installed. Potentially
sensitive invoice data might get exposed through this attack.

SEC Consult recommends not to attach InvoicePlane to the network until a
thorough security review has been performed by security professionals and all
identified issues have been resolved.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. Arbitrary File Upload
An authenticated user can upload a malicious file to the webserver. It is
possible for an attacker to upload a script which is able to compromise the
webserver.

2. Stored Cross Site Scripting
This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to inject malicious client
side script which will be executed in the browser of users if they visit
the manipulated site.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. Arbitrary File Upload
Below URL is used to upload the malicious file through the attachment
segment.

URL     : http://$DOMAIN/index.php/invoices/view/$INVOICE-ID


2. Stored Cross Site Scripting
The following parameters have been found to be vulnerable against
stored cross site scripting. Furthermore, there exist many more
vulnerable parameters.

The following payload shows a simple alert message box:
URL     : http://$DOMAIN/index.php/clients/view/$Client-ID
METHOD  : POST
PAYLOAD : client_name="onmouseover=prompt("XSS")>

URL     : http://$DOMAIN/index.php/index.php/users/form/$User-ID
METHOD  : POST
PAYLOAD : user_name="onmouseover=prompt("XSS1")>


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
InvoicePlane version 1.4.10 has been tested. This version was the latest
at the time the security vulnerabilities were discovered.


Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2017-04-11: Contacting vendor through mail@...oiceplane.com
2017-04-11: Vendor requests security advisory to be shared over unencrypted
            channel.
