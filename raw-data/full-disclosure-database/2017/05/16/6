Subject: [FD] Stealing Windows Credentials Using Google Chrome

Hi,

Attacks that leak authentication credentials using the SMB file sharing
protocol on Windows OS are an ever-present issue, exploited in various ways
but usually limited to local area networks. One of the rare research
involving attacks over the internet was recently presented by Jonathan
Brossard and Hormazd Billimoria at the Black Hat security conference in
2015. However, there have been no publicly demonstrated SMB authentication
related attacks on browsers other than Internet Explorer and Edge in the
past decade. This paper describes an attack which can lead to Windows
credentials theft, affecting the default configuration of the most popular
browser in the world today, Google Chrome, as well as all Windows versions
supporting it.
