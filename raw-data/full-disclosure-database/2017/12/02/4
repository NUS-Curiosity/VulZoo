NorthSec 2018, one of the biggest applied security events in Canada,

May 14-15-16 - Profesional Training Sessions - Syllabus Announced Soon
May 17-18    - Security Conference & Workshops
May 18-19-20 - The biggest 48H on-site CTF in the World, with 450+ attendees

* We are looking for great speakers to submit talks or workshops to
our 2018 CFP at http://www.nsec.io/cfp

We cover a wide range of subjects, including but not limited to:
application & infrastructure security, pentesting, network security,
software and/or hardware exploitation, web hacking, reverse
engineering,  malware/virii/rootkits, or anything low-level that makes
your personal clock tick !

We also will talk about cryptography & obfuscation, from theoretical
cryptosystems to applied cryptography exploitation, cryptocurrencies,
steganography and covert communication systems â€” anything goes!

Society & ethics issues will also be part of the show. Technical
subjects are at the core of the security field, yet we also exist in a
world of humans and are affected by our social and political contexts.
If you want to exchange great ideas about digital society and its
privacy and security implications, NorthSec's the place to be!

* Registration for the event is up at http://northsec.eventbrite.ca
(and 50% OFF for a limited time)

About NorthSec:

For the last years, NorthSec has been recognized as one of the biggest
applied security events in Canada. Organized by the community, for the
community, and aimed at raising the knowledge and technical expertise
of professionals and students alike.
We are determined to create a high quality security forum by combining
professional training sessions, a high quality security conference by
the brightest in their field of expertise, followed by an intense 48
hour on-site CTF contest.

All of this in the great city of Montreal, often cited as one of the
most party/hedonistic city & often named as the best traveller's
choice in North America.
