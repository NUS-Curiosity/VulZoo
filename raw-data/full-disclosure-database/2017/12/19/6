3. Vulnerability Description
============================
During the security analysis, ThunderScan discovered SQL injection and
Local file inclusion vulnerabilities in Booking Calendar WordPress
plugin.

The easiest way to reproduce the SQL injection vulnerabilities is to
send the specified parameter to the provided URL while being logged in
as administrator or another user that is authorized to access the
plugin settings page. Users that do not have full administrative
privileges could abuse the database access the vulnerabilities provide
to either escalate their privileges or obtain and modify database
contents they were not supposed to be able to.

By requesting a specially crafted URL, the attacker can cause remote
server to execute a php file of his choosing. Although the user
requesting the URL has to be logged into the WordPress administrative
console, the attacker can cause the administrator to request such a
URL by using various social engineering/phishing approaches. Specified
file will be interpreted by php interpreter, and any valid php code
will indeed be executed. If the php installation on server has
"allow_url_include=1" configuration option set, this attack can be
expanded to execute a php file from any remote URL. If the php version
is less than 5.3.4, the ".php" that gets appended to the end of the
file name attacker chose can be omitted by adding a null character
("%00") to the requested URL, and enable the attacker to execute any
file, regardless of the extension.

Due to the CSRF token needed to perform the attack the risk is lowered
to medium.

        ...
        162    $approved_id_str = join( ',', $approved_id);
        ...
        165    if ( false === $wpdb->query( $wpdb->prepare( "UPDATE
{$wpdb->prefix}bookingdates SET approved = %s WHERE booking_id IN
({$approved_id_str})", $is_approve_or_pending ) ) ){     
        ---------

        ...
        114    wpbc_update_number_new_bookings( $arrayof_bookings_id,
$is_new , $user_id );
        ---------
  File: booking\lib\wpdev-booking-functions.php
        ---------
        1468 function wpbc_update_number_new_bookings(
$id_of_new_bookings, $is_new = '0' , $user_id = 1 ){
        ...
        1485   $update_sql = "UPDATE {$wpdb->prefix}booking AS bk SET
bk.is_new = {$is_new} WHERE bk.booking_id IN  ( {$id_of_new_bookings} ) ";
        ...
        1487   if ( false === $wpdb->query( $update_sql  ) ) {
        ---------

3.3 PHP file inclusion
  Function: include()
  Variable: $_POST['captcha_chalange']

$prefix, $bktype ) {
        ...
        23       $correct = $captcha_instance->check($prefix,
$the_answer_from_respondent);
