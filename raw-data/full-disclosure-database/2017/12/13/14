          CVE Name        

    Description  If a compound RTCP packet is received containing more than   
                 one report (for example a Receiver Report and a Sender       
                 Report) the RTCP stack will incorrectly store report         
                 information outside of allocated memory potentially causing  
                 a crash.                                                     
                                                                              
                 For all versions of Asterisk this vulnerability requires an  
                 active call to be established.                               
                                                                              
                 For versions of Asterisk 13.17.2, 14.6.2, 15.0.0,            
                 13.13-cert6 and greater an additional level of security is   
                 placed upon RTCP packets. If the probation period for        
                 incoming RTP traffic has passed any received RTCP packets    
                 must contain the same SSRC as the RTP traffic. If the RTCP   
                 packets do not then they are dropped. This ensures other     
                 parties can not inject RTCP packets without they themselves  
                 establishing an active call.                                 

    Resolution  The RTCP stack has been changed so the report information is  
                always stored in allocated memory. The provided patches can   
                be applied to the appropriate version or the latest version   
                of Asterisk can be installed to receive the fix.
