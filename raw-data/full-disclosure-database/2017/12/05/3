Subject: [FD] CVE-2017-15357 Local root privesc in Arq Backup <= 5.9.6

Arq Backup from Haystack Software is a great application for backing up 
macs and
windows machines. Unfortunately versions of Arq for mac before 5.9.7 are
vulnerable to a local root privilege escalation exploit.

The updater binary has a "setpermissions" function which sets the suid 
bit and
root ownership on itself but it suffers from a race condition that 
allows you to
swap the destination for these privileges using a symlink.

We can exploit this to get +s and root ownership on any arbitrary 
binary.

Other binaries in the application also suffer from the same issue.

This was fixed in Arq 5.9.7.
