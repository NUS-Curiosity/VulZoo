Subject: [FD] CVE-2017-16895 Local root privesc in Arq Backup <= 5.9.7

As well as the other bugs affecting Arq <= 5.9.6 there is also another 
issue
with the suid-root restorer binaries in Arq for Mac. There are three of 
them
and they are used to execute restores of backed up files from the 
various
cloud providers.

After reversing the inter-app protocol I discovered that the path to the
restorer binary was specified as part of the data packet sent by the UI. 
After
receiving this, the restorer binaries then set +s and root ownership on 
this
path. This means we can specify an arbitrary path which will receive +s 
and root
ownership.

This issue is fixed in Arq 5.10.
