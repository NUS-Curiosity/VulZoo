          CVE Name        

    Description  If the chan_skinny (AKA SCCP protocol) channel driver is     
                 flooded with certain requests it can cause the asterisk      
                 process to use excessive amounts of virtual memory           
                 eventually causing asterisk to stop processing requests of   
                 any kind.                                                    

    Resolution  The chan_skinny driver has been updated to release memory     
                allocations in a correct manner thereby preventing any        
                possiblity of exhaustion.
