The Asterisk Development Team has announced security releases for
Certified Asterisk 13.13 and Asterisk 13, 14 and 15.  The available
security releases are released as versions 13.13-cert8, 13.18.3,
14.7.3 and 15.1.3.

These releases are available for immediate download at
http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/releases

The release of these versions resolves the following security
vulnerabilities:

* AST-2017-013: DOS Vulnerability in Asterisk chan_skinny
  If the chan_skinny (AKA SCCP protocol) channel driver is  
  flooded with certain requests it can cause the asterisk   
  process to use excessive amounts of virtual memory        
  eventually causing asterisk to stop processing requests of
  any kind.
