3. Vulnerability Description
============================
During the security analysis, ThunderScan discovered two SQL injection
vulnerabilities in Simple Login Log WordPress plugin.

The easiest way to reproduce the vulnerabilities is to visit the

that is authorized to access the plugin settings page. Users that do
not have full administrative privileges could abuse the database

also directly exposed to attack vectors such as Cross Site request
forgery (CSRF).
