Vulnerability summary
The following advisory describes an Unauthenticated Remote Command
Execution vulnerability found in Netgear ReadyNAS Surveillance.

Netgear ReadyNAS Surveillance – Small businesses and corporate branch
offices require a secure way to protect physical assets, but often lack the
security expertise or big budget that most solutions require. With these
challenges in mind, NETGEAR introduces ReadyNAS Surveillance, easy-to-use
network video recording (NVR) software that installs directly to a ReadyNAS
storage device. Add a set of cameras to a Power over Ethernet ProSafe
switch and your surveillance network is up and running in no time.

Vendor response

advisory.
