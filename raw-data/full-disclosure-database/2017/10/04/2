Vulnerability summary
Mac OS X contains a vulnerability that allows bypassing of the Apple
Quarantine and the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code without any
restrictions.

Credit
A security researcher from WeAreSegment, Filippo Cavallarin, has reported
this vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure
program.

Vendor response
Apple has been notified on the 27th of June 2017, several correspondences
were exchanged. Apple notified us that a patch has been put in place in the
upcoming High Sierra version. No additional information has been provided
by Apple since the notification that a patch has been made – no link to the
advisory nor any information on what CVE has been assigned to this have
been provided.

We have verified that Mac OS X High Sierra is no longer vulnerable to this,
a solution would be to either upgrade High Sierra, or remove the
rhtmlPlayer.html file (a workaround).
