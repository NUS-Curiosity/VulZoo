The following advisory describes an DLL Hijacking found in ZTE uSmartView.

which can be applied to different scenarios such as office, training
classroom, multimedia classroom, and business hall.”

Vendor Response
ZTE has been notified on the 13th of August 2017, several emails were
exchanged, but no ETA for a fix or workaround have been provided for the
following vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability details
When uSmartView starts on a Windows machine it tries to load a DLL
(pcacli.dll) from the C:\Program Files (x86)\vdc\ientry directory, if a
malicious attacker puts the DLL in that directory uSmartView will load it
and run the code found in it – without giving the user any warning of it.

This happens because uSmartView does not provide file pcacli.dll.
Furthermore, writing in C:\Program Files (x86)\vdc\ientry doesn’t require
any special privileges.

Since uSmartView can require admin privileges an attacker can place the
pcacli.dll and cause command execution as the current user (usually admin).
