macOS High Sierra 10.13 Supplemental Update is now available
and addresses the following:

StorageKit
Available for: macOS High Sierra 10.13
Impact: A local attacker may gain access to an encrypted APFS volume
Description: If a hint was set in Disk Utility when creating an APFS
encrypted volume, the password was stored as the hint. This was 
addressed by clearing hint storage if the hint was the password, and 
by improving the logic for storing hints.

Security
Available for: macOS High Sierra 10.13
