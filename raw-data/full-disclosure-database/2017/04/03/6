Internet connection and have installed the latest version of iTunes

will present the option the next time you connect your iOS device.

The automatic update process may take up to a week depending on the
day that iTunes or the device checks for updates. You may manually
obtain the update via the Check for Updates button within iTunes, or
the Software Update on your device.

To check that the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad has been updated:

* Navigate to Settings
* Select General
* Select About. The version after applying this update
will be "10.3.1".
