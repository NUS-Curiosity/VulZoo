Subject: [FD] DAVOSET v.1.3.1

Hello participants of Mailing List.

Since announcement of DAVOSET in 2010 and after making its public release in
2013, I've made next update of the software. At 4th of April DAVOSET v.1.3.1
was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

In new version there were added security bypass by using cookies at
appropriate sites. Also there were added new services into lists of zombies
and removed non-working services from lists of zombies.

In total there are 190 zombie-services in the list.

Best wishes & regards,
