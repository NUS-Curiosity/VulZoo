AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of LAquis SCADA, an industrial automation software,
are affected:
LAquis SCADA software, Versions 4.1 and prior versions released before
January 20, 2017.

IMPACT
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow authenticated
system users to escalate their privileges and modify or replace application
files.

IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284
An Improper Access Control vulnerability has been identified, which may
allow an authenticated user to modify application files to escalate
privileges.

CVE-2017-6016 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score
of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is
(AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

SCADA LAquis software is vulnerable to local privilege escalation. EVERYONE
has FULL permissions over all the install files (*exe,*dll), therefore, it
is possible for any local, authenticated, non-admin user to replace/modify
original application files with malicious ones, and gain higher privileged
access once an administrative user runs the application. Other vectors are
possible as well.
