Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was discovered that the Western Digital My Cloud is affected by an
authentication bypass vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can
exploit this vulnerability to authenticate as an admin user without
needing to provide a password, thereby gaining full control of the My
Cloud device.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This vulnerability was successfully verified on a Western Digital My
Cloud model WDBCTL0020HWT running firmware version 2.21.126. This issue
is not limited to the model that was used to find this vulnerability
since most of the products in the My Cloud series share the same
(vulnerable) code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue was fixed in firmware version 2.30.165.
