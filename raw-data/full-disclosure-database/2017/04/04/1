         CVE Name       

    Description  No size checking is done when setting the user field on a    
                 CDR. Thus, it is possible for someone to use an arbitrarily  
                 large string and write past the end of the user field        
                 storage buffer. This allows the possibility of remote code   
                 injection.                                                   
                                                                              
                 This currently affects any system using CDR's that also      
                 make use of the following:                                   
                                                                              
                 * The 'X-ClientCode' header within a SIP INFO message when   
                 using chan_sip and                                           
                                                                              
                 the 'useclientcode' option is enabled (note, it's disabled   
                 by default).                                                 
                                                                              
                 * The CDR dialplan function executed from AMI when setting   
                 the user field.                                              
                                                                              
                 * The AMI Monitor action when using a long file name/path.   

    Resolution  The CDR engine now only copies up to the maximum allowed      
                characters into the user field. Any characters outside the    
                maximum are truncated.
