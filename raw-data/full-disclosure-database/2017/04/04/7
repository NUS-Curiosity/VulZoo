Subject: [FD] AirWatch Self Service Portal Username Parameter LDAP Injection

https://www.osisecurity.com.au/airwatch-self-service-portal-username-parameter-ldap-injection.html

Date:
04-Apr-2017

Product:
AirWatch Self Service MDM

Versions affected:
v6.1.x
v6.4.x

Vulnerability:
LDAP injection

Example:
https://[target]/DeviceManagement/ URL accepts the following
POST parameters:

AuthenticationMode
ActivationCode
Username
Password
Login

The 'Username' parameter appears to be vulnerable to an LDAP injection attack.

A query of:
*)(sn=*

Takes a long time to complete (talking minutes), due to valid
injection of an LDAP query which enumerates the entire LDAP directory.
Other normal (or syntax invalid LDAP) requests are answered within
seconds.
