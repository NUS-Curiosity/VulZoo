Date:
04-Apr-2017

Product:
Inchoo Facebook Connect (Magento Plugin)

Vulnerability:
Reflected cross-site scripting.

Within ./app/code/community/Inchoo/Facebook/Block/Channel.php

return '<script src="'.($this->isSecure() ? 'https://' :
'http://').'connect.facebook.net/'.($this->getData('locale') ?

locale isn't escaped, so it is possible to submit <script> tags which
will be executed by the browser.
