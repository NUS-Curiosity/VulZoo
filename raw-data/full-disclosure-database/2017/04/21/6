SecretServerSecretStealer - A Powershell script that decrypts the data stored within a Thycotic Secret Server

URL: https://github.com/denandz/SecretServerSecretStealer

+-------------+
| Description |
+-------------+

SecretServerSecretStealer is a powershell script that allows for the decryption 
of passwords (and other items) stored within a Thycotic Secret Server installation. 
Two methods are exposed, Invoke-SecretDecrypt and Invoke-SecretStealer.

Invoke-SecretDecrypt requires you to manually pass the various data needed to 
decrypt a single secret (see Decryption in README.md). Invoke-SecretStealer is 
designed to be run on a Thycotic Secret Server machine itself, and takes only 
the web root as a parameter. The SecretStealer will decrypt the database 
configuration and connect to the applications db. All relevant information is 
extracted, and all secrets decrypted.

The script is available at: https://github.com/denandz/SecretServerSecretStealer
