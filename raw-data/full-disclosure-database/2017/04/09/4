Subject: [FD] NSE Script for exploiting Directory traversal vulnerability in
	Wordpress

NSE Script for exploiting Directory traversal vulnerability in the Elegant
Themes Divi theme for WordPress.

It is marked under CVE-2015-1579.

Its patched for WordPress versions > 4.1.4

This script is under "vuln", "intrusive" and "exploit" categories. So if
someone who scans the website using these modules it will disclose the
vulnerability to the end user.

There is a PR on #778 <https://github.com/nmap/nmap/pull/778> regarding the
same.

Thanks,
Rewanth.
