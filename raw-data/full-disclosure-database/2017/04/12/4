           DefenseCode ThunderScan SAST Advisory
WordPress Tribulant Slideshow Gallery Plugin - Cross-Site Scripting
Vulnerabilities


Advisory ID: DC-2017-01-014
Software: WordPress Tribulant Slideshow Gallery plugin
Software Language: PHP
Version: 1.6.4 and below
Vendor Status: Vendor contacted, fix released
Release Date: 20170410
Risk: Medium


# Brief Vulnerability Description

During the security analysis, ThunderScan discovered multiple Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities in Tribulant Slideshow Gallery WordPress Plugin. The easiest way to reproduce
the vulnerability is to visit the provided URL while being logged in as administrator or another
user that is authorized to access the plugin settings page.

The Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability can enable the attacker to construct the URL that
contains malicious JavaScript code. If the administrator of the site makes a request to such an
URL, the attacker's code will be executed, with unrestricted access to the WordPress site in
question. The attacker can entice the administrator to visit the URL in various ways, including
sending the URL by email, posting it as a part of the comment on the vulnerable site or another
forum, or embedding it as an IMG tag source in another web page administrator will visit,
causing the administrator's browser to request the URL automatically - due to missing nonce
token the vulnerability is directly exposed to Cross site request forgery, (CSRF) attacks.
The JavaScript code could enable the attacker to make requests with administrator privileges,
or grab the session ID and be able to interact with the administrative pages through his own
browser.
