Subject: [FD] SEC-T 0x0Anniversary Con next week

Hey all,

We're really happy about our speaker lineup this year, but we already sold
out apart from a few tickets to our pre-conference Training on malware
reversal.

However, we will be broadcasting the entire conference live, including
interviews with the speakers. Now if you have a hackspace or a community
project we would still like to help out the community anyway we can.

There is some information here on our thoughts
https://www.sec-t.org/ce2017/ and
we'll update it as we think of more ways we might be of assistance.

For those that managed to get tickets this year. See you soon.
And don't forget to bring your stickers and flyers and crap ;)

/Mattias,
A SEC-T Organizer
