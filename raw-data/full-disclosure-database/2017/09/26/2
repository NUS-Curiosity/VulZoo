============================================

Please note that examples below are for Documentum Administrator, but
the same exploitation takes place in Webtop.
This vulnerability allows for:
- listing directories and retrieving content of files from the filesystem
- stealing hashes of user that runs Documentum (if installed on Windows)
- DoS

1. Instance 1 and 2:
Authenticated users can exploit XXE vulnerability by browsing "Tools >
Preferences". It generates request to
/xda/com/documentum/ucf/server/transport/impl/GAIRConnector which
contains two XML structures. Both accept DTD and parse it which allows
exploitation.

2. Instance 3:
Authenticated users can exploit XXE vulnerability by using "File >
Import". Users can import XML files and use "MediaProfile" to open
file which triggers vulnerability.

3. Instance 4:
Authenticated users can exploit XXE vulnerability by using "File >
Check In". Users can use XML check in file and use "MediaProfile" to
open it which triggers vulnerability.
