Subject: [FD] OpenText Documentum Administrator and Webtop - Open Redirection

Title: OpenText Documentum Administrator and Webtop - Open Redirection
Author: Jakub Palaczynski
Date: 24. September 2017
CVE (Administrator): CVE-2017-14524
CVE (Webtop): CVE-2017-14525

Affected software:
==================
Documentum Administrator
Documentum Webtop

Exploit was tested on:
======================
Documentum Administrator version 7.2.0180.0055
Documentum Webtop version 6.8.0160.0073
Other versions may also be vulnerable.

Open Redirection - 2 instances:
========================

Please note that examples below are for Documentum Administrator, but
the same exploitation takes place in Webtop.

1. First instance:
It is possible to frame custom/malicious website on a trusted domain.
This way an attacker may for example steal credentials via creating
fake login form or redirect users to a malicious website.

Proof of Concept:
https://DOCUMENTUM/xda/help/en/default.htm?startat=//127.0.0.1/custom.html

2. Second instance:
It is possible to redirect user to custom website. Besides redirection
it also allows for stealing sensitive data - before redirection takes
place application appends username and base64 encoded user's encrypted
password ("ticket" parameter).

Proof of Concept:
Please note that PoC below works only in Internet Explorer browser as
only this browser treats /%09/ as //, which makes redirection work.
