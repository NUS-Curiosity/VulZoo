Vendor response
Hostwinds was informed of the vulnerability, to which they response with
“Zpanel is owned by Hostwinds but is no longer in production and has not
been supported for some time now. We only keep it active as a legacy
control panel and strongly discourage clients from using it. If you would
like to continue to use it that is agreeable, but we are not able to offer
any kind of support for it other than installing a different control panel
over it.”

Sentora was informed of the vulnerability on July 16 2017, while
acknowledging the receipt of the vulnerability information, they failed to
respond to the technical claims, provide a fix timeline or coordinate an
advisory with us.
