Business recommendation:
------------------------
Email address verification during the applicant registration can be bypassed.
Businesses using the vulnerable component are advised to estimate the impact of
insufficient email address verification on their business processes and react
accordingly. It is recommended to install a patched version as soon as possible.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
When an external applicant registers to the E-Recruiting application, he/she
receives a link by email to confirm access to the provided email address.
However, this measure can be bypassed and attackers can register and confirm
email addresses that they do not have access to.

An attacker could register email addresses not belonging to him/her. This could
have a business impact, because business processes might rely on a verified
email address. Furthermore, since an email address can be registered only once,
an attacker could prevent other legitimate users from registering to the
E-Recruiting application.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
The email verification link contains the "param" HTTP GET parameter with base64
encoded data. When decoded, this data contains the parameters
"candidate_hrobject" and "corr_act_guid". candidate_hrobject is an incremental
user ID. corr_act_guid is a random value that needs to be provided during the
email verification. However, this value is not bound to the current
registration, which means that the value of a previous registration can be
reused. Since candidate_hrobject is incremental, it can be guessed by an
attacker. An attacker who wants to register with an email address not belonging
to him/her, could simply do the following:

  1. Register with his own email address
  2. Directly afterwards register with someone else's email address
  3. Read the current value of candidate_hrobject in the confirmation
     link from the first registration
  4. Increment this value by 1
  5. Send the new value in the HTTP GET request, use the corr_act_guidparameter
     from the first registration
  6. If this did not work: go back to step 4 to try the next ID
     (maybe other people registered in between the two registrations)

This attack works because there is no per-registration nonce in the
confirmation link.
