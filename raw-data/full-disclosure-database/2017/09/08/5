Summary:  
EMC AppSync contains a SQL injection vulnerability that could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system. 
Details:  

EMC AppSync is affected by a SQL injection vulnerability.  Attackers could potentially exploit this vulnerability to access information, modify data or disrupt certain services by causing execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the application using default Apollo framework user accounts "apollo" and "test".
