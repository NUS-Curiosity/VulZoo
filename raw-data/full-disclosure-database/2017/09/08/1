Subject: [FD] Aerohive HiveManager Classic privilege escalation and auth
 code execution vulnerability

I. BACKGROUND

Aerohive Networks HiveManager Classic Online NMS is a cloud-enabled
enterprise-class management system for Aerohive networking products.
HiveManager Classic Online offers simple policy creation, firmware
upgrades, and centralized monitoring of thousands of Aerohive access
points, switches, and branch routers.

Responsible disclosure with Aerohive: Aerohive has a very reactive
security staff.

Their response to our communication was pretty fast, we received the
first ack within 24hrs and an official statement in 4days.

The latest version of the software at the time of writing can be
obtained from support portal at https://support.aerohive.com/login

II. DESCRIPTION

The vulnerability allows a local user, even restricted as a Tenant, to
upload a backup archive that contain jsp webshell, therefore to execute
code on underlying system.

The affected component is Backup Archive Handler.

III. ANALYSIS

The HiveManager Classic backup is a plain .tar.gz file with a very
simple structure.

Once the archive is extracted, you will see two folders:

- HiveManager
- dbxmlfile

"dbxmlfile/" contains the HM/VHM configuration, an interesting file to
work on. Anyway our interest moved to "HiveManager/" as it contains a
directory named "tomcat/webapps" which is the default Tomcat web app.

The full tree is something like:

── tomcat
    └── webapps
        └── hm
            └── domains
                └── MyTenant
                    └── maps
                        ├── ca.png
                        ├── campus.png
                        ├── map_floorplan.png
                        ├── us.png
                        └── world.png

If such directory is tampered, tar gzipped and then restored using the
backup/restore functionality, an attacker can gain code execution on the
system.

As Proof of Concept a "webshell.jsp" file has been added at maps/ level,
then we created a new .tar.gz archive and tried to restore it.

No error has been thrown and jsp file was available under the docroot at
URI /hm/domains/MyTenant/maps/

Further analysis pointed out that full path was writable so it's
possible to upload a jsp shell even outside the Tenant scope.

Code will be executed as tomcat (uid/gid 501) allowing a full compromise
of the web UI and access to other Tenant files and configurations as
well.

IV. WORKAROUND

We are not aware of any workaround.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Vendor is moving to a completely new release of the product called
HiveManager-NG, which has a different architecture and is not affected
by this vulnerability. We did not perform any audit on such version of
the product.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

Mitre assigned the CVE-2017-14105 for this vulnerability.
