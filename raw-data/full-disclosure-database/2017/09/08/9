Judging Criteria

New – the attack uses an unknown vulnerability (no record of it can be
found on Google, Exploit-DB, etc)
Complex – what was required to reach a successful attack
Innovative – we regard an RCE as more innovative than SQLi, for example
LAN or WAN – more points if the attack comes from the WAN side
What is gained – we give no initial access to the challengers, so any type
of access is an achievement. Of course, a guest level access would be
considered less valuable than root
Write-up Quality – how well is the write up (in English): including
details, explanations, etc

Device Settings
All the devices will be factory reset – i.e. default settings, and the only
non-default setting would be the password for the ‘admin’ (or equivalent)
account as documented in the product’s user guide, and the WiFi password
(if applicable).

What counts as ‘hacked’
A device would be considered ‘hacked’ if the participant can prove they:

Gained access to the device’s post-authentication admin web interface
(remember – you will not be given any credentials)
Changed some configuration value, like the WiFi password
Made the device do something it’s not supposed to do: like execute code, or
open a port/service which was previously closed (like SSH, telnet, etc)

What we won’t count as a ‘hacked’

Causing a malfunction to the device, DoS / XSS / CSRF, making it
unresponsive, making it no longer boot, etc
Usage of any known method of hacking – known methods including anything
that we can find on Google/Bing/exploit-db/etc – this includes: documented
default password (that cannot be changed), known vulnerabilities/security
holes

Eligibility
The contest is open to anyone who is at the legal age to receive a contest
prize in your country, if you are not allowed to receive prizes – and
please make sure to check this before participating – you may want to team
up with a person that is eligible.

The contest is not allowed to anyone working for one of the vendors, or is
involved in development of the above devices.
