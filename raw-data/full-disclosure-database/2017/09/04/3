=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local dll injection vulnerability has been discovered in the official Play TV  software 1.25.1(build r123776).
The issue allows local attackers to inject code to vulnerable dynamic link libraries to compromise the process 
or to gain higher system access privileges. Thus allows a local attacker to compromise the system process of 
the affected software to follow up with manipulations.

Vulnerable Software 
[+] Play TV  software 1.25.1(build r123776)

Vulnerable Libraries:
[+] api-ms-win-core-fibers-l1-1-1.dll	
[+] api-ms-win-core-localization-l1-2-1.dll	
[+] api-ms-win-core-file-l2-1-1.dll		
[+] api-ms-win-security-systemfunctions-l1-1-0.dll
[+] api-ms-win-core-sysinfo-l1-2-1.dll


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The dll hijack vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted system user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Generate a malicious dynamic link library
2. Rename it to any name mentioned in vulnerable libraries like api-ms-win-security-systemfunctions-l1-1-0.dll
3. Copy DLL file into applications directory path
4. Successfully reproduce the dll hijacking issue!


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the dll hijacking vulnerability in the software client is estimated as medium (CVSS 3.3).
