The identified vulnerability allows attackers to steal arbitrary files
(accessible by the app) from the mobile device.

SEC Consult recommends not to enable "Sharing over WiFi" feature in VLC
for iOS which allows wireless file transfer to/from PC until a thorough
security review has been performed by security professionals and all
identified issues have been resolved.


Vulnerability overview/description:

disclosure vulnerability. An attacker can read any files which can be accessed
with current application privileges. This issue can lead to data theft.

initWithFilePath:filePath forConnection:self];
    fileResponse.contentType = @"application/octet-stream";
    return fileResponse;
}
[...]
