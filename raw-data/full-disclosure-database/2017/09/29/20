Date: 27. September 2017
CVE: CVE-2017-14755

Affected Software:
==================
OpenText Document Sciences xPression (formerly EMC Document Sciences xPression)

Exploit was tested on:
======================
v4.5SP1 Patch 13 (older versions might be affected as well)

Cross-Site Scripting:
=====================

It is possible to inject Javascript into the application which will be
reflected to unaware application users. This might allow an attacker
to perform actions on behalf of unaware application users.
In order to remediate the issue, proper input validation, sanitizing
and output encoding should be conducted on server side.

No CSRF token is necessary for exploitation.
