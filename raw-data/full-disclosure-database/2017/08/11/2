Subject: [FD] Multiple unpatched flaws exist in NSS (CVE-2017-11695,
	CVE-2017-11696, CVE-2017-11697, CVE-2017-11698)

Good afternoon. Multiple flaws in NSS were reported to Mozilla on or around 28 April 2017 and as of this notification have not been resolved and as such, I am disclosing them to the public so that anyone making use of NSS is aware that these exist. Please note that as I send this, the bugs remain hidden on the Mozilla Bugzilla tracker.

What is NSS? Network Security Services (NSS) comprises a set of libraries designed to support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications with optional support for hardware TLS/SSL acceleration on the server side and hardware smart cards on the client side. NSS provides a complete open-source implementation of cryptographic libraries supporting Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and S/MIME.

All of the following flaws were triggered with changeset 13315:769f9ae07b10 in Mozilla's Mercurial repository (https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss) and can all be triggered using the NSS tool `certutil` and malformed `cert8.db` files which I have uploaded to https://github.com/geeknik/cve-fuzzing-poc.
