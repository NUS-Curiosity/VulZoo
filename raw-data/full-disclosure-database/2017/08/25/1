Subject: [FD] Trend Micro Hosted Email Security (HES) - Email Interception
 and Direct Object Reference

Date:
24-Aug-2017

Product:
Trend Micro Hosted Email Security (HES)

Versions affected:
Hosted Email Security before January 2012.

Vulnerability:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered.

The first allowed any HES user to intercept in-transit emails through
the Trend Micro Hosted Email Security cloud environment. The platform
allowed anyone to register an account online instantly and test the
solution. Users were required to 'activate' (enter) a domain name,
then update their MX records to enable filtering. However, to enable
migration testing, rules became active immediately without waiting for
MX records to be updated. This was intended, however the HES
environment itself was shared across all customers - therefore anyone
could create a policy for a domain which wasn't theirs or a
pre-existing customers and start intercepting, modifying / rewriting
content, BCC copying emails, quarantining or deleting messages which
came from@...ain.com or to@...keddomain.com if passed through HES.

Reproduction steps:

1) Register a free Trend Micro HES account.
2) Activate a domain name you want to filter - be creative (gmail.com,
mac.com, apple.com, microsoft.com, ibm.com, plus banks / military /
large ISPs / government domains worked exceptionally well!)
3) While the domain has not been valid, create a new policy rule, e.g.
"BCC all messages" to your personal email address.
4) Watch your inbox run out of disk space.

Interception revealed Sender, Recipient, Subject and in some cases
entire email contents with attachments if applicable.

Email Interception Statistics
###

The second vulnerability allowed any HES authenticated customer to
