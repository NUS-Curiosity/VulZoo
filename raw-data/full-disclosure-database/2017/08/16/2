Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A dns vulnerability has been discovered in the official Microsoft Resnet online service web-application.
The remote vulnerability allows remote attacker to hijack the inactive Microsoft Resnet subdomain service web-application 
by a sign up to microsoft azure service. Afterwards serve content for the proof local. The microsoft resnet subdomain and 
azure service is vulnerable to such typ of attacks. The dns answer cname performed by the azure app service and lead to 
a take over of the involved resnet subddomain.

The issue could allow an attacker to store something malicious by uploading a web page to make a pretty convincing phishing page.
The issue could allow an attacker to deface the microsoft resnet service web application and web-server system. The problematic 
allows an attacker to make inject codes with persistent attack vector.

The vulnerability is located in the dns configuration of the cname record that points resnet.microsoft.com to
resnetportal-prod.azurewebsites.net "Microsoft Azure app service ", but microsoft has not yet configuared azure to 
recognize it because the service is inactive.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as high. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a privileged web-application 
user account and high or medium user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dns hijack and subdomain compromise.

Vulnerable Service(s):
[+] resnet.microsoft.com


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The dns vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with high privilege of the web-application and lhigh or medium user interaction.
