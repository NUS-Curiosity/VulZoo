SSD Advisory – Chrome Turbofan Remote Code Execution

Vulnerability Summary

The following advisory describes a type confusion vulnerability that leads
to remote code execution found in Chrome browser version 59.

Chrome browser is affected by a type confusion vulnerability. The
vulnerability results from incorrect optimization by the turbofan compiler,
which causes confusion between access to an object array and a value array,
and therefore allows to access objects as if they were values by reading
them as if they were values (thus receiving their in memory address) or
vice-versa to write values into an object array and thus being able to fake
objects completely.

Vendor response

Google was informed of the vulnerability, and a ticket has been opened:
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=746946, because the
vulnerability stopped working in Chrome 60 – Google has no plan to address
it as a security advisory/patch.
