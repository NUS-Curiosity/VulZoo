Subject: [FD] CVE-2017-13671 - MISP Stored XSS

Hi list,

We have found a Stored Cross-site scripting vulnerability in MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform & Threat Sharing).

[Description]
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the comments of the events within MISP before 2.4.79 allows remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a POST request.

------------------------------------------

[Additional Information]
The comment functionality in the event section in MISP  is vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The comment functionality allow an attacker to insert pre-defined tags like e.g. [code] or [quote] which are then converted to HTML code by the server. By using a mix of different tags, the HTML code will be broken and an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code. This however only impacts users of the same instance since comments are not synchronized.

[Vulnerability Type]

[Vendor of Product]

------------------------------------------

[Affected Product Code Base]

------------------------------------------

[Affected Component]

[Attack Vectors]
An attacker could use the command section of an event to store malicious JavaScript code that for example loads external content serving malware in the database. Since the comment section can be used by non-privilliged users, an attacker could use this vulnerability to escalate privilleges.
