Subject: [FD] FTP Commander 8.02 [ Unsafe DLL Loading Vulnerability ]

Loading/Injection/Hijacking/Preloading.

4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

8.02 and prior

5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

http://blog.pentest.space/2017/07/023-ftp-commander-802-unsafe-dll.html

Tested Platform: Windows 7 x64 (Fresh Windows)

6. IMPACT

This occurs when an application fails to resolve a DLL because the DLL does
not exist in the specified path or search directories. If this happens, a
malicious Dll with the same name can be placed in the specified path
directory leading to remote code execution.


7. SOLUTION

For application developers:
    Require set paths for DLLs in applications

For system administrators:
    Disable write permissions to relative application folders
    Utilize least privilege access to prevent users (and applications) from
having too much access to the system

For both groups:
    Microsoft has a great article explaining the DLL-related registry keys
and how they can be used to protect applications -
