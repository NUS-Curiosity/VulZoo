Subject: [FD] Spider Player 2.5.3 [ Unsafe DLL Loading Vulnerability ]

1. OVERVIEW

The Spider Media Player is vulnerable to Insecure DLL Hijacking
Vulnerability. Similar terms that describe this vulnerability
have been come up with Remote Binary Planting, and Insecure DLL
Loading/Injection/Hijacking/Preloading.


2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Spider Player is a skinnable audio player with full support for all major
audio formats: MP3, AAC, WMA, OGG, FLAC and others. Its most interesting
features include audio streaming, integration with Shoutcast and Icecast
radio directories, lossless Internet radio recording, advanced CD Ripping
and Converting capabilities, FreeDB integration, 32-sound processing for
crystal-clear sound, customizable local and global hotkeys and crossfading
support. Spider Player is small and blazingly fast, and uses very few

# dwmapi.dll
# olepro32.dll
# dsound.dll

4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

http://blog.pentest.space/2017/07/spider-player-253-unsafe-dll-loading.html

Tested Platform: Windows 7 x64 (Fresh Windows)

6. IMPACT

This occurs when an application fails to resolve a DLL because the DLL does
not exist in the specified path or search directories. If this happens, a
malicious Dll with the same name can be placed in the specified path
directory leading to remote code execution.


7. SOLUTION

For application developers:
    Require set paths for DLLs in applications

For system administrators:
    Disable write permissions to relative application folders
    Utilize least privilege access to prevent users (and applications) from
having too much access to the system

For both groups:
    Microsoft has a great article explaining the DLL-related registry keys
and how they can be used to protect applications -
