Subject: [FD] MEDHOST Document Management System contains multiple
	hard-coded credentials

CVE-2017-11693 & CVE-2017-11694

Overview
------------
Medhost Document Management system for all versions contains
hard-coded credentials
used for customer database and Apache Solr access. This is a new vulnerability
not related to CVE-2016-4328 or CVE-2017-11614.

Description
------------

MEDHOST Document Management System contains multiple hard-coded
credentials that are
used for customer database and Apache Solr access. An attacker with
knowledge of the
hard-coded credentials and the ability to communicate directly with
the database and
Apache Solr may be able to obtain or modify sensitive patient and financial
information. PostgreSQL is used as the Document Management System
database. The account name is dms. The Apache Solr account name is
also dms. These passwords are hard-coded throughout the application,
and are the same across all installations. Customers do not have the
option to change passwords. The dms account for PostgreSQL has access
to the database schema for Document Management System. The dms account
for Apache Solr has access to all indexed patient documents.
PostgreSQL listens on the default TCP port 5432. Apache Solr listens
on the default TCP port 8080.

- WEB-INF/classes/database.properties

# DMS database settings
jdbc.driverClass=org.postgresql.Driver
jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dms
jdbc.username=dms
jdbc.password=[redacted]

# Liquibase flag
run.liquibase.on.startup = true

- WEB-INF/classes/solr.properties

solr.url=http://localhost:8080/solr/dms
solr.username=dms
solr.password=[redacted]

Impact
------------

An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credentials and the
ability to communicate
directly with the application database server may be able to obtain or
modify patient and
financial information.

Solution
------------

The vendor has not issued a patch and has been unresponsive to this
information after 3
attempts to communicate.

Restrict network access

As a general security practice, only allow connections from trusted
hosts and networks.
Restricting access would prevent an attacker from using the hard-coded
database credentials
from a blocked network location.
