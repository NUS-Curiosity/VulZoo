Subject: [FD] DAVOSET v.1.3.5

Hello participants of Mailing List.

2013, I've made next updates of the software. At 22nd of June DAVOSET
v.1.3.4 was released and at 25th of July DAVOSET v.1.3.5 was released - DDoS
attacks via other sites execution tool (http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

In version 1.3.4 there was added support of XXE vulnerability in Qlikview.
Also there were added new services into lists of zombies and removed
non-working services from lists of zombies.

In version 1.3.5 there were added new services into full list of zombies,
added command line argument for proxy and changed default settings.

In total there are 220 zombie-services in the list.
