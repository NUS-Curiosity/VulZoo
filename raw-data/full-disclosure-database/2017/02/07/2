Call for Speakers:



FIRST is looking for speakers that would like to present at the TC. We
are most interested in new presentations and presenters, however
important updates on prior work are also welcome. We strongly encourage
any individual who has not spoken at a conference before to submit a
proposal. The idea behind the TC is to encourage security teams and
researchers talent to share their technical work in a friendly
environment. While we give special consideration to local talent,
submissions are welcome from anyone, anywhere.



Any novel ideas, techniques, case studies, or research related to
incident and threat response are welcome. Some suggested topics are as
follows:



- Threat actor groups & techniques

- Creative incident response techniques

- Indicators of compromise and how detect/mitigate

- Data analytics for security

- Criminal underground

- Denial-of-service attacks and countermeasures

- Digital forensics

- Human-computer interaction, security, and privacy

- Intrusion and anomaly detection and prevention

- Malicious code analysis, anti-virus evasion, etc.

- Security architecture

- Open Source tools

- Attack and response to an organization




For your submission to be considered, you must provide ALL of the
following information:



- Title

- Presenter's Name(s), Affiliation, and short biography

- Brief Summary (Abstract) and completion status/plan

- Estimated Time (45 mins + 10 for questions is typical)



To: amsterdam-tc@...st.org



Important Note:


FIRST does not allow presentations with the aim of gaining the
audience's interest in any commercial application, solution or product.

In other words, NO MARKETING PRESENTATIONS. Please only submit a talk if
you are actually able to attend the TC in Amsterdam.


Our goal is to have the program on the event website by the end of
February 2017, to that end please have all submission completed by
February 17th. Feel free to reply with any questions.
