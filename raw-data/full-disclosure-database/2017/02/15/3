Subject: [FD] Backdoored Web Application v.1.0.2

Hello participants of Mailing List.

In December 2012 I released my Backdoored Web Application (BWA)
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2012-December/008630.html)
 - a reference test of backdoors scanners. All qualitative scanners of
backdoors must find it, otherwise such scanners not good enough. So everyone
can use it to check their scanners.

In 2013 I published the results of my backdoor scanners testing
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-May/008832.html).
In this research I tested WordPress plugins scanners with using of my BWA.

After release of version BWA v.1.0.1 in 2014, this year I released new
version Backdoored Web Application v.1.0.2
(http://websecurity.com.ua/8491/). In which I added new backdoor on PHP.
This will allow to better test backdoors scanners.
