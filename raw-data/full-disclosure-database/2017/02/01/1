Remote

*Impact:*
A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to
an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies
phishing attacks. An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause
the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By
modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully
launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name
in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts
have a more trustworthy appearance.
