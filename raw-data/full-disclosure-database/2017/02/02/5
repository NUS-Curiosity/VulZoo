HP Printers Wi-Fi Direct Improper Access Control

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Advisory Information

Title: HP Printers Wi-Fi Improper Access Control
Advisory ID: NESESO-2017-0111
Advisory URL: http://neseso.com/advisories/NESESO-2017-0111.pdf
Date published: 2017-02-01
Date of last update: 2017-02-01
Vendors contacted: Hewlett Packard
Release mode: User Release

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Vulnerability Information

Class: Configuration [CWE-16], Improper Access Control [CWE-284]
Impact: Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Vulnerability Description

HP printers with Wi-Fi Direct support, let you print from a mobile device
directly to the printer without connecting to a wireless network. Several of
these printers are prone to a security vulnerability that allows an external
system to obtain unrestricted remote read/write access to the printer
configuration using the embedded web server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Vulnerable Packages

HP OfficeJet Pro 8710 firmware version WBP2CN1619BR
HP OfficeJet Pro 8620 firmware version FDP1CN1547AR

Other products and versions might be affected too, but they were not tested.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

There was no official answer from HP Inc. after several attempts (see [Sec. 8]);
contact vendor for further information.

Some mitigation actions may be:

	• Disable Wi-Fi Direct functionality to protect your device.
	• Enable Password Settings on the Embedded Web Server.

7. Technical Description

Wi-Fi Direct Improper Access Control

Wi-Fi Direct [1], initially called Wi-Fi P2P, is a Wi-Fi standard enabling
devices to easily connect with each other without requiring a wireless access
point. It is useful for everything from internet browsing to file transfer, and
to communicate with one or more devices simultaneously at typical Wi-Fi speeds.
In a scenario where two devices want to connect they can authenticate using
methods such as PIN, Push-Button or NFC.

HP Printers implement Wi-Fi Direct[2] support in two ways, one as described on
the Wi-Fi Direct specification and the other providing a wi-fi access point that
has no security or uses insecure default credentials (12345678 passphrase is
used by default on newer models). Giving access to anyone that is near enough
to establish a Wi-Fi  connection without any user interaction or notification.
The second vulnerability is that the printing services and others, such as the
Embedded Web Server has no authentication by default which gives anyone the
ability to not only access sensitive information but also modify device
configuration. These two vulnerabilities exposes user information and gives
unrestricted remote read/write access to the configuration and services of the
printer.

Below two examples of HTTP requests that attackers could use to access emails
stored on the device or disable automatic firmware updates.
