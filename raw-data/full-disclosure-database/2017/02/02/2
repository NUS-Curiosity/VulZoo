Subject: Re: [FD] Free ebook to learn ethical hacking techniques

Hi,

Thanks for sharing, though I am not sure this is the right mailing list to
do so (imo).
However, you seem to raise an interesting point. @List: Do we have stuff
going on the mainframe guys ? 0days, vulns, exploits, etc ?
I've gone through FD archives but could not get something.

Thanks !
