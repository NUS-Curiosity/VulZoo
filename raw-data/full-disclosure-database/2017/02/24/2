Subject: [FD] Unicorn Emulator v1.0 is out!

Greetings,

We are super happy to announce version 1.0 for Unicorn CPU Emulator
framework!

Full source code & precompiled binaries are now available at
http://www.unicorn-engine.org/Version-1.0

This release is the result of over 1 year of community-based development.
We fixed a lot of issues on all architectures, added some new APIs and
provide 3 more bindings in Haskell, MSVC & VB6 now. See the link above for
details on important changes.

Huge thanks to all the heroic contributors who worked so hard make this
release possible!

Finally, don't forget to check out a list of excited security tools built
on top of Unicorn - by community - at
http://www.unicorn-engine.org/showcase/


Cheers,
Quynh
