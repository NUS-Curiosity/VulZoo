Subject: [FD] [SE-2011-01] Some ideas regarding security of ST DVB chipsets


Hello All,

We decided to release a short document revealing some of the unexplored
ideas we had with respect to security of ST DVB chipsets:

http://www.security-explorations.com/materials/se-2011-01_ideas.pdf

We appreciate any feedback, especially the one regarding the feasibility
to conduct the described crypto attack (this bothered us for years, but
unfortunately we lack expertise in breaking real life crypto and crypto
analysis in particular to properly evaluate if it all makes any sense -
we are usually lucky to find some way around crypto through SW loopholes).

Additionally, we decided to reveal some of our experiences regarding SAT
TV ecosystem as well. This can be found in the "Final words" section of
the aforementioned document and our updated FAQ:

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Adam Gowdiak
