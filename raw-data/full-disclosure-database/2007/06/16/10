the government are building a second internet incase this one goes down.

not only is the second internet being built incase the first one gets
attaced, infact the government plan to eventually switch everyone over to
the second internet because its being built with security in mind.

the problem with the first internet is, its not very secure and from the
governments point of view not very well designed for counter-terrorism eaves
dropping.

new protocols and processes are being developed on the new internet which
will be exclusively used by the u.s government until the roll out in 20 to
30 years time, although the u.s government will cut that public release
timeline if a major breakdown of the internet occurs through cyberattacks.

in high level meetings with corporate america officials, technical details
of how to let corporate security experts switch over to the highly
classified second internet project in time of national emergency was
disclosed.

all parties involved in talks have signed documents to stop them talking
about it in pub;lic, although details of the second internet have been
obtained by international hackers, who have become firmilar with the
project.

documents containing the plans for the second internet were downloaded off
government computer networks by underground hackers, and therefore the
information regarding the second internet project have been leaked.

it is unclear how far on in development the project is, due to the papers
obtained by illegal authorised entry into u.s government networks was not
marked as the same time period as when the papers of the plans were obtained
by the illegal means of international hackers.

in private the government are trying not to talk about cyber attacks too
much so not to over talk the risk to national government and e-commerce
interests, but in truth they are only too aware of the threat to their own
communications and anti missle systems, therefore a second highly classified
internet was advised by top level whitehosue advisors who have consulted
with cyber security experts in classified meetings with government officals.

the saftey net known as the second internet may save america from certain
national economic disaster and attacks to u.s army defense systems in a time
of real world war when nuclear and cyber attacks are likely to happen.
