Subject: Papoo CMS - Multiple Cross Site Scripting

Papoo Content Management System Multiple Cross Site Scriptings      Jun 12 2007
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Product

  Papoo Content Management System

* Vulnerable Versions

  Papoo Light 3.6
  
* Vendor Status

  The Vendor was notified and the issue fixed.
  A patch is available at: http://www.papoo.de/index/menuid/204/reporeid/215

* Details

  The Papoo Content Management System is prone to multiple Cross Site Scripting
  vulnerabilities. The application fails to sanitize user input from certain 
  characters in three cases:

  1) The argument list of GET requests is shown in the page source and may 
     contain script code.

  2) Visitor comments will appear in a message list in the internal administra-
     tion interface. The Title can contain script code that will be executed 
     in the administrator's browser.
  
  3) Internally sent messages between CMS users are shown unfiltered in the 
     message overview. (This requires a minimal set of privileges)

* Impact

  An attacker might be able to gain administrator privileges.

* Exploit

  No exploit required.
