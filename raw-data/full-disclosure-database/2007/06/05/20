Just FYI - my logs indicate that there is a fairly high percentage of
patterns consistent with successful exploitation among Safari users (about
20%).

For the non-vulnerable Firefox, this value is at 1% (for spoofed
User-Agent strings, random pranks, etc).

As such, the value for Safari seems significant, particularly since this
PoC is timing-dependent and fine-tuned for MSIE. I have no immediate way
to test it, but feel encouraged to explore this further.
