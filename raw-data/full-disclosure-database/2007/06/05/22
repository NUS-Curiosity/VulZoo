Synopsis
========

libexif fails to handle Exif (EXchangeable Image File) data inputs,
making it vulnerable to an integer overflow.

Background
==========

libexif is a library for parsing, editing and saving Exif data.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libexif      < 0.6.15                        >= 0.6.15

Description
===========

Victor Stinner reported an integer overflow in the
exif_data_load_data_entry() function from file exif-data.c while
handling Exif data.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to process a file with specially
crafted Exif extensions with an application making use of libexif,
which will trigger the integer overflow and potentially execute
arbitrary code or crash the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libexif users should upgrade to the latest version. Please note
that users upgrading from "<=media-libs/libexif-0.6.13" should also run
revdep-rebuild after their upgrade.

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libexif-0.6.15"
    # revdep-rebuild --library=/usr/lib/libexif.so
