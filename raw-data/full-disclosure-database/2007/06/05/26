1. Shouldn't I destroy the sender *after* notifying him?

2. You may not intend to waive confidentiality or privilege, but you did.

3. You can't prohibit what I do with this email. It is mine now. Moohahaha!

Seriously. These tags piss me off. There is no legal justification. It
just makes the company's admins look like uneducated asses. I encourage
all organizations to accept the fact that your emails are community
property once you hit send. There is no e-mail Postal police nor should
there be. Encrypt everything.
