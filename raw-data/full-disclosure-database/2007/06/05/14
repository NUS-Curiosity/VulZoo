Subject: [TOOL] untidy - XML Fuzzer

List,

  I'm glad to release the second beta version of untidy; untidy is
general purpose XML Fuzzer. It takes a string representation of a XML
as input and generates a set of modified, potentially invalid, XMLs
based on the input. It's released under GPL v2 and written in python.

  Project main site: http://untidy.sourceforge.net/

  Special thanks go to Dirk Loss for his help and bug reports.

Cheers,
