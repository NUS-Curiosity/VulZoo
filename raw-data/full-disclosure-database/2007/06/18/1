Subject: Re: Month Of Hackerrats Bugs

quite a pleasure to see another well drafted composition to full
disclosure. it appears we have quite a real hacker/wanker giving us
some wonderful information. i hope the people you reveal had great
success in working with the authorities. we should rename this to a
month of heros if you should continue. perhaps if you try hard
enough you could start a month of not sucking dick but some how i
doubt you could succeed in such  an endevour. enjoy hiding in the
shadows with your useless commentary that no one on here gives a
shit about. are you jealous that these people actually have
something that you do not,,success and lives?

get a bloody life you dumb shit.
