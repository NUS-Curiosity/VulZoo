Cerulean Studios Trillian UTF-8 Word Wrap Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.18.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 18, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Trillian is a multi-protocol chat application that supports IRC, ICQ,
AIM and MSN protocols. More information can be found on the vendor's
site at the following URL.

http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/learn

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in Cerulean Studios
Trillian Instant Messenger could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
code as the currently logged on user.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper handling of UTF-8
sequences. When word-wrapping UTF-8 text, the window width is
improperly used as a buffer size value. As such, heap corruption can
occur leading to a potentially exploitable condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code with the credentials of the currently logged on
user.

Exploitation occurs simply by viewing a malicious message that contains
a specially constructed UTF-8 string.

The MSN protocol is a known attack vector for this vulnerability.
However, exploitation could potentially occur using any supported
protocol.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Cerulean
Studios Trillian 3.1.5.1. Previous versions are suspected to be
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.
