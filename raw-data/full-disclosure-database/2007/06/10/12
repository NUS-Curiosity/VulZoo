Subject: Serious holes affecting JFFNMS

As a result of a short security audit of JFFNMS, a number of security holes 
were found, even from the perspective of a non authenticated user.  The holes 
included authentication bypass via SQL injection. Javascript injection and a 
serious case of information disclosure.  After liasing with the developers, 
the holes have been resolved.  Attached are the advisory and patch relating 
to these flaws.
