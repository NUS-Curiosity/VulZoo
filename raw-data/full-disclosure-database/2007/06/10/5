Dear list,

You asked for it, and we delivered!  Due to the increased demand
for more "Month of" projects, and the growing popularity of posting
hashes to this list, we proudly present... THE MONTH OF RANDOM
HASHES.

Every day for the next month we will be providing a list of not
one... not two... not three... not four... not five... not six...
not seven... not eight... not nine... not ten... not eleven... not
twelve... not thirteen... not fourteen... not fifteen... not
sixteen... not seventeen... not eighteen... not nineteen... not
twenty... not twenty-one... not twenty -two... not twenty-three...
not twenty-four... not twenty-five... not twenty-six... not twenty-
seven... not twenty-eight... not twenty-nine... not thirty... not
thirty-one... not thirty-two... not thirty-three... not thirty-
four... not thirty-five... not thirty-six... not thirty-seven...
not thirty-eight... not thirty-nine... not forty... not forty-
one... not forty-two... not forty-three... not forty-four... not
forty-five... not forty-six... not forty-seven... not forty-
eight... not forty-nine... not fifty... not fifty-one... not fifty-
two... not fifty-three... not fifty-four... not fifty-five... not
fifty-six... not fifty-seven... not fifty-eight... not fifty-
nine... not sixty... not sixty-one... not sixty-two... not sixty-
three... not sixty-four... not sixty-five... not sixty-six... not
sixty-seven... not sixty-eight... not sixty-nine... not seventy...
not seventy-one... not seventy-two... not seventy-three... not
seventy-four... not seventy-five... not seventy-six... not seventy-
seven... not seventy-eight... not seventy-nine... not eighty... not
eighty-one... not eighty-two... not eighty-three... not eighty-
four... not eighty-five... not eighty-six... not eighty-seven...
not eighty-eight... not eighty-nine... not ninety... not ninety-
one... not ninety-two... not ninety-three... not ninety-four... not
ninety-five... not ninety-six... not ninety-seven... not ninety-
eight...

not even ninety-nine...

but... ONE HUNDRED!

To make the project even more successful, this number (100) only
represents the number of random strings that hashes are generated
for, and not the total number of hashes we provide daily!  You will
receive an md5sum, sha1sum, and sha256sum of all 100 random strings
every day.

That is THREE HUNDRED hashes.  In your mailbox.  Free.  Every day.

Stay tuned for more details!
