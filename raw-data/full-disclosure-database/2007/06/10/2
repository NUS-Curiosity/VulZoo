Subject: i just made up a new word

"hackcessing"

you shall use it when hacking your way into something.

"i just hackcessed the mainframe"

kittens can use it in the form of "i'm in ur server because i
hackcessed my wai in"

and so on.

i'd post a hash of myself posting this message, to prove i'm the one
that posted it, but you know, it's hardly worth it.
