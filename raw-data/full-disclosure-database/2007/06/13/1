Subject: Robert Lemos over Neal Krawetz forensic findings

"

 Readers of the Cnet news outlet have brought it to our attention that a
commentator known as "ROBERT VAMOIS" has taken up post in replace of the
well known journalist Joris Evers.

We ask the security communtiy to investigate the incident and re-evaluate
the agenda of the security media community and that of cnet news for the
foreseeable future.

Indication shows the new journalist known as Robert Vamois is both young and
inexperienced with reporting security incidents to the public-at-large, as
was Joris Evers when he took replacement from the freelance journalist
Robert Lemos.

Robert Lemos who proved he holds grudges against members of the security
community underscores the possibility the media are trying to control public
opinion against the n3td3v security community, when he challenged the
securityfocus.com editorial policy by running a story on the released and
"unfounded" forensic science information regarding to the n3td3v security
group.

The information made credible by Robert Lemos to the securityfocus news web
site was later to backlash infront of the Securityfocus journalist, as
outcry over the relation between the reported security researcher "Gobbles"
and that of the group known as "n3td3v" appeared on the web.

Both security groups responded to the Robert Lemos report on the Neal
Krawetz findings with deep disapproval because of the unfounded research
post to the Funsec mailing list by the HackFactor PhD scientist.

Regardless of outcry and disapproval---both the former cnet journalist
Robert Lemos and the PhD scientist have yet to apologize over the
high-profile incident.

Both individuals have made no acknowledgement on-the-record that both
researchers got-it-wrong, yet both individuals prefer to defend their
behaviour as "proper" at the time.

Rumour has it that Robert Lemos decided to publish the article on the Neal
Krawetz findings to protect his own legacy, incase if in the long-term
people decided to look-up the term "Robert+Lemos" on major search engine
providers and found n3td3v commentry, he (Robert Lemos) wanted to make sure
he was distanced from the "n3td3v agenda", therefore ran the article.

No one from Securityfocus or Symantec have commented on the "out of
character" article made by Robert Lemos---and much of the security community
are still looking for answers by those within Securityfocus who said "YES"
to the "security troll" Robert Lemos article.

Many in the security communtiy have speculated for a number of years how
credible and current Securityfocus editorial standards are, especially in
light of the n3td3v related article, which unsuprisingly raised eyebrows
between both the underground and the professional security scene.

Robert Lemos fails to-date to acknowledge that the article wasn't infact "of
interest" to the public and was more focused towards protecting his own
personal gains or losses in respect of previous criticism made towards him,
as featured on search results when using the term "Robert+Lemos" on major
search providers.

The impact of the said article is yet to be evaluated in relation to the
career and personal saftey interests of both Gobbles and n3td3v, but both
groups have acknowledged that legal action hasn't been ruled out.
