Subject: Todays Lesson - XSS


Today's lesson, boys and girls is on Cross Site Scripting....
 
"An XSS attack relies on a website displaying text with-out checking whether it contains special characters.  The client browser interprets the special characters as script instructions, and executes the script..."
 
An example of an XSS attack:
https://www.isc2.org/cgi-bin/cissp_completerecord.cgi?name"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>&print=cpe
 
Now that you've seen XSS... you can add one CPE to your CISSP record!
