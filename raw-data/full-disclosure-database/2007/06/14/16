Subject: Paper: Secure file upload in PHP web applications

Various web applications, such as blogs, forums and photo galleries
allow users to upload files. Providing file upload function without
opening security holes proved to be quite a challenge in PHP web
applications. The applications we have tested suffered from a variety of
security problems, ranging from arbitrary file disclosure to remote
arbitrary code execution.

The paper describes various security holes occurring in file upload
implementations and suggests a way to implement a secure file upload.
