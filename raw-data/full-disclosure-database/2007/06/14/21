-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Details

  The banner module of the Elxis Content Management System is vulnerable to an
  SQL injection. The module keeps track of already displayed banners and stores 
  their ID's in a cookie named `mb_tracker'. The cookie value is then used in 
  an SQL query to get the next, not yet shown banner. 

* Impact

  By modifying the cookie value, an attacker might be able to execute SQL 
  queries.

* Exploit

  No exploit required.
