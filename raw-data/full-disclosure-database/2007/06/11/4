Subject: PHPIDS released

Hello everybody,

I would like to announce the immediate release of the PHPIDS.

http://christ1an.blogspot.com/2007/06/php-ids-released.html

We hope that this little framework will help developers to identify
and defend most common web attacks such as XSS, SQL Injection or Remote File
Inclusion.

Still, feedback or field reports are highly appreciated.

Best regards,
Christian Matthies
