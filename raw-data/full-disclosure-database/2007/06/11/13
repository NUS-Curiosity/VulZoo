Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in MadWifi, possibly
allowing for the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

The MadWifi driver provides support for Atheros based IEEE 802.11
Wireless Lan cards.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-wireless/madwifi-ng      < 0.9.3.1                 >= 0.9.3.1

Description
===========

Md Sohail Ahmad from AirTight Networks has discovered a divison by zero
in the ath_beacon_config() function (CVE-2007-2830). The vendor has
corrected an input validation error in the
ieee80211_ioctl_getwmmparams() and ieee80211_ioctl_getwmmparams()
functions(CVE-207-2831), and an input sanitization error when parsing
nested 802.3 Ethernet frame lengths (CVE-2007-2829).

Impact
======

An attacker could send specially crafted packets to a vulnerable host
to exploit one of these vulnerabilities, possibly resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with root privileges, or a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MadWifi users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/madwifi-ng-0.9.3.1"
