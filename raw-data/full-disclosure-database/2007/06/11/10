Is this a joke ? I have never seen such useless logging in my whole
life, this reads like pre-historic code, also cool how they check if

   Revision History

   01/06/93: revision history starting date
   05/08/93: When a card is already positioned in the card reader, a read on
             the external card reader is forced before the main loop starts,
             making the routine Reader_Read_Card() called in
             Process_Card_IN_BAC() work.
