Renzen,

As has already been noted, functions_post.php has this at the top:

if (!defined('IN_PHPBB'))
{
	die('Hacking attempt');
}

Accessing functions_post.php directly does not set this variable, ergo
you will not be able to influence the includes below that line.

This is the case with most of the files in the includes directory; any
file that does not include the above lines does not have any code
outside of just functions and thus you are unable to influence the
variables as they would be out of scope.

If you feel that you have found a vulnerability, I would encourage you
to use our Security tracker to make a report, which can be found here:

Thank you,
