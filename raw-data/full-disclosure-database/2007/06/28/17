coderman - spoiled? the fun is only beginning!

gobbles and friends have been busy. death threats, impersonations,
white supremacy groups, 0day exploits, sixapart ssns. gobbles has a
case worker at the fbi. his name is chris. chris is looking forward
to meeting gobbles at defcon. rofl!

and gobbles - sorry to hear your friend in florida had his dialup
account disabled. you should talk to chris about that. tee hee hee
i wonder if the fbi will knock on the door or just kick it in.

kisses!
