Story: Solving the Web security
challenge<http://news.com.com/2009-1002-6189437.html?tag=tb>

the information security director for Yahoo wants MSN and Google to share
intelligence on hackers sending in information that Yahoo should be aware
of, and Yahoo want MSN, Google to share bugs reported to them that may be a
new unseen before attack vector that would be important for Yahoo to know.
The problem is a lot of the time companies keep security information within
the company if details of a hack on their network hasn't already leaked out
to the media. In short, Yahoo's director of information security is paranoid
that they aren't being told everything they feel they should know, even
though the company Yahoo has off the record contacts within both MSN and
Google, yet the information security director for Yahoo would like more
official channels of intelligence setup to share information on cutting edge
hacks and hacker groups alike with a vested interest in Yahoo-like websites
and their applications.
