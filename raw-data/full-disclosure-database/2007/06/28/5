As I mentioned earlier, I'm not interested in DoSes.  I'm looking at how 
to hack a Polycom to use it to infect users, perhaps be a C&C for a 
botnet, that sort of thing.  I think it's entirely possible.  I just 
wondered if anyone else had looked at it.  There's lots of DoS type stuff 
for the Polycom, but those don't interest me.
