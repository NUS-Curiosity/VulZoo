Description:
    Previous versions of the krb5 package are vulnerable to three
    attacks.  Two (MITKRB5-SA-2007-004: CVE-2007-2442 and CVE-2007-2443)
    are likely limited in practice on rPath Linux to denial of service,
    but the third (MITKRB5-SA-2007-005: CVE-2007-2798) is believed to
    allow a remote arbitrary code execution attack against kadmind
    servers.  rPath Linux systems are not automatically configured with
    kadmind enabled.  Systems configured as kerberos administrative
    servers are vulnerable.
