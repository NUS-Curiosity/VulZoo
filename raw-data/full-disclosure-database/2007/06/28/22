I'm not sure about this - I understood it to mean that if you touch a
table, you have to invalidate the TLB that corresponds to its linear
address.  This was always how Intel CPUs behaved, even the old ones.
What changed?

Same thing here - altering tables without flushing the TLBs will result in
cached data being used instead.  Intel is documenting it very well now, but
it's not new behaviour.

The FPU memory corruption is old behaviour, too.

Certainly, there are some scary things in the list, but many of them are
behaviours that are being documented for the first time, yet they exist
in CPUs since even the 486, for example.
