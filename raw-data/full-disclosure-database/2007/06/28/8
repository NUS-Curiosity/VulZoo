The hashes would be less annoying if they had an easily filtered subject line.

Let me suggest that anyone who wants to publish a hash of
vulnerability report on full disclosure include the string "MORH" in
the subject line, in honor of the "Month of Random Hashes" project.
Presumably anyone with enough of a clue to want to publish a hash of a
vulnerability disclosure also has enough of a clue to do so with a
standard subject line.

Cheers,
Brian
