Well, it depends on the context.

A story went around some years ago about a colleague who was in London. Once he got his
PhD (in physics), he had a sign made which read "DOCTOR VISITING" which was placed in his
dashboard when he double parked now and again (parking spaces being hard to find in his
neighborhood). As the story went, he never got a parking ticket.

Signing with the PhD is occasionally useful in dealing with bureaucrats or people
in schools who make life difficult for one's children too, as I have noticed.

lol

it is the Standford envy; for the A&M philosopher must shore up his
fine credentials lest the authority and expertise conveyed by such be
underestimated...
