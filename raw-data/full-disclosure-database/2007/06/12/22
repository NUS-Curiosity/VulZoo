Interesting thing to think about ...

Does it benefit Apple to have an insecure browser on Windows? If the millions of clueless computer users get owned will they be able to understand that it was Safari's fault or just that their windows box got compromised and now they have grief and financial loss.

Page is dead but sound like old stuff reported years ago:

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10406


just that they fixed it at the helper level not at safari level (well it
was the right thing to do!). but then they prolly forgot about it and
released safari for windows. ^ ^
this said its kinda nothing special to be able to read old advisory to
find this kind of bugs :) (and its the right thing to do, too!) 2hours
is even long :D
