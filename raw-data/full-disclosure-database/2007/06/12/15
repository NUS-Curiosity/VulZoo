	0day URL protocol handler command injection

I wouldn't put it past Apple to steal associations in a nearly silent 
manner so that Safari becomes the default browser for untold numbers of 
Itunes users. How many of those with serious clue deficiencies would be 
willing or able to change all of those associations back? Apple could 
make Safari reclaim its default browser status every time Itunes opens. 
Its all rather shady, but Apple could gain a large market share chunk 
very rapidly just by irritating their users a bit.

I rather hope that Apple decides now is a decent time to develop some 
morals. Also I hope they don't get any ideas from this message.
