Sure.  If Apple can't make them run their OS, or their desktop, then nailing the browser is 95% of the typical user's attention span anyway.  Next best thing to converting them outright.

But unfortunately, this will just change the preferred target of exploits.  Safari will become one of the low-hanging fruits.
