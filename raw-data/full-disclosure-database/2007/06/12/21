Subject: [Off topic] Safari on Windows networked share
	question

Anyone see if Safari for Windows will open an html file on a Windows
share?  IE:

file://///machinename/directory/index.html

Firefox/IE open this just fine, but Safari on Windows gives me:

The error was: .unknown error. (NSPOSIXErrorDomain:22)

Thanks all!

James
