Subject: Re: Safari for Windows,
	0day URL protocol handler command injection

>>Apple released version 3 of their popular Safari web browser today,
with the added twist of offering both an OS X and a Windows version.
Given that Apple has had a lousy track record with security on OS X, in
addition to a hostile attitude towards security researchers, a lot of
people are expecting to see quite a number of vulnerabilities targeted
towards this new Windows browser. 

Joe Wilcox here at eWEEK is speculating, as are others, that Apple could
start bundling Safari with the Windows iTunes software
(http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/web_services_browser/do_we_reall
y_need_another_windows_browser.html). They have already done this with
QuickTime. Safari could develop installed base quickly that way.
