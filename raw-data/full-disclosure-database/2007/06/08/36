Justin Seitz of VDA Labs (www.vdalabs.com) already found this bug.
Here's the CVE: CVE-2007-1783.

 They had so many bugs, they're rolling this issue and more into the
next release.

We have a working PoC, and believe it could be transformed into remote
via embedded link.  For example:
<SCRIPT SRC="http://127.0.0.1:2372/<buffer here>
<http://127.0.0.1:2372/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA>"></SCRIPT>

Blessings,
Jared
