Subject: Re: Shady bastards - CONFIDENTIAL (Terms of
	Services)

For those who didn't bother reading, technically, I can find a legal 
loophole with the TOS I wrote. Some of you who visited the TOS page, 
ended up (based on the timing factors I see in access_log) ended up 
right on my front door. Technically, you are now bound to pay. This to 
me is a case for arguing over the validity and use of broad terms and 
semi-uselessness of so called "e-contracts/e-agreements/e-signatures" 
and the likes. I think companies love the ability to state "this mail is 
confidential" knowing damn well someone will likely not think about the 
extent of that statement, then turn around and twisting terms for the 
sake of saving face. Its a dual edged sword, love it or hate it. As for 
the previous thread and original comments regarding email... Personal 
work should be left off of any network not OWNED, OPERATED by YOU the 
individual. It's already established that corporate property whether a 
paper clip or email is property of the company there are no if ands or 
butts about it at present time.

In funnier matters... "That's so broad it can't be considered legal... 
but usually will be" (From the TOS page)

How's that for obsoleting a law in one swoop. I wonder if I should call 
a lawyer and sue all the corporations who visited me this morning... I 
could use some "Krispy Kremes", "Starbucks", tuition at UConn, Satellite 
systems, etc.  ;)
