To risk breaking my keeping off legal grounds (note: IANAL)

With your logic, someone could bring in their home computer, hook it into the 
network, upload their private files to the server and name a 
directory "CONFIDENTIAL" and shove their personal home files in it and nobody 
is allowed to see what's in it to determine if it's supposed to be there or 
not because it's named "CONFIDENTIAL", thus the person gets free space on the 
COMPANY server to do whatever they please, even after they leave the company.

To be brutally honest, Those marked "CONFIDENTIAL" emails stick about as much 
as those lines some corperations make their staff have at the bottom of 
emails that say essentially "If you received this email in error, delete it 
immediately as it is confidential. It is illegal for you to have this email 
if it isn't reguarding you".

Is it me or are too many people expecting "security by good will" nowadays?
