Too late...

This makes me wonder at times about the validity and arguments on these
signatures as well as so called "Terms of Service" agreements.

For anyone doing legal research, theory work, school work, I implore you
to read http://infiltrated.net/tos.html. Technically this "Term of Service"
may be legal... Moral? Absolutely not, but legal, I'm almost sure it can
be worded/re-worded to work. Does anyone even read their terms of service
when visiting a website, downloading software. I'm willing to say about
.0001 percent probably do. I'm willing to be 99.9999% either ignore them
or skim through them. Confidentiality signatures on email? Make zero sense.
"THIS MESSAGE IS CONFIDENTIAL BUT GOING TO A PUBLIC FORUM. DO NOT READ
THIS MESSAGE IF YOU CAME ACROSS THIS MESSAGE FROM A PUBLICLY LINKED SEARCH
ENGINE. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PRETEND IT DOESN'T EXIST".

By the way, after you read the TOS, don't forget to contact me afterwards
to make payment arrangements. On a more serious note, a TOS such as this
one in my opinion, would shoot down the entire concept of the legality of
a TOS and some of the claims some TOS' make.
