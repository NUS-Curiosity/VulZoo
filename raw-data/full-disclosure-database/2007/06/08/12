Dear List,

I know we have a "World Police" but luckily we have no World laws, how
about some of you stick to things your supposed to be able to do,
security, coding whatever and leave law to those that practise it ?

I have yet to see a lawyer good at sec, it depends on
- legislation the company resides in
- the contract
- the form of the message

In luxembourg for instance mails labeled as PRIVATE or CONFIDENTIAL
are not allowed to be viewed by the company, ALSO as email. Write it
in the subject line.
