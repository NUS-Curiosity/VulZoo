Second Call for Papers

We're inviting you to submit papers and proposals for trainings for
the first annual DeepSec security conference.

We've been able to get some really good submissions, fantastic
keynotes, and extremely interesting invited talks so far, and are
hoping we'll get even more exciting talks during the final phases of
the CFP.

We're especially interested in getting more non-web talks! Dudes -
stop submitting basic ajax, web2.0 and voip security talks already,
we're flooded by these! We still want to get more submissions and case
studies of government project security (egovernment, electronic
health/citizen cards, electronic passports, i- and evoting security,
inter-government protocols, ...), and also more submissions on secure
software development, rootkits, forensics, and the security of popular
but seldom discussed protocols.

We've managed to come up with a really nice social programme around
the conference. Among other things, there'll be Capture the Flag and
Live Web Hacking contests organized by the Hack in the Box team,
exciting evening action at our partner event, the RoboExotica
Cocktail-Robotics Festival, and a thrilling speakers after-party at
Vienna's top hacker club, the Metalab. We're sure this will be a
conference experience that you'll remember!

So submit your talks and trainings now and don't miss the action! :)

All proposals received before June 16th 2007, 23:59 CET will be
considered by the Program Committee.
