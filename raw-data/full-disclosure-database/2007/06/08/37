Description:
    A vendor-confirmed [0] SQL-injection vulnerability in version
    2.2 of the CMS WordPress [1] was exploited [2]. The problem is
    caused by the lack of proper input filtering in the function
    wp_suggestCategories() of the WordPress XML-RPC API. For exploiting
    the bug the WordPress user authentication has to be enabled and the
    attacker is required to be authenticated.
