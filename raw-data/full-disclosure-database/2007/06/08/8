Subject: CSIS Advisory: BlueCoat K9 Web Protection 3.2.36
	Overflow

CSIS Security Group has discovered a remote exploitable arbitrary
overwrite, in the Blue Coat
K9 Web Protection local Web configuration manager on 127.0.0.1 and port
2372.

This allows an attacker to perform at least a Denial of Service
condition, on the
usage of internet.

Since the overflow can result in an overwrite of both the return address
and SHE, remote code
execution is possible.

Another attack vector could also be privilege escalation on the local
machine.
