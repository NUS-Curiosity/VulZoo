Okay, if you want to go about it that way and use the law in this "game:"..

In that event: It should therefore be the user's responsibility alone, nobody 
else's reguardless of departure reason (Fired, quit, etc) to tell the people 
that the specified mailbox will be terminated. Furthermore, mail should be 
dropped upon employee's depature, reguardless if the user made those 
statements to those who he/she communicates with, as there would be nobody 
else that has legal qualification to touch mail sent to that box, therefore 
anyone not contacted who continues to send mail to the defunct address, too 
bad. They may get notified later on, they may not, just continue dropping the 
mail.

As long as the caretaking of defunct mailboxes is under someone else's 
control, there will be "snooping" going on

So best option: Terminate account, delete all mail in the box and being 
received for then on, have nobody take care of any defunct mailboxes. That 
way, nobody could be exposed to privacy invasion lawsuits.

End of Problem.
