  As someone who has had to recommend policy in both government and private sectors, I would say that there IS a SOLUTION within the laws, both existing and proposed:

Corporate or Business Entity networks belong to the entity, not to the employee. 

Network security personnel who are accountable and responsible for ALL security breaches must, necessarily, be able to monitor ALL traffic on their network.

Most entities have the appropriate notification up that all network use is subject to monitoring, as is correct.

Employees should not use corporate resources for personal business or personal emails. If one has personal business not appropriate to corporate monitoring, they should use personal email during personal time.

That being said, most entities do not directly view all network traffic, all websites visited, or all emails, but usually have the capability to do so if a 'key word' type monitor is tripped.

The concept is not difficult - look at the discussions of technology, ethics, and legalities behind the "Eche***" and "Carni****" monitoring programs...

So it is *usually* not considered improper to log into your website email during breaks or lunch (if you are allowed internet access at all); nor is it considered improper to use your personal wireless laptop or iPhone on any public network as long as they are not connected to the entity network, or to check your email at home after work....

...And then there are some places the employers just don't care to go unless there is extreme reason. For example, complete camera surveillance of entity property is allowable, but I have not yet seen camera coverage include bathroom stalls unless there is a specific need for it...

Warm Regards,
Dave Druitt
