As Andy stated, the IOS Exploitation Techniques whitepaper covers
details regarding IOS vulnerabilities which have been previously
disclosed. Further information regarding the vulnerabilities used in
the exploit were resolved across two separate Cisco security advisories
released in 2005.

The first advisory covered the attack vector:

   Cisco Security Advisory:  IPv6 Crafted Packet Vulnerability
   http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20050729-ipv6.shtml

and the second advisory covered the underlying vulnerability which
allowed for the possibility of remote code execution:

   Cisco Security Advisory:  IOS Heap-based Overflow Vulnerability in System Timers.
   http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20051102-timers.shtml

Cisco customers should reference those advisories (and more recently
released advisories) to determine the version(s) of software needed to
remediate any vulnerabilities within their network.

We would like to thank Andy for his continued cooperation with us in the
spirit of responsible disclosure and working to increase awareness of
security issues.

For information on working with the Cisco PSIRT regarding potential
security issues, please see our contact information at

Thanks.
