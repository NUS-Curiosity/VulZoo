Subject: New flaw found in Firefox 2.0.0.4: Firefox file
	input focus vulnerabilities

PoC here: http://yathong.googlepages.com/FirefoxFocusBug.html

The vulnerability allows the attacker to silently redirect focus of
selected key press events to an otherwise protected file upload form
field. This is possible because of how onKeyDown event is handled,
allowing the focus to be moved between the two. This enables the
attacker to read arbitrary files on victim's system.
