Subject: Rutkowska faces ‘100% undetectable malware’ challenge, teasing?

hi guys,

ref: http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=334

so are they teasing by making her the impossible challenge at this date? :)

honeypot developers have been trying to battle the same issue of
making the virtual machine emulate guest OS like the it is run in real
hardware since some years now.

But if Rutkowska or anyone is able to succeed to make it undetectable
in current hardware that would be genius!
