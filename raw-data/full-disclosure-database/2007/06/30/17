Subject: Google/Orkut Authentication Issue PoC

This is a proof of concept for Google Authentication
issues posted in the threads...

1.)
http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2007-June/064143.html
(Orkut Server Side Management Error by Susam Pal &
Vipul Agarwal)

2.)

(Google Re-authentication Bypass by Susam Pal)

I found that after logging out Google session doesn't
expire in 24 hours. It is longer. I am doing this
experiment to see how long the session remains alive
after logging out.
    
I am posting a session cookie for my account.

Name: orkut_state
Cookie:
ORKUTPREF=ID=11190574376736842125:INF=0:SET=111236436:LNG=1:CNT=0:RM=0:USR=aGlqYWNrbWVwbGVhc2VAZ29vZ2xlbWFpbC5jb20=:PHS=:TS=1183210062:LCL=en-US:NET=1:TOS=1:GC=DQAAAIMAAAArC-mJYqsrCOnv8uVQHdFUccRFQX8-ibRerEzrie5sOWNc06zs4z4fMNpovLUyRcNXHwxk8WzY6Z6SmvxcSmL1hAW4Mrdvazzkssq5VjSO70oE1HSFR4KOkSb3ZLg-U7k0x8c7ZuLHwu_qY2Umy8oobckg9UctWXYd1qoerXUTzsFSuLNXHdiAEVCSw7fUO00:PE=aGlqYWNrbWVwbGVhc2VAZ29vZ2xlbWFpbC5jb20=:GTI=0:GID=aGlqYWNrbWVwbGVhc2VAZ29vZ2xlbWFpbC5jb20=:VER=2:S=1Ah7VcA0JetHQ0Mgyfp4Jb6meXw=:
Domain: .www.orkut.com
Path: /
Send for: Any type of session
Expires: Expire at end of session

I have logged out but you can use this cookie in this
way... (anyone can try this. You don't need Orkut
account to try this)

1.) Open Firefox, etc. which allows cookie editing.
This extension is required...
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/573

2.) Set the given cookie.

3.) Try to visit http://www.orkut.com/Home.aspx

4.) You will be automatically logged in with my
account. It will not ask for any user-name or
password.

5.) Logout

6.) Repeat steps 1. to 4. You can log in again.

I want to see how long this session remains alive
after multiple logout. If you try this POC leave a
message in the scrapbook of the account here ...

Thanks
Joseph
