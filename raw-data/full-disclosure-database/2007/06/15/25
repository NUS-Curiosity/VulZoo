damn man,
you complicate it so much.

right now,
Deepan is more confused than before.
like,
"Hey Deepan, in order to kill that mosquito we have this missile and..."

Math is simple,
and so must be the explanations surrounding it.

the thing is,
many different strings can result in the same, say md5 hash signature.

but only one string can produce that md5 hash signature,
that sha1 hash signature, fucking that sha256 hash signature, fucking that
<any_other> hash signature, etc...
