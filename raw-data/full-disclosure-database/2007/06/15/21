Subject: State of Ohio looses 64k employee records

Apparently, "backups" involve sending employees home with tapes ..

"Data management protocols at the intern's office called for a set of 
back up data to be stored off-site. But officials say the intern had 
been inappropriately designated to store the data at his home."
