Aditya has a history of using security mailing lists to advertise
his various security consulting projects (metaeye.org, etc) under the
guise of fairly bogus whitepapers and vulnerability reports:

http://portal.spidynamics.com/blogs/jeff/archive/2007/04/16/ASP.NET-encoding-shortcomings-_2800_review-of-MetaEye-analysis_2900_.aspx
http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2007-03/msg00079.html
http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2007-03/msg00115.html

As a rule, these claim to discuss cutting-edge attack techniques whilist
in fact describing something remarkably mundane (register_globals as
"Global Space Exploitation", form-based XSS as "Double Trap Attacks").

I would advise WEBSECURITY moderators to exercise... well, moderation in
approving his non-advisory posts:
