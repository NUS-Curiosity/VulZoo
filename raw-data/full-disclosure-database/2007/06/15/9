Subject: [Tool] sqlmap: a blind SQL injection tool
	(release 0.4)

Hi,

I am glad to release sqlmap 0.4; sqlmap is an automatic blind SQL
injection tool, developed in python, capable to perform an active
database management system fingerprint, enumerate entire remote
databases and much more. The aim of this project is to implement a
fully functional database management system tool which takes
advantages of web application programming security flaws which lead to
SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Project web site: http://sqlmap.sourceforge.net/
SVN repository: https://sqlmap.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sqlmap
ChangeLog: http://sqlmap.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sqlmap/doc/ChangeLog?view=markup

Cheers,
