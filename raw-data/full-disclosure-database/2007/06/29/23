Actually the original post was a publish and cussing out people who  
only publish a hash which does noone on the list any useful good.

I keep thinking someone needs to start a usenet group/website/ 
database for these folks to publish their hashes to for posterity.   
Kind of useless on a mailing list, especially this one.  A hash is  
not a disclosure, it's a "nyah nyah, I got something but I ain't  
tellin but here's my hash of it so I can prove I did it first".
