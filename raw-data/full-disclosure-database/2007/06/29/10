As mentioned in the advisory, this *doesn't* require a user to provide 
his/her password to re-authenticate. The presence of valid cookies is enough 
to bypass re-authentication. This is a potential threat on a shared system 
where a user is logged out to failed authentication during a session and he 
assumes it to safe the shared PC at that point and leaves. Another user can 
simply put a valid URL such as the http://www.gmail.com/ or 
https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount and access his account without 
his password. 

An ideal design would be to disable the session unless the user 
re-authenticates himself successfully with his password. This has been 
explained in the 'Solution' section.

Agreed. 'Impact' section describes only the possible consequences. In future 
if an XSS flaw is discovered in future, the XSS flaw can be used to hijack 
sessions and the information in this advisory would allow you to have access 
to the compromised account even after the user has *logged out* or has been 
logged out.

As explained in the previous advisory, the vulnerability is that an attacker 
can access a compromised account even after the user has *logged out*. 
Logging out should *terminate* or *disable* the session at the server side 
which is not happening in case of Orkut sessions.
