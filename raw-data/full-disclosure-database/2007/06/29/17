Subject: blackhat talk pulled inexplicably (at the risk of
	violating MONBACOPL)

So by now you've almost certainly read:

http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/062707-black-hat.html

MY HYPOTHESIS on what has happened is that:

1) The technology is very flawed
2) The patch requires hardware to be re-issued, which causes all kinds
of law-suits, broken contracts and SLAs, basically it's a legal
nightmare.
3) The reason for the inexplicable pull out is a heavy legal threat
aimed directly at the presenter/research/their company.
4) Other people have broken this and are already pwning crypto
technology based on it

But I have *no* evidence at all. Anyone got any more information so we
can piece this together?
