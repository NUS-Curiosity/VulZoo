Does what happens in the Facebook stay in the Facebook? is a quite
clever video that shows some of the privacy issues that concern social

Mayhem article, which was published not that long time ago.

The real question is: if Facebook has access to so much information,
what hackers have access to? Hmmmâ€¦
