Title: [CAID 35450, 35451, 35452, 35453]: CA Products That Embed 
Ingres Multiple Vulnerabilities

CA Vuln ID (CAID): 35450, 35451, 35452, 35453

CA Advisory Date: 2007-06-21

Reported By: NGSSoftware, and iDefense

Impact: Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code, or 
overwrite files.

Summary: Various CA products that embed Ingres products contain 
multiple vulnerabilities that can allow an attacker to potentially 
execute arbitrary code. CA has issued fixes, to address all of 
these vulnerabilities, for all supported CA products that may be 
affected.

1) Ingres controllable pointer overwrite vulnerability (reported 
by NGSSoftware) [Ingres bug 115927, CVE-2007-3336, CAID 35450]
Description: An unauthenticated attacker can potentially execute 
arbitrary code within the context of the database server.

2) Ingres remote unauthenticated pointer overwrite #2 (reported by 
NGSSoftware) [Ingres bug 115927, CVE-2007-3336, CAID 35450]
Description: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit a pointer 
overwrite vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the 
context of the database server.

3) Ingres wakeup file overwrite (reported by NGSSoftware) 
[Ingres bug 115913, CVE-2007-3337, CAID 35451]
Description: The "wakeup" binary creates a file named 
"alarmwkp.def" in the current directory, truncating the file if it 
already exists. The "wakeup" binary is setuid "ingres" and 
world-executable. Consequently, an attacker can truncate a file 
with the privileges of the "ingres" user.

4) Ingres uuid_from_char stack overflow (reported by NGSSoftware) 
[Ingres bug 115911, CVE-2007-3338, CAID 35452]
Description: An attacker can pass a long string as an argument to 
uuid_from_char() to cause a stack buffer overflow and the saved 
returned address can be overwritten.

5) Ingres verifydb local stack overflow (reported by NGSSoftware) 
[Ingres bug 115911, CVE-2007-3338, CAID 35452]
Description: A local attacker can exploit a stack overflow in the 
Ingres verifydb utility duve_get_args function.

6) Communication server heap corruption (reported by iDefense) 
[Ingres bug 117523, CVE-2007-3334, CAID 35453]
Description: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the 
context of the communications server (iigcc.exe). This only 
affects Ingres on the Windows operating system. Reported by 
iDefense as IDEF2023.

7) Data Access/JDBC server heap corruption (reported by iDefense) 
[Ingres bug 117523, CVE-2007-3334, CAID 35453]
Description: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the 
context of the Data Access server (iigcd.exe) in r3 or the JDCB 
server in older releases. This only affects Ingres on the Windows 
operating system. Reported by iDefense as IDEF2022.
