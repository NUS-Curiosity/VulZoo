Subject: DB Assessment tool

Hi all,
 
Most often this list hosts assessment tools based on trying to exploit
one or more vulnerabilities. I would like to take this opportuinity and
introduce a free database scanning tool that works by looking into the
database configuration for evidence of a vulnerability rather than try
and exploit the vulnerability. This makes this tool much more IT
organization oriented rather than hacking oriented. I hope you find it
usefull. The tool can be downloaded at
