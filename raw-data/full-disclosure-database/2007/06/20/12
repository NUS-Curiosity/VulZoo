Subject: HackersFirst

HackersFirst is a relatively new Hacking Group, with several important
ideals, including "Hack The Planet," Freedom and Preservation of
Information, Free Open Source Software over Proprietary Software, etcetera.
As you probably have seen earlier an eMail has been sent out saying that we
are fighting for something and we need people, THIS IS NOT TRUE.  You were
the Primary victims of a Social Engineering attack, and we were meant to be
the Secondary.  As you can see I am trying to stop this, so DO NOT come to
the Group looking for a fight of any kind (at least not yet ;]).
Nevertheless, if you are genuinely interested in a Hacking Group like ours
and have the inclination to learn and be loyal to the Group, you are by all
means welcome to come check it out.

 

Greetings From Cyberspace

HackersFirst
