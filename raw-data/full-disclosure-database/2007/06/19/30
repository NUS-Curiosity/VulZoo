absolutely.  i didn't mean to imply that embedded and lightweight
webservers were more robust, they surely aren't.  only that they would
be much less likely to interpret arbitrary unprintable characters in a
request as valid.

in particular, buffer overflows are not uncommon for embedded devices,
like those who don't expect a request URL to exceed 1024 characters,
etc...
