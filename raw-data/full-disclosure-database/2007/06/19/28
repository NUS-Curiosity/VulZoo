I'm tempted to take that bet.  Lot of people have thrown lots of truly wild
stuff at the Apache code over the years - it may react in *unexpected* ways,
but it's probably pretty bulletproof.

On the other hand, that little webserver admin tool that's stuffed into one
corner of your DSL modem's ROM probably got tested: "Each menu goes to the page
it's supposed to, if you enter an IP here it sets it, if you enter a port there
it DTRT", with little to no serious abuse of the interface.  I'll bet half the
gear out there, the test suite never even *considered* that maybe a 0x0c should
be sent, even if just for shits-n-giggles to see what happens.
