You used a repeatable - albeit debatable - method of guessing the
gender of an individual based on pre-defined notion that men or
women MIGHT speak/slash write in a specific pre-defined manner.

What you've failed to include anywhere in your study was the fact
that, since these messages you've studied were gathered online,
the fact that one can become anything one chooses to be gender-wise
leaves your conclusion as just a theory with no solid ground. Keep
this in mind considering that this is a security list and is replete
with those comfortable in social engineering.

With this said, what's to stop someone from using say, context-free
grammar in their message to this mailing list - something which they
might normally do on a daily basis, in favor of saving time by using
regular grammar along with a barrage of abbreviations for the sake
of not wanting to type much or perhaps simply shooting off a response
as quickly as possible. Think about this deeply and ask yourself the
question as to whether you've been duped Krawetz. How would you
know someone hasn't used you as their own experiment in determining
who's been monitoring what, why and how for the purpose of disinformation
somewhere down the line.

There are times when I read posts here which lead me to wonder about
the validity and credentials of some of the people here. Surely it's
dawned on you that there are a majority of young individuals on this
list. Some seek guidance, some seek attention. Will you always shoot
off such asinine elitists messages to those who don't conform to some
pre-defined standard you've set or are you under the impression that
everyone was born with a PhD.
