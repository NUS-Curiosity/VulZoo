Yes I did read the page and I've also read through the obnoxious and smug
messages where this theory based hocus pocus voodoo bs is used for so
called hacker profiling. Quite frankly I could care less about n3td3v,
gobbles and whether or not they're one in the same. The purpose of my
message was point out that here is the quote on quote expert Krawetz
fingering individuals based on this same concept.

While vehemently insisting his method is not flawed I find it ironic that
he does not admit to it openly. Sure he can post it on a page, but how
about clarifying it openly. I can whip out some Chomsky documents and
offer arguments vis-a-vis and I can surely admit publicly when I'm an
ass I've done so plenty of times... Krawetz, you need to simmer down on
this "hacker profiling". You may fool the kiddiots, but how do you know
you haven't been fooled.
