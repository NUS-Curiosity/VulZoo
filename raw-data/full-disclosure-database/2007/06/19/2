a biased mind peers into the chasm that is full-disclosure:

<Dr._Neal_Krawetz,_PhD.> "my god, it's full of [n3td3v | GOBBLES] !!!"

... your paper was interesting and inherently flawed; may you one day
discover the concept of "compounded errors".

consider GOBBLES the slim shady; n3td3v the pimply imitator in a ford
festiva with plywood spoiler.  all you see is one annoyance, while
intact intellect discerns the substance from the shallow.

don't worry, i'm only pissing on your expert security credentials, Dr.
Neal Krawetz, PhD., because i too am n3td3v... disguised via
artificial intelligence softwarez!
