: >>A more ethical company would have sent HDM a polite note saying that

: Does your company do this for all former employee e-mail accounts?

No. But they also don't continue to accept mail to those accounts either.

: Let's hope he unsubscribed from all his mailing lists before he left.

If a company is going to continue monitoring a former employee's mailbox 
(intentionally or via a 'catch all'), that is fine. But when they 
specifically act on a personal private mail between someone outside of 
their company and the former employee, they are crossing the line of 
ethical behavior I think. As I said, the least they should have done is 
mail HDM and notified him the person no longer works there. If they didn't 
do that, and if you think they shouldn't be required to, then they 
shouldn't act on the information in the mail either.
