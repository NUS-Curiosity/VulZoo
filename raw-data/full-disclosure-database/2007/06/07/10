Subject: Re: You shady bastards.

The key is *personal* e-mail.  It's not unreasonable for any 
company to assume their e-mail systems are used primarily for 
business purposes. The e-mail doesn't indicate it's personal. It 
doesn't say, "Your Ghonorrhea test results have come back!  Click 
here for the results."  The e-mail has no contents other than a 
link and doesn't indicate that the "Zero Day" promise was made 
after this employee left the company. In fact, the subject "Zero 
Day" is directly related to SecureWork's business and it's entirely 
reasonable to expect a security company to investigate the 
contents. I'm actually surprised someone actually monitors these 
accounts and took the time to look into it!
