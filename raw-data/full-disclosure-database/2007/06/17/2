You know, I expect this kind of stupidity from regular people. There's no
reason in the world why I would expect regular folks to understand what
"The Internet" actually is, let alone how it works. That's why we have so
many idiots running around screaming that we need "Network Neutrality".
But to find that sort of stupidity HERE, even from a head case like
netdev...
It's shocking to me.

I should perhaps be more realistic in my expectations.
