Subject: Re: n3td3v says second internet exists

Okay, I have a few points I would like to make (assuming if this is true, 
which I doubt as it is technologically possible to properly implement):

1. The Internet is not owned or run by a single government therefore This is 
impossible to implement successfully and properly.The Internet as we know it 
cannot be controlled by a single government. The Internet as we know it is a 
de-centralized entity, with no "central network" that controls it all.

2. This current Internet (aka The former ARPAnet) has something We like to 
call "Redundancy" and Since the Internet (ARPAnet) is de-centralized, there 
is no real method of "attacking the Internet", you can only attack nodes of 
the internet, as you take down one link, another comes up to service, take 
down that link, and yet another comes about. The Internet is more complex 
than having bunch of home routers linked with single links peered between 
each other.

3. "Switching people over" and "With new protocols" - hm.. What could go wrong 
here... people's computers failing to being able to communicate with 
this "new Internet" because of incompatible protocols as well as operating 
systems... as well as what would be done to prevent 'crap' from the "old 
internet" from "leaking over"? 

I suggest stop doning a tin foil hat every time people "think of a plan", 
Especially those without a clue (i.e. cororate execs and government)

My appologies to the list for increasing the noise end of the SNR of the list.
