Shhhhh, dont tell anybody.. But theres a super secret web 1.0 page for
the choosen few. Since everybody knows you are a Ã»berhacker I guess we
better let you in on it.. -> http://www.internet2.edu/ .And make sure
you do not mention the secret European network either
http://www.dante.net/geant/ . Just dont let anybody else know about
these (especially the non-belivers on Full-Disclosure)

Except off course a "not very secure" network would actually be much
easier to eaves-drop on, wouldent it ?. Or are you saying the new super
secure Internet is cleattext protocol only ? Please advise..

FYI, All the "international hackers" needed turned out to be a browser

Dude, Im confused now, are they  "international hackers" or "underground
hacker" ? Or are you saying theres perhaps a combination of both ??.

Whoooa ! You totally lost me there !. But was it something about
timelines ? Try here -> http://www.internet2.edu/about/timeline/ (also
highly secret !)

So only people at the White House, Internet Security experts, Goverment
officials, most major US & EU universitys + the Full-Disclosure list
know?. Can I also tell my friend Joe (he'll think Im sooo cool) ??
