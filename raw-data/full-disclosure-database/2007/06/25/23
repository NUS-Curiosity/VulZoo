Isn't  this list called "full-disclosure"? - in otherwords: If you aren't 
going to disclose anything: DON'T post that you "have something". This list 
is designed specifically for disclosing (and discussing on the occasion) 
vulnerabilities, problems, etc to the entire community at once, not just 
selectively who you choose (i.e. who buys your "0day").
