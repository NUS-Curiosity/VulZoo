*Proposition*

Microsoft is a 280+ billion dollar corporation. Why don't/can't they have a
standard ransom fee for security flaws?

0day Remote OS flaw: $1,000,000
0day  IE explorer flaws that give administrative shells: $200,000
0day (other flaws) that affect other products (ie office): $200,000
etc..(these fees could be much higher)

Provided the person who discovered the vulnerability gives a full working
patch, Then Microsoft could patch the hole right away and people could
update. (yes i know lots of people don't update but at least it is a start,
and then legally they would be so liable). Maybe this concept isint new and
I am just in the dark about it.

*Question*
**
Why does'nt Microsoft (or any company) do this? And also has Microsoft ever
been held criminaly liable for negligence in a criminal case for not
patching a flaw leading to a security breach? Or is there team of lawyers
just to much for any normal person?
