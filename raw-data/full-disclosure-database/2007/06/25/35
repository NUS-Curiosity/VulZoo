<i>If other places are offering $20K for a 0day, why should Microsoft offer
10 times that, when they can probably make the sale offering only $25K?</i>

I would think Incentive.. Sell my exploit to some criminal network for
cheap? Or would I rather Microsoft trump their offer by much
more and continue consulting for microsoft rather than criminal networks.
Also if I am in any industry (lets say software) I am going to strive to
produce the best product possible reguardless of the profit. This means
spending a lot more for peoples research than some average criminal who will
then make much much more money the security researcher

<i>Yes. They could.  But if they've bought exclusive rights to the exploit,

should they?  Remember why the concept of "full disclosure" started in the
first place - because if a vendor is the only one who knows about a hole,
they

</i>

Well I would think there would be some motivation. Unless every employee who
codes at Microsoft is a money grubbing greedy person with no reguard to the
person who uses their products then there would have to be some motivation
to fix the product if it is flawed.

<I>Which is a better bet for Microsoft - spending $15 million on a big PR
and
advertising campaign that announces the 'New Secure Attitude', or spending
$50M on quietly fixing the broken software?
</i>

lets see, they spend 50 million over 7 years (windows xp lifespan so far)
not bad..
they are a 280+ billion  dollar company.

But compared to a Security team of 50 people at $250,000 a year for 7 years.
= 87,500,000 , Looks like their security team is costing a lot more..

Also I should'nt have to take into consideration 'the amount of security im
willing to pay for' If I can only get so much (guaranteed?) security for 1
price.

<i>Microsoft could *easily* argue that the webmaster
or sysadmin or whatever *should* have known that "software is hackable" and
taken additional precautions of their own.</i>

That is like me trying to argue that after going to a car mechanic, I should
have known that the engine mount that I paid to be secure in my car would
have loosened on a bumpy freeway and let my engine fall out on the freeway.
I should have put a big metal sheet under my car from keeping things from
falling out after i pay for service!! I just should have that knowledge
magically. It just won't hold up in court.

<i>Making a *criminal* negligence case stick would be *exceedingly* hard to
do</i>

I don't think it would be so hard. Someone reports a critical flaw, and
microsoft reports it, but does'nt patch it and does nothing about it. So
they know about the flaw at hand and are'nt doing anything to fix it. That
is the definition of negligence. Its like a tire company knowing of a
problem in their tires, stating the problem, and not recalling the tires.
They know of the problem but don't fix it. Now I've been thinking, I dont
think you'd need a big DA or anything of that nature. There was a judge in
the news recently suing for $60,000,000 for a pair of pants. All you have to
do is piss off the right people.

just some thoughts..
