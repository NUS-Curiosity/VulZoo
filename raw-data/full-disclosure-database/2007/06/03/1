Subject: Disinfectors for the calculator virus (ti89.Gaara)


Hey,

For those who are interrested, i made two types of Gaara (the calculator 
virus) disinfectors. The first one patches the virus body, which causes 
to return the control to the host just when the EPO injection travels 
the control to the virus. So the virus will not get executed at all.
And the second one is trying to find an EPO injection by searching for 
BRA opcodes, and testing them for suitable conditions.


Here are the codes:
Dis1:

Binary:
http://piotrbania.com/all/ti89/dis1.89z

Dis2:
Source:
http://piotrbania.com/all/ti89/dis2.c

Binary:
http://piotrbania.com/all/ti89/dis2.89z


i hope you will find them somehow interresting.

best regards,
pb
