I think your "vulnerability report" sucks (to use your word.)
1) You use very unprofessional language
2) You provide no links to either Base or the Base+ fork so the reader can 
check for themselves.
3) You provide no source from the Base+ fork to show how its 
authentication scheme is not vulnerable
4) You personalize your report by using Kevin's name, in an attempt to 
embarrass him
5) You provide no evidence that you have ever contacted the Base project 
and notified them of your "discovery"
6) You don't even mention that an authentication vulnerability was 
**reported and fixed** more than a year ago, nor do you mention how your 
report relates to that vulnerability [1][2][3]
7) You don't explain that the code you posted is not part of the 
authentication system and that the auth code is in base_auth_inc.php.
8) You don't explain what you mean by "what if not?"  The answer is, if 
not, then authentication is required, you do have a role and you have 
already authenticated.
