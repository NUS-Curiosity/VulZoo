Description:
    In previous versions of the mutt package, it is possible for an attacker
    to subvert other local users' mutt processes causing them to run
    attacker-provided code. Additionally, it is possible for a hostile server 
    masquerading as a user's APOP server to determine some characters from a
    user's password.
