Subject: Re: You shady bastards.

A very good point.
The subject line doesn't always show anything related to personal e-mail message and does the person monitoring messages know what is related to his/hers work?

I see adding the word PRIVATE as a part of subject line a good practice.

It's not so easy to accidentally post these e-mails to mailing lists etc.
Related to Maynor's case: If you are reading the e-mail account of former employer and you click a link included to message with marked as private you really cross the line.

HDM made a good decision when using a file name maynor.tar.gz.

If you are testing issues like this use very rare file names and it is worth of testing Return Receipt too. And use a complicated directory structure (not easy to guess) when generating the test files like maynor.tar.gz.
