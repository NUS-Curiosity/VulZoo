Spare me and the list legalities. One it is slightly offtopic then again 
this is fd so I retract.

That entire argument and any thread arising from what is legal and what 
is not is likelier
to be answered, dissected, studied on a legal forum.

Laws are not about what could or should. They're about what's written. 
In this case, he sent
an email to someone's former workplace. The worker was not there, the 
employer obviously
read the email. So the questions to ask should be 1) HD didn't give 
consent, did/does the
employer have something written to their employees which states the 
monitoring of email.
If they do, case closed there is the one party federal consent.

Secondly, did HD specify in his email any legalities of unauthorized 
reading. No.

Thirdly, you need to realize what you've stated and your 
misinterpretation of the law.
ECPA protects against INTERCEPTION. No interception occurred here, the mail
was delivered to a recipient.

The network is the company's and all of its communications into or out 
are property of the company.

Email auditing and email interception

A second distinction to make is the difference between email auditing 
(sometimes called email
monitoring), where email is checked after the actual transmission, and 
email interception (sometimes
called email filtering), where email is intercepted and checked during 
transmission.
