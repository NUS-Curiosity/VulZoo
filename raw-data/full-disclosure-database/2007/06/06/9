Subject: SecNiche - CERA Project is Reoriginated

Hi all

           This is zeroknock. I feel pleased  to announce that
project CERA is up again. There are some subtle problem
occurred previously.

CERA : Cutting Edge Research Analysis is project of
SecNiche : Dwelling Security.

The Sec Niche which will be up very soon which holds my work.

The CERA : http://cera.secniche.org
                      http://zeroknock.blogspot.com

I am not associated with my previous group. Lot of other
projects are coming. All to serve community.

I am concerned for previous delay. But now its all
ready. I have left my shared research work back to
the singular group.

Thanks

Regards
