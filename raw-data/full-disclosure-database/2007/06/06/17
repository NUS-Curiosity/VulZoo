Spare me and the list...

What about an employer's right to read e-mails as
they come in? As they hit the inbound server? ...
If the e-mail is not subject to the consent of
all parties, and one of the parties (either the
sender or recipient) lives in a jurisdiction
that mandates all party consent, then this could
be an unlawful interception under state law.
(Federal law requires only one party consent.)
