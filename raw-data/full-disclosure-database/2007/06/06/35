Would you feel the same way if it was a voicemail left on his machine?
What about a postal letter addressed to the person?

All are means of communication, although vastly differing laws pertain
to each. I have always found this confusing. Why should the method I
use to convey personal messages be treated with such amazing leaps in
the levels of expected privacy?

Snail mail, (PSTN/GSM/mostVOIP)telephone calls, and emails are all
sent unencrypted (unless you consider the envelope a form of
encryption) IMO if you disagree with the companies rights to
open/listen to one form of communication, you should disagree with the
all of them.
