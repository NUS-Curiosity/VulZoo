Subject: Re: You shady bastards.

I'm certainly not a laywer, but the below cases refer to an employer and
employee relationship. That isn't the case here and is likely an important
distinction. You're also assuming that while he was an employee he consented
to monitoring and had no expectation of privacy. While that is generally
true, it may not be.

I've been involved in a few employer/employee investigations. The subject is
always legally sensitive and the legal department is generally a huge
player. The method of collection, the information that's collected, and the
purpose of the collection are always significant factors. Generally there
has to be a reasonable effort not to intentionally invade the employee's
privacy. That's a bit contradictory but in the 4-5 situations I've been
involved in that has always been the case.

In the case above, it appears that the former employer is intentionally
maintaining the email address and monitoring it for the purpose of obtaining
information unrelated to business needs.

Going back to hdm's original comment "Illegal or not, this is still pretty
damned shady" and definitely unethical.
