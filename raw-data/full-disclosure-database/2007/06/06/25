Mr. Moore, 

Your expert recon abilities have been established earlier in this 
thread. I will not allow you to trick me into giving up my Georgia 
cable modem address knowing full well that you are armed with the 
latest version of the 'preter. Besides, Richard (who stresses the 
importance of image in this industry) tells me that you make the 
developers commit under your name in order to keep their fancy 
metasploit.com electronic mail addresses.

In any event, I have alerted the FBI to your hacking attempt.  I do 
not wish to become your latest victim of police kidnapping, 
choking, and beating.
