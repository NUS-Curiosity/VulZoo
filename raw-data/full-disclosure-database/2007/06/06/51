Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in ELinks allowing for the
user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ELinks is a text-mode web browser.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /   Vulnerable   /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/elinks      < 0.11.2-r1                   >= 0.11.2-r1

Description
===========

Arnaud Giersch discovered that the "add_filename_to_string()" function
in file intl/gettext/loadmsgcat.c uses an untrusted relative path,
allowing for a format string attack with a malicious .po file.

Impact
======

A local attacker could entice a user to run ELinks in a specially
crafted directory environment containing a malicious ".po" file,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running ELinks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ELinks users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/elinks-0.11.2-r1"
