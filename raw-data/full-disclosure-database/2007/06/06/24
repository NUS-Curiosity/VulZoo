I agree that the subscribers to FD are not the best crowd to discuss
legal issues with.  This will be my last post on the matter.

Exactly.  That and how the courts interpret them.

As mentioned multiple times by multiple posters, but apparently eluded
your reading, the recipient's consent:

 A) May have never been given
 B) May have expired with the employment contracts
 C) May not apply at all if the monitoring party was not given
    authorization by the company

These laws don't require senders or recipients to opt out of monitoring.
PERIOD.

FALSE.  ECPA applies to stored communication after delivery Wiretap act
applies to communication in transit and therefore interception.  Maybe
you should review the overturned ruling on United States v. Councilman
again.

Maybe you should follow the advice of your own sig quote.
