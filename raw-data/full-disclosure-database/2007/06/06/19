Spare you what?  If this is somehow off topic, please elaborate.

Right, so under federal law, single party consent is sufficient.  If HD
didn't consent, and the former employee currently doesn't consent (i.e.
consent under the AUP or other agreements has expired), then it could be
illegal.  That, or if the person reading the stored communications is
not authorized by the company, then they would be personally liable.

Your conjecture that it's legal because the employer somehow owns the
communication or the networks it travels over is completely bogus. The
recipient is this email user, not the company.

Yup just looked this up.  This was thrown out because Nancy consented
under JH's email privacy policy.  I don't see how this conflicts with my
argument.
