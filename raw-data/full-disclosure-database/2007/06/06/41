Subject: Re: screen 4.0.3 local Authentication Bypass -
	Working on multiple systems

Hi Nico,

I agree that there isn't much point in going through with the process  
if you already have an open shell.  In order to replicate not only  
the original vulnerability report but the subsequent behaviour, it  
was the only method discovered that even came close.  Source code  
analysis shows there isn't much opportunity to break out of the  
locked environment, and to get the response from screen that one of  
the earlier reports did you need to interrupt screen BEFORE it  
locks.  Plus, it bugged me that a vulnerability put up on milw0rm  
wasn't working as advertised.

Looking in at why BSD might be vulnerable but not other systems when  
a SIGINT is sent led me to look at what happened if another signal  
could replicate the process.  While SIGHUP ended screen as well, it  
was only SIGKILL that then allowed you to reattach the supposedly  
killed screen with screen -r.  I know there are some differences in  
the way BSD handles some signals when compared to Linux / Unix / OS  
X, but this behaviour is just plain odd.

After all of that, I place this in the 'Interesting, but unlikely to  
have practical use' category (for the various reasons already covered).
