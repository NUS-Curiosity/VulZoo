So I take it that law enforcement computer examiners and prosecutors *do* have
the years of experience in software engineering and exploit construction and
use, to qualify them to translate a bit of data into forensic evidence of guilt?

Since the standard is "innocent until proven guilty", it would seem that the
prosecution's interpretation would need to be even *more* technically rigorous
that the defense's interpretation.  However, the number of district attorneys
and detectives that have 10 and 20 years of full-time work experience in
computer security is very limited, so one wonders why the court would accept
the findings from a prosecution expert that doesn't have the qualifications that
you imply a defense expert should have?

Also - do you require that all DNA testing be done by a professional with several
decades of research in genetics, or do you allow a well-trained technician to
do the work?
