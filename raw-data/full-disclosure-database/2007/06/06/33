That's an interesting point.  Not sure how that aspect of it would be
interpreted against the ECPA, and Wiretap Act, and other related laws.
While a consent exception may no longer apply, in a way the
communications weren't sent to them anymore, since they don't exist
at the company.

In any case, J. Oquendo's obsessive linking has convinced me that this
probably wouldn't be illegal due to non-provider exceptions, even
without consent.

Sorry H.D., it most likely isn't illegal.
