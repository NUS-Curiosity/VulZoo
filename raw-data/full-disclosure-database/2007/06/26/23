What I've discovered is that some devices run telnet, and it requires no 
login at all.  Haven't tried doing anything with it yet, but a DoS was 
possible in earlier versions of the software.  I suspect that's still the 
case.

It also runs ftp, with a login of "admin" or "administrator" and a null 
password.  So you can remove, alter and upload files at will.  I suspect 
that could be used for plenty of nefarious purposes.

Then there's the web interface; no login, admin access remotely to setup, 
placing a call, etc., etc., and if they use a password, just load 
http://target/a_security.htm and it will happily present you with the 
passwords in plain text.

I suspect the ftp interface would be the most fruitful, because you could 
upload new web pages with embedded scripts that load malware, redirect to a 
fake site, exploit weaknesses in the browser, etc., etc.

All in all, a pretty poorly designed (from a security perspective) device.
