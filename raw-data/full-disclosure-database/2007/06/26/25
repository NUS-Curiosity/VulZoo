Thanks.  I'm not that interested in DoSes, but I'm thinking that you could 
mget the entire contents, alter them to your satisfaction and then mput 
them.  Don't know how much memory these things have yet, but you ought to 
be able to iframe silent installs of malware, script the capture of all 
audio and video traffic from/to the device, etc.  Could be quite 
interesting.
