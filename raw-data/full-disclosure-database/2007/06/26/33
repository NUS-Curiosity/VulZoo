Synopsis
========

libexif does not properly handle image EXIF information, possibly
allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libexif is a library for parsing, editing and saving EXIF metadata from
images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libexif      < 0.6.16                        >= 0.6.16

Description
===========

iDefense Labs have discovered that the exif_data_load_data_entry()
function in libexif/exif-data.c improperly handles integer data while
working with an image with many EXIF components, allowing an integer
overflow possibly leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user of an application making use of a
vulnerable version of libexif to load a specially crafted image file,
possibly resulting in a crash of the application or the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libexif users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libexif-0.6.16"

==========
