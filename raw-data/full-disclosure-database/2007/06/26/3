Subject: Overwrite variables eqDKP 1.3.2d and prior
	(login.php)

If you want to run old code that relies on register_globals temporarily, 
make sure you use one of the non-overwriting extract_type values such as 
EXTR_SKIP and be aware that you should extract in the same order that's 
defined in variables_order within the php.ini

-----
eqDKP 1.3.2d and prior login.php allows you to overwrite variables.

Impact: At the very least path disclosure via error, but use your 
imagination. :)

Vulnerable Code:
Lines 20 and 21
extract($_GET);
extract($_POST);
-----

path-to-eqdkp/login.php?tpl=fucked
path-to-eqdkp/login.php?user=fucked
path-to-eqdkp/login.php?eqdkp=fucked

And so on... no further evidence required.
If you want a hint on escalating this vulnerability, try overwriting 
variables login.php is going to try call from other scripts.
