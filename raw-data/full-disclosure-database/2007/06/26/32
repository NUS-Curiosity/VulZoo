Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in emul-linux-x86-java,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of
Service.

Background
==========

emul-linux-x86-java is the 32 bit version of the Sun's J2SE Development
Kit.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                            /  Vulnerable  /    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java     < 1.5.0.11      >= 1.5.0.11

Description
===========

Chris Evans of the Google Security Team has discovered an integer
overflow in the ICC parser, and another vulnerability in the BMP
parser. An unspecified vulnerability involving an "incorrect use of
system classes" was reported by the Fujitsu security team.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
image, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Emul-linux-x86-java. They also could
entice a user to open a specially crafted BMP image, resulting in a
Denial of Service. Note that these vulnerabilities may also be
triggered by a tool processing image files automatically.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Emul-linux-x86-java users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.11"
