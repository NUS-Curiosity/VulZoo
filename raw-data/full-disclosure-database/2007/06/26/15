Hehe, you don't even know what can be done with PSYOP.

Did you ever immagine how many PSYOPS are behind financial activities of hedge funds?

What's very very interesting is that PSYOP it's really a 0day issue in the technological information security / hacking environments.

Being 0day and unknown will give us much more competitive advantage with the regards of people like you that does not understand!

Thanks a lot for your precious lack of knowledge :)
