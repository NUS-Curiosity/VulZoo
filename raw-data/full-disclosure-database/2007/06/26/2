--------
Summary
--------

The way Microsoft Windows handles filenames is well known 
and documented [1]. In situations where the path to 
executable contains white space and is not enclosed in 
quotation marks, it is possible to execute alternate 
application. This attack is commonly referred to as the 
"Program.exe trick".


---------
Analysis
---------

Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner (WVS) is an automated 
web application security testing tool. Acunetix WVS 4 and 
WVS 5 do not properly handle file names containing white 
spaces creating a condition where an attacker might be 
able to install arbitrary code as a file 
%SystemDrive%\program.exe. The arbitrary code would 
generally be executed under the privileges of the 
executing user but could also be launched with elevated 
privileges. Acunetix WVS Scheduler Service 
(WvSScheduler.exe) is executed in LocalSystem context and 
thus the vulnerable code will be executed in privileged 
LocalSystem context.


-----------
Limitation
-----------

1.)
Default permissions on Windows XP Professional prevent 
least-privileged users write access to %SystemDrive% and 
thus this attack must involve some form of social 
engineering or need to be combined with another attack to 
first get the arbitrary code installed in the correct 
location.

2.)
Windows xP will alert user about "File name warning" while 
executing %SystemDrive%\program.exe. Attacker might 
circumvent this warning by setting registry key 
"HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
\Explorer\DontShowMeThisDialogAgain" value name 
"RogueProgramName" value data "NO". In any case, local 
services are executed before user registry keys, meaning 
that program.exe would be already executed when the 
warning appears.


-----------------
Proof of concept
-----------------

- copy program.exe to %SystemDrive%
- restart the computer
- login as least-privileged user
- use whoami.exe [2] and enumerate user privileges

Tested on Windows XP Professional sP2 and Windows 2000 
Professional SP4.
