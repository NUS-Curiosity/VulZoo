These people are talking to Cnet about outside hackers doing something, but
its the enemy from within thats the biggest threat to all three brand names.

What these people do in office and what they do and who they speak to out of
office are completely different things.

While these teams play the good guys at work, they are the actual elite
skilled users that the government are keeping an eye on outside of their
corporate cubes!!!

I have spoken to many people from these companies and they are two faced in
so many ways, and they are more than whitehat, they where multi colored
hats!!!

The brand name doesn't know whats going on, but there are elements who know
whats going on, but are too scared to speak up because of job and career
insecurites, so they jsut shut up and turn a blind eye.

If employees weren't scared to speak out against known rogue employees, the
brand name would be far more secure from security breaches.

i can tell you that half of them are blackhats but play the role of whitehat
during the day, but the same people are seen in underground hacker channels
at night openly planning cyber attacks.

if you want the real story behind all three security teams then approach me
and i'll give you the employee names and evidence to back everything up.
