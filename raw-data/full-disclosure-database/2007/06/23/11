Subject: About the power of Google

http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/about-the-power-of-google

Google has become the most profitable organization on the Web, having
access to millions of people personal information, providing free
services in exchange for even more data, dominating the web we know it
today. It is time to question Google's dominant position on the global
market, before it is too late. In the months to follow, I am going to
present a serious of posts on how Google has transformed from the
don't be evil search engine company to the true hacker platform.
