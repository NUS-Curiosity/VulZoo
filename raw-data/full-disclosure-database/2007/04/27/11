Let n = 1, A1 = p, B1 = q. Then
1. A1B1 = pq = N.
2. A1(-B1) = p(-q) =
   [let's pretend this careless mixing of equalities in Z an
    congruences in Z_N makes any sense and assume -X stands for N-X]
   = p(N-q) = p(pq-q) = p(p-1)q = pq(p-1).
QED.

Ok. Your "gypothesis" holds (sort of). We can factor N when we know its
factors. What a breakthrough. Perhaps Bill Gates will mention it in
"The Road Ahead II".
