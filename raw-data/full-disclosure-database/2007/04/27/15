Product Description:

> From the forensicswiki.org website[1]:

  "The Advanced Forensics Format (AFF) is an extensible open format for
   the storage of disk images and related forensic metadata. It was
   developed by Simson Garfinkel and Basis Technology."

AFFLIB(TM) is the reference implementation of the AFF(TM) format,
written primarily by Simson Garfinkel.  It comes in the form of an open
source library and a set of command line tools used to manipulate
AFF(TM) files.



Vulnerability Overview:

In mid-March, 2007 Virtual Security Research, LLC (VSR) performed a
security code review of AFFLIB(TM) as a part of an internal tool
assessment process.  As a result, multiple vulnerabilities of varying
severities were discovered. The most significant of these
vulnerabilities are being announced publicly to raise awareness and help
end-users secure themselves against potential attack.

A time-of-check-time-of-use race was discovered in AFFLIB(TM) which
could allow an attacker on the local machine to overwrite an arbitrary
file.  Because the content of the file would not be controllable by an
attacker, it is unlikely that this is vulnerability is exploitable for
more than a denial-of-service.

This vulnerability remains in the latest version (2.2.8) despite several
notifications to the vendor.  All line numbers listed below are from 
version 2.2.0.


Vulnerability Details:

File: aimage/aimage.cpp
Lines: 554-575
Platforms Affected: Unix

Description:
A mostly predictable name for the lockfile as it is created under
/tmp. An access check is first performed, and later the file is opened,
truncating if it already exists. Since the time of check and time of use
are not the same, a filesystem race could be exploited by a local
attacker through the use of a symlink. Lines 548-582 are included below
to illustrate the problem:

 int getlock(class imager *im)
 {
    /* If the file exists and the PID in the file is running,
     * can't get the lock.
     */
    char lockfile[MAXPATHLEN];
    sprintf(lockfile,"/tmp/aimge.%s.lock",im->infile);
    if(access(lockfile,F_OK)==0){
    /* Lockfile exists. Get it's pid */
    char buf[1024];
    FILE *f = fopen(lockfile,"r");
    if(!f){
        perror(lockfile);		// can't read lockfile...
            return -1;
            }
            fgets(buf,sizeof(buf),f);
            buf[sizeof(buf)-1] = 0;
            int pid = atoi(buf);
            if(checkpid(pid)==0){
                /* PID is not running; we can delete the lockfile */
                    if(unlink(lockfile)){
                    	err(1,"could not delete lockfile %s: ",lockfile);
                            }
                            }
                            /* PID is running; generate error */
                            errx(1,"%s is locked by process %d\n",im->infile,pid);
    }
    FILE *f = fopen(lockfile,"w");
    if(!f){
    err(1,lockfile);
    }
    fprintf(f,"%d\n",getpid());		// save our PID.
    fclose(f);
    return 0;
 }

This is likely only exploitable for a denial-of-service condition, since
the attacker would have little control over the content being written
(the process ID of aimage).
