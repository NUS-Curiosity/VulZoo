Subject: Vista typographical vulnerability

Platforms affected: All
Distribution: low (lol)

It has come to my attention that Macroslut Vista contains at least 
three spelling errors.  These include the "Welcome Center", the 
"Security Center" and some other "center" that my poor, addled brain 
can't recall right now.

The Vista in question was set to the "UK" region, where "centre" is 
spelled correctly.

While (probably) not affecting the operation of the software itself, 
these errors are likely to at least cause one small child somewhere 
to fail his university entrance exams, and may also precipitate the 
labelling of other users as illiterate.

Far be it for me to accuse Macroslut of revisionist imperialism, 
never - this is just an isolated case of cluelessness, I'm sure.

In any case if you folks have forgotten, you are speaking English, 
and in England, centre is spelled C-E-N-T-R-E... OK???
