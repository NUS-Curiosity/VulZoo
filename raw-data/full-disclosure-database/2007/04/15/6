Subject: ZoneAlarm Multiple insufficient argument
 validation of hooked SSDT function Vulnerability

Hello,

We would like to inform you about a vulnerability in ZoneAlarm 6.


Description:

ZoneAlarm hooks many functions in SSDT and in at least two cases it fails to validate arguments that come from the user 
mode. User calls to NtCreateKey and NtDeleteFile with invalid argument values can cause system crashes because of errors 
in ZoneAlarm driver vsdatant.sys. Further impacts of this bug (like arbitrary code execution in the kernel mode) were 
not examined.


Vulnerable software:

     * ZoneAlarm Pro 6.5.737.000
     * ZoneAlarm Pro 6.1.744.001
     * probably all versions of ZoneAlarm products branches 6.x
     * possibly older versions of ZoneAlarm products

Not vulnerable software:

     * ZoneAlarm Pro 7.0.302.000 and higher
     * probably all versions of ZoneAlarm products branches 7.x and higher



More details and a proof of concept including its source code are available here:
