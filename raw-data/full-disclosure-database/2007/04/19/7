	Command Execution Vulnerability

Anybody with some experience on BMC Patrol products know that 
security levels 1 to 4 are rarely used, because of the 
configuration and management overhead.

Furthermore, level 0 (the default one) isn't imho the only security 
level impacted by this vulnerability (which is an anonymous r/w 
access to the SNMP configuration, including full paths to 
binaries), given that level 1 use anonymous SSL and that level 2 
use SSL with unverified client certificate. Levels 1 and 2 will 
just help an attacker to bypass your NIDS.

Interested people can have a look to the "Patrol Security User 
Guide" 
(http://www.bmc.com/supportu/documents/73/44/17344/17344.pdf) for 
additional details.

Conclusion : pconfig/xpconfig/wpconfig or any similar custom script 
can be used to hack any default install of Patrol BMC but it "has 
been found not to be a security vulnerability". How sad :-(
