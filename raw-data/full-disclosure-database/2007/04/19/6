Subject: Anyone have a Lindows/Linspire contact


Sorry to ask this of anyone on this list... If it bugs someone
please respond offlist no need to irritate others more than I
already have...

I'm hoping someone could provide me with a direct contact for
someone in Lindows/Linspire/*whatever*umbrella*name. Seems
they have a security issue on their hands... Tried getting
information from their fluffy website, no dice.

Tried whois, etc., no direct names available...
