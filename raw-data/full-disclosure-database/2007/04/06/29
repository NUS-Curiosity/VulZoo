Accessing it is different than listening to it. Assuming I don't do ARP 
replay or other L2 games because I'm impatient, I've never really 
"trespassed" since you were blasting your signal into a public area, and 
it's an unlicensed band.

(IANAL .. anyone have a case law link for the above conjecture?)

Depends .. can they convince the jury that your fence wasn't *really* 
tall enough? Remember .. here in the US, store owners get sued because a 
burglar falls through the roof during the course of a break-in.

Put another way, if I use a system known to be ineffective (a twist-tie 
on a gate lock, to use the above "pool" example) it could be plausibly 
argued that you in effect made no effort at all.

Once someone writes a network widget that automates the (capture -> 
crack -> connect) process, it could probably argued the same way for WEP 
(again .. IANAL).
