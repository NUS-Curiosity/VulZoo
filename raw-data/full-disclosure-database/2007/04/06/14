Do you mean not beaconing the SSID as mentioned by Michael or do you mean
they being blocked by a wireless IDS?

With the limited knowledge about this stuff i am wondering is

Well if its just not beaconing with the SSID (aka no ssid broadcasting) then
follow Michaels steps or just do a tcpdump or use wireshark to filter the
frames  and look into the frame control.  If its due to a Wirless IDS you
should still be able to see some traffic but you will probably see alot of
deauths also if its trying to prevent rogues.

your welcome.

As for Michaels comment

Sure you can.  You have to do it on the primary wifi0 and not a vap (athx).
shut it first, then change it (ifconfig or tool such as macchanger), then
bring it back up.

hope this helps.
