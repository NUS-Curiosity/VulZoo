Subject: Question Regarding Wireless Frames

Hi All,

Recently i come to know about a network where becon frames where
blocked.With the limited knowledge about this stuff i am wondering is there
any other kind of frames from which we can identify the accesspoint over a
wirless network?
Thanks for any help.
