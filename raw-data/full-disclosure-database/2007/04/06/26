Well, people who do it for a living understand it's a tradeoff continuum,
where fractional values make sense, and the most sensible setting varies
from place to place.

But when you're trying to sell to Joe Sixpack, or a PHB in upper management,
confusing him with more than two choices ("Good" and "Bad") just pisses him off
and loses you the sale.
