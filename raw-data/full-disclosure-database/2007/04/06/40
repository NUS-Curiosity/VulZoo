Here's what wikipedia has on this.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Torch

" Operation Torch (initially called Operation Gymnast) was the
British-American invasion of French North Africa in World War II during the
North African Campaign, started November 8, 1942."

"The Soviet Union had pressed the United States and Britain to start
operations in Europe, and open a second front to reduce the pressure of
German forces on the Russian troops. While the American commanders favored
Operation Sledgehammer, landing in Occupied Europe as soon as possible, the
British commanders believed that such a course would end in disaster. An
attack on French North Africa was proposed instead, which would clear the
Axis from North Africa, improve naval control of the Mediterranean and
prepare an invasion of Southern Europe in 1943. American President Roosevelt
suspected the African operation would rule out an invasion of Europe in 1943
but agreed to support Churchill."

The battle of Stalingrad  which was the turning point on the Eastern Front
went from August 21, 1942 through February 2, 1943.

For you to hint that the battle of Europe was "already won" by the Russians
is bullshit!

Back to my point.

The U.S. Wanted nothing to do with any European wars - we were dragged into
them. Now, we're hearing a lot of crap from people like Timo, who know
nothing about history, trying to tell us we aren't handleing things the way
you would like.

Tough shit! You sprung us out of our borders because of your inability to
handle your own problems, and 60 years later you hand us a load of shit
while at the same time you can't defend your own sea lanes of trade from
Iran, et al. Grow up!
