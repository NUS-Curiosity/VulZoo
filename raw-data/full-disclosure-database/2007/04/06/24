That's one bad-ass woods you live in, or one *really* low packet rate network.
Given the recent attacks that can do the break based on only a few minutes of
packet capture on a moderately busy network, it shouldn't be more than a long
afternoon's work. Eaten by a bear is *exceedingly* rare, most skunks won't
spray unless you corner them, and if you have any brains it will take
mosquitoes a long afternoon to chew you alive unless you're in swampland.

I will however grant you that rabid skunks are both fairly common and
bad news.
