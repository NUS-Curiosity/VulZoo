in fact, _I_ did, as you could read on my email from yesterday, 9:04pm.

their health care is way way better and _everyone_ can afford it, as it
doesn't cost anything for people there.

admitting, they don't have new iPods every two months -- but who needs
them there? they are not in the situation like the US where 'panem and
circensis' is neccessary to keep the people down.

interestingly, even the german burgouise media said (when Castro was
ill last year) that more than 2/3 of the Cuban people back the
revolution. so, how much is that in reality? go figure.

i did not meet many of them. i recommend watching 'Surplus: Terrorized
Into Being Consumers' [0] where a Cuban girl -- being interviewed in
Cuba -- tells about her year in GB as an exchange student; very
enlightening.

in fact, people do.

defending against antihumanist propaganda has to be done, regardless
where. it's very important to keep fighting against fascism.
