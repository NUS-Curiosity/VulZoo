Really? Like how far?

I've done point-to-multipoint (me with 24db parabolic, them with a 
standard omni) at 6 miles (granted, I was on the 12th floor of a building).

2 Linksys boxes running OpenWRT and a decent battery (actually using WDS 
you could have a whole string of such devices) sort of negates the 
mosquito/bear/skunk problem if you're so far away that you can't be 
found with a reasonably high-gain antenna.

WEP is basically a screen door, and always has been.
