AUSTIN, Texas, April 05 2007 /CAUNewswire/ –

CAU announced today it’s second specialized certification offering into
the Information Security Certifications market, the Phone Hacker,
Researcher, Exploiter, And Konqueror (PHREAK®) certification. Nearly two
years since introduction of it’s extremely successful first offerings of
the CAU Certified Information Systems Security Practitioner (C²ISSP®)
certification, as well as it’s first specialized certification, the
Hacker and Xtreme 0day Researcher (HAX0R®) certification, this new
certification is targeted toward all hackers who specialize in
vulnerability and exploit development within the scope of targeting and
exploring telephony systems and technology.

In continuing the trend that CAU started with their first two
certifications, the PHREAK® certification process is also FREE, as in
“free beer,” not as in “free speech.”

More information on CAU’s Information Security Certifications can be
found at the organization’s website, under the Certifications area:
