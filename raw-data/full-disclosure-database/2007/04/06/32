Like, I can probably get my car up over 45mph(72.42kph) before I get to
the end of my driveway far.

Yeah, there's some cool shit that can be done with
wireless/WRT/WDS/parabolocs... a friend of mine was experimenting with
some directional antenna and the WRT54Gs running one of the 3rd party
firmwares. He got some pretty far reaching signals. But he had tall
buildings around too. Where I'm at, you'd be in a tree.

You'll need a bunch of em... it takes me 25 minutes to drive to the
grocery, and I know a shortcut.

> WEP is basically a screen door, and always has been. 

True, I won't argue with that. I just need to deter the neighbors from
trying a simplified version of the above so they can get free broadband
access, but even if it was an open AP, I doubt anyone would bother.
Where I live, I'm lucky if my broadband connection is working at all. In
the last 4 months alone I've gotten over $100 credited to me on my cable
bill for downtime. My house came hard wired for a generator... that
pretty much says it all right there.

I wouldn't trade it for anything though, not even heating my food on the
wood stove like it's 1827 when the power is out for 26 hours.

NOTE: I still need to pick up a generator, anyone know of one for sale? ;o)
