Subject: Re: Question Regarding Wireless Frames

You mean SSID not broadcast?

Look for the client's network-specific probe request. Kismet (and 
others) do this automagically. Windows quite helpfully issues probe 
requests for *all* the networks it has past associations for.

You can also use aircrack-ng to force-deauth a client and just watch for 
them to reauth, since the mac-layer stuff isn't encrypted.

IMHO, the Atheros chipsets work best for this sort of stuff. Get the 
patches to allow raw frames from aircrack's website 
(aircrack-ng.org/patches). The only bummer is you can't change *your* 
mac with ifconfig like you can with other cards.
