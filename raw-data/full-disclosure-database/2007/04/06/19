Subject: WEEPING FOR WEP

seconds. Knowing that WEP is no more secure than a plastic luggage
lock, many people are questioning whether WEP is even useful at all.

While I certainly do not recommend WEP for high security (or even
moderate risk) environments, you need to remember: security is a
measurement of risk. If the threat is low enough, then WEP should
be fine.

WEP actually has three things going in its favor:

   * Availability: While there are many alternatives to WEP, such
as WPA and LEAP, only WEP is widely available. Hotels and coffee
shops that only cater to WPA or LEAP will not support many of their
customers. However, if you support WEP then everyone should be able
to access the network.

   * Better than nothing: There's a saying in Colorado: I don't
have to run faster than the bear, I just have to run faster than
you. If a casual war driver or WiFi-parasite has the option to use
your WEP system or your neighbor's open system, they will always
choose your neighbor. Having WEP makes you less desirable than an
open WiFi because there is no effort needed to use the network. If
you happen to live next to a coffee shop or library that offers
free WiFi, then the casual wireless user who just wants Internet
access will always choose free over the hassle of cracking WEP.
While WEP does not block a determined attacker who wants your
network, it will stop opportunistic network users.  Attackers tend
to not be sophisticated and do not choose their targets.  Attackers
are much like Russian roulette players, and like Russian roulette
players are usually both Russian and not very intelligent.

   * Intent: This is a biggie. If someone trespassed on your
private network through an open wireless access point, then proving
digital trespassing can be very difficult. However, if the user
must bypass your minimalist WEP security, then they clearly show
intent to trespass.

Consider WEP like a low fence around a swimming pool. Without the
fence, you are in trouble if a neighborhood kid drowns in the pool.
It's an "attractive nuisance". However, with the fence, you should
be covered if a kid climbs the fence and drowns. It's still bad,
but you have a standing to refute blamed since you put up a
barrier, even if the barrier was minimal.

As far as WEP goes, it may not be very secure, but it is better
than the open-network alternative. If you have the option to use a
stronger security algorithm, then definitely do that. However, if
you have no other option, then WEP is better than nothing.
