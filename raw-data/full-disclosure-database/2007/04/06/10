After trying to sort through the quotes and re-quotes; I'm really not sure
who made the following statement:

QUOTE:
==============================
...that's not true. 
when western countries 
(GB, USA) joined in WWII, 
the battle was already 
won by the russian red army. 
==============================


Regardless, that statement is historically inaccurate. Not just a little
inaccurate... COMPLETELY inaccurate.

Between nonsense like that from people who apparently never bothered to
open a history book and ridiculous statements like; "One man's terrorist is
another man's freedom fighter." it is completely obvious that practically
the only people left on this list are dumbasses, script kiddies and
refugees from Dumb-O-Craptic Underground.

Not that anyone except me cares, but it seems to me that the S/N ratio here
has finally reached a fatal level.

No point in sticking around to watch the body rot.
