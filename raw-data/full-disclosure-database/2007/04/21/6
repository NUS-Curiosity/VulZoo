"It has already consumed N megabytes of memory."

This condition is superfluous from a purely theoretical POV because a
program running for N units of time cannot consume more than N units of
memory (*) but this upper bound is too loose for most programs doing any
useful work.

(*) Or less than log_2(N) units of memory unless it is going to 1. read
more inputs from the outer world or 2. loop forever.
