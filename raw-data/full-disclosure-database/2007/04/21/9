Subject: Apparently eEye's blog got p0wnd

When I saw the post on Full Disclosure, I didn't think much of it.  BS 
like that is posted here routinely by fools without a life.  However, when 
I saw it in my rss feed, I realized that eEye's blog got p0wnd by somebody.

Here's my RSS feed:

Whitehat Manifesto: Life at eEye

By Ross Brown

Cocktard2xw5_2

Hi,

My name is Ross Brown, eEye Squirting Research CEO.

I'm an addict. I'm addicted to the same all-dancing, all-singing crap that 
this so-called "security industry" is made of. I sell utterly flawed 
products through my company and employ brilliant individuals such as Marc 
Maiffret who can't even read. I also work for the company who was behind 
Code Red and nowadays pretends to promote "responsible disclosure". We are 
nothing but blood sucking animals. We suck the motivation and altruism out 
of the really talented people, and turn them into industry whores.

We are the ones making this whole security consultant image. College 
degree, responsible individual with a dog and nice family, with a feminist 
girlfriend who buys "French donuts" and cracks you up every night. We are 
utterly hopeless, and thus we are being owned by crack commandos from 
outerspace.

We have tainted the whole thing already. We manipulate people through 
press releases, we release "0-day patches" and products that allegedly 
protect from the problems that "the bad guys" create. We are the ones who 
buy "exploits", information from third-parties and anything that can boost 
our market share by spreading fear. We create the problems for the 
solutions we sell. But we are retarded enough that our own products are 
flawed to their knees. A single look over their source code would cause 
you deadly diarrhea. I know this because Tyler knows this.

All we do now is blogging, "podcasting" and utterly gay crap. We would 
rather shut the fuck up but we feel like telling the world how bad h4x0rs 
are and how they can snap off your cybercock.

We invented beautiful terms such as "responsible disclosure", 
"vulnerability response time", "proof of concept", "penetration testing", 
"ethical hacking", etc. We also invented rubber fists, but that's another 
story.

I'm a whitehat and this is my manifesto. You may snap off my cock, but you 
may not stretch my anus with a rubber fist. You may release your evil 
0days or own me with them. I'll stand anyway. Because I have no other 
intention than buying CANVAS licenses and IDA Pro (ah, we employ Andre 
Protas too, don't tell Ilfak about his leak of IDA Pro 5.0 Advanced to 
CRACKLab.ru). I have no other intention than fucking up the real sense 
behind this. I have no other intention than building up a industry based 
on fear and public relations. Space monkeys have been sent on mission. 
Fuck yeah, I pen-test the world, ethically!
