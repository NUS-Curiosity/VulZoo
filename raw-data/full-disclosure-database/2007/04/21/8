ActionScript is a crappy language, it's used in Flash movies.

Since it was created to be used by webdesigners, there are lots of
failsafe devices, including an "infinity loop detector". 

No more than 100.000 iterations, as I remember.

Of course real programmers hated the thing, it created lots of weird
bugs, because if you can't trust your loops... terrorists win ;)
