Are you familiar with the term STFU?
If so, then please do so.

Come on - how obvious can you make it? You have nothing to do with
warfare, hacking or freedom. You are just a troll.
Exactly when people stop leading pointless debates you just pop right
back in.

This is a seclist. And I guess it is just a matter of time before people
will turn against lamers like you.
