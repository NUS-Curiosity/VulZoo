You left out two important things to try: 

* Single user mode, invoked by holding Command-S after the chime.  If you 
are having system boot trouble, the second thing AppleCare will have you try 
is single user boot.  (The first is a traditional UNIX-style boot, they call 
it verbose mode, which is Command-V.) 

* The install CD has a Terminal shell available, and you can access your 
system under /Volumes/SystemVolumeName, like you would using FireWire Target 
Disk Mode. 

Check Mac OS Help for "Shortcuts".  There's many key combinations that are 
available, and they're all in the help.  Well, all the ones I know about. 

Also, 

* Booting from an external FireWire disk (or USB disk on Intel models); hold 
down Option to get a simple boot disk... uh... option menu.  If you don't 
have one, you could install to a scratch external disk with the install DVD, 
without modifying your internal system disk.  Turn off all the fonts and 
printers and bundled software and it doesn't take long at all.  Never throw 
out old IDE disks, a spare FireWire/USB cage and a 10 gig disk can be very 
handy if you're running out of options.
