Hackers United Update from the Front Lines

The Hackers United against the Threat of Islam have continued their stance at readiness, awaiting the strike by American forces on the physical infrastructure of Iran. During the waiting period, Operation Screaming Eagle has continued with a significant degree of success, preparing for surgical strikes on core routers owned by the Telecommunication Company of Iran (a puppet corporation of this corrupt, Islamic-extremist held nation's "government"), including several Cisco 7200, Cisco 12000 and Cisco 7500 series routers. As well, several computers at Iranian universities have been taken control of in preparation.

The freedom-loving Hackers at the front have been joined by their Israeli brothers in arms who stand strong beside them, bringing their unique experience and talents in dealing with the threat of Islam to their well-being. Their numbers were added to the battle group, as well as hackers taking up the cause in Canada, China and Poland who understand the threat of Islam to continued growth and well-being of the world, as well as the need to bring governments devoted to protecting the rights and freedoms of the citizens of a nation, including the right to religion, and the separation of religion from state affairs.

Preparations shall continue for attacks to be launched against the Iranian infrastructure, and when the day comes we will be ready.

Islam must be stopped. And the Hackers United against the Threat of Islam are there to do the job.

Shout outs to everyone united against Islam. We stand together to face this threat to humanity.
