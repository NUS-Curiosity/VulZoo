That clears the picture a-lot of "how" the list of sites pointing at
google.com was composed, but more generally speaking it's just passing
the stick from one guy to another corporation. OK, this guy copied the
list generated using domaintools.com reverse-ip lookup utility, great.
Still the question remains - How do they do it? What/How are they
monitoring to keep their database up to date?

Never the less, thanks for the very helpful pointer.
