  was looking at a friend of mine photos on flickr and found this little tid
bit
it showed his email to address from his nextel phone ... along with his
phone number of his nextel as the send from address

and to confirm this do a search on flickr with "messaging.nextel.com" and it
will show you the phone number of the nextel user along with the "Secret
Email Address" to send photos to flickr
