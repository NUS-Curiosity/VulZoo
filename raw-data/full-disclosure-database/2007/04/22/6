31337 is just an example port! aMSN is binding an ephermal port after you've
started it. Just do a netstat -an and look for ephermal ports. If you get the
aMSN port you can connect to it and sending some characters and you'll get
replies by aMSN. 
If you send an '{' or '}' character to that amsn port, you'll notice
that aMSN is reporting an error message (amsn window). 
But if you going to send more than one character of '}' or '{' 
it will be killed. Yes, the whole client!

To "Ismail Soenmez": What about "DDoS"? Sending characters to that port in an
"infinite" loop is a DDoS for you?
