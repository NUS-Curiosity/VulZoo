All my kids got their own computers when they turned 3.

Initially with Daddy's(tm) installed filters but later I'm just loggin.

If they fuck their computers up, I'll reinstall the latest image.
(Just as you would do with cow-orkers).

Soon 10 years later I still just upgrade boxes, monitors or parts
as needed. They learn by using and abusing.

If they ask for tutoring or hints I provide, otherwise I leave them
to their own.

A bunch of 7 yo having a Lan parties and figuring out how to hack their
clients is quite amusing.

A 12 yo trying to hack Daddy's firewall is also amusing, I think I can
outsmart 'em for some more years, but it's becoming a challenge :)
