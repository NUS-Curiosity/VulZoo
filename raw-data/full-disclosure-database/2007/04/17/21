Dear carl hardwick,

Both  Firefox  2.0.0.3  and  IE  6.0.2900.2180  resisted  (Firefox stops
loading  page  after 500MB of memory, IE warns about script slowing down
performance).  It's  simple  memory  bomb,  probably  you are vulnerable
because you have <= 512 MB of RAM.

ch> Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.3 is also vulnerable
