Subject: Persistent CSRF and The Hotlink Hell

http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/persistent-csrf-and-the-hotlink-hell/
http://michaeldaw.org/papers/hotlink_persistent_csrf/

I would like to bring your attention to a topic that has been rarely
discussed. I am going to talk about hotlinks, redirections and of
course CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery).

When we talk about CSRF we often assume that there is one kind only.
After all, what else is in there when CSRF is all about making GET or
POST requests on behalf of the victim? The victim needs to visit a
page which launches the CSRF exploit. If the victim happens to have an
established session with the exploited application, the attacker can
perform the desired action like resetting the login credentials, for
example.

However, CSRF can be as persistent as persistent XSS (Cross-site
Scripting) is and you don't need XSS to support it. Persistent CSRF is
not dependent on persistent XSS.

I hope that you find the post useful.
