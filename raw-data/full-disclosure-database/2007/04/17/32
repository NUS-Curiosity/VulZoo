And that means the corporates should be expected to be (as) botted?

Indeed we should.

It's easy to compare numbers, but that's not the real story.  Almost by 
definition an ISP has no administrative control of the computers its 
customers use to connect via its service.  Corporates are totally 
different in this regard -- in fact, diametrically opposite.  
Corporates own and thus are responsible for the control of all the 
computers they attach to their LANs and should be responsible for the 
actions of all those machines.

So, in answer to your question, yes, we definitiely should expect more
-- a great deal more.

Will they be perfect?  Sadly, no; partly because of human fallibility 
and partly because too many of them take what seems to be your view --
"controlling all this is a hopeless task so why even bother trying".

And finally, I don't think SI's efforts show that any F500s are as bad 
as a "typical ISP".  SI is, however, showing that at least some F500s 
have lazy arse/stupid/otherwise incompetent admins and/or oversight 
procedures and/or policies driving the whole mess of their IT systems, 
and as a result the rest of us pay for their incompetence.

Did you read any of their reports fully?

They don't assume that.  They track the mail back "behind" the gateways 
and they know what forms of what spam are being sent through bot-nets 
because of other systems they run (honeypots, etc) and analysis they 
perform.

And they made an obvious (or much more subtle) error like this where?
