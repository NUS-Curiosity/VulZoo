Subject: ...Alright I need a little help....

So far i've spent two days fooling around with metasploit-Like a new
girlfriend trying her out.
I've looked on forums, i've looked on google.

So there are a few exploits written for metasploit. Now for the exploits
written in ' .C ' for the new meatasploit doesn't work like before.
Now it reads only ruby and or perl. So far i've looked around in my
metasploit DIR and only found there to be .rb files.
SO is it possible to convert a .c file to .rb so i can load it in
metasploit.

For example. This exploit ' http://milw0rm.com/exploits/3746 '
It's came in .rar packages with a few .c files. Open'ed it with DEV C++. I'm
guessing if i were to put down the information in for example the port and
ip address
and compile it, and run it would work.

Am i able to convert this into a ruby file so i can load it in metasploit.
So far i've not found a program that can do that. Maybe thats all i need if
it's possible is a program. Or i'm also thinking that it's just not going to
happen in metasploit and that i'm going to have to compile and run under the
language.
