Metasploit 2 only runs modules written in the Metasploit 2 Perl format.

Metasploit 3 only runs modules written in the Metasploit 3 Ruby format.

Keep in mind that many exploits also depend on a specific version or 
update of the Metasploit Framework. If the exploit is for Metasploit 3 
and uses the new Endpoint Mapper features, it will only work with a 
fully-updated version of Metasploit 3.0.

You can't "convert" a .rar or .c to a metasploit module directly, but you 
can "port" the exploit over if you know what you are doing.

Hope this helps,
