I've worked in a large corporate environment. I don't think it's a matter of
the admins being lazy or incompetent. It's more a matter of corporate
politics. The admins roll out a policy that locks down all workstations,
prohibits the installation of unapproved software, and prevents visiting
restricted web sites, and all is well. Then, Melllvar, the CEO's nephew in
accounting, complains that he can't play World of Star Trek. The CEO comes
down on the IT department, and the admins either lose their jobs or open a
few holes for Melllvar, who promptly installs a "crack" for his game,
unleashing a bot on the local LAN.
