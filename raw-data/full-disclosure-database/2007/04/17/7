  That depends how nasty proprietary BIOS behave...

  "Intel EFI is a DRM bios, since it has unlimited control of your
  memory and I/O, and implements a full network stack. So the BIOS can
  veto your I/O, and report your being veto'd over the network. By
  design. I know people at banks who are very unhappy with this. They
  thought they were running GNU/Linux and knew what the whole thing was
  doing.

  A few years ago Intel were explaining the cool EFI stuff, how EFI can
  download a new version of the BIOS and burn it to flash, on its own.
  They explained how convenient this is - but chaos went off when the
  banks heard about this. For the banks, like LANL, when we buy a
  consumer machine, we either demand full, buildable, source code to
  their BIOS, or that they ship LinuxBIOS, now."

  If you care about freedom, you'll be aware of this  problem, and your
  next motherboard will be something listed on
  http://linuxbios.org/Supported_Motherboards - the Gigabyte M57SLI-S4
  is the current favourite, and FSF sysad Ward Cunningham has written
