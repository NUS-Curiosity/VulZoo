Or... her complete failure. Someday the little child could be hitting warez,
mscracks, crackspider or maybe rotten.com (just to mention some of the most
known) going just out there or a more strange address you are not aware of
to look for the key to run that little great game that refuses to run
because is protected and... Guess what he/she will see ;)

I really doubt that a 3 years old kid (and I definitely don't believe in
that number 2 you said can even type at the keyboard) can handle that
avalanche of pornography and violence without burning/twisting their little
brain. If I where a parent I would wait a little more time until that
technology could be maybe critical as you call it instead of playing the
geek parent that teaches his kid to go earlier. Nope filters are not very
smart and the internet is WILD and only takes a couple of clicks before you
land on a very strange place. And we all know that. Given the fact that now
there is even emulation on that Is really scary the little monsters that are
being built out there. Hey sometimes I can't even handle rotten.com and I am
not a teen since quite some time ago. Some day I just decided not to visit
that website anymore imagine a little kid's brain. Hey you could even
misspell Yahoo or Google and get hacked or get the avalanche in front of
your face. Or maybe type some random stuff into a search engine. Guess what,
robots are not smart enough to get that kind of stuff out if their index and
believe me those guys are busier taking out competence and copyrighted
material out of the index than actually caring about taking out that kind of
content. Ohh I forgot, you can also download an exe and execute a little
*program* that automatically tells you enjoy hot fresh hotties. Sure no
problem the little hacker will be able to debug it before that happens
right? Ohh yeahh I forgot the antivirus will be smart enough to catch a
modified version of morphine or  Yoda's protector ;)
