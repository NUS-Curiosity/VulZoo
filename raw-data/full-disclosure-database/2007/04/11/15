This is *highly* dependent on the definition of "best".  Possible factors:

a) Amount of money paid
b) How white/black/grey hat the group is
c) How "under the table" they are willing to be - this could be important
if you want the bucks but *not* the fame and notoriety

Somebody might be willing to accept $10K from a white hat group, but
want $25K from a known black/dark grey hat group to cover the added risk
of being associated with them if the exploit is used for nefarious purposes,
but willing to settle for $20K if the exploit can't be traced back to them.
