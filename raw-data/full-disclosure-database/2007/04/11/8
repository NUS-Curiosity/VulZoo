Of course I am not questioning the intelligence on anyone. Polite
people don't do such thing. I don't know you so I can't judge you,
that's all :-) and if I have remarks on that, I don't do them in a
public mailing list. It would be simply lame.

Still, I found quite strange that you use - in what seems to be a kind
of "official communication" - one of the worst English ever seen
(which doesn't testify for professionality. Still bear in mind, I am
not judging anyone...) or that you talk in pluralis majestatis like
you were the Queen :-)

Apart from jokes, what I am questioning is that you really have a clue
of such organisations, apart from always pointing your finger to Yahoo
- which should have done something to you I guess :-) are you a
disgrunted former employee? :-)

I am not so interested personally .-)

Ok, I trust you that Yahoo is sending their out of office out to the
world. Therefore I suggest you to say "some" corporations or just
"Yahoo".
