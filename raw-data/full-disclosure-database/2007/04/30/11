Description:
     Previous versions of the vim package allowed two functions, feedkeys() and 
writefile(), to be used in the sandbox. Functions executed via modelines in 
files being edited are verified by the sandbox; a user who is coerced into 
opening a specially-crafted file could cause the system to execute arbitrary 
shell code supplied by the attacker.
