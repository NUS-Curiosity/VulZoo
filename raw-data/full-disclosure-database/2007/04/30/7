Subject: Firefox 2.0.0.3 non-existent applet DoS flaw

Firefox 2.0.0.3 is unable to handle a multiple request of non-existent
applet so, after some page refresh, crashes or stops to answer.
You can try this exploit here www.shinnai.altervista.org/nea.html but,
if so, you need a little patience 'cause it's too slow than from local
exploitation.
