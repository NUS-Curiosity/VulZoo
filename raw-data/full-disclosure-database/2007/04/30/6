Any idea why his DVD offer only goes to December 2006?

And it does seem like he'd have an actionable complaint against Verio if
they're terminating his account without cause.

Then again, unless you're an insomniac I'm sure there's fine print
saying they can terminate you for not showering for one day or something
too...

Back to lurk-mode,
Brandon

As a friend of mine said elsewhere, John Young must have said something
bad.

No word yet on a new host.

He got the two weeks notice on the 28th.

Verio caved. It's really too bad, for us all.
