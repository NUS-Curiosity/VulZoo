Alex had said that he was exploiting this bug on Firefox, even though
the Firefox docs say it should be impossible. I'm just trying to
understand how his claims are possible.

There's no reason to believe the Firefox developers need to do anything.
IE, for example, is fixed when the ANI code in GDI is fixed.

Why? That would needlessly put Firefox users at risk -- not everyone
will be able to apply the Windows patch immediately. Microsoft may have
had since December to craft a patch, but the Firefox team hasn't.
