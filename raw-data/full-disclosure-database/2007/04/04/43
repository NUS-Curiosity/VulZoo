I think there are about two handfuls that I know of that can place it all
together but I also know in doing so many careers could be ruined as well
as current businesses to some degree.

Of the people I had in mind, it definitely would not be hearsay. When I
describe the 90's I'm talking about the mid through late 90's and I mean
this in the sense of those who were making noise on the scene with their
attacks - keep in mind the original post was about script kiddiots (DoS)
so I believe on that portion of individuals who were out attacking
sites, defacing, etc., it would be easier than you think to put the
puzzle together name names and give accounts of what truly happened.

Would be an interesting read, but the author would also face the wraith
of feds because they could possibly expose snitches, informants, rats
however you want to call them.
