>>Larry, why are you so curious about how this exploit works? 

Because the Firefox docs say they don't support ANI files for cursors
and I can't get any non-malicious ones to work in it. I have to admit
I'm having trouble getting them to work in IE now too.

What's wrong with this code?

<HTML>
<BODY>
<style type="text/css">
BODY{cursor: url(http://www.larryseltzer.com/DRUM.ANI);}
</style>
This is a harmless animated cursor.<br>
This is a harmless animated cursor.<br>
This is a harmless animated cursor.<br>
This is a harmless animated cursor.<br>
</BODY></HTML>
