 Who knows... mabey they will get smart. IMHO M$ should, and could,
release an opensource OS.

 OpenWin , WindOS, call it whatever.
 Release a small basic win32 platform ( kernel / window / desktop / 
explorer ), that could
leverage existing development tools, to allow the comunity to provide 
extensible
applications that readily conform to existing, public API's. Provided with 
runtime
libraries already available in todays applications, the underpinning would 
support
existing win32 applications.

 Packaged with win32 / cygwin versions of POSIX tools, perl, php and python, 
it
would be a very robust, basic OS.

( reactOS + freeDOS ? )

 Ooops... I forgot... this is Micro$oft I was talking about....

..what we need is another Linus Torvalds to build and release a "newcode" 
win32 compliant
kernel / base that uses....

anyway,
M.W
