    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1202

Description:
    Previous versions of the kdelibs and qt-x11-free packages are vulnerable
    to two attacks.  The first is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack
    against the Konquerer web browser; the second is a potential information
    leak in which a malicious passive FTP server could possibly discover
    which network ports are open on client systems when the FTP connection
    is done via the KDE FTP ioslave.
