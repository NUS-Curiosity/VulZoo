The problem isn't Islam. It's not Christianity.  It's extremists who cloak
themselves in one or the other to try to claim the moral high ground in their
attempt to rid the world of The Other Flavor, because they never learned
concepts like "tolerance" or "playing nice with others".

Failing to realize that, and then taking action on that failure, just
makes the situation worse, as it gives the intolerant of The Other Flavor
more fuel for their reprisals.  Ask yourself "Are They going to hate Us more
if We do this?" - if the answer is "yes", you're probably making a mistake....
