To avoid any confusion:

1) There is no vulnerability in the Firefox source code

2) Firefox uses a Windows API function which uses the vulnerable code in
USER32.DLL, so the ANI vulnerability can be exploited through Firefox

3) Installing the MS07-017 patch will protect both IE and Firefox against this
vulnerability

4) There is no vulnerability for the Firefox developers to patch. I recommend
that they limit their use of the Windows API to avoid being affected by the next
Windows vuln, but this is application hardening, not a vulnerability fix.

5) Even thought the patch is already out, I'd like to avoid harming Windows
users who haven't installed it, so that's why I'm not releasing the details
about the Firefox exploit just yet.


Larry, why are you so curious about how this exploit works?
