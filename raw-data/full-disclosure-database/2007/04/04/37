M$ will never let us h4x0rz into their source (willingly) but I agree
with you James, the open source paradigm has regularly outpaced M$ and
many other large corporate software producers where it comes to
addressing bugs, security holes, and in many cases feature requests.

I don't think too many people will agree with me on this but my feeling
(call it a hunch) has been that vista will be the beginning of the end
for M$. Already more and more "average users" (like my dad who knows
jack about computers) are installing, using, and liking Linux.

I guess time will tell. As to this patch, or the time M$ takes to
release any patch... the word that comes to mind here is "typical".
After all, what can you expect from a company that is commonly referred
to as Micro$loth.
