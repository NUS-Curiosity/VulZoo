Subject: Re: Exploiting Microsoft dynamic Dns updates

Dear Denis,

As I told before, this feature/vulnerability related with dynamic dns
updates is known for a long time. My experience has demonstrated that this
weak configuration is very common and extended between most companies and
some of the attack vectors that I exposed were never considered as a threat.

I agree with you that Windows 2003 provides more security, but that's not
the default configuration with windows 2000 server.

I was not aware of nsupdate tool so I coded Dnsfun just as a proof of
concept (not as a high-sk1llz hacker tool). It helped me to test some
configuration issues.
If it also helps people to identify risky configurations then its enough for
me.
