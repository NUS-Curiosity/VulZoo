I just posted a video of exploiting IE7 and Firefox on Vista. Internet Explorer
was running in protected mode with DEP disabled (this is the default Vista
setup). It's interesting that the protected mode of IE does not stop the
execution of cmd.exe, but it does prevent you from writing to the file system
once you get the shell.
