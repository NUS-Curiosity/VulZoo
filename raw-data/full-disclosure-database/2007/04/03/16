Subject: HP Mercury Quality Center Any SQL execution

Vendor: HP
Product: Mercury Quality Center
Version: 9.0 build 9.1.0.4352
Vendor Informed: No

HP Mercury Quality Center is test management product for companys to do
software testing and quality insurance.

HP Mercury Quality Center has additional guest command on server which
allows any user who logged on to run a SQL command of their choosing.
This command called 'RunQuery' not SQL injection but allows any SQL to
run. I hva eonly manage to get this to work as blind SQL command no
results returned but returning results probably possible with more
work.

Attached is small Perl script which likes to be the HPMQC client and
logs in as normal user and connects to a domain and project and runs
SQL. Last step in program that runs SQL will genarate error but will
works.

HPMQC can use MSDE, full MSSQLserver or Oracle data base.
