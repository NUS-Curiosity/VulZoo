Synopsis
========

OpenAFS is subject to a design flaw that could allow privilege
escalation on the client.

Background
==========

OpenAFS is a distributed network filesystem.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-fs/openafs       < 1.4.4                             >= 1.4.4

Description
===========

Benjamin Bennett discovered that the OpenAFS client contains a design
flaw where cache managers do not use authenticated server connections
when performing actions not requested by a user.

Impact
======

If setuid is enabled on the client cells, an attacker can supply a fake
FetchStatus reply that sets setuid and root ownership of a file being
executed. This could provide root access on the client. Remote attacks
may be possible if an attacker can entice a user to execute a known
file. Note that setuid is enabled by default in versions of OpenAFS
prior to 1.4.4.

Workaround
==========

Disable the setuid functionality on all client cells. This is now the
default configuration in OpenAFS.

Resolution
==========

All OpenAFS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/openafs-1.4.4"
