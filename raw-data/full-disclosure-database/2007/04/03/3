The exploited instance of IE7 probably spawns cmd.exe with the same
privilege levels as IE7 in Protected Mode, which means you don't have
read/write access to the user or system files.  It's still bad because you
probably get to harvest all of the saved username/passwords in the browser
and capture all input/output from that IE session.

Now in the case of an exploited Firefox 2, you have full read/write
permissions to all of the user files which means you get to steal all the
user files and/or encrypt them for ransom.

I just posted a video of exploiting IE7 and Firefox on Vista. Internet
Explorer
was running in protected mode with DEP disabled (this is the default Vista
setup). It's interesting that the protected mode of IE does not stop the
execution of cmd.exe, but it does prevent you from writing to the file
system
once you get the shell.
