Ok thanks.  I guess we need to add "steal data" to the list of things an
exploited IE7 session in Vista can do.  I never got to test that far because
DEP nuked my browser session.

Protected Mode only blocks write access. IE can write only to a few
locations on
the system, but it still has full read access to all files readable by the
user.
