I think there might be a salient idea in this rant (and somewhat
meandering thread discussion).  That is that the greatest challenge to
learning black hat hacking techniques is the fact that it is illegal to
attempt in most countries.  If you choose a target with which your
native country has no normalized diplomatic relationship and no
extradition treaty as a target then even if you're caught legal action
against you becomes impossible.  For script kiddies in the US to attack
servers in North Korea, Iran and other countries with which the US has
poor diplomatic relationships is actually quite wise - well, much wiser
than trying to break into a domestic server or one in Western Europe
(just ask Gary McKinnon).
