Subject: Re: Why Microsoft should make windows open

Didn't you know? MS is not looking to make any more O/S after Vista. So when
you say it is the end for MS in that front you are correct.

They are instead, investing in other markets which are proving more
profitable then such an effort as churning out an O/S.
