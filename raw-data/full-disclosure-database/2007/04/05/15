I believe that the greatest lesson in history is that if you are not
willing to fight for your freedoms, someone will come in and take them
away.  It has happened time and time again throughout the ages.  There
are always other peoples who will stretch their boundaries - and if
you are not willing to defend yourself, you will be taken over.

Yes, Ghandi and Martin Luther King were great men and won great
victories.  But in BOTH cases, they were "fighting" against peoples
that had a Christian moral character AND sympathetic populations back
home.  In NO case would the British, or the American powers that be,
solve the problem by going in and merely blowing away Ghandi and King.
 Make no mistake about it - the Islamic extremists against whom we
fight would have NO problem with going in and dealing with their
problems by eliminating them.  Ghandi and King would have lasted no
time at all in their world - whereas in our world they are accorded
rights and privileges - often to the detriment of established
authority and society.

Ethically you may be able to establish a moral high ground, but just
the same, Paul is right and you are wrong.
