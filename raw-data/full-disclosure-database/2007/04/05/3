 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

ESRI ArcSDE Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.04.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 04, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) ArcSDE is a multi-user
database server that has been bundled with ArcGIS to provide access to
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). More information is available at
ESRI's web site located at the following URL.

http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcsde/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability within
Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Inc.'s ArcSDE service
allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the
running service.

This vulnerability appears to exist in the handling of requests
containing overly long string parameters. By supplying a specially
crafted request, the ArcSDE server will overflow a buffer and overwrite
execution control information stored on the stack.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the running service.

No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The
attacker only needs the ability to converse with the server via the TCP
port on which it is listening. By default the server listens on port
5151.

IV. DETECTION

An iDefense contributor reported that version 9.2 is vulnerability to
this attack. ESRI confirmed the vulnerability. All prior versions are
suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Employing firewalls to limit access to the affected service can help
prevent potential exploitation of this vulnerability.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

ESRI has identified this issue as NIM007075 and corrected the
vulnerability by releasing ArcGIS 9.2 Service Pack 2. Additionally,
ESRI released the "Three Tiered Connection Security Patch" to address
the problem in older versions. For more information see ESRI's
