What a lovely idea.

Too bad that it crashes directly with the very basics of the human 
nature - which is the only thing that has not changed for all those 
thousand years of written history. Despite all the glorious 
technological advancements we have achieved, we are still the very same 
bloodthirsty and envious creatures as we were in the days when the stars 
were young and too sad that we did not learn nothing in the process, 
still ignorant to everything but us.

No state system or religion, be it democracy or communism, be it islam 
or christianity, will change that. It simply does not matter.

nice evening,
Martin
