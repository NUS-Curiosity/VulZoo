err, look up the definition of communism (no, not what 'the US' says
what communism is, but what Marx & Engels, Lenin, Mandel, Thaelmann
etc. wrote).

first of all, this is not true; there were several democratic
countries starting a wars between them. even worse for you, it started
_within_ the US of A:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA#History

on the other hand, the recent example of non-democratic countries is the
faschist US invading a dictatorship, iraq. funnily, almost 80% of the
iraq people say it was a better life for them before the US spread
their, err, democracy there with bombs.

estimates of whom? i saw different numbers on the net, and about half
of the people in the US i know (no people from bronx, but database
coders, programmers, account managers etc -- part of them with masters
degree and PhD) cannot pay their health insurance, not to speak of
health insurance for their family.

you where there? i was. for more than two months, and i never saw a
typical 'tourist environment', not even from the far. i don't have to
rely on propaganda, and i saw a different Cuba. not the whorehouse the
US had before revolution came.

funnily, the US sends bombs out into the world; Cuba sends medicine

in fact, i did. when my girlfriend had an appendicitis when we where
there there were hospitals in every single village (!) -- very good,
interdisciplinary hospitals. polyclinics, as they're also called.
comparing them to german hospitals was a tragedy, as the so wealthy
Germany looked so poor suddenly.

of course, 'the elite' in Germany has different treatment ;)

NICE TRY?

"This report is the first release of the National Assessment of Adult
Literacy (NAAL) health literacy results. The results are based on
assessment tasks designed specifically to measure the health literacy
of American adults. Health literacy was reported using four performance
levels: Below Basic, Basic, Intermediate, and Proficient. The majority
of adults (53 percent) had Intermediate health literacy. About 22
percent had Basic and 14 percent had Below Basic health literacy."

(another thing -- why does the US always say that 'America' is 'US'?
have a look at the maps; maybe you do better than your president, who
didn't find iraq!)

no, you can't. have a look at the gigantic debts of the US:

8.87 Trillion $$$

waste of energy, and for what? sitting in the living room and getting
even fatter than you are now? that's funny, go whereever you like
throughout the world and you'll be able to recognize US citizens from
miles away: they're three-fold in size. and you can hear them catching
(or trying to catch) their breath from there. funny! :)

> tanks

yes, your kids like tanks. they're so much more beautiful than animals,
sunsets and the like.

> *and* BMWs

yeah, our good german cars. what a luck we had Hitler and the
opportunity for those companies to make lots of money back then!

> , fighter jets

yeah, much more beauty in it than in non-destroyed eco system. so much
more humanity in it than giving starving people some food to eat.
better destroy the food that is being produced too much (actually, 12
billion people could be fed today; but not only, but also the US
doesn't want this).

> *and* Gulfstreams.

you forgot to attach bombs and guns to it.

> The rest of your tripe isn't even worth responding to.

you obviously don't have kids and hate other human beings on the
planet, that's why you're such an asshole. i bet your favorite place in
history was in germany, 1933 to 1945, really -- you would have liked it!
