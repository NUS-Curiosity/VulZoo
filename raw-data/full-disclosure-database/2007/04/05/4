You seem to be living under the delusion that your actions can somehow 
influence the extremists.  There's only two actions that will influence 
the extremists in any way and that is to kill or imprison them.  Anything 
else you might try, like trying to make nice with them or negotiate with 
them, is a complete waste of time and merely hastens your own death or 
imprisonment.
