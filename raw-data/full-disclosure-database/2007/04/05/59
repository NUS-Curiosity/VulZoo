Have you ever been to (lived for an extended period in) Cuba?

[I almost wonder how do you explain the Cuban emigration: about 2 million
have left, with 10 million remaining in Cuba; and those left dream about
leaving the country. Really, why don't people emigrate to Cuba: I know of
some people who have spent months there, as tourists; why don't they, you,
go to live there permanently?]

[BTW: what has this got to do with security, or full-disclosure?]
