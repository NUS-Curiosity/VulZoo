It seems to have fallen about 19.9% overnight then:

http://www.cnn.com/2007/EDUCATION/03/19/adult.literacy.ap/index.html

Functional illiteracy rate is 36% in Washington DC, 21% nationwide.

And it's *functional* literacy that matters - if they can't read and/or
write well enough to figure out a subway schedule or fill out the job
application at a fast food place, does it really matter if some test claimed
they were "literate"?
