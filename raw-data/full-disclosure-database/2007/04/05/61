Amen, brother!

While the USS Nimitz Carrier Battle Group is making haste to the Arabian
Gulf (formerly known as the Persian Gulf), to help secure the sea lanes for
the oil market (THE WEST PAYS A FAIR PRICE FOR THE COMMODITY) without which
Europe's economy would be destroyed, I have to read this crap.

Look. The Europeans couldn't WAIT to get The U.S. into WWII. (BBC report of
Winston Churchill: Defender of Democracy
By Dr Geoffrey Best: "In foreign affairs, his greatest achievement was to
engage the sympathy of the United States, without whose material help - and,
better, military alliance - Britain, he well understood, had no chance of
winning." Now, 60 years later, you want to pat us on the head and send us
back home?

What makes you think that the U.S. Would now believe you won't screw up
again and cause a couple of million U.S. Military casualties when you
"engage our sympathy" next time? Nope! The U.S. will continue be PROACTIVE -
and that's whether the Democrats or Republicans are in power. And the U.S.
does appreciate the wisdom of Tony Blair and John Howard to mention only 2
who are well aware of what it takes to keep the sea lanes safe for commerce.
Also, thanks to the Royal Navy and Marines who are still patrolling the
Iraq/Iran border sea lane.



So, if we STAY THE EFF on the security topic, then we will ALL be much
happier. Oh, yes, the above IS security!
