Well, no one can help it if you're ignorant.

Estimates of dead from various totalitarian regimes are over a hundred 
million.  China and Russia alone almost reach that figure.  The worldwide 
figure for deaths under communist regimes from 1900 to 1987 is estimated at 
almost 170 million.

Japan - 3 to 10 million
Cambodia - approximately 4 million
Turkey - 3.5 to 4.3 million
Vietnam - 3.8 million
Poland - 1 million
Pakistan - 1.5 million
Yugoslavia - 1.7 million
North Korea - 1.6 to 3.5 million
Nazi Germany - 7 to 10 million
Mexico - 1.4 to 3.3 million
Russia - 52 million
China - 35 million

If you total all the war dead and every category of violence you can think 
of in every democratic country on earth, you can't even get close to those 
appalling numbers.

Furthermore, no democratic country has ever started a war with another 
democratic country.  (That's as in zero.)  The majority of wars are begun 
between two non-democratic countries, and democratic countries have the 
lowest incidence of foreign and domestic violence of any form of 
government.  (And yes, that includes the US.)

The fact is that if all countries in the world would adopt democracy, there 
would be no more wars.

Wow.  I am so impressed.  US is 6.43 and Cuba is 6.22.  Statistically 
insignificant and, without context, meaningless.

Both are less than 1/10th of the rates in a lot of the garden spots of the 
world that so many liberals admire.

Estimates of uninsured in the US (not including illegal immigrants) are in 
the range of 20 million.  That's about 7% of the population.  Meanwhile, in 
the paradise of Cuba, they don't have chlorinated water, they live in 
dilapidated and deteriorating housing (except for the chosen few, of 
course), and sanitaton is almost non-existent.

Cuba uses a two-tier system for healthcare.  Good stuff for the party 
members (and for viewing by the gullible) and not-so-good stuff for the hoi 
polloi.  Cuba spends 1.5% of its overal foreign purchases on medical 
imports compared to 5 times that amount for the Dominican Republic.

The statement that Cuba's healthcare system is first rate reveals a 
profound ignorance of the actual conditions in Cuba.  But if you think it's 
so wonderful, perhaps you'll move there to take advantage of it.

Cuba's literacy rate is 96.9.  The US is 99.9.  Statistically 
insignificant, but nice try.

Probably what irks you is that we can afford both B-2's *and* wide screen 
tvs, tanks *and* BMWs, fighter jets *and* Gulfstreams.

The rest of your tripe isn't even worth responding to.
