no, i'm not joking; i mentioned the 100,000+ deaths caused every day (and forgot those deaths caused by civilization diseases like diabetes, cancer etc. that is caused by 'your lifestyle'), i mentioned wars, i mentioned killing the planet... so i don't see that capitalism is NOT a thread, the greatest thread, to humanity.

facing the fact that even money that accumulated at about 20,000 rich people (stolen from 6 billion on the planet) can't save the 20,000 rich people's lifes when the planet collapses too soon is something that's even more sarcastic.

maybe you get the point, maybe not; if not, you're probably one of the guys who fell out of US 'schools' being almost an illiterate and think Coca Cola invented everything (or Bill Gates).

err, what? ever heard of logic?

you're guessing wrong, but i can understand it as i pulled the typical trigger to cause typical US-style anticommunism. okay, go, and follow the swarm. the germans showed about 70 years ago that this is a very good idea to be not guilty for things that happen.

if everyone on the planet is a jackass like you, maybe. but this is not reality :)

i put one single country here to show how US sucks as being one of the 'richest' countries in the world:

- Cuba has a much lower infant mortality than the US;

- Cuba has an overall much better health care than the US (who in the US is able to pay for health insurance? not that many people!)

- Cuba has a much better educational system and a MUCH LOWER NUMBER of illiterates than the US

so, what of that gigantic amount of money goes to the people? nothing! it's used to buy B-2 bombers and pay Halliburton.

that's "God's own country", freedom, peace, democracy, civilization.

MUHAHAHAHA!

Mahmud Ahmadinedschad is not the man in power; furthermore, do you remember how the US did influence Iran in the past? and paid Iraq to fight Iran? well, a school paid by Coca Cola won't tell you... but it's reality.

when going out into the forests and upsetting a grizzly, well, now and then you will be punished :)

wow! never thought of this!

but hey, wait: there's that "God's own country" which gave Israel about 300 nuclear warheads. and both country's leaders are religious fanatics. cool!

i never said that.

logic, it's all about being able to read and draw the right conclusions! logic!

> Saying the US sucks is a very bold statement,

after spreading war all over the world for centuries (TM), no, this isn't a bold statement. Team America -- World Police!

no, in fact i work in a jewish company.

no, except for crazy christians like the pope who forbids the use of condoms in Africa.

> and anti-capitalist.

well, i do have problems what capitalists cause, e.g. idiots like you, George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan et altera. i have problems with capitalists murdering the planet for no purpose.

yes, i'm an anticapitalist :)

> Just
> admit what you are. You're a racist bigot,

no, i'm an internationalist and introduce myself not as a member of a certain country (like some US citizens, not all -- there are still some brain cells active over there).

so save your breath and think about what BS you're telling here.

logic! it's all about reading, thinking and LOGIC!
