You completely ignored the most important part of Valdis' argument.
Nobody is arguing that terrorism is not a threat.  The argument is about
how many people have died as a result of this war that is supposed to
"end" terrorism (but has probably just made matters worse).

People are fundamentally the same.  If you put "civilized" British
people in the situations facing many extremists in the Middle East, do
you think they would continue to act civilized?

Do you think no innocent men/women/children have died at the hands of
the civilized Brits?

Sure -- their foreign policy is better than the U.S. at the moment --
but don't make some ridiculous claim that they're "better" and "more
civilized."  Rich nations are just a lot better at covering it up.

Do you realize that the U.S. put many of those radicals into power in
the first place?

A better analogy would be this:

There are hoodlums running around various neighborhoods around the
world, killing people.  YOU think it is a good idea to start invading
other neighborhoods, enforcing curfews, searching their houses (and your
own neighbors'), passing unconstitutional laws, and killing a lot of
innocent people in the process -- oh, and starting "cyber wars" against
the hoodlums (I laughed) -- because if you don't, things are going to
get much worse.

Does that sound like the best approach to you?

This was never all-or-nothing, and YOU are an extremist for thinking it is.
