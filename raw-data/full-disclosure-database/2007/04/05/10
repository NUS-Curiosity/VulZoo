 >Rich,an American Jew?!!!???

My ancestors would come out of their graves to answer this one!

The real answer lies in the fact of,are you prejudice or not.
That simple point,alone,speaks volumes about how you perceive things 
that happen around you.
There are,basically speaking,two ways to look at things.Your way,or,My way.
That said,I believe that to find common ground on which you both 
agree...ie.That this assault on a countries infrastucture that we are 
not at war with,to be complete idiocy(nor will it ever succeed in its 
original intent,IMHO)for all involved.
This was,and is my point.
Agree or not,
                  Regards,
                          Scott
