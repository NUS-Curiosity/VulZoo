If this was the end.........I've heard it all!
 From the days when Microsoft wrote the OS for IBM,people were
saying,nay,swearing,to the ends of the earth,how good Bill Gates & Co.'s
code was.Granted,without IBM & MS,the web MAY not be what it is
today.....You know..Ease of use,and so and,and so forth,....

In reality,it's probably very much true.Maybe to the chagrine of many of
the current,and past users of Unix systems.
New OS'es breed new 0Day's,same as ever!
(
                      I try to use both,MS and many different flavors of
*nix, as many as I can take at one time,OS'es as possible.That way I can
learn,and understand,different feels for,basically the child of a long
ago parent.

    Knowledge is only as good as what you choose to use it for.Correct?

             Happy Easter to ALL.
                             Scott
