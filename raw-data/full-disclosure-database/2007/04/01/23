If the information is within the 'warezed' version, then it's also
within 'the non-warezed' one.

Using available distributed information to write software isn't piracy.

Taking someones written software and distributing it as your own and
under your own terms most certainly is.

But building on someones idea and distributed information to write a
different tool (smaller, bigger, better, worse, cheaper, what ever) isn't.
