First of all I haven't said anything that could not be rebated.
So I am not slandering anyone. I just said what I'm thinking at the moment;
maybe Max Moser can make me change my mind.

> you refer to ? I have read the paper and found none, where did you ?

The software is described into detail inside the paper.
Dongle activation, .ini files and .dcu files. This seems to run on
Windows. I know only one software like this one (Maybe you are using it as
well).

> Where is he promoting Software Piracy ?  I have read the paper and found

Those software are based upon a dongle (USB Bluetooth in this case).
If you can clone the dongle, you could be able to easily clone the software.

I'm sorry this was my mistake, but there wasn't any direct link to the
release.
Anyway I found this stuff after I have read the .pdf document. At first I
have found the vendor
then I have searched in google "Vendor + CSR dongle" and I found that.

I never told this.

without software piracy.

Read it as not forcing (or partially forcing) the protection of commercial
software.
