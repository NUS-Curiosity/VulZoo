Subject: Re: Busting The Bluetooth Myth

| Hi,
|
| You missed the point completely. He's not promoting software piracy but
| showing that the high-dollar bluetooth sniifers are not required and that
| you're average dongle can do everything that a proprietary product can.

The "thinly veiled advert" was to mention that either:

1. He is using a pireted version of the bluetooth sniffer;
2. He has downloaded a pirated version of the bluetooth sniffer and printed
a pdf of the readme inside;
3. He is the author of the pirated version of the bluetooth sniffer.
