Subject: Re: Busting The Bluetooth Myth

Hi Kevin,

I could understand that vendors are charging simple CSR dongles (19
dollars??) up to thousands of dollars.
But the way to publish a paper making a direct reference (if someone is
aware about the underlying piece of software he is talking about) to a
particular vendor it's not so cute. Maybe they have written their firmware.

Worse is to sustain the fact that the world need a better bluetooth sniffer,
using the information that can be found inside the warezed version of the
tool. The opensource community I think that is able to do it's own research
without software piracy.
