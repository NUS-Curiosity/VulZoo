Subject: Re: Windows .ANI LoadAniIcon Stack Overflow

I made a mistake in including "jmp esp" for XP SP2 because the stack cannot 
be executed (due to DEP of course :P). It is completely possible to execute 
shellcode if we can do some DEP bypass (ie. ret2libc attack, etc..) to add 
execute access to the stack and jmp to our code. My PoC i updated yesterday 
(added as an attachment to the full disclosure post) returns to 
ExitProcess()  and closes explorer.exe upon viewing the .ani file, just to 
show that it is possible to do our own shiznat in SP2.
