ok, if your consequences are right, could you disprove this gypothesis?

Gypothesis:
Let N = p*q = A1*B1 + A2*B2... + An*Bn
Then exists some subset(A1...An) and respective subset(B1...Bn), which
satisfies for equality:
A1*B1+A2*B2...+An*Bn = p*q and:
A1*(-B1)+A2*(-B2)...+An*(-Bn) = p*(-q)=p*q*(p-1)
or
A1*(-B1)+A2*(-B2)...+An*(-Bn) = (-p)*q=p*q*(q-1)

in terms of this gypothesis, could you really prove: there are no one
subsets (A1..An) and respective (B1...Bn) which satisfies equality:
A1*(-B1)+A2*(-B2)...+An*(-Bn) = p*(-q)=p*q*(p-1)
or
A1*(-B1)+A2*(-B2)...+An*(-Bn) = (-p)*q=p*q*(q-1)
?

Another example in terms of gypothesis:
35 = 2^2*2^3 + 2*1 + 1
then one of possible subsets of 35 is: 4*8 + 2*1 + 1 (4,2,1) and (8,1,1)
try one of possible cases for test subsets (A1...An) and (B1...Bn):
4*(35-8)+2*(35-1)+1*(-1) = 4*27 + 2*34 + 1*(34) = 108 + 102 = 210
then, 210 / 35 = 6
6+1=7
gcd(35,7)=5
Gypothesis is right (or written above is exception?)
Your sample: 6 = 4 + 2 => 1*4 + 2*1
1*(6-4)+2*(6-1)=12
Divide result by 6: 12/6 = 2
Add one for 2: 2+1 = 3
Test: gcd(6,3)=2

Any other samples needed?

More over, while no one present valid proof of incorrectness, it is
correct, right?

Has somebody more constructive ideas?
