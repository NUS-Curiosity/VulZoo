Subject: FW: Steganos Encrypted Safe NOT so safe

I forwarded the original issue to Steganos as I am a user of their software
package.  This is their reply and also posted on Security Focus.

Subject: Re: Steganos Encrypted Safe NOT so safe

In response to frankrizzo604's comment, Steganos would like to dispel the
rumor that its Steganos Safe encryption software is easily cracked. Steganos
Safe enables users to create any number of secure virtual drives in which
data is safely stored and encrypted. However frankrizzo604 goes through
several steps 'teaching' users how to open others' encrypted files. In his
last step, he claims Steganos will 'PUNISH you by resetting your encrypted
drives passwords to "123" until you buy a registered copy', implying that
the password feature can be circumvented thus opening anyone's safe. He
conveniently left out that before he was able to reset the password to
"123", he had to enter his original password to open the safe. Then, he saw
this message box:

It is absolutely not possible to open any Steganos Encrypted File without
having the original password. The Steganos support and development team
reconstructed the process he described. It is not possible to open a Safe
WITHOUT the original password. In the 2007 generation of Steganos products,
Steganos decided to set the Safe attributes to write protect. Steganos would
like its user to rest assured that their files are in fact still encrypted
and safe from hackers.
