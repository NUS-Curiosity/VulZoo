Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 April 12 1600 UTC (GMT)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Cisco Wireless Control System (WCS) works in conjunction with
Cisco Aironet Lightweight Access Points, Cisco Wireless LAN
Controllers, and the Cisco Wireless Location Appliance by providing
tools for wireless LAN planning and design, system configuration,
location tracking, security monitoring, and wireless LAN management.
Cisco WCS contains multiple vulnerabilities that can result in
information disclosure, privilege escalation, and unauthorized access
through fixed authentication credentials.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are
available.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070412-wcs.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

This section provides details on affected products.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Versions of WCS prior to 4.0.96.0 are affected by one or more of
these vulnerabilities. To identify the first fixed version for a
specific Cisco Bug ID, please see the Software Versions and Fixes
section of this advisory.

To determine the version of WCS running in a given environment, take
the following steps:

 1. Log in to the WCS graphical web interface.
 2. From the menu, select Help > About the Software.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco Wireless Control System (WCS) works in conjunction with
Cisco Aironet Lightweight Access Points, Cisco Wireless LAN
Controllers, and the Cisco Wireless Location Appliance by providing
tools for wireless LAN planning and design, system configuration,
location tracking, security monitoring, and wireless LAN management.
Cisco WCS contains the following vulnerabilities:

Fixed FTP Credentials For WCS Location Backup
+--------------------------------------------

WCS can be configured to back up the data stored on the Cisco
Wireless Location Appliance via FTP. Affected versions of WCS include
a fixed user name and password for this backup operation; these
credentials cannot be changed or disabled. Knowledge of these
credentials, when combined with other properties of the FTP server,
could allow an attacker to read from and write to arbitrary files on
the server hosting the WCS application. In some cases, this could be
leveraged to alter system files and compromise the server. This
vulnerability is documented by Cisco Bug ID CSCse93014.

Account Group Privilege Escalation
+---------------------------------

The WCS authentication system contains a privilege escalation
vulnerability that allows any user with a valid user name and
password to change their account group membership. For example, a
user in the "LobbyAmbassador" group can add themselves to the
"SuperUsers" group. This privilege escalation can allow full
administrative control of WCS and the wireless networks it manages.
This vulnerability is documented by Cisco Bug IDs CSCse78596 and
CSCsg05190.

Information Disclosure to Unauthenticated Users
+----------------------------------------------

On affected versions of WCS, several directories within the WCS page
hierarchy are not password protected and could be accessed by an
unauthenticated user. Although the information available would not
allow an attacker to gain access to WCS, it would be possible to
obtain information about the organization of the network, including
access point locations. This vulnerability is documented by Cisco Bug
ID CSCsg04301.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

Cisco will provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are
encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the
environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at 
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html.

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at 
http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss.
