In my last article at Security Focus, I mentioned that phishing is
directed (based on your online profile) and not blast-o-gram
(everyone gets one). My example used Arizona. I said:

    For example, if you are likely in Arizona then you are more
likely to receive an Arizona Credit Union phish. They can guess
where you are based on the forums you use. If you post in a Tucson
forum or write about Flagstaff and Phoenix, then you might be in
Arizona.


Well, the email address associated with that article just received
an Arizona State Credit Union phish. It had never received one of
those before.

Man, spammers are predictable and funny.
