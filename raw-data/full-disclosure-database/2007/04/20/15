Subject: Re: ShortNotes : Stack Smashing with GCC4

Your section:

> ** [ iv. call %edx ] **

Was also covered here some time ago.

(I am only running gcc 4.0.3) In main() %edx is pointing to the start
of your environment variables, not the stack. If you were to call
another function from main() it would probably no longer point there.
So maybe this technique works for vulnerablilities in programs parsing
command line arguments in main() but its very limited in its use.
