-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of GraceNote's CDDBControl ActiveX Control.

information lookup. The ActiveX control is commonly registered as safe
and can be accessed from a malicious web site. The buffer overflow is
triggered when long values are specified for various Proxy
configuration parameters.
