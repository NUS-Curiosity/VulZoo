If *mine* got pwned, I'd take the machine down, but if an unprivileged user 
got pwned, I'd simply have them change their password, *unless* there was 
evidence of problems on that host.  Just because someone's account got 
hijacked doesn't mean that further damage necessarily happened.  Lots of 
people have no access to anything except their own stuff.
