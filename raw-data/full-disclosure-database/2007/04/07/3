in case its not there when you see it:

'so you don't want to pay me because the traffic i sent was 100% ukranian?
i sent the traffic, i dont care if it wasnt 'mostly english speaking'
traffic you pay me my $9,204 and ill give you your mysql database and
website files back -buchkov p.s. lol @ your server'

--

Seriously, screw all of you companies that promise money for traffic and
then try to worm out of paying, i hope you didnt have backups.

ty to mu-tiger for pointing this out.
