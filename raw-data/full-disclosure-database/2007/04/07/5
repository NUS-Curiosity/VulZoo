It can be argued that the German's siege of Leningrad, which lasted almost 900
days but they never managed to take the city, was the first indication that the
Germans had run into trouble...

Unfortunately, Timo *is* at least partially correct - by the time the US
forces landed at Normandy, the Soviet armies had already pushed back the
German armies a considerable way, and the Germans were already in severe
trouble.

Of course, that begs the question of whether the Germans would have had less
trouble near Leningrad and Stalingrad if they hadn't had to commit Rommel's
forces in North Africa. Germany just didn't have the resources to fight in
North Africa and Russia (which is a logistics nightmare all by itself - you
might have enough divisions to hold a front when it's near Poland, but the
further you go into Russia, the front gets wider and wider....)
