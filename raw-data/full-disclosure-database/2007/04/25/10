In that case, nobody's talking about vulnerabilities on this list, only
poor programming. :)

The problem in here is that the programmer "assumes" that the variables
do have a proper value checking done prior to handling off to the script
engine. HTTP_METHOD is well defined. One would assume apache has
validated the method somehow.

Unfortunately, this assumption was flawed.

However, it (apache) should perform integrity checks, because it has the
capacity to do so.

Not with PHP. But I would agree with the original programmer that apache
is in fault here. Apache should have done the expected work, and
validated that the request was standards-compliant. It didn't, and that
opens up a huge chasm in which plenty of problems, vulnerabilities and
others, may hide.
