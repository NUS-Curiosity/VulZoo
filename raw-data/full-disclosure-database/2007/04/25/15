First make sure that it is actually a NEW technique. If you just
discovered a new flavor of XSS or some addition to another technique it
won't work. Make sure you know _exactly_ what you are talking about
before releasing such a thing.
Then write _documentation_. That is the key issue. I have no idea who
first came up with BufferOverflows. But I'm pretty sure almost everybody
knows AlephOne. FYI: When he wrote "Smashing the stack for fun and
profit" those attacks had already been around for about a decade.
But his paper hit it off - so he is remembered for it.

Oh, and most off all: Check your attitude.
If your primary intention is fame then there is probably something
wrong. If you are 1337 enough, you'll get accreditation.
