Subject: Apache Illegal Request Handling Possible XSS
	Vulnerability

Hi.
I think now we can classify this as flaw in Apache. It accepts
requests that simply make no sense. Take a look at this example:
<script>alert(document.cookie);</script> /test.php
<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
In some circumstances it may cause XSS vulnerability:
<?php
        echo $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];
        echo $_SERVER['SERVER_PROTOCOL'];
?>
I am now investigating other possible attacks.
Regards Michal Majchrowicz.
