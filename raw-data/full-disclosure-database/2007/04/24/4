Subject: Re: Apache Illegal Request Handling Possible XSS
	Vulnerability

Hi.
I think that server should have a list of valid requests. In fact
Apache warns you sometimes that valid requests are:
"GET/POST/TRACE/OPTIONS". The solution that it just accepts everything
as request and protocol makes no sense. What kind of protocol is
"<script>"?
Regards Michal.
