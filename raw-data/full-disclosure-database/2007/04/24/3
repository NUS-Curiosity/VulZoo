As Kradorex Xeron said, that's a flaw in the script. Apache needs
to let arbitrary verbs through to the PHP (or other server extension) 
otherwise tools like webdav that require additional verbs could not
be implemented. It is possibly arguable that it should restrict the
verbs to a single alphanumeric string, but it certainly can't be
counted on to be just GET/POST etc.

Cheers
