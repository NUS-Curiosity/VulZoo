The Windows regional settings format only affects the way dates, times,
number, and currency is displayed. Languages are not changed by default and
require a seperate MUI or LIP. AFAIK, Microsoft does not have a UK English
LIP. So, switching to the UK region still leaves the GUI displaying American
English, where "center" is the preferred spelling.

I'm surprised. Normally, it's the Americans who fail to realize that
there is more than one way to speak English. :)
