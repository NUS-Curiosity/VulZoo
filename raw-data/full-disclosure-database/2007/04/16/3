---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information technology has become crucial to almost every part of
society.  IT infrastructures have become critical in the world-wide
economy, the financial sector, the health sector, the government's
administration, the military, and the educational sector.

Due to its importance the disruption or loss of IT capabilities results
in a massive reduction of operability.  Hence, IT security is
continously gaining importance.

Although security usually gets integrated into the design process of IT
systems nowadays, the process of maintaining security in the operation
of IT infrastructures still lacks the appropriate attendance in most
cases.  Especially the capability to manage and respond to IT security
incidents and their forensic analysis is established in the rarest
cases. The quickly rising number of security incidents worldwide makes
the implementation of incident management capabilities essential.

In order to advance the fields of IT-Incident Management and Forensics
the special interest-group Security - Intrusion Detection and Response
(SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI) organises an annual
conference, bringing together experts from throughout the world, to
discuss state of the art in the areas of Incident Management and
IT-Forensics (IMF). IMF promotes collaboration and exchange of ideas
between industry, academia, law-enforcement and other government bodies.

IMF invites to submit:
----------------------

 - Full papers of up to 20 pages, presenting novel and mature research
   results. 

 - Practice papers of up to 20 pages, describing best practices, case
   studies, lessons learned, or latest developments in technology. 

All submissions must be in English, and in either postscript or PDF
format.  Authors of accepted papers must ensure that their papers will
be presented at the conference.  Presentations should be held in
English.

Submitted full papers must not substantially overlap papers that have
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings.

All submissions will be reviewed by the program committee and papers
accepted to be presented at the conference will be included in the
conference proceedings.

Details on the electronic submission procedure are provided on the
conference Web site at:
