LS>Heap spraying implies running code in the heap, 
JA>Actually, um.. no.. it doesn't

My understanding of heap spraying comes from
http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/638: "...SkyLined's heap
spraying techqniue
(http://sf-freedom.blogspot.com/2006/07/heap-spraying-internet-exploiter
.html) (the concept of this technique is that you inject the nop +
shellcode into the heap memory and use some method to trick the eip jump
into that heap ..."

Sure sounds like running code in the heap to me.
 
JA>How do you get to be in that position? Lot's of buzzword-tossing I'd
have to guess.

Fuck you too.
