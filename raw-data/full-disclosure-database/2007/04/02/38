Hewlett-Packard Mercury Quality Center ActiveX Control ProgColor Buffer
Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.02.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 02, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Hewlett-Packard Mercury Quality Center is a web-based interface that
allows managers to automate software quality testing. More information
is available at URL shown below.

http://www.mercury.com/us/products/quality-center/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in an ActiveX
control installed by Hewlett-Packard Mercury Quality Center could allow
for the execution of arbitrary code.

Hewlett-Packard Mercury Quality Center installs the following ActiveX
control which is registered as safe for scripting.

  Progid: SPIDERLib.Loader
  Clsid: 98C53984-8BF8-4D11-9B1C-C324FCA9CADE
  File: C:\WINDOWS\Downloaded Program Files\Spider90.ocx

This control contains an exploitable stack based buffer overflow in the
"ProgColor" property. By setting this property to an overly long value,
a buffer overflow will occur.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary
code.

The target ActiveX Control is part of the Mercury Quality Center web
application which runs on port 8080 by default. Any user which can
remotely log into the web application will have to install the
vulnerable control.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in the control that is
installed with the 9.0 version of Hewlett-Packard Mercury Quality
Center. The vulnerable ActiveX control is version 9.1.0.4353.

V. WORKAROUND

Setting the kill-bit for this control will prevent it from being loaded
within Internet Explorer. However, doing so will prevent legitimate use
of the control.
