Subject: Re: More information on ZERT patch for ANI 0day

Well I did my patch and I'm giving it away to be modifiable by everyone out
there.

I did it for version 5.1.2600.2622 of user32.dll, English version not sure
if that is the last version from M$ (with the way they handle patches you
know
you could miss one) anyway in any case I believe there is enough information
in the sources if it needs a fix or... not if Microsoft really comes with a
patch
tomorrow. So far you don't have to be at the mercy of the chinese worm or
evil random
cracker. Let me know if is a POS if has bugs etc... Maybe is not needed by
tomorrow
but was already doing it. So if it helps.. Then great!!

download binaries here
http://aircash.sourceforge.net/micro-distro-src.zip

and sources here
http://aircash.sourceforge.net/micro-distro-bin.zip

just my 2 cents

Waldo
