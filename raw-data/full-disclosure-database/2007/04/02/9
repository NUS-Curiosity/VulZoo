HD,

I realize that DEP is disabled for Explorer and the browser by default, but
I have it enabled and enforced by hardware XD/NX and it stopped the Milw0rm
PoC.  Do you or anyone else have a PoC that can get around this type of
fully-enabled hardware-enforced DEP?

I also realize that Protected Mode in IE7 does not prevent arbitrary code
execution, but it does prevent that code from interacting with user or
system files and it can't be persistent if that infected instance of IE7 is
closed.  From what I understand, owning the IE7 process in protected mode is
bad in the sense that it lets you steal data from web pages or user input
(such as password entry), but it doesn't let you capture keyboard input from
other application or system processes.  Am I missing something here or does
someone out there have a PoC that can get around these limitations?

Two new exploit modules are available for version 3.0 of the Metasploit 
Framework. These modules can be obtained by using the 'Online Update' 
feature in Windows and the 'svn update' command on Unix-like systems.

Matt Miller posted to the Metasploit Blog about our ANI efforts:
http://blog.metasploit.com/

The two exploits can be viewed in the svn repository at metasploit.com:
http://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/modules/exploits/windows/browser/
ani_loadimage_chunksize.rb
http://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/modules/exploits/windows/email/an
i_loadimage_chunksize.rb

The first module exploits the ANI flaw through Internet Explorer. It uses 
multiple icon files referenced from a single HTML page. This allows 
client-side brute forcing without resorting to javascript. This module 
will execute code on Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista using 
the default target. As mentioned in the blog, a command shell is not 
directly accessible on Vista, but the Meterpreter payload can be used to 
bust out of the low-privileged process :-)

The second module exploits the ANI flaw through Outlook and Outlook 
Express. It sends a multipart MIME e-mail that contains multiple icons 
files referenced from a HTML message. This allows brute forcing of the 
correct target via the mail reader, all without any form of client-side 
scripting. To use this module, point RHOST and RPORT at a SMTP server 
that will relay your email. Set the MAILFROM and MAILTO options, select a 
payload, launch the exploit, and wait for your payload to execute.

An example session from the e-mail based exploit module:
