ASRL has limited entropy and the attacker can continue to try exploits
an infinite number of times (as Solar Eclipse points out). This means
you can write a reliable Vista exploit, theoretically. I'll probably
finish one up on Monday.

IE in protected mode would still allow you access to the local network
and, more importantly, anything IE does. You could, for example,
inject code into all viewed webpages that steals passwords and
whatnot. Just at the very minimum.
