Subject: Metasploit vs ANI

Two new exploit modules are available for version 3.0 of the Metasploit 
Framework. These modules can be obtained by using the 'Online Update' 
feature in Windows and the 'svn update' command on Unix-like systems.

Matt Miller posted to the Metasploit Blog about our ANI efforts:
http://blog.metasploit.com/

The two exploits can be viewed in the svn repository at metasploit.com:
http://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/modules/exploits/windows/browser/ani_loadimage_chunksize.rb
http://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/modules/exploits/windows/email/ani_loadimage_chunksize.rb

The first module exploits the ANI flaw through Internet Explorer. It uses 
multiple icon files referenced from a single HTML page. This allows 
client-side brute forcing without resorting to javascript. This module 
will execute code on Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista using 
the default target. As mentioned in the blog, a command shell is not 
directly accessible on Vista, but the Meterpreter payload can be used to 
bust out of the low-privileged process :-)

The second module exploits the ANI flaw through Outlook and Outlook 
Express. It sends a multipart MIME e-mail that contains multiple icons 
files referenced from a HTML message. This allows brute forcing of the 
correct target via the mail reader, all without any form of client-side 
scripting. To use this module, point RHOST and RPORT at a SMTP server 
that will relay your email. Set the MAILFROM and MAILTO options, select a 
payload, launch the exploit, and wait for your payload to execute.

An example session from the e-mail based exploit module:
