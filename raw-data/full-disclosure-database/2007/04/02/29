Subject: SecTor Call for Papers & Registration now open

A new event along the lines of the world famous BlackHat USA event is coming
to Toronto, Canada and is looking for top speakers.

SecTor is all about the meat -- The content that matters to Security
Professionals today -- Black Hat and White Hat. Sure we plan on having fun
and having a number of celebrated speakers contributing to the event, but of
number one importance to the advisory committee is quality content for
attendees and an security conference experience unmatched in Canada.

This is a call for speakers/papers. If believe you have a significant
discovery or research that the security community would value, or enjoy
hearing about, we invite you to submit your presentation topic for serious
consideration.

Please make your proposal submissions before May 31st, 2007. Slides for the
papers must be submitted by October 15th, 2007.

SecTor attendees are a mix of security professionals and vendors,
programmers, students, network administrators and IT executives. Preference
will be given to speakers who can present innovative technical content to a
broad audience. Of course, all presentations are expected to challenge the
brightest and quickest of attendees - we wouldn't have it any other way.

SecTor is not a vendor fair. Consequently, there will be very little
tolerance for commercial content within presentations. Attendees will be
encouraged to quell any shameless marketing that is not immediately backed
up with rationale for its inclusion. Beware of flying objects presenters.

Proposals should consist of the following information:

   1. Presenter and contact info (country of origin and residence-mail,
   postal address, phone, fax).
   2. Employer and/or affiliations.
   3. Brief biography, list of publications and papers.
   4. Any significant presentation and educational experience/background.

   5. Topic synopsis, Proposed paper title, and a one paragraph
   description.
   6. Reason why this material is innovative or significant or an
   important tutorial.
   7. Optionally, any samples of prepared material or outlines ready.
   8. Will you have full text available or only slides?
   9. Please list any other publications or conferences where this
   material has been or will be published/submitted.



Please include the plain text version of this information in your email as
well as any file, pdf, sxw, ppt, or html attachments.



Please forward the above information to cfp@...tor.ca
