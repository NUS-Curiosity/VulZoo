I got bit by a wild cockatoo. It was a white, sulfur-crested
cockatoo.  It seems, they have learned to eat out of people's hands
- -- so I (and most other people on the tour bus) were feeding them.
A few of the birds learned that if they bite or scratch the hand
that feeds them, then the other hand will drop all of the food it
is holding.

One bird scratched my hand (didn't break the skin, but it did
startle me and I dropped food). Another bird began stalking me.
Every time I tried to feed anyone else, he was there. He ended up
biting my thumb -- more like a 1/2 inch paper cut. However, I
didn't drop the food for him. Net result? Bird drew blood and
didn't get seeds. And I learned that the antiseptic liquid in wet-
wipes burns like hell.

How does this relate to computer security? Many organized crime
gangs use hostile tactics such as DDoS to blackmail companies into
handing over money. And on a smaller scale, I know a half dozen
users without any ethical or social values who use impersonation
and deceitful tactics to intimidate honest netizens. Like the wild
cockatoo, don't give in to these threats or they will only be
encouraged, continuing their abuses on other people and escalating
from scratches to bites.
