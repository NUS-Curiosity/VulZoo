Microsoft Security Bulletin Advance Notification
Updated: April 1, 2007

As part of the monthly security bulletin release cycle, Microsoft
provides advance notification to our customers on the number of new
security updates being released, the products affected, the aggregate
maximum severity and information about detection tools relevant to the
update. This is intended to help our customers plan for the deployment
of these security updates more effectively.

In addition, to help customers prioritize monthly security updates with
any non-security updates released on Microsoft Update, Windows Update,
Windows Server Update Services and Software Update Services on the same
day as the monthly security bulletins, we also provide:

* Information about the release of updated versions of the Microsoft
Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool.
 
* Information about the release of NON-SECURITY, High Priority updates
on Microsoft Update (MU), Windows Update (WU), Windows Server Update
Services (WSUS) and Software Update Services (SUS).
 

Note that this information will pertain ONLY to updates on Microsoft
Update, Windows Update, Windows Server Update Services and Software
Update Services and only about High Priority, non-security updates being
released on the same day as security updates. Information will NOT be
provided about Non-security updates released on other days.

On Tuesday 3 April 2007 Microsoft is planning to release:

Security Updates

* One Microsoft Security Bulletin affecting Microsoft Windows. The
highest Maximum Severity rating for these is Critical. These updates
will require a restart. These updates will be detectable using the
Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer.
 

Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool

* Microsoft will not release an updated version of the Microsoft Windows
Malicious Software Removal Tool on Windows Update, Microsoft Update,
Windows Server Update Services and the Download Center on Tuesday 3
April 2007.
 

Non-security High Priority updates on MU, WU, WSUS and SUS

* Microsoft will not release any NON-SECURITY High-Priority Updates for
Windows on Windows Update (WU) and Software Update Services (SUS) on
Tuesday 3 April 2007.
 
* Microsoft will not release any NON-SECURITY High-Priority Updates on
Microsoft Update (MU) and Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) on
Tuesday 3 April 2007.
 

Although we do not anticipate any changes, the number of bulletins,
products affected, restart information and severities are subject to
change until released.

Microsoft will host a webcast next week to address customer questions on
these bulletins. For more information on this webcast please see below:
