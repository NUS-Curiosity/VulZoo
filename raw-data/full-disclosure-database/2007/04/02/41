Understandably. This is the attack which this thread is about, as 
indicated in the subject line of the e-mail.

To recap, you used the phrase "flawed copy routine." to refer to the 
fact that you could carry out an attack using this particular attack 
method by writing to "typically C:\WINDOWS\ or C:\WINNT\". Again, to 
recap, my point was:

"an attacker with write access to %systemroot%
  probably has juicier, simpler targets to attack (which potentially let 
them run code in a higher security context) than animated cursors."

Do you have any reply to make to what I actually *said*?
