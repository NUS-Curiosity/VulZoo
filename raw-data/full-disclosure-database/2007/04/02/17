>>"Heap spraying" is filling the heap with controllable data... This is
simply allocating things in the heap. NOT running code.
>>You are trying to say that once you jump into that code via some
exploit (NOT part of the heap spraying technique itself) THEN you are
"running code in the heap". 

What's the point of spraying the heap if you're not going to jump into
it?
