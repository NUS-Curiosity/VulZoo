Larry is right here.  DEP is pretty much turned off by default for
everything except some critical system processes.  All your applications
including IE have it turned off by default.  You have to manually turn DEP
on for all programs and then make some manual exceptions for the few
applications (like Microsoft Live Meeting) that aren't compatible with DEP.
Vista isn't much better with DEP settings though I've noticed they've made
it much harder to make DEP exception entries because you now need to do it
manually instead of being prompted to insert a quick exception on the fly.

>>That's where you are wrong larry, if you have an NX capable CPU
("hardware enforced") DEP is turned on by default on all and every
process. Software DEP is not really DEP it's more like SafeSEH... 

See http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/875352 ("A detailed
description of the Data Execution Prevention (DEP) feature in Windows XP
Service Pack 2...")

"OptIn - This setting is the default configuration. On systems with
processors that can implement hardware-enforced DEP, DEP is enabled by
default for limited system binaries and programs that "opt-in." With
this option, only Windows system binaries are covered by DEP by default.
"

I'm almost positive that the limited system binaries do not include
Internet Explorer. At the time they made this configuration decision too
many controls were broken by turning on DEP by default. 

And the policy is the same in Vista. For now.
