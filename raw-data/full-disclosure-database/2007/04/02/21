Oh dear, my "claim is just pointless", the fact is, I have not made
such a claim, I have introduced the notion of Hardware DEP and Software
DEP, that's what I did and that's all. Some poeple don't realise there
is a difference between them I wanted to show them there is.

In otherwords, claiming it works with "DEP enabled" just because the
PoC worked on your software-DEP-enabled machine doesn't proof it works
on HW-enabled-machines, that was my point. That's my entire point, not
saying it can't be  or is be done with Hardware DEP...get it ?

I never claimed it can't be done, actually within our company some do, so..
Try the current milworm PoCs on NX enforced CPUS
