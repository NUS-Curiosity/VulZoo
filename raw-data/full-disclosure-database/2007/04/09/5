Subject: DNS mining ?

Hello,

I have a domain name which has it's primary A record pointing at google.
This domain hasn't been published anywhere and is very low traffic,
surprisingly this guy has it listed as one of the entries pointing to
google:

http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:Vp6UWUf7NmMJ:mousecave.com/google/+rfsee.net

His list is correct, question is how could he possibly compose it?
Scanning the whole [[:alnum:]]{1,30} dns range is impractical. I find
it hard to believe he is sniffing some major backbone router for
traffic and having access to a root DNS won't help him much (IMHO).
How could he then have done it? The only option I can think of is that
he is working @google or has backdoor access to google indexing
service which allows him to query for info such as "With what header
did the http request came to the server".

I find this highly intriguing.

Ideas are welcome.
