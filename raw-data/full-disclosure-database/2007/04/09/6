Note that there *do* exists feeds of things like "all domains registered in
the last 24 hours", and other ways to get lists of things like "everything
in *.com".  So "never published" does *not* equate directly to "not findable".

Did you check your nameserver logs for:

a) Do you prohibit AXFR requests except from your secondaries?
b) Do your secondaries prohibit AXFRs entirely?
c) Has anybody *tried* to do an AXFR? If so, who?
