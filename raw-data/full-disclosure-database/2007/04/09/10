I doubt it.  If such a tool existed, it would just be querying some
third party service like domaintools.com, not doing anything itself.  In
order to do this lookup yourself requires access to the TLD zone files,
which requires signing a contract with Verisign (for .net & .com) or PIR
(for .org) that says you won't use it to spam or whatever.

Without that you'd have to bruteforce the TLD nameservers with all
possible domain names, and that is obviously impractical (and stupid.)
