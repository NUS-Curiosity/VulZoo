My 7 line python fuzzer found several file format bugs in 3 hours. Quite
alarming. 

No deep analysis was done, I leave that to the community.

These are some of the results:

 

file789-1.doc  - Unspecified Overflow in word 2007 - Crash in wwlib.dll -
Code execution is not trivial.

file798-1.doc - Word 2007 CPU exhaustion DOS - CPU shoots up to 100 %.

file613-1.doc -  Word 2007 CPU exhaustion DOS + ding - CPU shoots up to 100
%, and windows goes "ding!"

evil.hlp - Heap overflow in Windows HLP files - Funky heap overflow crash,
more than meets the eye (does this sound familiar to anyone?)

 

These files can be found at

Be safe,
