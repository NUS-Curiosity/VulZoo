ZDI-07-019: BMC Patrol PerformAgent bgs_sdservice Memory Corruption
            Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-07-019.html
April 18, 2007

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2007-2136

-- Affected Vendor:
BMC

-- Affected Products:
Patrol

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since April 13, 2007 by Digital Vaccine protection
filter ID 5287. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of BMC Patrol. User interaction is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists due to improper parsing of XDR data sent to
the bgs_sdservice.exe process listening by default on TCP port 10128.
An attacker can influence a parameter to a memory copy operation and
cause corruption of the stack and including SEH pointers. This can be
leveraged to execute arbitrary code.


-- Vendor Response:
BMC has provided the following statement: "[This issue] has been
addressed, and a patch has been made available to our customers. A
flash bulletin has been created describing the patch and will be sent
to all affected customers in the next few days. 
 
BMC has a formal customer support mechanism in place to provide
solutions to security issues brought to us by those who have legally
licensed our software. In cases where security issues are brought to my
attention by individuals/vendors who do not have legal access to our
products, we will investigate their merit; however the issues will be
addressed at our own discretion and according to our understanding of
their severity. 
 
Finally, please note that in the future, I will only communicate
resolutions and workarounds to licensed customers who are using our
software legally. For a more meaningful dialogue around these issues
and to be notified of any available patches, I urge all licensed
customers to use BMC's support mechanism."
