Lets also keep in mind that most vendors won't patch a hole in a  
timely fashion, and will happily leave their customers hanging in the  
wind to protect their stock price and image.

Did you really just metaphorically compare software companies to  
Yahweh??  And for completeness sake, do you really mean to assert  
that people don't cry out to $deity about various injustices?

Oooo.  Nice.  "if you disagree with me, you suck and stuff!"

Cuz Yahweh forbid there be consequences.

You must live an interesting life when you lack the ability to  
differentiate between truth and lawlessness.

When the hacksaw threat costs users, business and government as much  
as insecurities in poorly audited code you'll see these stories.   
Somehow I don't see that happening though.  There are clear laws in  
place when a company places a poor/flawed product on the market.   
Software seems to get a pass on this.

That's right ladies and germs.  Stop searching for holes and  
insecurities in your applications and OS.  Stick your head in the  
sand and let people with ill intent find it and exploit before you  
can be aware of the problem and protect yourself.  Definitely *do  
not* share the information if you stumble on it.  $deity knows you'd  
be a poor example if you acted to protect and inform others.

Yes, because you're all psychic and stuff, and can immediately  
ascertain someone's motives.  It's a miracle you aren't employed full  
time by the legal system with this super amazing power.
