There'a a lot of stupid/lazy/incompetent admin'ing out there too, 
though as I suggested with my "and/or" options, often what is 
supperficially "obvious admin incompetence" from the outside is 
actually due to a failure (commonly in the form of managerial override 
you describe) of otherwise good policies and implemantation.  That said 
though, if an incompetent to decide CEO (etc, etc) can so easily 
override the agreed policies, etc, then the system is just as borked as 
if the firewall rules, client lockdown policies, etc, etc were 
incomplete/missing/etc and the rest of us are scarcely any better off 
than if it were simple administrative incompetence, as the result is 
the same.  If more admins stood up to such "managerial incompetence" 
things might actually change for the better, as like it or not, it _is_ 
managerial incompetence that is the problem here, regardless of the 
source of the problem being admin incompetence or policy override...
