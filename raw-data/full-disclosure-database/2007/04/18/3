Subject: UK ISP threatens security researcher

http://www.theregister.com/2007/04/17/hackers_service_terminated/

"A 21-year-old college student in London had his internet service
terminated and was threatened with legal action after publishing details
of a critical vulnerability that can compromise the security of the ISP's
subscribers."

I happen to know the guy, and I am saddened by this.

	Gadi.
