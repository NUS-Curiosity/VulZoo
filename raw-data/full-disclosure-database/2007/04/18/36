It's an unsolvable problem in computer science: a program (the browser) cannot calculate exactly how long another program (the script) will execute except by executing it... thus running at least as long as the latter. Proven mathematically, inescapable fact. The PoC at hand only demonstrates the easiest case, but there are infinitely more possible ones. The only safe way out is a timeout, like Internet Explorer (or PHP on the server side) implements
