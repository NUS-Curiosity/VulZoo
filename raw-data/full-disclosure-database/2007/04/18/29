This also works under Konqueror.

There should be an implimentation on ALL browsers that a loop such large is 
unacceptable and refuse to even run it. There is no viable reason for a 
client-side to run a loop through so many itterations.

This DoS technique could be abused and  iframes with the code could be 
embedded within popular websites, effectively causing a denial of service to 
that specific site.
