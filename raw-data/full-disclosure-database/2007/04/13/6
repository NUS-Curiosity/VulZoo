The page mentions different types of spam, so it's really just a
matter of doing whois lookups / reverse dns checks and stuff like that
to see where the stuff comes from. Once you filter out all the end
user ranges you can easily do some manual sorting of the list to find
"juicy" stuff, aka things that are fun to laugh at.
