Subject: Re: patch-9449

Myself and a client have received several over the past 24hrs.

I submitted one as the password protected zip file to VirusTotal and 
Kaspersky identified it as a virus/trojan as did several other AV 
products. Names varied so I didn't record them. Was most interested in 
seeing if there was a consistent identification of the archive.

Received another this morning which I unzipped on a Linux box  then 
tested with CA AV. It was identified as Win32/Pecoan.R
