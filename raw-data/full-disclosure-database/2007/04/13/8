The filenames are randomized. 4 or 5 numbers always.

Hi,

Had a funny spam today that warned about mails coming from my IP address
and I should apply the attached patch. The filename was named
patch-9449.exe which was attached in a password protected zip file -
presumably to fool your virus scanner.

I unpacked it but my up-to-date virus scanner on my Windows XP vmware
instance cannot detect any malware.

Has anyone else seen this and know what it is?

Stew
