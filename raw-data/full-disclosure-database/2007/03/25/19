I get a valid answer as well:

Tracing to phishtank.com[a] via 127.0.0.1, maximum of 3 retries
127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1)
 |\___ auth3.opendns.com [phishtank.com] (208.69.39.2) Got authoritative 
answer
 |\___ auth2.opendns.com [phishtank.com] (208.67.219.54) Got authoritative 
answer
  \___ auth1.opendns.com [phishtank.com] (38.99.14.20) Got authoritative 
answer

auth1.opendns.com (38.99.14.20)         phishtank.com -> 66.135.40.79
auth2.opendns.com (208.67.219.54)       phishtank.com -> 66.135.40.79
auth3.opendns.com (208.69.39.2)         phishtank.com -> 66.135.40.79
