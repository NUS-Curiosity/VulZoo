No, if you have a signature to some text, you need to find a collision to a
specified value - the one the signature covers.  For instance, if you have
a 16 bit hash, finding two texts that both have a hash value of 0x1F6E doesn't
do you much good if the signature is for 0x4ED2.  And due to the birthday
paradox, finding any pair of colliding hashes is a lot easier than finding
a collision to a specific hash.

And being able to force a collision to a specific hash may not be very
useful all by itself - for instance, if you're trying to collide the hash
that the PGP signature covers in this message, you *might* be able to find
a string of bits.  But you won't be able to make it a *plausible* signature
unless your string of bits is *also* a chunk of English text, that reads as
if I wrote it.  So not only do you need to be able to collide a specific
hash, you need to do so with at least *some* control over the content of
the text, which is even harder.

Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped
