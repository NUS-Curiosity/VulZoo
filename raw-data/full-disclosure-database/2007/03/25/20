I'm on a Mac, so I'm pretty sure I don't have any DNS poisoning or  
evil malware.  My hosts is intact:



caprica:~ mward$ cat /etc/hosts
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
