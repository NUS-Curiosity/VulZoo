Subject: Re: hi5 Antiphishing Departement

Yep it works. I cloned that and modified it to mail me the user cookie see
http://bottester.hi5.com You have to be logged to make it work ok. Sometimes
doesn't works correctly, it takes you to the home page. Try several times.
No idea why. Sometimes when you modify your profile in hi5 you have to do it
two or three times until it works. Maybe they have some broken code when
updating the database. Adding the subject seems to break it, anyway works
well as a phishing attack since you can tell the user to fill that field.
