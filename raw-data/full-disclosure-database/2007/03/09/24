No, I never said I blame Windows for a poorly written app such as this.
Don't jump to conclusions.

Many developers might think using predictable filenames in TEMP might be
ok, since Windows doesn't (yet) have issues related to symlink attacks.
However, ZARAZA has shown a few ways to exploit this lame practice
anyway, beyond just a DoS.  That's all I'm saying.
