Dear Michele Cicciotti,

First,  Bob's private data was just an example. A problem itself belongs
to any case where data with more restrictive permissions is created in a
folder  with  less restrictive permissions. And despite Mr. Grimes says,
this  is  quite common case under Windows and can be found in almost any
real  corporate  directory  structure. If you ever removed "Inherit from
parent"  checkbox in advanced security settings - you most probably were
vulnerable to attack. Show me administrator who never did.

Second,   "Preopen  file  attack"  and  everything  below will work with
saner  "Add  and  read permission for User group". Any usage of "Creator
owner" group is a case where this can be exploited.
