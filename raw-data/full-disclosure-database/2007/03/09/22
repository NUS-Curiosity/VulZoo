Dear Roger A. Grimes,

Nice.  What  about  creating  "Sales  Reports" folder only head of Sales
department has access inside "Sales" folder?

 There  is  no  actual  difference  between  "Change" and "Full Control"
permissions  for  NTFS.  "Change"  give you ability to delete and create
objects. An ability to delete some object and create it again give you a
way to become object owner, like if you have "Take ownership" individual
permission.  As  an  owner you always have implicit "Change permissions"
individual  permission.  So, you have your "Full control" without having
it.  There  is simply nothing more to debate here. Ownership problem was
debated for ages.

Who  can  tell  me,  creating "Sales reports" inside "Sales" is insecure
choice?

RAG> There's  a  reason  why your "announcements" aren't making the news

If   I   want   to  "make  news  media",  I  write  article  on  Russian
cyberterrorism  and it's connection with Ukraine, Germany and US. Not an
article on enterprise file management best security practices.

Roger, please read "Intro" section, it's rather small.

Are not we discussing?
