Subject: firefox 2.0.0.2 crash

Can be dupe but in fast browsing over topics I did not discovered this
exploit:

http://people.zoy.org/~sam/firefox-crash-save-session-before-clicking.gif


I do NOT know anything else than this url. Just seen it in random
discussion and anyone else I asked knows nothing. Current tests indicate
that Mozilla 2.0.0.2 gets killed within second, 1.5.0.10 survives.
