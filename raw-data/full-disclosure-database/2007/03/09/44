Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in Smb4K.

Background
==========

Smb4K is a SMB/CIFS (Windows) share browser for KDE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/smb4k      < 0.6.10a                          >= 0.6.10a

Description
===========

Kees Cook of the Ubuntu Security Team has identified multiple
vulnerabilities in Smb4K.

* The writeFile() function of smb4k/core/smb4kfileio.cpp makes
  insecure usage of temporary files.

* The writeFile() function also stores the contents of the sudoers
  file with incorrect permissions, allowing for the file's contents to
  be world-readable.

* The createLockFile() and removeLockFile() functions improperly
  handle lock files, possibly allowing for a race condition in file
  handling.

* The smb4k_kill utility distributed with Smb4K allows any user in
  the sudoers group to kill any process on the system.

* Lastly, there is the potential for multiple stack overflows when
  any Smb4K utility is used with the sudo command.

Impact
======

A local attacker could gain unauthorized access to arbitrary files via
numerous attack vectors. In some cases to obtain this unauthorized
access, an attacker would have to be a member of the sudoers list.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Smb4K users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/smb4k-0.6.10a"
