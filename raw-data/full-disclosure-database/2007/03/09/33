Hi Justin,

 

Imperva is hosting a webinar on March 14th that goes over Web 2.0
(including AJAX, RSS feeds, collaboration sites & mashups), Web 2.0
security risks, and mitigation techniques. You can sign up for it at
http://imperva.webex.com <http://imperva.webex.com/> . 

 

 

There are also some good resources on the web. For example, this article
covers AJAX security issues: http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1868.
And the new OWASP Top Ten 2007 candidate-while not developed for "Web
2.0" apps-covers many of the top Web 2.0 security threats like XSS &
CSRF. It's available at: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007 

 

Best regards,
Kasey
