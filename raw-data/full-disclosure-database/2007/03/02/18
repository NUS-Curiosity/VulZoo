 AntiVirus UPX File Decompression DoS Vulnerability

Kaspersky AntiVirus UPX File Decompression DoS Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.02.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 02, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Kaspersky Antivirus is a popular client and gateway virus scanner for Unix
and Windows. UPX, the ultimate packer for executables, is a method for
compressing executable files to reduce their size on disk. For more
information, visit the vendor's site at the following URL.

http://www.kaspersky.com/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in Kaspersky
Lab's Antivirus could allow an attacker to conduct a DoS attack on a
targeted host.

The antivirus engine is vulnerable to a DoS condition when processing an
executable packed with UPX compression. Malformed compressed data causes
the decompression routine to enter an infinite loop. Specifically, a
negative data offset results in the same compressed data chunk being
processed endlessly.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to conduct a DoS attack.

If this attack is conducted against an e-mail gateway running Kaspersky,
legitimate clients may be unable to send e-mail through the server.

The infinite loop being executed consists of a short sequence of
instructions, which results in maximum CPU usage. On a client desktop, the
infinite loop will render the machine nearly unusable. On a server, it
severely degrades the quality of service of other applications running.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Kaspersky
Labs Antivirus Engine version 6.0.1.411 for Windows and 5.5-10 for Linux.
Previous versions may also be affected. Any products that use the scanning
engine are also affected, which includes the Kaspersky e-mail gateway
scanner.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
