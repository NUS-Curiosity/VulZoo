Subject: Re: Knorr.de SQL Injection and XSS	Vulnerabilities

The point why I rated those problems as high risk was that due to this  
problems free access to all user data was possible.

And problems that will offer any kind of user data (including  
unencrypted passwords) is a significant security risk from my point of  
view (see the latest problems regarding StudiVZ).

A lot of people are using the same password for websites, email and so  
on. And getting a password using this security hole makes it also  
possible to log in to a lot of email accounts that don't belong to you.
