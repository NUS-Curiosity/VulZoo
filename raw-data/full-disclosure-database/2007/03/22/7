4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in XMMS, which can
be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

1) An integer underflow error exists in the processing of skin bitmap
images. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow
via specially crafted skin images containing manipulated header
information.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

2) An integer overflow error exists in the processing of skin bitmap
images. This can be exploited to cause memory corruption via specially
crafted skin images containing manipulated header information.

Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Do not install skins from untrusted sources.

======================================================================
