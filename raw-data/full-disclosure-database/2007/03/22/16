Subject: ZombieMap - GEO Zombie Mapper

ZombieMap is an AJAX application that you can use to locate Zombie
hooked on bi-directional persistent communication channels. Carnaval
is such type of channel and it is added by default. If you want to
spawn your own attack channel, use AttackAPI's channel.php
infrastructure module.

These Zombie can be controlled with Backframe Attack Console

If you cannot see points on the map in the first 5 seconds, most
probably there are no attached clients. For testing purposes, open
another browser (different from the one you use for ZombieMap) and
point it to here. Have fun!
