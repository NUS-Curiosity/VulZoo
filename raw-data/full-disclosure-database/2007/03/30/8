Subject: secure listserv config

What? A security company sets up a mailing list, but allows any tom,
dick or J.Random Hacker Jr. III to post to it? Then fails to notice
the storm of people saying "unsubscribe!", "me, too!", "shut up!",
"stop sending me all this crap!" and "No, you stop!"??

Inconceivable!
