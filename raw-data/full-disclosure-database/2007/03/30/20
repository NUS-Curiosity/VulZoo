Synopsis
========

A buffer underflow vulnerability has been reported in file allowing for
the user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

file is a utility that guesses a file format by scanning binary data
for patterns.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-apps/file       < 4.20                                >= 4.20

Description
===========

Jean-SÃ©bastien Guay-Leroux reported an integer underflow in
file_printf function.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to run the "file" program on a
specially crafted file that would trigger a heap-based buffer overflow
possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of
the user running "file". Note that this vulnerability could be also
triggered through an automatic file scanner like amavisd-new.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Since file is a system package, all Gentoo users should upgrade to the
latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/file-4.20"
