Synopsis
========

SILC Server is affected by a Denial of Service vulnerability.

Background
==========

SILC Server is a server for the Secure Internet Live Conferencing
(SILC) protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/silc-server     < 1.0.2-r1                     >= 1.0.2-r1

Description
===========

Frank Benkstein discovered a possible NULL pointer dereference in
apps/silcd/command.c if a new channel is created without specifying a
valid hmac or cipher algorithm name.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could cause the server to crash, resulting in a
Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SILC Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/silc-server-1.0.2-r1"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
