Subject: new AttackAPI

for those who are interested in Web 2.0 security, there is a new
version of AttackAPI that you can download from here:

http://www.gnucitizen.org/projects/attackapi/

There is still no documentation which is a bit of a drawback, but that
will be generated soon. If there is anyone interested in documenting
some of the features, please contact us.

There is a also a simple bookmarklet that you can use to load
AttackAPI on any page. You can install it from here:
