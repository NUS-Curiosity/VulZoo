Synopsis
========

The Magnatune component shipped with Amarok is vulnerable to the
injection of arbitrary shell code from a malicious Magnatune server.

Background
==========

Amarok is an advanced music player.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/amarok     < 1.4.5-r1                     >= 1.4.5-r1

Description
===========

The Magnatune downloader doesn't quote the "m_currentAlbumFileName"
parameter while calling the "unzip" shell command.

Impact
======

A compromised or malicious Magnatune server can remotely execute
arbitrary shell code with the rights of the user running Amarok on a
client that have previously registered for buying music.

Workaround
==========

Do not use the Magnatune component of Amarok.

Resolution
==========

All Amarok users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/amarok-1.4.5-r1"
