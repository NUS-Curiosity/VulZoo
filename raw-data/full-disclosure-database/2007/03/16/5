It can be interesting if you can find a way to get some *other* user to
run the application - so if you can find a web server that has a CGI that
invokes QFTP (or whatever) with attacker-controlled parameters, you can use
that to pwn the webserver.  Basically, you need to be able to leverage the
distinction between "yourself" and "the userid executing the program".
