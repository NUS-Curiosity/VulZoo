At the end of this email is the press release with more details about this
innitiative. This in a nutshell says that we have (at least) $110,000 USD
budget, that everybody can apply and that we are going to give 10 'no
strings attached'  1,000 USD grants to popular security Open Source
projects.

Of course that you are invited to submit an application and use this
opportunity to work on an (existent or new) OWASP project, increase
knowledge and create a great tool / document (note: submission period ends
on the 30th of March).

Also if you are thinking of joing OWASP as a member, then use this
opportunity to do so and allocate your membership fees to project(s) you are
interested in.
As always, I am here to help, so feel free to contact me.

For Immediate Release

*OWASP Spring Of Code 2007 sponsorship initiative and Membership Drive*

*London, United Kingdom, March 14, 2007*

The OWASP Spring of Code
2007<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007>(SpoC
007) aims to financially sponsor contributions to OWASP Projects.
*SpoC 007 * follows up the successful AoC 06 (OWASP Autumn of Code 2006
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Autumn_Of_Code_2006>) in which 9
projects were sponsored and greatly improved.

The objective of *SpoC 007* is to allow contributors to allocate
considerable resources on (existent or new) OWASP projects which are
relevant and beneficial to the OWASP community.

The initial Budget for *SpoC 007* will be $110,000 USD, and it is funded by
OWASP (using current membership fees and profits from past conferences) and
newly joined members (currently SPI Dynamics and EDS). In parallel with the
*Request for Proposals*, OWASP would like to invite individuals and
companies that benefit from OWASP projects to join OWASP as a member. In
addition to the current Membership benefits, the new OWASP members will be
able to allocate membership fees to SpoC 007 projects they are interested in
(for example SPI Dynamics is sponsoring the OWASP SiteGenerator project).

The *SpoC 007* structure and organization is very similar to the very
successful OWASP Autumn Of Code 2006 (AoC 06), whereby the major changes
are: Bigger budget (with a $20,000 USD sponsorship), the special project:
"10 Donations to Open Source projects" and an Internship

There are no geographical, age or any other form of restrictions of who can
apply for an "OWASP Spring of Code 2007" sponsorship. The only requirement
is that the candidate shows the potential to accomplish the project's
objectives and the commitment to dedicate the time required to complete it
in the allocated time frame (projects must be completed by 9th July 2007).

Prospective candidates should visit the
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Owasp_Spring_Of_Code_2007
page for SpoC 007 information (rules & how to apply) and the
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007_Project_Ideas page
for project ideas.

*Schedule:*

   - 14th March â€“ OWASP Spring of Code 2007 initiative is officially
   launched
   - 30th March - Deadline for project proposals
   - 9th April - Publish of selected projects and start of SpoC projects
   - 17th May - Announcement of the winners of the '10 Donations to Open
   Source projects' on OWASP Conference in Italy
   - 9th July - Project Completion, participants to deliver final project
   report

The special SpoC 007 project "10 Donations to Open Source projects" will be
made of 10 $1,000 USD grants to the top 10 Open Source projects which OWASP
members use regularly and really find useful. The payment would be a
no-strings attached "Thanks for the hard work in creating this tool (which
is widely used and appreciated in the OWASP community) and please keep
working on the next version".

The OWASP Spring Of Code 2007 is not connected to the Google Summer of Code.


The "OWASP Spring of Code 2007" project leader is Dinis Cruz (based in
London, UK) who can be contacted for further details.
