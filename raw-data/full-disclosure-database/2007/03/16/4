That depends on your actual code. It's not a security/speed trade-off, it's a
_I_don't_fucking_care_about_anything_and_I_use_the_easiest_function/speed 
trade-off.

If you care about security AND speed then you use strcpy() correctly, if 
you're a lazy bastard and don't care about speed, then use strncpy().

Anyway, usually you should fill the whole buffer, so if you know how to code, 
it shouldn't have a big impact. *BUT* if you're one of those lazy guys that 
just allocate a 1024 char buffer to copy 32 char strings then you have worse 
problems than security.
