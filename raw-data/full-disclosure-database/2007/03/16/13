Subject: TOOL: LLTD implementation in Perl

Hello list,

I just released a LLTD (Link Layer Topology Discovery Protocol) 
implementation written in Perl (using Net::Frame framewwork).

Also, the OSPF implementation used to write the OSPF Attack 
Shell has also been released (see www.gomor.org).

You may use this two modules to write fuzzers, or anything.

You will find them here:
