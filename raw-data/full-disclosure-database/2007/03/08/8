Remote DOS in Asterisk SIP  [MU-200703-01]
March 07, 2006

http://labs.musecurity.com/advisories.html

Affected Products/Versions:

Asterisk versions 1.2.15 and 1.4.0, and earlier versions

Product Overview:

http://www.asterisk.org/

"Asterisk is the most popular and extensible open source telephone system
in the world, offering flexibility, functionality and features not available
in advanced, high-end (high-cost) proprietary business systems. Asterisk is
a complete IP PBX (private branch exchange) for businesses, and can be
downloaded for free."


Vulnerability Details:

Asterisk crashes when handed an otherwise valid request message but with no
URI and no SIP-version in the request-line of the message.  For example,
"REGISTER\r\n <other valid SIP headers>".  The crash is due to a null pointer
dereference, and does not appear to be otherwise exploitable.
