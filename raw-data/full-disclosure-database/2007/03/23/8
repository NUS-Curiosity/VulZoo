Subject: Re: XBOX ID's being Jacked

There are lots of folks that mention obtaining the IP in order to  
hack your account. They usually say they have done this with Cain and  
Able or Commview or any other sniffer out there. You IP can be easily  
obtained by the usual standby groups or bridgers....  The only reason  
they want your IP is because that can buy them ONE piece of  
information. In some cases if you have paid for the proper program  
you can get an address and GPS coordinates for an IP. In most cases  
the address will be that of your neighborhood router or something  
like that.

I just wanted to clear this up as there appears to be some confusion  
over what the IP address has to do with prextexing Microsoft XBL  
employees.

You can try something like this...

http://www.melissadata.com/lookups/iplocation.asp? 
ipaddress=209.11.233.26

and get something back like this

IP Address 209.11.233.26

City FINDLAY

State or Region OHIO

Country UNITED STATES

ISP CENTRACOMM COMMUNICATIONS.

This may be JUST enough info to trick a dumb employee
