	Side Code Execution Vulnerability

Hello,

I just tested it with UNC paths,
and yes this works too, but you have to
press on the yes button when it asks because
the file is not authorized (it comes from remote).
After pressing Yes one time it gets executed.
Normally Windows Mail does not execute
exe or other executable files, now it does :-)


Thank you for this nice idea Joxean Koret.



Regards,

kcope
