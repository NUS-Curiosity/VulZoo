Subject: Fix Update: Disable Google Desktop Link
	Integration with IE & FireFox

Thanks to all those who sent their few lines of appreciations or good words
after the first release of this fix details. 

Many requested offlist and onlist to put some info for disabling the GDS
*desktop* link for FireFox. However, being a bit lazy guy ;) I delayed the
response for such long time. After doing few minutes of study, I figured out
disabling the GDS desktop link in FireFox is far simpler compared to IE. 

Here are few updates made to the present release - 

- [Section 2.a] Added section for identifying components responsible for
GDS desktop link integration with FireFox

- [Section 3] Two more methods to fix are added under the "Permanent
Fix Details".

- [Section 4] Added fix details for FireFox

GDS Desktop Link and Google.com Integration -
Bad Design or Necessary Evil?

The recent security advisory on Google Desktop Search (GDS) published by
Watchfire did not really surprised me as I was expecting more like this in
past 2 years. However, the fact that intrigued me to write this article is
Google has not yet bothered to provide it's GDS tool users the option to
disable GDS desktop link regardless of knowing this design will attract more
attacks in future as well. 

In this article, I'll discuss a bit about why the GDS issues revolves
primarily around the GDS Desktop link and how one can fix it permanently by
disabling it which will ensure that users can still use GDS without the fear
against exploits that are targeted towards the desktop link.
