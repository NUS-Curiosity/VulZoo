Subject: XBOX ID's being Jacked

Kevin, 
 
My son's Xbox Live ID was jacked by "Brad" of the o Infamous o Clan. It happened in such a short amount of time that I don't feel that it was a case of Social Engineering. I did some research and came up with a way to do it using your Xbox, with Action Replay and a memory card, and the DVD of the game Splinter Cell, your PC Kernal IP Logger and an FTP program. It seems that the DVD has a copy of Linux on it that you use to help get the person's gamertag by using that person's IP address. 
 
I found the steps to do it on a message board. However, by the time I got to it, the message board admin had edited it and then also closed the thread. I think that the social engingineering angle is only a small percentage of the ID thefts. I have a feeling that the technical way is more likely how the majority of IDs are stolen.
