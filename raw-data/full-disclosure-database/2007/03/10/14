Apparently you don't understand the difference between a variable and a 
function.  wgBreakFrames is a variable that can be defined elsewhere. 
Without looking at the entire site, I assume that wgBreakFrames gets 
defined as "true" in those places where they don't want their pages 
trapped inside someone else's frame.

Given the syntax of this function, wgBreakFrames can only have one of two 
values: true or false.

I'd be interested to see some POC that would show how you would exploit 
this.
