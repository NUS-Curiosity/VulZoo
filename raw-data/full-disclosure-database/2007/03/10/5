I believe all dates in the advisory contain the wrong year...

Taking into account that the vulnerability you describe is fixed in
Hardened-PHP for years and that there is also a protection against this
in the Suhosin Extension you can be sure that this NOT a new
vulnerability (and that you are not the first one who found it...)

For the record, the same vulnerability was reported by me on the
23.10.2004 at 22:05 in a mail to security@....net (before I added the
protection to Hardened-PHP)
At that time the PHP developers considered it NOT A VULNERABILITY.

Well now the PHP developers have commited a fix for this to the PHP CVS,
crediting you instead of the original reporter (me) and as usual the fix
is only fixing a part of the problem.
(Hint: long names like HTTP_POST_VARS do exist...)
