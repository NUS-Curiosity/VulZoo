How?  You'd have to find some way to inject code into the javascript 
"stream".  If you can inject code into the site, it won't be because that 
variable exists.  It will be because something else isn't properly 
evaluating input.

 In addition to true and

Even if this is true, all you would have then is an information disclosure 
that might lead to some other compromise path.  But all the code is 
already available to the attacker, so he/she ought to be able to read the 
code and find the exploitable condition without doing all that extra work.
