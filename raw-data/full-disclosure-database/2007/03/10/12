Subject: Is OWASP vulnerable ??

Hello all,

There is an undefined function in OWASP website's javascript code (wikibits.js)
called wgBreakFrames. This can cause potential damage to the site if used maliciously.

http://www.owasp.org/skins/common/wikibits.js

start of code:

if (wgBreakFrames) {
// Un-trap us from framesets
if (window.top != window) {
window.top.location = window.location;
}
}

end of code

Your views, thoughts,comments,criticism, are most welcome.

Cheers :)
Kish
