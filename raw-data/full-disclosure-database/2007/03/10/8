Synopsis
========

The KHTML component shipped with the KDE libraries is prone to a
cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Background
==========

KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and
Unix-like Operating Systems. KHTML is the HTML interpreter used in
Konqueror and other parts of KDE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  kde-base/kdelibs     < 3.5.5-r8                       >= 3.5.5-r8

Description
===========

The KHTML code allows for the execution of JavaScript code located
inside the "Title" HTML element, a related issue to the Safari error
found by Jose Avila.

Impact
======

When viewing a HTML page that renders unsanitized attacker-supplied
input in the page title, Konqueror and other parts of KDE will execute
arbitrary JavaScript code contained in the page title, allowing for the
theft of browser session data or cookies.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All KDElibs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdelibs-3.5.5-r8"
