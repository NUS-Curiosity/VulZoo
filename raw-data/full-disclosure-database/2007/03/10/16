First of all, that's a variable, not a function. Creating a function  
called "wgBreakFrames" wouldn't execute the function.

Second of all, I'm not really sure how that could be "used  
maliciously". If you're able to inject Javascript into the window  
context, you can already do whatever you like to the user's browser.  
So I'm not quite sure how this is supposed to "cause potential damage  
to the site".
