The first thing to do is abuse the variable. In addition to true and false, try
3, 0 , -37, "Cabbage", and maybe "true) and (my_evil_function()))". See if you
can force it to throw a syntax error that creates a 404 page or something that
contains *other* input you control, especially if it finds its way to an eval().
