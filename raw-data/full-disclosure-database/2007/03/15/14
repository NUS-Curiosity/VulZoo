If they can write to it, then they can read from it. There is no distinction or security control.

There will also not be a trace on the client side that anything has happened. Additonal testing with Opera and FF2 show that they do not block/prompt for this behaviour by default. So you can't make the statement that nothing happend with FF.

Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] tinyurl.com - Local Clipboard

I took a quick look and it appears that they aren't trying to read the
clipboard, they're trying to write the generated tinyurl to it for the
folks who are too lazy to control-c it out of the page. Annoying to have
your clipboard contents clobbered, but not really a threat.

It didn't do anything in FF2.
