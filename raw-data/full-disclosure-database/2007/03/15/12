Subject: tinyurl.com - Local Clipboard

"TinyURL.com 
Making long URLs usable! More than 29 million of them. Over 700 million hits/month."

Word of warning. When you submit a url to be shortened by tinyurl.com they attempt to steal the contents of your local clipboard.

IE7 intercepts this and ask whether you want a site to be able to access your clipboard or not. Not sure how IE6, Opera and Firefox behave.

Sent an email to inquire about why they were trying to access. No response as of yet.
