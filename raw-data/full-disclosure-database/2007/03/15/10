Although it may come as a surprise to some, not all software has to worry
about working in a security-critical environment.  Quite often, the program
is a one-off that's working with data that is relatively trustable, and there
is little or no chance of the software being compromised.  And keep in mind
that str* functions *can* be used safely if somebody did a strlen() check
earlier in the program.

I mean, come *ON*.  If there exists a black hat that can drop an exploit
string into the middle of a data file produced by some data-mining program
of ours, and exploit a program that *didn't even exist* when the data was
written.....  in that case, we're screwed anyhow.  There's no way to stop
a black hat that knows how to exploit code from the future.
