Indeed. This should work, as "Restricted Sites Zone" is in "High" security
level by default.
To correct myself, I meant that this was the only way _I can think of_ to
mitigate this vulnerability using an out-of-the-box security feature.

On XP SP2 (and probably Vista), you can block the exploitation of this
by disabling script execution for the res:// scheme specifically.
Note that I didn't try blocking the specific resource involved in the
attack.

If you attempt to add "res://*" or "res://ieframe.dll/navcancl.htm" to
the Restricted Sites zone, this results in an entry for
"about:internet" being added.  After doing this, the "Refresh the
page" text is no longer a clickable link.  Removing the
"about:internet" entry reverses the change.  It seems that making this
change blocks scripts in ANY resource, even without the wildcard.
