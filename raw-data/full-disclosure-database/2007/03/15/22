Hi out there,

seems to be quite the same exploit as the one appeared in middle January 
which isn't very public and was marked as "private". The exploit code is 
nearly the same such as the bug.

For a quick fix change the following line

if (is_array($_POST['applicationids'])) while (list($applicationid, $val) = each($_POST['applicationids'])) if ($val == 1) $deleteids[] = $applicationid;

to this

if (is_array(intval($_POST['applicationids']))) while (list($applicationid, $val) = each($_POST['applicationids'])) if ($val == 1) $deleteids[] = $applicationid;

PS: I just got informed that it's the same crew discovered this bug as 
the last time.
