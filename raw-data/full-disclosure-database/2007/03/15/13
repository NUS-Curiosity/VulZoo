Subject: Re: tinyurl.com - Local Clipboard

I took a quick look and it appears that they aren't trying to read the
clipboard, they're trying to write the generated tinyurl to it for the
folks who are too lazy to control-c it out of the page. Annoying to have
your clipboard contents clobbered, but not really a threat.

It didn't do anything in FF2.
