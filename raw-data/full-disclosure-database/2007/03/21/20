Dear Blue Boar,

I  know  meaning  of  'hash  function'  term,  I  wrote  few articles on
challenge-response   authentication   and   I  did  few  hash  functions
implementations  for  hashtables  and  authentication  in FreeRADIUS and
3proxy.  Can  I  claim  my  right  for  sarcasm after calling ability to
bruteforce 160-bit hash 2000 times faster 'a crack'?
