Dear Blue Boar,

It's  not  clear  if  this 'crack' cam be applied to birthday attack. My
in-mind computations were: because birthday attack requires ~square root
of N computations where bruteforce requires ~N/2, impact of 2000 times N
decrease  for birthday is ~64 times faster. 64 = 2^6. Because complexity
is ~square root of possible combinations, it's equivalent of traditional
birthday  attack,  with  160-(2*6)=148  bits  hash (150 is my mistake in
in-mind computations).

Of  cause,  since  I  completely  wasted 10 years after obtaining Master
degree  in  Mathematics  and  3 years after loosing last pencil I may be
completely wrong in computations :)
