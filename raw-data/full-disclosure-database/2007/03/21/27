Subject: Re: Chinese Professor Cracks Fifth Data Security
 Algorithm (SHA-1)

My understanding that the kind of birthday attack under discussion would
start at 80-bits if SHA-1 (at 160-bits) were 100% secure. The attack
under discussion is reported to reduce that to the neighborhood of
60-something bits.

I am not a mathematician though, so I would be perfectly willing to
believe I was wrong about that.
