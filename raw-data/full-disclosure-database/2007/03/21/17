Cracking a hash would never mean recovering the full original message,
except for possibly messages that were smaller than the number of bits
in the hash value. There are an infinite number of messages that all
hash to the same value.

The best crack you can have for a hash is to be able collide with an
existing hash value and be able to choose most of the message contents.
