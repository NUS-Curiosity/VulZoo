	Algorithm (SHA-1)

Dear Blue Boar,

To  be more precise, theoretically, if compare bruteforce with birthday,
160  bit  birthday  is  equivalent  to  81-bit bruteforce by calculation
complexity (number of arithmetic operations).

I  do  not  compare  birthday  vs  bruteforce,  I  compare bruteforce vs
bruteforce and birthday vs birthday.

Practically,  if  you  define  some  real values instead of mathematical
symbols, software algorithm implementation and physical limitations must
be also considered. Software implementation may be impossible or require
more  CPU  cycles to implement algorithm with less arithmetic operations
because, e.g. it requires more physical memory than you can address with
64bit integer :)
