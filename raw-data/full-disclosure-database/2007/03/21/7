Sure.  Someone could create an html email with an img src set to
something like this:
http://192.168.1.1?/cgi-stuff?dns1=badguy.someplace.tld.  

Next they could add a bunch of urls for all the different router types.
Then, they could send the email from a common Sender addr like
security@<comapany>.tld so that email clients load the images
automatically.  :-(
