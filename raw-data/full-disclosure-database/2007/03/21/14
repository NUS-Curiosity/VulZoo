Both of you guys are confused.

First off Michael: this is old news.  It doesn't seem to indicate that
finding collisions is any faster than 2^63, which was reported quite
some time ago[1].

Secondly, 3APA3A, birthday attacks against the collision-resistance
property of a hash take approximately 2^(b/2) time, where b is the
number of bits.  That is, brute-force birthday attacks would take around
2^80 time against SHA-1.  These attacks reduce the complexity to 2^63,
or thereabouts, at least from what I've read previously[1].

As for US courts... which case are you referring to (as I'd be
interested to read the results)?  The only one I know of involving MD5
was an Australian case[2].

cheers,
tim
