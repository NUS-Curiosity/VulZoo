For those who haven't read about what Ken was saying.

The technique is called drive by Pharming. It involves crafting a page
hosting malicious JavaScript that takes advantage of default configurations
in home broadband modem/routers. (dlink, Linksys, netcomm etc.)
The basis of this attack is tricking a user into accessing a webpage that
changes the configuration of your modem by using default username and
password credentials.

The report by the Indiana university is here:
