Subject: Newest hacks

Hi guys,

I noticed a news recently.Researchers at Indiana University's Department 
of Computer Science recently released a report outlining a way hackers 
could potentially access and change the configuration routers on home 
networks. They described how some JavaScript built into a Web page could 
be used to log into the administrator account of a home router and change 
its DNS (define) settings.The Indiana University report points out that 
this attack doesn't exploit any browser vulnerability, and, more 
importantly, it seems to work with pretty much any router,rrespective of 
brand or model.Any idea how to program the javascript to modify the DNS 
configuration? 

Best Regards 



Ken
