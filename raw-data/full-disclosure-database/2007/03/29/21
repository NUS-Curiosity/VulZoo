     http://www.openoffice.org/security/CVE-2007-0238.html
     http://www.openoffice.org/security/CVE-2007-2.html

Description:
     Previous versions of openoffice.org were vulnerable to multiple 
issues which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code at the 
permission level of the user running openoffice (usually non-root). 
Attack vectors include coercing a user into opening a URL which contains 
an exploit, coercing the user into opening a vulnerable WordPerfect file 
(via bundled libwpd), and coercing a user into opening a vulnerable 
StarCalc document.
