Hemmm...
The same guys relased another 4 just a few minutes ago.

The idiot part is that Libero strongly refuse to contact the guys even if they continue to say that they have other XSSs and want to contact the admins...
They told libero : 'we have other vulns, will you tell us who can cope with them' but received no answers... :)

Sort of sad...
