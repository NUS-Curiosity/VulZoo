slocate=/conary.rpath.com@rpl:devel//foresight.rpath.org@fl:1-devel//1/3.1-8.1

     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0227

Description:
     Previous versions of the slocate package were vulnerable to an 
information-disclosure vulnerability. Slocate did not properly manage 
database entries that specify names of files in protected directories. 
Thus, for example, a user could see via slocate the names of files in a 
directory chmodded 711.
