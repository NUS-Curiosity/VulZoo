ZDI-07-011: IBM Lotus Domino IMAP Server CRAM-MD5 Authentication Buffer
            Overflow Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-07-011.html
March 28, 2007

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2007-1675

-- Affected Vendor:
IBM

-- Affected Products:
IBM Lotus Domino Server 6.5
IBM Lotus Domino Server 7.0

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:

vulnerability since January 5, 2006 by the pre-existing Digital Vaccine
protection filter ID 4033. For further product information on the

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Domino Server. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the CRAM-MD5 authentication mechanism of
nimap.exe which binds by default to TCP port 143. No check is done on
the length on the supplied username prior to processing it through a
custom copy loop. If the username is longer than 256 bytes, a pointer
overwrite may occur in the function nnotes.dll.CStream::ToBase64()
which is later called and can therefore result in execution of
arbitrary code.


-- Vendor Response:
IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
