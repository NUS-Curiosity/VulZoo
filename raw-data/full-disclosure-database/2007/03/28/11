Here's the update I had announced.

Further discussion on the ViewVC development mailing list [1]
revealed that the content type fixation issue [2] can be found in both
ViewCVS 1.0-dev (and lower) as well as ViewVC 1.0.3 (and lower).

A 'security information' section will be contained in the 'INSTALL' file
[3] of the upcoming ViewVC 1.1.0 release. This will explain how
providing HTTP access to a code repository can have negative effects if
code which can be considered malicious for web clients is contained in
the repository.

The ViewVC code was also changed in that support of the 'checkout view'
functionality (which allows presetting the content type of the HTTP
response) will be optional and disabled by default in future releases of
ViewVC (see changelog [4]). The changes can already be obtained by
checking out revision 1547 or higher off the ViewVC SVN repository.

I recommend that users and distributors of earlier ViewVC and ViewCVS
versions should either backport the patch which disables the 'checkout
view' or the one which makes it optional and deactivate it by default.
A less simple but less restrictive patch would introduce a content type
whitelisting approach.

Thanks to the ViewVC developers for their proactive support in sorting
this out.

Moritz

Here's the explanation of the content type fixation issue, as given in
my previous email on this topic:
