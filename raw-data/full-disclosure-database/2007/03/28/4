IBM Lotus Domino Web Access Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.28.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 28, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

IBM Lotus Domino Web Access is a web-based messaging and collaboration
interface for the Lotus Domino server. More information is available at the
following site.

http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/products/product1.nsf/wdocs/webaccesshome

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a cross-site scripting vulnerability in IBM Lotus
Domino Web Access allows attackers to execute arbitrary script code in a
targeted users browser.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper HTML filtering of
e-mail
message contents. Although Web Access attempts to filter out HTML and script
code, certain code sequences will bypass the filters and successfully
execute
JavaScript.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary
script code in the targeted user's browser.

This can lead to a full compromise of the e-mail account as credentials
may be
stolen and sent to the attacker. All that is required to trigger this
vulnerability is for a user to view a malicious e-mail using Web Access.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed that Lotus Domino Web Access 7.0 is vulnerable.
Earlier
versions are suspected vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
