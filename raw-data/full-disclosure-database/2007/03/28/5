 Domino Server LDAP Request Invalid DN Message Heap Overflow Vulnerability

IBM Lotus Domino Server LDAP Request Invalid DN Message Heap Overflow
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.28.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 28, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

IBM Lotus Domino Server software provides messaging, calendaring and
scheduling capabilities on a variety of operating systems. More information
about the product is available at the following URL.

http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/domino

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in the LDAP
component of
IBM Corp.'s Lotus Domino Server 7.0.1 may allow a remote attacker to cause
denial of service or execute arbitrary code.

When a malformed request is made to the LDAP component of a Lotus Domino
Enterprise Server, a heap overflow can be triggered. The vulnerability
specifically exists in the handling of strings larger than 65535 bytes. When
a string longer than this value is encountered, the service allocates memory
using only the lower 16-bits of the string length. Since the entire
string is
subsequently copied into the newly allocated buffer, a heap-overflow occurs.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to crash the LDAP
service
or potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected host.

In order to attempt exploitation, attackers must be able to connect to the
LDAP service.

Although the service does not run as root, it does run as the same user as
many other components of the Lotus Domino Server. Because of this an
attacker
may gain access to sensitive information or be able to maliciously
subvert the
server in other ways.

IV. DETECTION

This vulnerability has been confirmed to exist within versions 7.0.1 and
7.0.1.1 the Directory Service (LDAP) component of Lotus Domino Server.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

IBM Lotus has addressed this vulnerability in the 6.5.6 and 7.0.2 FP1
