**You mean my requests that you adhere to the contract I got you to agree to?
And upon breach my legitimate removal of copyrighted code?
>
> and then the best of all , the time you asked me for bots for your KR website
> scam that you couldnt keep quiet about
**You make it seem like common place that people would just randomly
ask you for
such things. I wonder what kind of people you associate with? HACK 4 LYFE.

**Actually I had Daniel start me off with some PHP code, he provided me with a
subscription system he used before, I adopted and extended it for
rainbowcrack-online. Which means I wrote the entire site, as the most recent
codebase stands the only thing left of his code is in _ipn.php

> YOU WANT SUMMIT IN THIS WORLD ... YOU GOTTA WORK FOR IT ,, NOT TRY TO
BLACKMAIL
> AFTER YOU SABOTAGE YOUR OWN CODE
**You mean post this to full disclosure and be completely transparent about the
whole thing? Also, storing my copyrighted code offsite because I didn't trust
you enough is not 'sabotage' it's called not being stupid. Without
being able to
get you to commit to anything concrete I firmly believe it was the right way to
do it. eval(decrypt(php code from db)) is really great.
