Subject: silc-server 1.0.2 denial-of-service vulnerability

Hi,

there is a bug in the current version of silc-server that makes it
possible to crash a networks SILC router or a standalone server, when a
new channel is created. All it takes is to specify an invalid hmac
algorithm name and no cipher algorithm name. This results in an null
pointer dereference in 'SILC_SERVER_CMD_FUNC(join)' at line 2444 in
apps/silcd/command.c.

To reproduce:

/connect yourserver
/join nonexistent -hmac nonexistent

The attached patch fixes the problem.

Best regards,
Frank Benkstein
