Synopsis
========

Two buffer overflows have been discovered in STLport possibly leading
to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

STLport is a multi-platform C++ Standard Library implementation.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/STLport       < 5.0.3                           >= 5.0.3

Description
===========

Two buffer overflows have been discovered, one in "print floats" and
one in the rope constructor.

Impact
======

Both of the buffer overflows could result in the remote execution of
arbitrary code. Please note that the exploitability of the
vulnerabilities depends on how the library is used by other software
programs.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All STLport users should upgrade to the latest version.

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/STLport-5.0.3"
