Subject: XSS and SQL Injection in Election Commision of
 India website (now fixed)

Election Commission of India website had XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities were reported on 2nd of March to ECI and on 4th March to CERT-IN, for the following URL:

http://search.eci.gov.in/maps/eci_se2007/detailResult.asp

The above script is used to display detailed results of a given constituency.

On 9th March 2007 Election Commission of India Fixed (disabled parts of) their website to avoid XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities after intervention of CERT-IN. 

Still a bit of usually harmless data insertion is possible.

Sincerely

Ajay Pal Singh Atwal
