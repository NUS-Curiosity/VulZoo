Synopsis
========

The AMD64 x86 emulation Qt library makes use of an insecure version of
the Qt library, potentially allowing for the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The AMD64 x86 emulation Qt library for AMD64 emulates the x86 (32-bit)
Qt library on the AMD64 (64-bit) architecture.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  emul-linux-x86-qtlibs       < 10.0                        >= 10.0

Description
===========

An integer overflow flaw has been found in the pixmap handling of Qt,
making the AMD64 x86 emulation Qt library vulnerable as well.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted pixmap image in an
application using the AMD64 x86 emulation Qt library, a remote attacker
could cause an application crash or the remote execution of arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All AMD64 x86 emulation Qt library users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-qtlibs-10.0"
