Since I only use Windows, let alone IE, at Work (where I'm
invariably issued a Windows laptop whether I like it or not), and
I'm too lazy to dig out the work laptop at the moment, I'm not
checking this now, but I recall pretty clearly that this is a
behavior that tinyurl.com OPENLY ADVERTISES as being a "feature" of
using that site with IE under Windows (and nowhere else, because
no other browser and OS security model permits such silliness).

It's a security problem, but it's not indicative of any particular
threat on their part.

(Really, if the original poster wanted to bitch about evil intentions
at tinyurl.com, the obfuscation of affiliate links is a much better
target...)
