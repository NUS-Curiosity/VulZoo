Synopsis
========

PostgreSQL contains two vulnerabilities that could result in a Denial
of Service or unauthorized access to certain information.

Background
==========

PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database management
system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/postgresql      < 8.0.11                         >= 8.0.11
                                                            *>= 7.4.16
                                                            *>= 7.3.13

Description
===========

PostgreSQL does not correctly check the data types of the SQL function
arguments under unspecified circumstances nor the format of the
provided tables in the query planner.

Impact
======

A remote authenticated attacker could send specially crafted queries to
the server that could result in a server crash and possibly the
unauthorized reading of some database content or arbitrary memory.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PostgreSQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-db/postgresql"

References
==========
