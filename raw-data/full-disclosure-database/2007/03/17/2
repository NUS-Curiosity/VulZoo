Subject: Call For Papers - IT Underground Dublin

Dear Specialists,

Call For Papers for IT Underground 2007 - Dublin edition is now open.

We kindly invite you as a speaker to our conference to come and share 
your experiences and insights about IT Security.
Prepare your BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) presentation or a lecture to 
pass your knowledge and skills to other IT Security Specialists from all over the world. 

This edition of IT Underground conference will be held on 20 - 22 June 2007 in DUBLIN.

Our goal is to create a truly international and high quality IT Security event, that will put 
its unique footprint on the roadmap of Europe. We want to penetrate new territories, 
both geographically (expecting delegates from all over the World ) and intellectually.

With each edition we're improving the formula and we'd be honoured if you'd like to 
become a part of this event.

What we can guarantee is an exceptional and friendly atmosphere both during the
conference and of course ... in the evenings after it :)

Hope to see you soon!

Please visit www.itunderground.org for details
