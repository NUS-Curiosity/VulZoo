Subject: Xbox live accounts are being stolen

There have been rumor going around that Bungie.net was hacked and  
that a portion of Xbox live has been taken over because of it. Some  
folks are having their Microsoft points stolen and or points  
purchased via their stolen gamer tag.

I just got off the phone with a Microsoft Tech for Xbox live that has  
confirmed this to with me and they have stated that accounts are  
being stolen and that "Hackers have control of Xbox live and there is  
nothing we can do about it"

If anyone else has experienced their Xbox live account info being  
stolen let me know. I am trying to archive as much info on this as  
possible. During the conversations I have had with Xbox live support  
I would certainly say that Microsoft  staff is more than negligent in  
dealing with this issue especially with regard to the potential theft  
of personal information.
