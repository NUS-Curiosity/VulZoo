I've seen phishtank.com disappear the same way Michael is describing. 
The next moment, DNS info was alright again. This was on a 
non-malware-infected *nix box, using 'host', using my ADSL-router's 
resolver which uses my ISPs DNS-servers.

When I query *.gtld-servers.net, the .com nameservers, I'm seeing 
auth{1-3}.opendns.com; not dns(2).parkpage.foundationapi.com as 
Michael's seeing.

Don't have a dig trace to show where false information was coming from, 
though.
