Subject: RainbowCrack-Online

Hello Full Disclosure,
John Harrison has cut off communication with me after breaking contract on
rainbowcrack-online (specifically neglecting to pay out, and to keep
financial records.) Other than that every source page there is copyrighted
me, and I've communicated my request to take down my intellectual property
(It was ignored.) I have copyright comments in every .php page, and in the
source of every rendered page. Also the underlying queuing system that runs
the whole thing is my IP as well, and that's being used illegitimately.

So know that in supporting rainbowcrack-online with your subscription money
you are supporting stolen intellectual property.

Believe me in me telling you that I've exhausted my resources in resolving
this issue, I've extended several communications to John all of which he has
ignored. There have been several occurrences when he's had an anger attack
and 'unplugged the cracking machines' and ignored me for several months.
Most recent he only talked to me when he needed updates to the code base, I
got him to 'agree' to a contract via e-mail, made the changes but received
no further communication or follow up from him. After bringing this point up
to him months later he simply blocked me from his MSN, his phone, and his
E-mail.

And John if you're reading this, I'm still open to talking.. I know the
current code base you're using isn't working properly, and you've had people
dropping subscriptions like flies, this could have been avoided by you not
screwing around on everyone involved.

I've been deeply involved in this project, and I'm really disappointed it's
ended this way. I guided the project, designing the website, the underlying
systems, did marketing, made deals, talked with government people, really
cool experience, and I'm sad to see it go this way.

I'm still working on projects, currently some Search Engine analytics
software, and typical freelance consultant jobs. (anyone want VoIP ish?)

If anyone wants a CV / Resume I've got one located here:

(it's missing a section on my current employer Ontario Lottery and Gaming
Corporation.)

Well out into the ether with this.

Regards,

Travis Biehn
