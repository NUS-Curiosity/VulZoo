 It would seem to me that MS / Bungie could simply cross reference
the "pretexed" accounts to the IP address logged in from, following the 
reporting
of a compromised account. If it is a rather small group perpetrating this, 
and
it appears to be, one would think investigators could track this fairly 
easily???

 XBOX Live accounts are purchased, and have monetary value.
 I am sure once word got out that these pretexters were being arrested for 
theft, incidents
would drop fairly rapidly...  PH34R T3H XB0X P0L1C3 !!!
