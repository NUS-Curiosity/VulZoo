Subject: Re: Xbox live accounts are being stolen

Here is someone on youtube with the same problem.... using a capture  
card to get the guy on video talking about it. He blatantly says he  
can steal any account on your xbox with just your IP address. One  
side of the conversation has been cut out but you can clearly hear  
the gentleman talking about stealing the account.
