Subject: nac-gaf spam attacks

Good Afternoon,
I'm seeing wide-spread spam attacks across several different shared hosting
servers, operated by multiple companies. The attacks forge emails on the
fly, and follow a pattern. The spam first takes the client's domain name,
for example, plastic.com. Then adds the word "nac" to the beginning, and
"gaf" to the end, making the from email address nacplasticgaf@...stic.com .
If the domain were rockin.com, the email would be nacrockingaf@...kin.com .
Byob.com, nacbyobgaf@...b.com, etc.

Has anyone else noticed this trend this afternoon? It seems they just
started a couple of hours ago. It doesn't seem like a security risk, just
standard forging of email headers. The main company I work for makes use of
SPF, however not every mail server on the internet makes use of it. I'm only
submitting this because it seems like a wide-spread issue this afternoon.

All the best,
Mike Bailey
