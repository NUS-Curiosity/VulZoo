Synopsis
========

ulogd contains a possible buffer overflow potentially allowing for the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ulogd is a userspace daemon for netfilter related logging.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/ulogd      < 1.23-r1                         >= 1.23-r1

Description
===========

SUSE reported unspecified buffer overflows in ulogd involving the
calculation of string lengths.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could trigger a possible buffer overflow through
unspecified vectors, potentially leading to the remote execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the ulogd daemon, or
more probably leading to the crash of the daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ulogd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/ulogd-1.23-r1"

==========
