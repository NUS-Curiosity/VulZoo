Subject: Web Security and Bookmarklet Exploits

http://www.gnucitizen.org/projects/technika/

I have rolled out a new Technika browser extension. It is very small
and extremely fast. Technika also integrates with Firebug, so you can
easily test and compose Bookmarklets on the fly. The article that I
pointed above discusses how Bookmarklets can be used to compose web
app exploits. There is a framework similar to metasploit that will
come out very soon. I thought that it might be a good idea to share
these ideas now, so the community knows what to expect in the future.
Thanks.
