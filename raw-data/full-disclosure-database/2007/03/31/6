	Forgeries [ASP.NET crowd]

Nice article.  

For the ASP.NET crowd out there, the will be even more simple, one line of
code.  Set the ViewStateUserKey property in your base class or page and the
unique token protections (similar to CSRF_Guard) will be provided for you.

.aspx

This protection mechanism has been available for many years, since the
Framework 1.1

I briefly covered how simple it is to prevent CSRF attacks. Hope that you
find it useful.
