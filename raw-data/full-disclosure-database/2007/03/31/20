Synopsis
========

CUPS incorrectly handles partially-negotiated SSL connections allowing
for a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX-based operating
systems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-print/cups       < 1.2.9                             >= 1.2.9

Description
===========

CUPS does not properly handle partially-negotiated SSL connections.
Upon receiving a partially-negotiated SSL connection, CUPS no longer
accepts further incoming connections, as the initial connection never
times out.

Impact
======

An attacker could partially negotiate an SSL connection with a CUPS
server, and cause future connections to that server to fail, resulting
in a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.2.9"
