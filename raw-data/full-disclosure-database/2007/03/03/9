Hi,

I'm currently coming across a lot of PostScript documents. And I realize
that most people consider them as "pictures" and thus plainly open them.
This is why I thought about testing it's security and possibly creating
some PoC to raise awareness.

During my research I found that PostScript has the possibility to open
and manipulate files. Now that's a good start. :)
Also this project here proves that it must somehow be possible to "bind"
to a port: http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/pshttpd/
(Still researching this one...)

However google hasn't been particularly helpful when it came to the
following questions:
1) Has anybody researched this before (no need to crash open doors)
2) Is PostScript capable of using the system()-call or something similar?

Does anybody know about this?

Thanks in advance
Paul
