Synopsis
========

Several vulnerabilities exist in the Mozilla Suite, which is no longer
supported by the Mozilla project.

Background
==========

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that includes a
mail and news reader.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla          <= 1.7.13                 Vulnerable!
  2  www-client/mozilla-bin      <= 1.7.13                 Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Several vulnerabilities ranging from code execution with elevated
privileges to information leaks affect the Mozilla Suite.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to browse to a specially crafted
website or open a specially crafted mail that could trigger some of the
vulnerabilities, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary code,
denials of service, information leaks, or cross-site scripting attacks
leading to the robbery of cookies of authentication credentials.

Workaround
==========

Most of the issues, but not all of them, can be prevented by disabling
the HTML rendering in the mail client and JavaScript on every
application.

Resolution
==========

The Mozilla Suite is no longer supported and has been masked after some
necessary changes on all the other ebuilds which used to depend on it.
Mozilla Suite users should unmerge www-client/mozilla or
www-client/mozilla-bin, and switch to a supported product, like
SeaMonkey, Thunderbird or Firefox.

    
    # emerge --unmerge "www-client/mozilla"
    
    # emerge --unmerge "www-client/mozilla-bin"
