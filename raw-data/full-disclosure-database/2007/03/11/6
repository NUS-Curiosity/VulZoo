Paul, if you find a way to get something to execute an eval() with data that
you control, and all you can get out of that is an information disclosure,
you *really* need to find a new line of work.

Yeah, a 404 page controlled by the server might just be too chatty and give
away info - but if you can control the input that creates the 404 page, it
gets more interesting...
