Hey Andrew :)

Corrected the blog entry, Thanks for your email...

Also added "jf at danglingpointers dot net" ... since he was the first to reply.

I hope this is just a bug, probably something that could cause minimal damage and not a vulnerability.

Cheers :)

First of all, that's a variable, not a function. Creating a function  
called "wgBreakFrames" wouldn't execute the function.

Second of all, I'm not really sure how that could be "used  
maliciously". If you're able to inject Javascript into the window  
context, you can already do whatever you like to the user's browser.  
So I'm not quite sure how this is supposed to "cause potential damage  
to the site".



Remember there is alwayz someone who knows more than us out there
