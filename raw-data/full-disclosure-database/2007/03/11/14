In addition, you get money in the Internet by the surfing at activated view beard. 100% of the profit are distributed to the members by AGLOCOT because. The one who further builds up the community can in addition earn more: because you recommend AGLOCOT per more persons, you can make a the higher profit. This comes that not only your online hours but also that one of your recommendations be collected on your account. And just as also the hours of the recommendations of your recommendations up to the 5th level! This will be a strong drive for this to extend the member number very fast for certain.

Thema: Re: [Full-disclosure] Is OWASP vulnerable ??


Sorry, I didn't mention this in my original reply, if you type the
variable name into google you'll get several hits from the wiki software
they use, appearantly it used to be considered a security hole by the
authors of the software if the wiki was embedded in another frame, so
thats what that check was, however anymore it is disabled by default, and
web app authors being what they are, disabled most likely means they
commented out the declaration.
