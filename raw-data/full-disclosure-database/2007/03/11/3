Subject: Re: Is OWASP vulnerable ??

Sorry, I didn't mention this in my original reply, if you type the
variable name into google you'll get several hits from the wiki software
they use, appearantly it used to be considered a security hole by the
authors of the software if the wiki was embedded in another frame, so
thats what that check was, however anymore it is disabled by default, and
web app authors being what they are, disabled most likely means they
commented out the declaration.
