holy %&$@Â£%!# you're right:

D:\WINDOWS\security\templates>more "setup security.inf" | findstr /r /i 
"\<temp\>"
"d:\windows\temp", 2, 
"D:P(A;CI;0x100026;;;BU)(A;CIOI;GRGWGXSD;;;PU)(A;CIOI;GA;;;BA)(A;CIOI;GA;;;SY)
(A;CIOI;GA;;;CO)"

Where "(A;CI;0x100026;;;BU)" =
    A = access allowed
    CI = container and items (subfolders and files), this folder only
    0x100026 = SYNCHRONIZE, traverse, create files, create subfolders
    BU = BUILTIN\Users

/revokes
/plans to eventually make a custom security policy .inf
