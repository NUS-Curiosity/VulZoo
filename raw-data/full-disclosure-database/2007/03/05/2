Subject: Hakin9 Magazine - Request for Article

 Hi All,

To keep this email short. The next issue of Hakin9 study kit is on
"Exploits, rootkits, exploit writing, buffer overflow, and so on". The issue
after that is on "Intrusion Defense".

Website: www.hakin9.org/en

Please do shoot me an email at shyaam<at>evilfingers<dot> com. I work as an
Editor and my duty this time is to collect papers for these issues and
enumerate the content based on the goodness factor which is determined by
the Hakin9 scale.

Thank you for your patience and great to have your contribution.
Kind Regards,
Shyaam
