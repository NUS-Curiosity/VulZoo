Subject: Re: An Auction Site for Vulnerabilities

Yes, Fakhar has put it best in English so far. 

As a sidenote, WabiSabi seems to have removed my account from their 
system already for unknown reasons. However, included inline is a 
simple exploit for one of the few bugs they are making available 
for currency exchange. I think you will find it trivial to find and 
exploit most (all?) of their other bugs, even those that aren't 
publicly documented ;)

Linux Torvalds documented this particular bug here:

http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8134

The following program can be used to hack 4 bytes out of kernel 
memory. Put it in a loop to dump all of the kernel. If you use an 
insecure program that hasn't been reviewed by the OpenBsD Secure 
Shell team, you might find unscrubbed passwords in there.

I encourage everyone to research and release exploits for every bug 
on the auction block. Remember: it is only consistent with REAL 
hacker ethics to sell bugs to terrorists, NAMBLA, and similar 
organizations such as GOBBLES/n3td3v.
