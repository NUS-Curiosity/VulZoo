I agree on most of these points.It seems that researchers don't get back

what they put in.


At the same time,you can't expect to get rich off finding exploits,either.

The security industry,as a whole,needs to get on the bandwagon of how
far the envelope needs to be pushed in this direction.
Who,what,where and how, the found vulnerabilities are reported  needs to
be defined in some definite way.

ROFL,I can't believe I said that with a straight face!!?

But seriously.I would not sell any vuln I have found--as far as looking
to make it a full time job--to someone else,simply because they might
make a name for themselves using my work.

Anonymous works well for me,at this time anyway.
