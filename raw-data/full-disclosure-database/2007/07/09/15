Subject: Re: An Auction Site for Vulnerabilities

>>From their FAQ (http://www.wslabi.com/wabisabilabi/faq.do?):
"Q: Can everybody purchase vulnerabilities from the market place?
A: No, all purchasers will be carefully evaluated before granting them
access to the market platform to minimize the risk of selling the
right stuff to the wrong people."

I am very curious as to how they are going to enforce this

We have just recently seen what was possibly the start of an era of
cyber-war between nations (yes, the Estonia case, but we might never
know for sure).
How will WSLabi decide who is right and who is wrong? It is without a
doubt that many nations are building up considerable CNO-resources,
and unpublished vulns. might certainly prove a lethal arsenal.
I have no doubt that the players on the international arena will
sabotage their enemies and/or opponents in their pursuit of security,
freedom, power or whatever. And it might have dire consequences for
innocent civilians...

What I'm saying is: Don't try to be so fancy about the whole ethical
and moral thing when we all know it won't work (this time either).
