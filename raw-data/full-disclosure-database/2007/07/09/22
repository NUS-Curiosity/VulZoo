Subject: XWW - Cross webmail Worm - PoC

Hi,

I realized a PoC of what I define a XWW - Cross webmail worm, based on
exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities.

For the PoC I've tested the worm code on 4 popular Italian webmails:

o    Libero.it

o    Tiscali.it

o    Lycos.it

o    Excite.com

Detailed informations and a video can be found at:
