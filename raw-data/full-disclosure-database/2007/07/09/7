Well... I believe that ppl do know vulns, that are not discussed/discovered by 
tech companies or open forums, and they use it for their personal gains.  
Its just a matter of single transaction that needs to be happen and it'll spread 
like a wild fire.

cheers

I wonder how long it's going to be untill someone finds a vuln in that site then tries to auction it off.
