Subject: Nordic countries censor Pirate Bay off the net...

Yep, now officials have confirmed that they will censor Pirate Bay off 
the net. They have already added it to "black list" of "child porn" and 
ISP will update their filters to include it in just few days... Then we 
wont be able to reach Pirate Bay anymore.

This is what they call free speech & free internet & democracy.

Now the censorship has started. Its only a question what is to be 
censored next and who decides that. The road that we have taken is 
terrible. Child porn is terrible, but violating free speech with 
censorship is much more terrible. Especially as in this case, this has 
nothing to do with child porn whatsoever. Its just pure censorship.

Atleast we can complain to our ISP:s and demand compensations or lifting 
of the ban. The day our goverment would do something like this is the 
day I would grap a gun and use it to protect my (and other peoples) 
freedom. Yes, go ahead and tell Suojelupoliisi that. EVVK.
