thank you? okay - thank you for creating this wonderful software
that we use. thank you for listening to our defect requests and
thank you for addressing them in a meaningful time frame. but thank
you for finding bugs? are you on drugs?

they didnt ask you to look for defects. this sounds like those
people who paint house numbers on your curb and then want to be
paid even through you never said to paint the numbers. or those
windshield washers who want you to pay them for smearing your
window when you didnt ask for it. the only people who should be
paid to find vulnerabilities are the people asked to find
vulnerabilities.

should we pay burglars for breaking into our homes? and what about
open source projects? should nonprofit groups be forced to pay for
defects that they never asked people to look for? if they dont pay
then should we stop looking?

companies that pay for exploits are honest about it. zdi and vcp
let their customers know about risks before the rest of the world.
the bounty comes from their customer registration fees. customers
pay to hear about exploits first.
