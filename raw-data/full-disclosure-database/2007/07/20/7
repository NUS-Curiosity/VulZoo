Subject: David Maynor/LMH/Infosecsellout

I was at Das Bunker with David Maynor one night, and he told me how he aided a push to have Randi Harper (aka sektie/sekt0rgrl) fired from her job because she gave him bad head in a burger king bathroom. He didn't finish and she never paid him back for the meth he gave her to get the beej. I found out later he also told that story to at least two other people.

Later I heard him praise the efforts of PHC repeatedly, lambasting the security industry for being snake oil salesmen. Clearly the rhetoric of LMH is not as skillfully spun as former PHC texts. It seems awkward in an unusual way, as if it were were written by someone intentionally trying to not read like their standard writing style.

Regardless of whether he is LMH or not, Maynor has exactly the same personality archetype as LMH: disrespectful, arrogant and hateful. He has repeatedly supported non-disclosure and irresponsible disclosure and has an admiration for the former movement (my sneering and bitter sarcasm here cannot be adequately conveyed in text) of the PHC.
