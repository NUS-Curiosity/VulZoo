Ummmmm -- what part of "address bar spoofing" did you not understand?

_IF_ the URL spoofing part of a URL spoofing vulnerability in one 
browser does not work in another browser, then that other browser is 
clearly NOT vulnerable to the first browser's URL spoofing 
vulnerability.

The issue Robert reported is NOT that Opera and Konqueror parse the 
data: protocol, BUT that cunning use of a data: protocol URL can be 
used to fool the user to think they're somewhere other than they are.

As you so clearly -- and accurately -- say yourself, the URL spoofing 
part of this does not work in FF, so we should give a rat's arse that 
FF handles data: protocol URLs why?
