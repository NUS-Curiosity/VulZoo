Subject: Re: Opera/Konqueror: data: URL scheme address bar
	spoofing

Hi Robert, it works for me on Opera 9.21 (8776) WXP SP2.
I was trying to do the same with firefox and it seems to works too..
but you get the "data:text/html" on the beginning of the URL.

here you have a PoC for FF, it works on a 2.0.0.4 version
