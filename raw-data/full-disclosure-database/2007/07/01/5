Possibly because I am a paranoid phreak who thinks security is a way to
get around this problem?

Or just maybe I should have added...or just down for maintenance?...to
my original post.That way smart asses like yourself wouldn't need to

Sorry to waste your time so you could waste more time by replying in

Ooops.There's my Xanax.I knew I needed it!

Bad day.Sorry for the rant.^~^
