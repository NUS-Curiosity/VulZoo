The problem is that she wants the money upfront, in order to develop the 100% undetectable thing that she doesn't have right now.  So that's a problem.

Joanna has stated her technical requirements for the challenge and Thom and group has accepted them, so why not turn this into what it really is... a bet.

The losing team agrees to pay the other $350,000 - if both groups are really so confident there shouldn't be any issue.
