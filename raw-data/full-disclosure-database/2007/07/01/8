Subject: How to compromise a Microosft site using SQL
	injection



http://www.zone-h.org/content/view/14780/31/



Has the explanation, and a place to upload the HOW-TO video (with test

explanation) from the hacker, http://www.unbase.com/n/5725974396





Better than any class I have taken on Web application security.  It is nice to know that SQL Server 2005 has its issues just like every other database server.



BTW, The hacker has a hotmail address in the HOW-TO video for you to contact him :)
