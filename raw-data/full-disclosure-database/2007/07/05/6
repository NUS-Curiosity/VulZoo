You may want to email Jason Coombs (the guy who keeps posting to lists 
such as FD that he "wont have anything further to do with computer 
forensics" and then works yet another case.  Yea, I think he's nuts, 
but...). 

Jason was actively working on a project similar enough to this that it 
could be interchangeable (using his Piv-x botnet of course).

"The real point is that you cannot harbor malice toward others and then
cry foul when someone displays intolerance against you. Prejudice
tolerated is intolerance encouraged. Rise up in righteousness when you
witness the words and deeds of hate, but only if you are willing to rise
up against them all, including your own. Otherwise suffer the slings and
arrows of disrespect silently."

Harvey Fierstein is an actor and playwright.
