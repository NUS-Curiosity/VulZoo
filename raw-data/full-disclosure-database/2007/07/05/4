Stop trying to make a name for yourself n3td3v - you can't hack, 3 years and
zero zero-days dropped, by this alone you clearly you have no association
with phrack or gobbles or any other turkey based products, free-range or
otherwise, stick to your newsgroup and post about retarded yahoo employees
and how your a high profile r4xx0r, in your own head. Nab.
