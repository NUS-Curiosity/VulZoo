Subject: Does this exist ?


I have an idea that won't leave me alone and this list seems to have  
the most potential for knowing if the idea exists. My apologies for a  
somewhat offtopic post.

Would there be a way to create a  rainbow table of tcp packets to be  
used to generate one packet for every 1000 or so normal packets simply  
by matching hashes with databases on both ends ?

One could use this for crypto or simply traffic reduction over latent  
networks such as satellites.
