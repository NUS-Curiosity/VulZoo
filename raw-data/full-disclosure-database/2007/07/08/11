Vulnerability research is good. Getting paid for research is good. Holding
vendors accountable is good.

Yet, secretly trading intellectual property, keeping it under wraps for
months or years to maximize buyer's ROI, and not giving a second thought
as to why would a shady foreigner pay $50,000 for an _exploit_ they have
no legitimate use for, pretty much stands against *all* the core values of
the hacker culture - a culture to which this field of research owes quite
a bit.

Yeah, it can be done. It might be legal by itself, too - though I'm sure
the moment your code is used for malicious purposes (or simply against
your government), if it can be shown you willfully ignored the clearly
dubious nature of the transaction, a charge of being accessory to crime
won't be far off.

Still, legal or not, it's not exactly something to be too proud of on this
list.
