Given the number of highly regarded people who have had legal threats against
them already (the DMCA actions against Ed Felton, Cisco against Michael Swan,
and a number of BlackHat and similar presentations that have been withdrawn
after legal threats), It's likely that "a matter of time" is "sooner" rather
than "later", and people should include that in their 0day release planning...
