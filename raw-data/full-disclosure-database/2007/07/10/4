In a way a larger company (beyond idefense/tippingpoint) getting involved will be to our advantage. 
There hasn't been a high profile lawsuit against a vuln researcher for finding and selling an 0day
at this point (that I can think of) and it's only a matter of time before it happens. A company with a closed 
source product can claim EULA agreement violations as well as IP violations. While they may not 
win the lawsuit they will punish you with lawyer fee's potentially bankrupting you and I'd rather not 
be the one to test the theory.

By working with an established company as a researcher you may be offered some sort of legal protection 
provided by the terms of the agreement with the company you're selling it to, if said vulnerable company came 
after you.
