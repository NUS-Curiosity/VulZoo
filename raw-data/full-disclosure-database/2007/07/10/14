 libodm ODMPATH Stack Overflow Vulnerability

IBM AIX libodm ODMPATH Stack Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.09.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 09, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

AIX applications use libodm to access system settings and device
configuration data stored in the Object Database Manager. The Manager
is responsible for accessing and updating such things as currently
installed software packages and devices. Many of the applications that
use libodm are installed set-uid root.

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in IBM Corp.'s AIX
libodm library could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a
targeted host.

The vulnerability exists in the processing of the ODMPATH environment
variable within the odm_searchpath() function. This function reads the
ODMPATH variable from the user provided environment, and then copies it
into a fixed sized stack buffer without properly validating its length.
This results in a stack-based buffer overflow, and allows the saved
return address to be overwritten.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute code with root privileges.

Since this is a local attack, an attacker has complete control over the
process environment and can reliably place shellcode at known
addresses. This makes exploitation of this vulnerability trivial.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in AIX
version 5.3 SP 4. Previous versions may be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
