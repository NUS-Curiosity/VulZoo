Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 07.12.07: Red Hat
 Enterprise Linux init.d XFS Script chown Race Condition Vulnerability

Red Hat Enterprise Linux init.d XFS Script chown Race Condition
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.12.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 12, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

XFS is the X Font Server, and is used to render fonts for the X Window
System. "init.d" refers to the startup and shutdown scripts used by
Linux distributions. These scripts are run by the init process to start
and stop various system services.

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a race condition vulnerability in Red Hat Inc.'s
Enterprise Linux init.d XFS script allows an attacker to elevate their
privileges to root.

The XFS script is vulnerable to a race condition when it is started by
init, or by a system administrator. Specifically, it insecurely changes
the file permissions of a temporary file. This allows an attacker to
make any file on the system world writable.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in an attacker gaining root
privileges on the affected system.

However, in order to exploit this, it is necessary for either the system
to be rebooted, or for the administrator to manually restart the XFS.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux version 4, and Fedora Core 6. Other versions may also
be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
