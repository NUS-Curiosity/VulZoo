Subject: Re: Does this exist ?

Others have pointed out a database would work for common packets and  
yet others have pointed out much beyond that scope the idea is not  
feasible.

I have another question. Would moving the TCP stack to base 32 double  
traffic ?

We have enough alphanumeric characters to do so. Perhaps a designation  
of 1x000 instead of 0x000 to define the difference in base 32 to base  
16 respectively.

Or am I missing something you uber math types can explain to me.
