Umm.. That doesn't actually work.  For instance - in binary, one of the
addresses of this laptop is 128.173.14.107. First, let's look at it
in binary:

1000 0000 1010 1101 0000 1101 0011 1011

Representing that in base 16, you get 80 AD 0E 6B.  Representing it in
base 32 is still going to get you that same exact sequence of 32 bits on
the wire.

You may wish to read RFC791, especially section 3.1, which goes into great
detail about the on-the-wire format of the bits.
