Subject: Re: Best wireless card for packet capturing?

Thanks for the input.  I'm not just starting out on capturing packets or
anything -- after all, I'm doing research and writing about something very
related -- it's just that in a Windows environment I know very little
about how to do things.  I'm a Linux guy when it comes to this kind of
activity and I know that it's typically very difficult to do things
"right" as far as security testing goes in a Windows environment. 
Unfortunately, given the circumstances of the research, I am only able to
use a Windows-based laptop, but I've now found (thanks to a contributer to
the list) a live CD which will help with get into a Linux environment to
do the work.

Thanks again to you and the others for your input.
