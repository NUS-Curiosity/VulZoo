you'll want to get a copy of Airpcap drivers for win32.

atheros or prism2 cards are my preference.  ideally you should use
multiple cards for best performance (built-in + 1 or 2 pccard?).
remember that channel hopping affects capture, so locking on chan of
interest is preferable to constantly hopping.
