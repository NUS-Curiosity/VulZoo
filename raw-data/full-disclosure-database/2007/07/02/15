Subject: Re: Best wireless card for packet capturing?

I think it was more as a statement regarding the maturity of security tools
on each platform.  for instance, for wireless, linux has far more tools, and
a wider variety, for that work, than windows, and the tools have fewer
limitations... and that's an opinion from an mcse+i/mcdba/mcse:security.

so more often than not, for research/security work: linux good/windows bad.
not as a statement regarding which platform is better in general, or more
secure, etc.  just simply from the vantage point of needed to do security
work.
