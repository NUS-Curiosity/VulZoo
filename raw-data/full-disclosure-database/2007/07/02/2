Would that allow you to selectively redirect keystrokes (that is, check
event's keycode)? More importantly, does Carl's original example allow
that?:-)

An example of event check logic is implemented in my original POC; if you
can't redirect selectively (that is, prevent certain events from being
delivered to INPUT TYPE=FILE field), the flaw is much less severe.

(Would check that, but am at work).
