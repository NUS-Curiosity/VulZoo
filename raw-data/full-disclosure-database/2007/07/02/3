Subject: Re: Google/Orkut Authentication Issue PoC

It has been more than 36 hours and we have logged out
of the account at least 10 times. The POC still works
and my account can still be hijacked.

This proves the Net-Square report - "Google has fixed
this problem on their side. session cookies are now
set to expire within 24 hours from the server side, as
opposed to two weeks." - to be wrong.

Moreover expiry within 24 hours is not a fix. expiry
of session in 24 hours + expiry of session on logout +
disabling the session on lockout is a fix.
