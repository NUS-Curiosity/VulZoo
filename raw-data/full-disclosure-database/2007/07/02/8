Subject: Best wireless card for packet capturing?

Heya,

For some research I'm doing I need to capture packets using my laptop in a
public space.  What is the best wireless card for doing so which will work
with most of the packet capturing software on Windows, such as Ethereal?

Thanks in advance for the help.

-Josh
