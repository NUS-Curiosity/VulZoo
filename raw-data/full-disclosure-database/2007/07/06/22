Yes Sir,

I also believe there is a point we will hit in data transmission that  
will surpass this limitation. I do not have the time to "grok" the  
math to disprove or prove what I believe at this time but perhaps  
knowing the math would be a limitation in creativity. There has to be  
a way to reduce transmissions based on patterns similar to my  
understanding of how DNA functions.

What happens when quantum processors are in daily use ? What will that  
do this idea ?

In any event thank you all for the thoughts and corrections. I will  
take the information received and study for a bit.

Again the apology for off topic postings.
