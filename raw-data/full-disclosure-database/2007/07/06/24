Ya know, I don't think he does get that part yet.

This scheme is essentially how data compression already works.  Not in
gigantic swaths of bits, as being proposed here, but in smalish numbers a
few bits represents a bigger set of bits.  Huffman coding is a basic
example.

The infeasability of this idea is all about the data size.  As someone
already pointed out 2^4000 is not 16,000,000 (that's 4000^2).  2^4,000 is
large enough to just call it infinite and be done with it.

For comparison, there's something like 2^100 to 2^130 or so atoms in the
known universe.  The hardware you'd need to implement a database of that
size would require more matter than exists.  Period.

This idea is only interesting if it works at the scale proposed.  It
doesn't.  On a smaller scale, this is how data compression is already done.
