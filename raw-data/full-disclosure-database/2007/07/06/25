Subject: EXPLOITS FOR SALE (AUCTION SITE)

It didn't take long for the middleman to try to cash in on exploits.  This site is selling or trying to sell zero-day and other exploits to anyone willing to pay.  However, they are just a FRONT company, a middleman of sorts.  Why in the hell would anyone use a middleman if they are trying to get top $$$$ for their hack. I DO NOT agree with selling any exploit and I definitely believe this is stupid.   But I am sure their are some dumb asses out that will use them.
