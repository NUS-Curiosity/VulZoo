Subject: Re: EXPLOITS FOR SALE (AUCTION SITE)

Well, 
    Having read what you write, IÂ¹d also question the ethics behind such a
business. If you sell your exploits through that site you do not know who
will end up buying the exploits. There is no promise that the exploits will
end up in good hands.
