Subject: Attacking Password Recovery Facilities

http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/attacking-password-recovery-facilities

this is a small article from ap (aka pagvac) on how to attack password
recovery facilities. this post just briefly scratches the surface and
I am sure that he will come up with more stuff in the near future.
Nevertheless, he brought some interesting points. Hava a look. Cheers.
