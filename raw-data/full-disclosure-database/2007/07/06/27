Do you agree that you are often spoon fed free information by  
individuals that are not paid for providing you a service?

Is it so bad that some of these nice people would ask for a little  
compensation here and there?

Do you agree with the fact that some of the vendors that you have  
purchased software from would like to lead you to believe that their  
products are secure when in reality they are not?

Is it safe to assume that you agree with selling of flawed software?
