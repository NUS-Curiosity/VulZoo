Subject: kismet wireless sniffer: OSX x86 Airport Extreme
	Atheros5424 capture source.

This is a heads up email to let you know that Kismet wireless sniffer  
once again compiles on OSX machines and is now able to sniff on some  
Airport Extreme enabled macs.

I have tested multiple intel based Macs and all seemed well short of  
the fact that the OSX wifi driver is not feeding us data packets (if  
you know how to fix that let me know!).

3 x86 Macbook pros
1 x86 Mac Mini
2 x86 Macbooks

All of the above Macs came with one of the following wireless cards:
Wireless Card Type:   AirPort Extreme  (0x168C, 0x87)
Wireless Card Type:   AirPort Extreme  (0x168C, 0x86)

Fire up svn and enjoy!

Thanks
-KF
