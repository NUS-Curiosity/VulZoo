yeah, and by the time you reach 50 yrs. old just think! you can have
headaches all the time, you hobble around on busted knees, eat lots of pain
killers, and your whole existence is centered around trying to look &
function like a normal person... groovy.

Yes earnest question indeed, one that is easily answered by using Google.

""I'd love to be a dentist or a chiropractor with either of them sitting in
a chair at my office."" 

  Oh and being a sadomasochistic lurker on E-Mail lists is acceptable?

I'm not sure I agree with Jared.  I think you might find Stack's suggestions
especially satisfying - be a dentist or a chiropracter! 

I mean, just think of all the creative ways you could deal with
condescending, arrogant jerks who are incapable of helping someone with an
earnest question? 

I'd love to be a dentist or a chiropractor with either of them sitting in a
chair at my office. 

Good times indeed.
