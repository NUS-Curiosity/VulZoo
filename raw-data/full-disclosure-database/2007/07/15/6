Subject: The new dawn of filter evasion

http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/the-new-dawn-of-filter-evasion

.mario (http://www.gnucitizen.org/about/mario) has posted quite cool
overview on filter evasion practices. Here is the excerpt :

"""This article is about the most important phase when attacking a web
application. The phase when the markup has just been broken and the
attacker will try to inject his own markup, script code or other data
- let's call it the PMBP (post-markup-breaking-phase). This phase is
mostly possible to occur when quotes aren't correctly sanitized or
when input is placed between two tags. In this article we will set the
focus on the first variant - the attribute injection. And we will
prove that protecting your markup from being broke is the very most
important task in client side security."""

he goes further and dissects the process into the following sections:

* Basic filtering
* Get it running
* Circumvent the ignorance
* CSO's nightmare

very interesting!
