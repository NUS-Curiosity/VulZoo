Sorry but Verisign plainly sucks. I found some problems in their system
when tried to get vertificates for web server. After I reported issue to
them I get continuous spam from them trying to sell their services to
me.

To reproduce those problems with their site you can issue certificate
request with empy Common Name (CN) for example. It crashes Verisign
scripts.
