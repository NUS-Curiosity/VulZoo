Dave / LMH / whatever,

Give up.

You really don't get it, do you?

Rouland, Ptacek, hdm, myself - we're all out to get you.
Infosecsellout is a collaborative effort to drive you insane.

Aitel even wrote that script just to make you more paranoid.

If anyone actually cares that you used two identities online I'll
really be surprised.  So did my grandma.

Is this some kind of story?  A confession?  A bug report?  Your whole
paragraph about SILC leads nowhere - it doesn't make any sense.

Ptacek, hdm, myself, et al - we all know who Infosecsellout is.  Not
because we wrote clever scripts that do user fingerprinting via
behavorial statistical analysis.  Think of it more like hearing the
voice of an old friend call you on the phone.  Someone you haven't
heard from in awhile.  Easy to identify, correct?

Wait, why am I asking you? - that's probably never going to happen to you.
