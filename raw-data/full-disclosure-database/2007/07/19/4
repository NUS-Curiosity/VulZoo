I think this is common for all unlocked phones.  That is why phone companies
in the US and in some part European providers get you lock into contracts
for so long.  If you don't what this built in code I would suggest that you
buy an unlocked phone or hack it.

TMobile uses this type of 'technology' in the sidekick and other phones 
to sync the phone with a web service so if/when you change phones you 
have the same content on the phone, without having to sync it to a PC or 
whatever.  I figured some other providers would do the same thing.  Is 
this actually shocking to anyone?
