But what does Dr. Neal Krawetz have to say? I will not draw any 
conclusions until he has the time to analyze the writing samples. 
As Neal has taught us, the students of Full Disclosure, there is no 
validation required for online impersonation [1]. How do we know 
you are not impersonating this David Maynor character?

More importantly, and of equal relevance to this list (these 
lists?), how can we be sure you aren't n3td3v? Or GOBBLES? Or both?
