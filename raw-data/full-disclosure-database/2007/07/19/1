TMobile uses this type of 'technology' in the sidekick and other phones 
to sync the phone with a web service so if/when you change phones you 
have the same content on the phone, without having to sync it to a PC or 
whatever.  I figured some other providers would do the same thing.  Is 
this actually shocking to anyone?
