Guess the proof will be if the "real" David doesn't complain or refute these claims.

Subject: RE: [Full-disclosure] [fuzzing] The truth

Well "David", you clearly have not followed the life and times of 
the Doctor. The Great Doctor (I am not referring to myself here) 
has also been impersonated by hackers who cleverly used PGP to fool 
the masses. I talked to Neal about this and he has told me he 
suspects PGP has been cracked. 

So yes, PGP is good, but the only real evidence one can provide as 
proof of identity are pictures of his or her own butt as Jarod 
DeMott has previously offered up on this list.

So "David", wheres the REAL proof?
