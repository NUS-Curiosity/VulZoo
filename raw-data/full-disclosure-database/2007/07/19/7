 blocking IRC and hijacking DNS entries

I understand there is currently a serious botnet attack that seems to
generate approximately 600 megabits/sec of ICMP traffic, and is being
used against those three ISPs specifically.  Perhaps they are attempting
to get a handle on it?

cox internet in my area (Oklahoma) is not doing any such blocking.
