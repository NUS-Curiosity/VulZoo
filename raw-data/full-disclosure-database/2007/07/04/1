   conference to be discussed.

   The PacSec meeting provides an opportunity for foreign
   specialists to be exposed to Japanese innovation and markets

   issues. In a relaxed setting with a mixture of material
   bilingually translated in both English and Japanese the eminent
   technologists can socialize and attend training sessions.

   Announcing the opportunity to submit papers for the PacSec 2007
   network security training conference. The conference will be
   held November 29-30th in Tokyo. The conference focuses on
   emerging information security tutorials - it will be a bridge
   between the international and Japanese information security
   technology communities..

   Please make your paper proposal submissions before July 27th,
   2007. Slides for the papers must be submitted by October 1st
   2007. The conference is November 29th and 30th 2007, presenters
   need to be available in the days before to meet with
   interpreters.

   A some invited papers have been confirmed, but a limited number
   of speaking slots are still available. The conference is
   responsible for travel and accomodations for the speakers. If
   you have a proposal for a tutorial session then please email a
   synopsis of the material and your biography, papers and,
   speaking background to secwest07 [at] pacsec.jp . Tutorials are
   one hour in length, but with simultaneous translation should be

   The PacSec conference consists of tutorials on technical
   details about current issues, innovative techniques and best
   practices in the information security realm. The audiences are
   a multi-national mix of professionals involved on a daily basis
   with security work: security product vendors, programmers,
   security officers, and network administrators. We give
   preference to technical details and education for a technical
   audience.

   The conference itself is a single track series of presentations
   in a lecture theater environment. The presentations offer
   speakers the opportunity to showcase on-going research and
   collaborate with peers while educating and highlighting
   advancements in security products and techniques. The focus is
   on innovation, tutorials, and education instead of product
   pitches. Some commercial content is tolerated, but it needs to
   be backed up by a technical presenter - either giving a
   valuable tutorial and best practices instruction or detailing
   significant new technology in the products.

   Paper proposals should consist of the following information:

   1) Presenter, and geographical location (country of
   origin/passport) and contact info (e-mail, postal address,
   phone, fax).
