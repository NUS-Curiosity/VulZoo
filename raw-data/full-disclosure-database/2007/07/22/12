Dear Aditya K Sood,

Can you just please stop posting shit on Full Disclosure?
Honestly I'm sick of reading your advisories for "vulnerabilities" (such
the orkut ones posted in the past and url redirection bugs).
It's too sad some people, in special from third world countries, want to
 make their way into the security industry like this, with fake claims
and bullshit.

Unfortunately The Black And The White Ball conference was cancelled
because I was seriously thinking about the possibility of buying a
ticket to London just to rip off your face.

PS: You and Ankit Fadia belong to the same trash can.
