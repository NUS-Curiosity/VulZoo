Reply from the developer of JWIG regarding "Hack Annotations in JWIG" by secniche.org


Hi Pranay (cc to "SecNiche"),

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I have now read this document "Hack Annotations in JWIG", and I must admit that I have never seen so
much bogus in so few pages ever before. Is this a (bad) joke?? It seems that the author Aditya K Sood (a.k.a. Bubba Gump?) has completely
misunderstood the processing model of web communication in general and JWIG in particular. JWIG is a research project exploring new ways of
programming web applications. JWIG programs run on the server, and the JWIG system obviously does not by itself provide any means for attackers to
control which code is being executed on the server. This means that all the example "attacks" described in this report seem to assume that the
attacker is the service programmer, which clearly doesn't make much sense.
I hope that anyone reading a report like "Hack Annotations in JWIG" quickly will see that it is all bogus. However, I would naturally prefer that
"SecNiche" would withdraw these absurd claims whereever they have been published.

Regards,
Anders

world are the CVE maintainers doing.
