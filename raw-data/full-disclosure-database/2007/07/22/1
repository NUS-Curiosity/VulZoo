Subject: In ur server-status

Noticing lots of admins tend to forget about /server-status, I typed at random:

http://www.cnn.com/server-status
http://www.webshots.com/server-status
http://www.download.com/server-status
http://slashdot.org/server-status

I am sure there are ten billion others.  In some cases this is worse than
someone grabbing your access log.
