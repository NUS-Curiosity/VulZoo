Subject: [CVE 2007-3816] [Advisory] Vulnerability Facts
	Related JWIG Advisory

Hi all

             The JWIG has got very good functionalities. But vulnerability
finding never states that technology should not be used but should
be carefully used. The vulnerability points should be taken into account
while implementing technology.

The growth counts.

Thats it.
