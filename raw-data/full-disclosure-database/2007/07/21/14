	Vulnerability Advisory Missing In Action in Bugtraq Archive

Dear Symantec,

As long as we're burning digital books to mitigate our civil liability, 
perhaps we could do a good job of it next time? Quietly disappearing 
Russell Harding's advisory from the BugTraq archive didn't resolve your 
potential liability for distributing links to material that violates the 
DMCA. Perhaps you have failed to notice the various other locations 
where you still publish this illicit material, including the exploit?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     MacOS X SoftwareUpdate Vulnerability.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date:      July 6, 2002
Version:   MacOS 10.1.X and possibly 10.0.X
Problem:   MacOS X SoftwareUpdate connects to the SoftwareUpdate Server via
            HTTP with no authentication, leaving it vulnerable to attack.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:

Mac OS X includes a software updating mechanism "SoftwareUpdate". Software
update, when configured by default, checks weekly for new updates from
Apple.  HTTP is used with absolutely no authentication. Using well known
techniques, such as DNS Spoofing, or DNS Cache Poisoning it is trivial to
trick a user into installing a malicious program posing as an update from
Apple.


Impact:

Apple frequently releases updates, which are all installed as root.
Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to root compromise on affected
systems. These are known to include Mac OS 10.1.X and possibly 10.0.X.


Solution/Patch/Workaround:

There is currently no patch available. Hopefully the release of this
information will convince apple they need, at the very least, some basic
authentication in SoftwareUpdate.


Exploit:  http://www.cunap.com/~hardingr/projects/osx/exploit.html

An exploit for this vulnerability has been released to the public for
testing purposes.  It is distributed as a Mac OS X package which includes
DNS and ARP spoofing software. Also, it includes the cgi scripts, and
apache configuration files required to impersonate the Apple
SoftwareUpdatesServer.
