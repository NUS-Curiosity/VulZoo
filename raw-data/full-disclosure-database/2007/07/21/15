Yes, but this is fixed in recent Firefox versions. see:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=360493

The heise demo with JavaScript still works with Firefox 2.0.05 and 
Safari.

On the other hand, if you can place JavaScript on a server, there are 
other means of stealing passwords. So don't be too fast with blaming 
Firefox. For more details read:  Holes in Firefox password manager
