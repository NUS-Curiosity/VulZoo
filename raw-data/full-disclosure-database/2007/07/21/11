Subject: new version of XSSDB

Hi there,

GC has released a new version of XSSDB
(http://www.gnucitizen.org/xssdb). The current version contains an XSS
testing tool which is there to try each payload against the
applications your are testing. You can submit XSS payloads.

We are still in beta/alpha stage but gradually moving forward. Your
feedback will be greatly appreciated. We are also working on a toolkit
for Technika to automate some other tasks.

thanks for the interest

P.S. according to .mario, our leading database maintainer and founder
of the PHPIDS group, there will be more then 50 new payload additions
for the following couple of weeks.
