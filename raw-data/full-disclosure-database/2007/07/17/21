Subject: Help with education

I did not intend to start some kind of flame war on the mailing list, 
and I certainly don't intend to perpetuate it. However, I do want to 
make it clear that I was looking for advice from professionals in the 
field. I find questions like "the best of" something often is misleading 
in simple google searches. Things like advertising and special interest 
usually cloud the answers. Thanks to everyone who has sent me helpful 
replies.
