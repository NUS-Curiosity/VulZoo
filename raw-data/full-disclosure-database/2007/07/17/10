Subject: Help with education

I am looking to become a security consultant(White hat) in a few years 
and I was looking for some advice on the best certifications to get, 
graduate level schools and majors, and any web sites that will continue 
to help me along my path. I am currently a student at a school in 
Atlanta, USA for Information Security and Assurance. Any ideas?
