I'm not sure I agree with Jared.  I think you might find Stack's suggestions
especially satisfying - be a dentist or a chiropracter!

I mean, just think of all the creative ways you could deal with
condescending, arrogant jerks who are incapable of helping someone with an
earnest question?

I'd love to be a dentist or a chiropractor with either of them sitting in a
chair at my office.

Good times indeed.
