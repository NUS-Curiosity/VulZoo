_AND_ at least they noticed and moved to act against it.

Every day, many hundreds of thousands of _successful_ attacks against 
corporations, small businesses and private individuals not only go 
unreported by them, but entirely undetected and largely unnoticed by 
the _attacked_.

The reason for this comment?  A great many of those mocking the DHS 
over this incident are part of the group just mentioned and are too 
stupid to ever realize it...
