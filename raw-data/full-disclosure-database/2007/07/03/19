Subject: Re: [Dailydave] iPhone Roadblock

 From what I understand of the phone it is running a native version of 
OS X. Which may mean to say its running the underlying BSD kernel of 
'Darwin' with a modified Aqua (which is their impementation of XWindows) 
on top. As with any type of blackbox testing you must go with the 
'knowns' to find the 'unknowns' (yai!!). Learn what the points of 
ingress are from the device it self, i.e. is safari still vulnerable and 
maybe can be used as a gateway into the directory structure? Or can you 
write code to use safari in that manner? If not then you must take a 
closer look inside the phone. One thing is certain, at some point a 
developer needed a way into the phone to do proper debugging, maybe not 
a JTAG interface on this device but some type of 'shell'. I have seen 
certain sites where people have taken apart the device and have started 
to peer into it.

I do know that their no SDK for the device but it does have a fully 
functional Safari browser which will allow for AJAX.... so quick start 
coding ;0
