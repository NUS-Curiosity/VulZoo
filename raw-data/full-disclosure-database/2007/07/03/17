Subject: Re: [Dailydave] iPhone Roadblock

Actually the guys over at:
http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki<http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Confirmemail/bc89b850ecfa38723bc811a4fa8ce092>are
pretty far along of mounting the iPhone. The can read a files from a
sandbox setup on the phone for iTunes. I believe they're hooking the iTunes
dlls being used and REing a basic interface.

Also, I haven't heard of anyone doing serious work regarding loading
unofficial firmware. I'm sure that's a route people may consider, but
everyone seems happy with the iPhone and just want it to do more and be more
open. Reinventing the wheel by writing new firmware seems like a lose-lose
situation.
