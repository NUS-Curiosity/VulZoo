Old as in this happened yesterday, last week, last month, last year,
last decade, last millennium, etc.

The US DoD gets hit all the time... not because they are so much
insecure, but because they are such a primary target.  It's a fact of
life, just like doctors and nurses are the most vulnerable to contract a

greater.

Now, back to your normal programming....
