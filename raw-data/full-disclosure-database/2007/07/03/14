Buffer Truncation Abuse in Microsoft SQL Server Based Applications

Release Date:	3rd July 2007
Author:		Gary O'Leary-Steele

This paper is designed to document an attack technique Sec-1 recently
adopted during the course of their application assessments. The basic
principal of this technique has existed for some time; however we hope
this paper we will provide an insight of how a variation of the
technique can be adopted to attack common "forgotten password"
functionality within web applications.

Our initial intention was to release this paper along with a case study
demonstrating the flaw within a commercial application. However since
the vendor has yet to fix the flaw it was decided that an initial
censored release will be followed up with the complete release further
down the line.
