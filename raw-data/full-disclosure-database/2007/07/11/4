Severe?  All that seems to be leaked is a person's Name/Address/SSN
number and some other details.  While this is too much info to leak, I'd
hardly say it's severe.   That same info can be easily found in people's
mailboxes weekdays between noon and 4pm.

7 days?   "industry practice"?   Come on Bob I know you know that large
corporations can't feed a cat in 7 days let alone make unscheduled
website changes that fast.  Change control approvals alone would include
14 or more days in most enterprises.   Why the rush to "say so"?
