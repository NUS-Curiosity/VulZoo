Thanks Steve.

This proves the value of Full Disclosure.

This seems to have changed within a few hours of my posting to Full
Disclosure rather than in the several weeks after I first alerted it.
Note that Wachovia still has not subsequently contacted me to thank me,
acknowledge my work, or to threaten me.

Yes, the page that consumers can get to by navigating Wachovia's web site
(or in response to the paper mail Wachovia sent out) now is the
following, which posts using https to provide strong encryption:

      https://www.wachovia.com/personal/forms/privacy_optout

It has comments with time-stamps of late yesterday, after I disclosed
on the list:

     <!-- Vignette V6 Tue Jul 10 19:28:33 2007 -->


I do note that the existing URL:

     http://www.wachovia.com/personal/forms/privacy_optout

still exists and is accessible.

That http page still appears to post the SSN, etc. unencrypted.
Clearly, someone needs to delete the old page or only allow it as https.
Of course, this is a very minor issue as there is no way for a consumer
"trip over" this page accidentally.

I wonder if Wachovia will follow the California state breach security
policy.
