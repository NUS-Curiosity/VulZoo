Subject: Re: Wachovia Bank website sends confidential
 information

Hi Jim,

No, I did not "declare the whole of Wachovia technically challenged based 
on the one incident at a security conference.." What I was pointing out is 
that the current problem of their failure to put up a secure web and their 
failure to respond to notification about has another data point from 6 
about months ago.

In general enterprises send only a small group of people to any given 
conference, so no, the whole of Wachovia did not attend. Nevertheless, 
when you are the one attending, you are a representive of that enterprise.

You seemed to have missed the point that I was adding to a discussion, not 
trying to create a new one. My point was in the dustbin, where it would 
have stayed, until the current discussion appeared.
