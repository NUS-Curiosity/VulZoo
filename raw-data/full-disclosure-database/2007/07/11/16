Leaking a SSN is considered serious.  My use of the term "severe" was
to get their attention.

Please read my posting more carefully.  I stated that if I did not
hear back within 7 days and the problem persisted then I would disclose
it.  All they had to do was to ask for more time and I would have granted
any reasonable extension.  Instead, it appears that they ignored my
report; discouraging that is what Full Disclosure is all about, IMO.

I think that that web page should have been shut down within the
hour as any competent web person could have confirmed the leak with
a few minutes' inspection of the page source.
