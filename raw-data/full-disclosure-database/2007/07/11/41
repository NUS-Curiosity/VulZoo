Mechanisms of politrix... I was doing contract work from home for a
HUGE-O-MONGOUS tech company I won't name (NDA) and was assigned to
do fw administration, configuration for a bank that outsource it to
this HUGE-O-MONGOUS monster. When we needed to implement a change
these were the steps:

"Uh oh.. We're seeing attacks from network X" ...

1) Call manager
2) Manager calls his manager in another state
3) That manager calls sales rep
4) Sales rep called the bank's contact
5) Bank's contact called his security team
6) Hey security team, you need to speak with your contractors
7) Security team to bank's contact ok make a conference call
8) Bank's contact to the sales rep - ok make a conference call
9) bank sales rep to HUGE-O-MONGOUS' sales rep - ok make a conference call
10) manager to manager - hey we're going to do a conference call
11) No wait... My contractor is tied up... Can we re-schedule?

In essence, when we needed to do things, it wasn't as cut and
dry as I thought it would be. In fact it was downright frustrating.
Here you are Rainwall open, NSM open about to fire off changes
but have to wait for at minimum 4 business days hoping no one
up the food chain was unavailable to make a mission critical
change.

Long story short, while at HUGE-O-MONGOUS I was surprised I
was even given the opportunity to be there - but hey contractors
liabilities, etc., legal foobarfoo wording exculpated HUGE-O-MONGOUS
company from the whole shmoo (compsec historians know the HIStory),
anyhow, I got frustrated working for them. I felt as if it was
such a dead end. Mind you I was making about $80.00 per hour
to roll out of bed and do work pretty much whenever I wanted.

Sometimes, things aren't as clear cut as one may think they are.
To me the initial "Oh noes! Wachovia is evil" post was nothing
more than someone itching for their Andy Warhol 15 minutes. With
that said... Off to lunch...
