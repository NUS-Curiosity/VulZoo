So you declare the whole of Wachovia technically challenged based on the
one incident at a security conference (did all of Wachovia attend?) six
months ago?  Come on. ;-)

Wachovia, like every other large enterprise, has good, mediocre, and bad
employees.  It's a fact of life, but not a news worthy story.  I'm sure
that some days the best and brightest represent Wachovia at some
conference somewhere, and I am equally sure that some days the worst and
most deplorable represent Wachovia at some conference somewhere.  It
happens.
