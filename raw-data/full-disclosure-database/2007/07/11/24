Finding collisions is definitely one piece.  The other is that you can
argue about SHA-1 being the Federal standard.  Is it used more due to
widespread use in existing applications?  Yes.  However, all Federal
agencies (and people in general) should stop using it where possible. 
NIST has mandated by 2010 for most uses by Federal agencies.  I guess
we'll see how well that goes...

March 15, 2006: The SHA-2 family of hash functions (i.e., SHA-224,
SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512) may be used by Federal agencies for all
applications using secure hash algorithms. Federal agencies should stop
using SHA-1 for digital signatures, digital time stamping and other
applications that require collision resistance as soon as practical, and
must use the SHA-2 family of hash functions for these applications after
2010. After 2010, Federal agencies may use SHA-1 only for the following
applications: hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs); key
derivation functions (KDFs); and random number generators (RNGs).
Regardless of use, NIST encourages application and protocol designers to
use the SHA-2 family of hash functions for all new applications and
protocols.
