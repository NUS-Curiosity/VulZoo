Driver walks into a dealer and speaks to customer service:

"These brake pads are extremely vulnerable to slipping during X
conditions on a 90 degree slalom" says the driver. Puzzled and
not knowing squat about slaloms, or the breaking system, the
customer service rep send the driver to a mechanic.

"These brake pads are extremely vulnerable to slipping during X
conditions on a 90 degree slalom. Someone will die!" says the
driver to the mechanic... Not being able to change the auto's
design nor engineering, the mechanic is puzzled and offers to
take the information although he is even more puzzled on who
this should be directed to.

Two days later driver rambles on news stations nationwide:
"Their arrogance will get people killed. I warned them repeatedly"
People moan and grumble, etc., recalls, fixes...

This Wachovia thread is pointless. I see no mention or posting
to perhaps any security list (and I'm on many both public and
private) saying: "Hey is there anyone who can put me in touch
with someone in the know at Wachovia" on any list. All I see
is... "I called customer service". So what, if you're a security
professional you will know damn well you're getting nowhere
with them. "I spoke to their w3bm4ster". And? Either the poster
is looking for attention or a complete and utter idiot. If his
or her true intention was to provide a report of a security
woe concerning said business or product, he or she could have
easily jumped on any security mailing list and found the right
connection instead of rambling on "the sky is falling..."

Let me see:
wachovia security cissp "incident" +network via Google

This looks interesting:

I would have contacted someone on this level to put me in
touch with the right person. But hey, guess its more hip
to add stupid little tags next to your resume or webpage:
I broke $INSERT_VENDOR_HERE
