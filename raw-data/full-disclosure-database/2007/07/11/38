http://www.homestayfinder.com/Dictionary.aspx?q=User:Susam_pal/Sandbox
now redirects to
http://www.inglesnoexterior.com/dictionary.aspx?q=User:Susam_pal/Sandbox

Vulnerable script moved to another domain. To protect the cookies of
homestayfinder.com???

Wondering whether this kinda attack would be called persistent XSS or
something else? This is a case where the attack vector goes into one
site and the vector exploits another site. How to classify this?
