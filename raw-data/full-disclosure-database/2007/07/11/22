Subject: Re: HomestayFinder XSS Vulnerability in Wikipedia
 Mirror

Hi Matjaz, 

I just checked it and I find it to be working with the browsers I have
(tested with Firefox 2.0.0.3 and Internet Explorer 7). 

http://www.homestayfinder.com/Dictionary.aspx?q=User:Susam_pal/Sandbox
demonstrates the vulnerability. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Susam_pal/Sandbox is the page where
the script is hosted. The script present in Wikipedia exploits the XSS
vulnerability in HomestayFinder's Dictionary.aspx script. 

Regards,
Susam Pal
