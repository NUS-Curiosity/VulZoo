Subject: Re: [WEB SECURITY] Attacking Password Recovery
	Facilities

when the provider sends and email with a link + hash, it normally wont allow
you to send you another link (lets say password recovery email) unless the
timeout for the first one expires...the timeout is normally a time/cost
function that limits how long or how much money it would cost you to get the
hash predicted the following attempt (usually hours)

anyway, nice website mailinator.com, can be handy!!! anyone knows for how
long it keeps your emails? probably not much!
is anyone aware of cool sampling tools that tries usual tricks (like
b8/64/etc encoding, etc) and non-usual ones?
