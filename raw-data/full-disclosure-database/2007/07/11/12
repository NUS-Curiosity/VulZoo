========================================================================


== Overview ==

During security analysis of the Tippingpoint IPS product a signature 
evasion vulnerability was discovered. The use of specific Unicode characters
on particular web servers allows a remote user to bypass IPS detection.

== Exploitation ==

By using a hex encoded alternate Unicode character for forward slash (/)
a request can be produced that will not match any IPS signature present
in the TippingPoint device.

Example:
http://www.test.com/scripts/cmd.exe is a known attack, and detected by a
signature.

The same URI with alternate Unicode forward slash characters are not 
detected by the signature.
 
http://www.test.com/scripts%c0%afcmd.exe
http://www.test.com/scripts%e0%80%afcmd.exe
http://www.test.com/scripts%c1%9ccmd.exe

Web servers located behind a Tippingpoint IPS device which are capable
of decoding alternate Unicode characters can be accessed, and exploited 
without triggering the IPS device.

== Solutions ==

Security-Assessment.com has been in contact with Tipping and a new version
of the Tippingpoint IPS software has been released to address the 
discovered vulnerability.
This issue has been addressed in various TOS releases as indicated
by the affected product below.
  - X-Family devices, 2.5.0.6682.
  - non-X-Family device (not including 600E, 1200E,
  	2400E or 5000E), 2.5.1.6826.
  - non-X-Family device (including 600E, 1200E, 2400E
   or 5000E), 2.5.2.6919.
