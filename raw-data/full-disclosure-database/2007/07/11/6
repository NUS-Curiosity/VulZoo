Subject: HomestayFinder XSS Vulnerability in Wikipedia
	Mirror

There is an XSS vulnerability in HomestayFinder's 'Dictionary.aspx'
script which is responsible for mirroring the content of Wikipedia. I
found this interesting because here a script injected in one website
exploits an XSS vulnerability in another website.

I am including only a short example to demonstrate the issue. The
complete document is available at:-
http://susam.in/security/advisory-2007-07-11.txt

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Susam_pal/Sandbox consists of the
following as the source wiki markup:

   <script>alert('XSS Demo')</script>

http://www.homestayfinder.com/Dictionary.aspx?q=User:Susam_pal/Sandbox
consists of the same code as HTML without the special characters encoded
as HTML entities. Hence, the script is executed on the browser of the
visitor.
