Summary
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM), formerly CallManager,
and Cisco Unified Presence Server (CUPS) contain two vulnerabilities
that could allow an unauthorized administrator to activate and
terminate CUCM / CUPS system services and access SNMP configuration
information. This may respectively result in a denial of service
(DoS) condition affecting CUCM/CUPS cluster systems and the
disclosure of sensitive SNMP details, including community strings.

There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has made free software available to address these
vulnerabilities for affected customers.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070711-voip.shtml

Details
=======

  * Unauthorized Administrator Can Activate/Terminate CUCM/CUPS
    System Services
    An unauthorized CUCM/CUPS administrator may be able to activate
    and terminate system services in a CUCM/CUPS cluster environment.
    This may result in a denial of critical voice services. The
    unauthorized administrator cannot make changes to or view the
    configuration of the vulnerable CUCM/CUPS system, with the
    exception of viewing SNMP settings, which is documented in the
    next vulnerability. The CUCM issue is documented by Cisco Bug ID
    CSCsj09859. The CUPS issue is documented by Cisco Bug ID
    CSCsj19985.
  * Unauthorized Administrator Can View CUCM/CUPS SNMP Settings
    An unauthorized CUCM/CUPS administrator may be able to view
    sensitive SNMP configuration information in a CUCM/CUPS cluster
    environment. This may result in the disclosure of sensitive
    information, including SNMP community strings. The CUCM issue is
    documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsj20668. The CUPS issue is
    documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsj25962.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 1.0.

Cisco will provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are
encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the
environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at

Impact
=====

Successful exploitation of the service activation/termination
vulnerability may result in a DoS condition affecting critical voice
services. An attacker could disable central CUCM services,
effectively causing the complete disruption of a CUCM cluster.

Successful exploitation of the SNMP settings vulnerability may result
in the disclosure of sensitive network configuration information,
including SNMP community strings. Using this information, an attacker
may be able to leverage access to sensitive information on other
systems in the network. It is a common practice in many enterprise
environments to utilize standardized SNMP community strings. This may
compound the severity of this vulnerability.

Software Version and Fixes
==========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities. It is possible to
mitigate these vulnerabilities by permitting only trusted CUCM/CUPS
cluster nodes and administrator workstations to access TCP port 8443
on a vulnerable CUCM/CUPS system.

Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your
network, it is possible to identify traffic which should never be
allowed to target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic
at the border of your network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a
network security best practice and should be considered as a
long-term addition to good network security, as well as a workaround
for this specific vulnerability. The filters shown above should be
included as part of an infrastructure access list, which will protect
all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP address range.

The white paper entitled "Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure
Protection Access Control Lists" presents guidelines and recommended
deployment techniques for infrastructure protection access lists.
This document is available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml

Filters blocking access to TCP/8443 should be deployed at the network
edge as part of a transit access list that will protect the router
where the ACL is configured, as well as other devices behind it.
Further information about transit ACLs is available in the white
paper "Transit Access Control Lists: Filtering at Your Edge," which
is available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion
document for this advisory:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20070711-voip.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software

their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreement with third-party support organizations
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.
