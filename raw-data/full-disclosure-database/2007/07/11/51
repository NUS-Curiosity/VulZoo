Subject: [Full-disclosure] Wachovia Bank website sends confidential
information

Wachovia Bank website sends confidential information (social security
numbers, phone number, address, etc.) over the Internet without encryption.

Horizon Network Security Security Advisory 07/10/2007
http://VerySecureLinux.com/ Jul 10, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Wachovia Bank's official web site offers the following URL to allow its
customers to change their privacy preferences:

     http://www.wachovia.com/privacy

Wachovia also notified its customers by U.S. Mail that they can use that
same URL besides.

That URL has a link to the following to actually change one's
preferences:

     http://www.wachovia.com/personal/forms/privacy_optout

Unfortunately, that page appears to be an ordinary HTML form whose "filled
out data" then is transmitted via the "post" method to an http (not https)
URL.

III. ANALYSIS

We inspected the page's source via our Opera browser.  (We did not sniff the
web traffic so we are not absolutely sure that there is not some hidden
encryption method, though there appears to be none.)

IV. DETECTION

It is trivial to inspect the page source or sniff the data to demonstrate
the problem.  The problem has not been corrected.

V. WORKAROUND

Use a method other than their web site to exercise one's preferences.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor (Wachovia Bank) was notified via their customer service phone
number on June 25.  We were transferred to "web support".  The person
answering asked us to FAX the details to her and we did so, also on June 25.
We explained that we were reporting a severe security problem on their web
site.

We stated that that if we did not hear back from them within 7 days and the
problem was not fixed by then that we would post the problem on the Full
Disclosure list, following accepted industry practice.

To date we have received no response and the problem remains unfixed.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

There is no CVE number.

VIII. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE

06/25/2007  Initial vendor notification
06/25/2007  Vendor requested FAXed details
06/25/2007  Details FAXed to vendor

07/20/2007  No vendor response

IX. CREDIT

This problem was discovered by Bob Toxen, one of our engineers.
