Subject: Exploiting reflected XSS vulnerabilities,
	where user input must come through HTTP Request headers

1.0 Introduction
=======================================
Ever since Adobe patched Flash player to stop attackers spoofing
certain headers such as Referer, User-Agent, etc, it has been
considered impossible to exploit XSS vulnerabilities where the user
input is taken from a request header, e.g. when a website prints out
what User-Agent a user's browser is sending, without escaping it. With
the exception of the Referer header which we can control enough to
exploit XSS attacks through it.

I want to showcase several ways in which we can still exploit these
vulnerabilities.
