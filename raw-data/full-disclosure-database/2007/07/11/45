 AntiVirus symtdi.sys Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

Symantec AntiVirus symtdi.sys Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.11.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 11, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Symantec has a wide range of Anti-Virus and Internet Security products
that are designed to protect users from viruses and other harmful
software. More information can be found on the Symantec site at the
following URL.

http://www.symantec.com/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an input validation vulnerability in version
5.5.1.6 of symtdi.sys allows attackers to elevate privileges to SYSTEM.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to improper address space
validation when the \\symTDI\ device driver processes IOCTL 0x83022323.
An attacker can overwrite an arbitrary address, including code segments,
with a constant double word value by supplying a specially crafted Irp
to the IOCTL handler function.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to obtain elevated privileges by
exploiting a kernel-mode driver. This could allow the attacker to gain
complete control of the affected system.

Note that since the attacker can only overwrite with a constant
double-word value, exploitation is not completely straight forward.
However, this does not significantly impact the difficulty of
exploitation since code segments can be overwritten within the kernel.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed this vulnerability in version 5.5.1.6 of Symantec's
symtdi.sys device driver as included with version 10 of Symantec
AntiVirus Corporate Edition. Previous versions and related products
that contain the affected driver are suspected vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Symantec has addressed this vulnerability by releasing updated versions
of the SymTDI.sys device driver. The updated driver has been made
available via LiveUpdate. For more information consult Symantec's
