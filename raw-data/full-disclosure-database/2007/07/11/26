Can  you,  please, provide example of such server? Fatih Ozavci reported
similar   problem   with  Checkpoint  and  Halfwidth/Fullwidth  Unicode,
potential  attack  vector  was IIS with .Net framework, in this case IIS
seems not to be exploitable.

Blaming IPS it does not detect attack which is impossible in-the-wild is
nonsense. Blaming corporate-level IPS doesn't detect attack against SOHO
web server is acceptable nonsense :)
