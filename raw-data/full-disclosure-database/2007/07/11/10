Hey All,
 
I have begun writing a little class to do some fault injection on Win32
applications. Currently it only has DLL injection/ejection which is useful
if you are a MS Detours kinda person, or are writing DLL payloads for
exploits and you want a quick and dirty way of getting them in and out of
processes. Really I am looking for comments, and suggestsion on some
interesting fault cases that everyone would like to see. As time permits I
will be expanding this library to pound the snot out of software in all
kinds of interesting ways. You can download it here:

And I look forward to your comments, suggestions and bug fix requests.
