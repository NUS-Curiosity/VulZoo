Subject: First cross-domain XSS worm (not)

Hi all,

I recently stumbled upon this;
http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20070709/nduja-cross-domainwebmail-xss-worm/
In short: It mentions a "new" kind of XSS worm; one that can infect multiple
domains. I attempted to reply but my reply mysteriously never made it to the
page. In an attempt to set the record straight on XSS worms, I'll post my
reply here:

(Cross-domain) XSS worms are much older than Samy or Nudja:

It's been 5 years, I can see how you forgot about it. Samy and Nudja can
claim the prize for the first _publicly_released_ XSS worms, but they are
definately not the first of their kind. Also, it is a misconception to think
that worms can only exists because of Ajax; a worm can just as easily spread
without XMLHTTPRequest. I've been told that people saw XSS worms as early as
2000, but I have found no evidence to support this: let me know if you know
something.

Cheers,
SkyLined
