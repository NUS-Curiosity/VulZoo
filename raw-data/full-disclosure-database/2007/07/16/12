 OfficeScan Session Cookie Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Trend Micro OfficeScan Session Cookie Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.16.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 16, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Trend Micro OfficeScan is a centrally managed AntiVirus solution that
allows administrators to manage virus and spyware protection in
business environments. More information can be found on the vendors
site at the following URL.

http://us.trendmicro.com/us/products/enterprise/officescan-client-server-edition/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in
Trend Micro Inc.'s OfficeScan for Windows could allow attackers to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the IIS Web User.

The OfficeScan installation includes a series of CGI executables that
are used for configuration through the Web interface. A shared library,
CGIOCommon.dll, is used by many of these binaries to access environment
variables passed to them from the parent IIS process. If a malicious
Web request is made for a vulnerable binary, including an overly long
session cookie, a stack-based Unicode buffer overflow will occur.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the IIS Web user. Exploitation does not require
authentication.

While the IIS Web user account is a limited account, this attack could
be used to conduct further privilege escalation attacks.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in OfficeScan 7.3 with all
current patches applied. Testing has shown that this attack can be
conducted by requesting multiple CGI binaries that make use of the
shared library. Other versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.
