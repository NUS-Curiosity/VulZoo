It's quite possible that they were out there, but nobody noticed them because
nobody was *looking* for them.  At most sites, if it doesn't trip the IDS,
it literally never happened.  If your intrusion detection system only has
templates for mammals, a hell of a lot of alligators can wander through and
you'll never see one....
