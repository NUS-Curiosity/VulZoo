Subject: Re: PIRS2007 local buffer overflow vulnerability

Dear 3APA3A,

you are absolutely right. Overwriting EIP does not 
necessary mean that the application is exploitable. 
Neither we claim that in our advisory. So, technically 
speaking, consider this a "bug" or "buffer overflow 
condition" rather than vulnerability.

Thanks God for semantics :)
