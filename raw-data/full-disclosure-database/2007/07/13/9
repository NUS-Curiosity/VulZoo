Subject: ActiveWeb Contentserver CMS Editor Permission
	Settings Problem

Advisory: ActiveWeb Contentserver CMS Editor Permission Settings Problem

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a problem with the permission settings in
the management interface of the activeWeb contentserver CMS during a
penetration test. The ability of an editor to create and edit documents
can be restricted to specific folders. RedTeam Pentesting was still able
to create arbitrary documents in all directories, regardless of the
restrictions set on the editor account.

Product: activeWeb contentserver
Affected Versions: <= 5.6.2929

Vulnerability Type: Permission Problem

Vendor-Status: informed, fixed version released
Advisory-URL: http://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2007-007.php
Advisory-Status: public
CVE: CVE-2007-3018
CVE-URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3018


Introduction
============

contentserver is the comprehensive, scalable Content Management System
for professional requirements. It combines editorial system, website
management and development platform for web applications in one package.

(translation of the description on the vendor's homepage)


More Details
============

When creating new editor accounts, the administrator has the ability to
impose restrictions on it. The editor can be restricted to be only able
to create and modify files in certain folders. All other folders should
be inaccessible to him.
The vulnerability lies in the fact that an editor with such a restricted
account is still able to create files in arbitrary locations. He will
not be able to edit already existing pages though.


Fix
===

The vulnerability is fixed in release 5.6.2964.


Security Risk
=============

Editors may create arbitrary files in locations they are not supposed to
modify.  This can include the usage of Javascript for malicious purposes
or other ways of exploiting users. They cannot modify existing files,
and the creation of new files is easily traceable and revertable through
the system. Additionally, editors are normally considered trustworthy.
The risk is therefore labeled as medium.
