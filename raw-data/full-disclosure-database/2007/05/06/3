   The severity of a DOS is entirely context dependent.  That's why 
software users need to informed about the DOS so they can decide how 
critical it is in their context.  A home user who rarely uses an ActiveX 
.ocx may consider a DOS of that feature negligible.  If that ocx 
(probably not a PowerPoint viewer) is used in controlling a catalytic 
cracker, then a DOS is a lot more serious.
