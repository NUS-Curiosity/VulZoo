 Once I developed this, vendors were typicaly fast to respond...

 This link is sent upon first contact to the vendor with PoC.
Further you should date your PoC and research notes, another good
tactic to take is to place your advisory on a webserver, accessable to
the vendor but not the public. This also helps establish your timeline so
a vendor cannot claim it was fixed "on foobar date" and you get no credit.
With over 50 security advisories to date, I have not had the issue
you are having.
