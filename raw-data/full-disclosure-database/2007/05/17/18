Subject: Oracle Forensics Part 4: Live Response

Hey all,
For anyone that wants a copy, I've just posted the fourth paper in the 
Oracle Forensics series I'm writing to http://www.databasesecurity.com/. 
This paper covers what an incident responder should do during a Live 
Response on a compromised Oracle server.
Cheers,
David Litchfield
