Due to a complete lack of actual testing, the abovementioned "fix" for 
this problem didn't actually do anything. Thanks to Nathaniel Roberts 
for pointing this out, even almost a year later.

A new release of WebScarab has been published that does actually fix 
this. It can be obtained from 
<https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id=61823>

The full changelog since the previous version is available at 
<https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=506001&group_id=64424>

Regards,

Rogan Dawes
