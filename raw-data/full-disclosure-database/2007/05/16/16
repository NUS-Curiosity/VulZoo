Title: CA BrightStor ARCserve Backup Mediasvr.exe and 
caloggerd.exe Vulnerabilities

Notice Date: 2007-05-16

CA is aware that two functional exploit code samples were 
publicized on May 16, 2007. These two denial of service exploits 
are associated with vulnerabilities in CA BrightStor ARCserve 
Backup Mediasvr.exe and caloggerd.exe.

We have verified that vulnerabilities do exist, and we are now 
working on a patch to address the issues. We have given these 
vulnerabilities a Medium risk rating.

To mitigate the Mediasvr.exe vulnerability, CA recommends that 
BrightStor ARCserve Backup users implement the following temporary 
workaround:

   1. Rename the "mediasvr.exe" file to a non-functional file 
      name, such as "mediasvc.exe.disable".

   2. Then restart the CA BrightStor Tape Engine service.

This will disable the command line functionality in the product 
(i.e. command line utilities such as ca_backup, ca_restore, 
ca_merge, ca_qmgr, ca_scan, etc will not work).

After we have completed our analysis of these issues, we will post 
an update and patches on the CA SupportConnect website. If 
additional information is required, please contact CA Technical 
Support at http://supportconnect.ca.com.

If you discover a vulnerability in CA products, please report your 
findings to vuln AT ca DOT com, or utilize our "Submit a
