Subject: Re: Retrieving "deleted" sms/mms from Nokia phone
 (Symbian S60)

and what's more .. Flash memory not being infinitely over-writable, file 
systems used on those devices (JFFS2 for example) actually encourage 
leaving data behind by ensuring recently unlinked logical blocks aren't 
re-used anytime soon (wear-leveling).

I know the original method proposed is non-destructive, but using a test 
clip it's possible to dump the contents of just about any flash device. 
Furthermore, given a significantly motivated adversary (and barring all 
but physical destruction of the chip die itself -- not just the package) 
one could also read the contents with a microscope -- even after several 
erasures(*).

But if all you're trying to do is retrieve SMS messages, it'd be a lot 
easier to just subpoena the carrier .. they keep the contents forever 
(even if they say they don't .. I know for a fact they do because I 
personally saw one of the major US carriers .. [ahem.. Verizon] .. 
deliver boxes of sent/received text messages -- for hundreds of phones 
-- going back at least a year).
