Subject: phpPgAdmin Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities

Synopsis: Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities

Introduction:
phpPgAdmin is a web-based administration tool for PostgreSQL.

Details:
phpPgAdmin doesn't correctly sanitize data in $_SERVER array and most of the
scripts make direct use of PHP_SELF.

PoC:
http://www.test.com/redirect.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22)%3C/script%3E?subject=server&server=test
This was tested on versions  3.5 to 4.1.1 as not logged user. Other versions
may also be vulnerable.
