On a script basis:
1. Parse input for validity
2. Don't allow urls to be unconditionally accepted
3. Don't allow XSS bymaking sure input is genuine and doesn't contain extra 
characters than are expected.

On a server-basis:
If it is a server that will be hosting users, I suggest deactivating RFI 
all-together as users may install scripts that don't check input, 
Furthermore, disable sockets to prevent users from starting up their 
own "services" and/or backdoors, even though there may not be privledged 
access, if a user gets a shell of some sort, they may be able to get your 
system roped into a botnet or filestore under the HTTPD's account.

However, if it will only be hosting you, then it may be acceptable to leave 
the default config and make sure scripts behave on a per-script basis as RFI 
may be eventually useful for you if you parse the include input.
