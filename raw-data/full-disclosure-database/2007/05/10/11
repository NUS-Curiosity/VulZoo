Synopsis
========

PostgreSQL contains a vulnerability that could result in SQL privilege
escalation.

Background
==========

PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database management
system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/postgresql      < 8.0.13                         >= 8.0.13
                                                            *>= 7.4.17
                                                            *>= 7.3.19

Description
===========

An error involving insecure search_path settings in the SECURITY
DEFINER functions has been reported in PostgreSQL.

Impact
======

If allowed to call a SECURITY DEFINER function, an attacker could gain
the SQL privileges of the owner of the called function.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PostgreSQL users should upgrade to the latest version and fix their
SECURITY DEFINER functions:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-db/postgresql"

In order to fix the SECURITY DEFINER functions, PostgreSQL users are
advised to refer to the PostgreSQL documentation:
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/techdocs.77
