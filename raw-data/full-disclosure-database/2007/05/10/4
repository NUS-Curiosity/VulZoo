4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in BearShare, which 
can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the
NCTAudioFile2.AudioFile ActiveX control when handling the
"SetFormatLikeSample()" method. This can be exploited to cause a 
stack-based buffer overflow by passing an overly long string (about 
4124 bytes) as argument to the affected method.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a user
e.g. visits a malicious website.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Set the kill-bit for the affected ActiveX control.
