But the subject line reads:

[ MDKSA-2007:101 ] - Updated bind packages fix vulnerability

So is this a spoof or is this a spoof?
Or did somebody make a booboo at Mandriva. The PGP key seems to at least
check out for the fact that the signature on the part of the message
that is signed is correct. As the PGP key is not in the strong set it
can't be really trusted of course.

Greets,
