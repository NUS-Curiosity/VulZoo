Depends on the goals.  A Linux box is probably easier to use remotely.
However, your presence on the Windows box is far less likely to be noticed.

And if I was doing a targeted attack on an organization, I'd probably trade
10K of *any* machine out on the open Internet for that old VMS machine in
the target's DMZ....
