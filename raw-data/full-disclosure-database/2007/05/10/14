why, Windows machines of course, I'm an attacker, not a fool! If you 
were a terrorist, what would you rather do?

Crash the Twin Towers
Crash the dollar

There is no such thing as an "attacker". All actions, even such an 
individual's, are driven by economical considerations. Your "attacker" 
seems to be some kind of space alien hacker (or possibly the Unamomber), 
as detached and... alienated as it is from this world. You hint at a 
sci-fi epic scenario, with an unstoppable army of Linux bots targetting 
vital points of the Internet infrastructure with aimed attacks. Even 
putting your nonsensical premises aside (like the wishful assumption 
that operating systems are *not* commodities, and to add to the 
absurdity we are talking about zombies here!), you are still left with 
an one-man fuck-the-world scheme with no winner. Why would anyone do 
that? So bravo and yay, a shell script trojan and vague threats of MD5 
collisions, history books here you come! Now all you need is a(n) hero's 
death. I can already see the epitaph: "Nobody was faster in the awk"
