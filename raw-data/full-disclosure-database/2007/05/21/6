Subject: Re: Retrieving "deleted" sms/mms from Nokia phone
	(Symbian S60)

gd,
You can also recover SMS from flash memory cards used in these Nokia
phones. The phones has a feature wherein you can archive or backup SMS
to the cards. So even if they delete the backup you could just
undelete the .dat files using something like Testdisk to recover the
messages.
