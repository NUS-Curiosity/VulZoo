To summarize what I've heard from various sources: I am missing
something important. =)  Both PHP and ASP.NET will decode these
characters into their ASCII equivalents.  I don't think J2EE apps are
vulnerable, but this is definitely useful for more more than just
homograph attacks.

Thanks to the various people who have tested this out!
