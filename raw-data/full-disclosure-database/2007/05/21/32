I think you could be on either side, but I would learn towards this being
a feature than a bug.  Multiple products appear to do the decoding in the
same manner and intentionally perform this function.  However, the recent
advisories that went out were geared towards IDS/IPS products that were
not designed to be able to recognize such half-/full-width encoded
traffic.  Unless there is some RFC or generally followed documentation
saying the traffic should not be encoded/decoded as such, I would continue
to lean towards this being a feature.  It just appears to be a place much
of the IT (security) world has overlooked.
