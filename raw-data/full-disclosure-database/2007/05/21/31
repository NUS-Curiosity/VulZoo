(Cracking up that somebody going by the handle ascii is commenting on
character encoding issues. =)

Given how few application platforms decode full-width unicode to ASCII
equivalents, is there a case to be made that those application
platforms that do decide this conversion is a good idea are broken?

Put another way: should this be considered a bug in ASP.NET?
