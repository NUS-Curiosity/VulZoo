I've added a function to hide the script from showing up on Samhain
awk -vfilename=$filename '{print "perl -pi -e 
'\''s/'$filename'/samhain/g'\''"}' /var/log/samhain_log|sh

What is does when run now is look for the instance of its name (the
backdoor's name) and rename it to Samhain. So if the file created
is called foo.h and Samhain logs it, it will go and rename foo.h
in the logs to Samhain. Tripwire is no difference unless both logs
are kept offline. On a side note, I started tinkering with a triple
threat mechanism of checksums: (SHA1 + MD5 + RIPE160)

Just don't know if I want to devote time to doing a full blown
program. It works as is, but does nothing more than checksum
whatever is in my current path of which later I can do a diff
etc.
