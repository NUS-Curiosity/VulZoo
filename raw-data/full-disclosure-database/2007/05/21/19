Your POC works for me, the PHP iconv code converts the UTF-8 byte
sequence 0xef  0xbc 0x9C to ASCII '<'.  Looks like PHP applications
may be at risk.

The java CharsetDecoder class does not.  (I don't think this will be
JRE specific, but I tested the IBM JRE...).

The perl Encode module does not.

Anybody have an IIS server handy, to test out how .NET handles this?

Brian
