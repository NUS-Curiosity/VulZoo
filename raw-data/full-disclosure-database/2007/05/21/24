Dear Brian Eaton,

It's not true, because it's quite convertible character. At least for IIS:

http://example.com/test.asp?q=%uFF1Cscript>alert("Hello")</script>

where test.asp is

<%=Request.QueryString("q")%>

launches javascript.

BTW:  It  may be used to bypass keyword based filtering to create, e.g.
porn pages available through any corporate firewall. See
