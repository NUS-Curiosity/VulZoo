Subject: Re: Cryptome is dead (at least for now)

Mr. T is back on his soap-box,

Why does not he just GTFO of the BIG BAD EVIL US if it is so restrictive to his vocal sensibilities.  I would be happy to purchase a one way ticket First Class back to his beloved IRAN.

BTW AL GORE is responsible for the INTERNET ( Free Pornography for all) and now Global Warming so at least Ol'e W is just stepping on our freedom not trying to kill us.

Yes it is.  And who's next, huh?  Bush's machine can just do whatever the 
hell it wants, and "we the people" just sit here botching about "its too
bad John got shut down, isnt it"?

Please, someone just nuke the US and get it over with already - we (TINW -
read: USA) has long since forfeit our right to exist.

"The real point is that you cannot harbor malice toward others and then
cry foul when someone displays intolerance against you. Prejudice 
tolerated is intolerance encouraged. Rise up in righteousness when you
witness the words and deeds of hate, but only if you are willing to rise
up against them all, including your own. Otherwise suffer the slings and 
arrows of disrespect silently."
