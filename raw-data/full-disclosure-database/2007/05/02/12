Yes it is.  And who's next, huh?  Bush's machine can just do whatever
the hell it wants, and "we the people" just sit here botching about "its
too bad John got shut down, isnt it"?

"The real point is that you cannot harbor malice toward others and then
cry foul when someone displays intolerance against you. Prejudice
tolerated is intolerance encouraged. Rise up in righteousness when you
witness the words and deeds of hate, but only if you are willing to rise
up against them all, including your own. Otherwise suffer the slings and
arrows of disrespect silently."
