Subject: CMS Made Simple: SQL injection

1) Summary

Affected software  CMS Made Simple 1.05
Vendor URL         http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/
Severity           High

2) Vulnerability Description

The affected software is vulnerable to SQL injection via the templateid
parameter of the stylesheet.php page (the value of this parameter is
used directly in an SQL query, without any form of escaping or sanitation).

This vulnerability is remotely exploitable, and does not require
authentication prior to remote exploitation (since the page is normally
part of the publicly accessible part of the package).

The impact is dependent on the database back-end type (and the subset of
the SQL language supported by this back-end). E.g. a MySQL 5 back-end
will allow disclosure of the CMS usernames (including administrators)
and their password hashes.

3) Verification

http://www.example.com/stylesheet.php?templateid=16+AND+1=1
http://www.example.com/stylesheet.php?templateid=16+AND+1=0

4) Solution
