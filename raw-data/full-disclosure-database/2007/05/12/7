Subject: Fight Censorship on Full-Disclosure


Hello all,

It was brought to my attention that this list has become moderated. 

As a community, we must not stand for this!  We must join together and
fight the oppression.  

I have decided to host a mirror of the censored materials on my website.
As an American, I value free speech above all else, and will gladly give
my life defending this content.

George Bush, you can kiss my ass.  I didn't vote for you, and as far as
I am concerned you are not my president and no matter how many of my
Muslim brothers you massacre, I will not be intimidated and I will not
remove this content from my website.

Everyone, please download the following file and mirror it where ever
you can.  While it may seem cruel to the individuals named in here,
remember the greater good.  George Bush and his Marxist ways have no
place here on our good list.
