So you are the recently-out-of-retirement dude or dudes that claim
they used to make up gobbles right?

I am assuming this due to the recent challenge and such issued to Neal
as a result of his long-ago comparison of the netdev personality to
gobbles.

When I first read his comparison, I thought "wrong again douchebag".
But as I glance over the endless streams of emails from "Dr. Neal
Kraweitz" with a hushmail addy or badly spoofed headers, the content
makes me re-think my harsh judgment of that analysis, as long as it
was applied to this incarnation of "Gobbles".

 Gobbles personality sounded like someone who knew how to manipulate
with finesse. Maybe I am hardened to trolling now, but I just dont see
that expert manipulation or semi-technical meandering in these posts
(which gobbles was at least nice enough to include on technical
groups), which leaves me to believe that you are a faux-turkey.
