Subject: Exciting new Paimei release!

I am excited to see Jared DeMott's recent post to Dailydave with his release
of the Evolutionary Fuzzing System! A highly exciting and revolutionary (or
is it EVOLUTIONARY!?) new fuzzing system designed for automatic discovery of
protocols. A much exciting concept that I will have to write about in my new
book!

Also included in this release is code previously only private to my copy of
Paimei! Previously, all remote debugging functionality was reserved for my
private copy but apparently Jared DeMott felt the time was right to include
pydbg_client class in his EFS release of Paimei! This should allow debuggers
of applications to use the remote functionality of Paimei to debug processes
running on remote computers. Also the all new pydbg_server, just in this
release! These tools should help all of you most greatly. I highly recommend
that instead of downloading the latest release of Paimei from openrce.org,
you download the efs-paimei package from appliedsec.com, as their package
has been updated far in advance of mine.

Happy fuzzing, and let the best boundary character overflow!
