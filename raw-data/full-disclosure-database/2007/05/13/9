Synopsis
========

XScreenSaver allows local users to bypass authentication under certain
configurations.

Background
==========

XScreenSaver is a widely used screen saver collection shipped on
systems running the X11 Window System.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-misc/xscreensaver       < 5.02                        >= 5.02

Description
===========

XScreenSaver incorrectly handles the results of the getpwuid() function
in drivers/lock.c when using directory servers during a network outage.

Impact
======

A local user can crash XScreenSaver by preventing network connectivity
if the system uses a remote directory service for credentials such as
NIS or LDAP, which will unlock the screen.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All XScreenSaver users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-misc/xscreensaver-5.02"
