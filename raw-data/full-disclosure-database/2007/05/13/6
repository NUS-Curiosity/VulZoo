gobbles - wheres the humor you used to be so known for? now youre
just a sad little turkey. why if it wasnt for that south park rerun
on august 29, 2001 youd still just be calling yourself a backwards
retard - drater.

it must take a lot of effort to hate so many people so much. then
again you are not new to hate are you? i couldnt help but notice
that your web site n3td3v.googlepages.com uses the same template
found at http://uncle-semite.com/stickerschlock/. the web pages
were even created within hours of each other. and how does uncle
semite describe himself? oh yeah "Uncle-Semite.com is the work of
various contributors, collectively referred to as "Uncle Semite.""
thats just how gobbles/n3td3v describes himself. no wonder you hate
gadi so much - hes jewish.

by the way gobbles - next time youre in new york for lunch let me
know. we could have met at a nice jewish deli last month on april
15th.
