Synopsis
========

Samba contains multiple vulnerabilities potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

Background
==========

Samba is a suite of SMB and CIFS client/server programs for UNIX.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /   Vulnerable   /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-fs/samba      < 3.0.24-r2                        >= 3.0.24-r2

Description
===========

Samba contains a logical error in the smbd daemon when translating
local SID to user names (CVE-2007-2444). Furthermore, Samba contains
several bugs when parsing NDR encoded RPC parameters (CVE-2007-2446).
Lastly, Samba fails to properly sanitize remote procedure input
provided via Microsoft Remote Procedure Calls (CVE-2007-2447).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain root
privileges via various vectors.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Samba users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/samba-3.0.24-r2"
