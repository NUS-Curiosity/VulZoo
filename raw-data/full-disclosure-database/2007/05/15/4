ssh.com ssh-3.2.9.1 sftp server remote off by one

***ATTENTION***This has not been tested under reallife conditions***

ssh-3.2.9.1 which is available from http://ftp.ssh.com/pub/ssh/
contains the same old rootd off by one bug as described bei isec.pl here:
http://www.isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0011-wu-ftpd.txt

The file ssh-3.2.9.1/lib/sshfilexfer/sshunixrealpath.c reads

/*
 * char *ssh_realpath(const char *path, char resolved_path[MAXPATHLEN]);
 *
 * Find the real name of path, by removing all ".", ".." and symlink
 * components.  Returns (resolved) on success, or (NULL) on failure,
 * in which case the path which caused trouble is left in (resolved).
 *
 */
char *ssh_realpath(const char *path, char *resolved)
{
  struct stat sb;
  int n, rootd, serrno;
...
...
...
...
...
/*
   * Join the two strings together, ensuring that the right thing
   * happens if the last component is empty, or the dirname is root.
   */
  if (resolved[0] == '/' && resolved[1] == '\0')
    rootd = 1;
  else
    rootd = 0;

  if (*wbuf)
    {
      if (strlen(resolved) + strlen(wbuf) + rootd + 1 > MAXPATHLEN) // 
<----- !rootd
        {
          errno = ENAMETOOLONG;
          goto err1;
        }
      if (rootd == 0)
        (void)strcat(resolved, "/"); /* XXX: strcat is safe */
      (void)strcat(resolved, wbuf);     /* XXX: strcat is safe */
    }
...

ssh_realpath is called when theres an incoming SSH_FXP_REALPATH packet.
from sshfilexfers.c :

---snip---
case SSH_FXP_REALPATH:
      LOG(0, SSH_LOG_INFORMATIONAL, ("Received SSH_FXP_REALPATH"));

      /* Parse the REALPATH message. */
      if (ssh_decode_array(data, len,
                           SSH_FORMAT_UINT32, &id,
                           SSH_FORMAT_UINT32_STR, &name, NULL,
                           SSH_FORMAT_END) != len || len == 0)
        {
          ssh_warning("ssh_file_server_receive_proc: bad REALPATH");
          goto return_bad_status;
        }

      LOG(0, SSH_LOG_INFORMATIONAL, ("Resolving path to `%s'", name));

      if (ssh_realpath(name, resolved) == NULL)
        {
---snip---

old pure-ftpd and openssh versions contain the same code but thats
out of scope, just to mention ssh.com's opensource ssh because
it's unpatched and CURRENT.
