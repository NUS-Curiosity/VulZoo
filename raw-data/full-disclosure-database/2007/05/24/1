Subject: Rainbow tables and Oracle SYSTEM salt

speaking of bad salts, i haven't seen any tables for oracle SYSTEM
user.  i know at one point the "lack of fix" was deterring some from
release, but that was two years ago.  perhaps oracle needs a stronger
incentive.

rumors of patches / table generators abound; are people just keeping
these private?
