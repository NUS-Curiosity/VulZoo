Perhaps, but there is an assumption that may be incorrect that these blogs
are insecure.  Also, there is no mention of how the survey was done.  I
could probably go out and make a list of 2000 blogs where only one of them
wasn't the latest version.  I do understand his point though, and I
guarantee you can find well over 50 older version WP blogs that are
vulnerable.  However, part of my response was geared towards Larry's post
about the possibility MoWPB (Month of WordPress Bugs) -- which is
something I just don't see happening.
