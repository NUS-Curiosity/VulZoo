Subject Summary:         TrueType Font (TTF) Rendering Library
Subject Home:            http://freetype.sourceforge.net/
Subject Versions:        * >= 2.3.4

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           arbitrary code execution

Description:
    A vulnerability caused by an integer signedness error was found
    [0] by Victor Stinner in the font rendering library Freetype [1],
    versions up to and including 2.3.4. The vulnerability might allow
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted
    TrueType Font (TTF) file with a negative "n_points" value, which
    leads to an integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow [2].
