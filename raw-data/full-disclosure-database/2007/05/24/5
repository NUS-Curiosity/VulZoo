4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in various eScan
products, which may be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the MicroWorld
Agent service (MWAGENT.EXE) when decrypting received commands. This can
be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long
command sent to the service (default port 2222/tcp).

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code with
SYSTEM privileges.

Update to version 9.0.718.1 or later.
