Probably because alot of  the said blog owners that neglect upgrading are like 
any regular computer user, they just want something to work, and if it works, 
they assume it's okay, therefore, they ignore security upgrades since it 
would require additional work for something that is not visable to them, as 
they go by the premise, "if it has no new features, Why upgrade?"

We all know (at least I hope) that security upgrades are something worthwhile 
because we can see the difference (we can test the exploit on the new version 
to see if it's patched or nott), whereas a regular user would not.
