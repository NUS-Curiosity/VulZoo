Fair enough I stand corrected but it's been there since 1.something, so either 
way it's not new.  I shall be more careful to read responses in future :).  
To categorically state what I mentioned in the original advisory, "I do not 
make any claim to having discovered the directory traversal first, I simply 
want the bug fixed".

Exactly.  Although SF is now attributing BID 23802 (my XSS) to Jose as well :)

So it seems, and there lies the problem, the UK forum at least does not 
function in either Firefox or Konqueror.  I like vendors who respond by email 
and I like vendors who respond[1] quickly even more :).
