Subject: Re: Month of ActiveX Bug

I'll take a stab at it...

"This bug speaks for itself and I don't have much to add, except that,
given the number of criticisms levied at my English, which as I
pointed out and emphasized before, is less than scholarly (and I
assure you that I would have taken criticisms against the bugs much
better than against how I speak in English), from now on I'll be
writing the advisories in Italian, my native tongue, so whoever wants
to can translate them on their own."
