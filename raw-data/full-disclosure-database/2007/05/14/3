Well, yeah. The script depends on lynx and wget being available, and  
neither is installed on OS X. It also depends on the line-by-line  
layout of several include files, one of which (linux/wireless.h)  
doesn't even exist on non-Linux systems.

It won't even work on all Linux systems. If the target doesn't have  
compilers available, for example, it won't have any headers to grab  
the target strings from.
