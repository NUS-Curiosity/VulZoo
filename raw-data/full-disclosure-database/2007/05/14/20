Your points are moot.

The only reason OSX is "so good" security wise, is because the OS doesn't give 
open administrator access to the users, preventing the dumbness of the 
uninteligent users from screwing up the OS in the conventional sense, I bet 
the instant you introduce "administrative privs" into OSX, you'd get security 
breaches galore. 

To put it bluntly: OSX Treats it's users like they're in a playpen, trying not 
to expose the users to the "real world"

It's the DUMB USERS who are the security risks. NOT the OS the majority of the 
time. If you left a Windows machine running, with a competent user, it will 
have a lower risk of becoming infected/rooted Â than if you parked a clueless 
user in front of the machine.

Same with Linux, park a stupid superuser in front of the machine, you will of 
coruse you'll get stupid results. However, if you get a competent superuser 
that only uses "root" for admin tasks only and doesn't do anything 
exparamental under root on a production machine, as well as not give users 
any more permission than they need, you'd be set.

So what are we trying to do? protect the OS from what? or protect the users 
from making idiotic decisions that will screw up their boxes?

Remember folks: Computers only operate as good as those who operate them.
