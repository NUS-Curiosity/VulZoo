I know this might be a bit hard for you to understand, but it is these 'features' that make OS X impossible to break.
I am guessing if you had your micro$oft operating system or even something like n00buntu you will have something to worry about. All of these extra 'features' are just making your security harder. Is it any wonder there are so many of these advisories every single day? How many for OS X?

Maybe instead of flaming you might want to do a security course :-P
