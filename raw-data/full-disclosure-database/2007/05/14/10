Of course no operating system is invincible when you have full access 
to the machine. You could just delete all of the files yourself.
OSX isn't using all of the tricks like windows does to try and hide 
executables throughout dlls and other such files. Ever heard of dll 
hell? No wonder these machines are broken into so often.
The point is what would you rather have 1000 windows machines 1000 
linux machines or 1000 OSX machines? If you wanted to not be infected 
I'd be taking the OSX machines for sure, otherwise if you want to get 
these kind of kernel rootkit tricks of JOquendo or something like 
rhosts for your life then you would choose one of the linux 
distributions.
What next are you going to virtualise this and run them all on the 
same host? Frankly, it really doesnt matter what your guest server is 
running if your host is broken :-)
