Hello hotshot,

In fact I was discussing the execshield implementation that's currently 
shipping in FC6 and the about-to-escape FC7, and you weren't more than 
happy to listen.  The comment about FC3 was in addition to the 
still-present issues I discussed and was mentioned in the same area 
since I noted the PIE binary non-determinism at the same time.
Maybe you should read first, and open your mouth afterwards.
