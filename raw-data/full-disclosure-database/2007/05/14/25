Dude, Fedora Core 3 was like 2 frikking years ago.  I suppose it's OK
for us to diss the grsecurity patch today because there were bugs in 2.1.5?
(I have a grsecurity-2.1.5-2.6.11.9-200505121617.patch.gz hanging around
which dates back to just about the same time as FC3 was released).

Now if you want to discuss the execshield implementation that's currently
shipping in FC6 or the about-to-escape FC7, we'll be more than happy to listen.
