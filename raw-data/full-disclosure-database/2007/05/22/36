Chaos Communication Camp 2007
"In Fairy Dust We Trust!"
August, 8th to 12th, 2007
Airport Museum Finowfurt (Finow Airport) near Berlin, Germany

http://events.ccc.de/camp/2007/

Final Call for Paper Deadline: June 5th 2007, 23:59 CET

===Overview===

The Chaos Communication Camp is an international, five-day open-air
event for hackers, builders, and makers organized by the Chaos
Computer Club (CCC). The camp provides a relaxed atmosphere for free
exchange of technical, social and political ideas. Discuss, sunbathe,
and enjoy camping with some of the most interesting people you might
ever meet. And all that with internet, power, an abundance of weird
self-made gadgets, and people willing to explain them to you, right
next to your tent.

The Camp area is themed as a starship launch site and split into
various thematic villages organized by participating groups from all
over the world. Have a look at the incredible new location, right next
to an old Russian military airfield (we'll launch drones and UFOs - no
kidding!). All this together with vintage MiG fighter planes the
Soviet airforce left there when they left East Germany and
helicopters, oh my!

Two huge main hangars (room for 400 people each) will feature
conference tracks with lectures and presentations, while workshops
will take place in a central workshop area and in the various
villages.
To get a first glimpse of what to expect have a look at our
self-organizing participants at the Camp Wiki:
http://events.ccc.de/camp/2007/Villages.

Furthermore there will be a hangar for not-so-lonely hacking nights
and days together with hundreds of others, and a hangar featuring art
and beauty created with or without a computer. Of course there will
also be a lounge with nice electronic music, German beer, great food,
and a choice of caffeinated hacker drinks.

The conference languages are English and German. Don't worry about
language issues though - the Camp is a truly international event!
Everyone will be happy to communicate with you in the languages of the
Internet - broken English and 1337speak.

===Topics===

In general, lectures and workshops dealing with technology, ethics,
science, security, art, philosophy, politics, culture and cooking are
welcome.

The main theme of this year's camp is the world we want to live in
tomorrow. Any cool tech, research, ideas, and presentations
interesting to our audience, are interesting to us.

And even beyond the presentations, the camp lives from participation,
so bring those gadgets, Go boards, webapps, p2p-simulators, knitted
hardware protectors, drones, and lockpicking sets, and expect people
to come to you wanting to learn more.

===Travel===

For this year's Camp there's a special travel opportunity. The Hacker
Foundation (http://hackerfoundation.org) has put together a package of
nothing less than legendary proportions. For US$1337 (roundtrip from
the US and Canada) or &euro;1337 (roundtrip from Europe) you get
admission to both the Camp and the Defcon hacker conference in Las
Vegas just a few days before the Camp, a flight from Defcon to
Frankfurt (Germany) and from there directly to Finow Airfield on a
specially chartered "Hackers on a Plane" flight. This offer includes
optional accomodation at the Camp. See for yourself:

For general travel Information see http://events.ccc.de/camp/2007/Getting_there

===Lecture Requirements===

Lectures are expected to be highly relevant in practice or better be
darn funny. Sales droids and PR-people have been known to disappear
without traces on past events. Interactive workshops are welcome.
Hands-on anything are even more welcome.

Final presentations for talks should be up to 60 minutes, for
workshops up to 60 or 120 minutes long. Additionally, a
question-and-answer period will be provided. Follow-up discussions and
hands-on workshops are strongly encouraged, there will be space for
such activities available outside the main lecture shelters (if you
don't prefer a nice sit-in on the grass in the sun).

Audio and video recordings of the lectures will be published online in
various formats. All material will be available under a Creative
Commons licence allowing free non-commercial redistribution of the
material as long as the original credit to authors and publishers is
retained.

===Submissions===

All proposals MUST be submitted online using our lecture submission
system at https://pentabarf.cccv.de/submission/Camp+2007 . Please
follow the instructions given there. You can provide papers and slides
for the digital conference pack upon submission. Please make sure your
submission contains all information we need to review your talk and
send us everything in one go.

If you have any questions regarding your submission, feel free to
contact us at camp-content@...v.de but do NOT submit your lecture via
e-mail.

Accepted speakers are asked to hand in slides used in their talks.
Please use a well-known format for your slides.

===Dates and deadlines===
