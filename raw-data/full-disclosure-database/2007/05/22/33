Subject: what is it about mi5 and inverness?

either all the terrorists live in inverness or there are a lot of secret
agents belonging to mi5 there or potential recruits wanting to sign up for
the british security service in inverness.

no other result i researched on the new google trends service related to
security had an overwhelming search trend from one geographical location.
