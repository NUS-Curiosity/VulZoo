Subject: Unicode Left/Right Pointing Double Angel
	Quotation Mark bypass?

Dear full-disclosure@...ts.grok.org.uk,

  By  the  way:  I saw Unicode Left Pointing Double Angel Quotation Mark
  (%u00AB) / Unicode Right Pointing Double Angel Quotation Mark (%u00BB)
  are  sometimes  translated  to '<' and '>'. Does somebody experimented
  with

  %u00ABscript%u00BB

  in different environments to bypass filtering in this way?
