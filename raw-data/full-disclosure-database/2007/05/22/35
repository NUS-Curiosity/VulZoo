We invite you to attend DIMVA 2007. The annual DIMVA conference
serves as a premier forum for advancing the state of the art in
intrusion detection, malware detection, and vulnerability
assessment. Each year DIMVA brings together international experts
from academia, industry and government to present and discuss novel
research in these areas. DIMVA is organized by the special interest
group "Security - Intrusion Detection and Response" of the German
Informatics Society (GI). 

This year's conference will take place on July 12 - 13, 2007, at the
University of Applied Sciences and Arts Lucerne (HTA Lucerne) in
Switzerland. DIMVA 2007's technical program will consist of five
sessions covering web security, intrusion detection, traffic
analysis, as well as host & network security. Please refer to
http://www.dimva.org/dimva2007 for a complete list of all
presentations accepted by DIMVA's program committee.

DIMVA 2007 will also feature three invited talks by renowned experts:

* Vern Paxson, International Computer Science Institute & Lawrence
  Berkeley National Laboratory. (Keynote)

* Marcelo Masera, Institute for the Protection and Security of the
  Citizen at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. 

* Peter Trachsel, Deputy Head of Federal Strategic Unit for IT,
  Switzerland.

The conference program will be complemented by 

* a Rump Session: a series of short and entertaining talks where
  attendees can present recent research results, work in progress,
  or other topics of interest to the community. 

  Please contact the Rump Session Chair, Sven Dietrich, at
  rump@...va.org for submission questions.

* CIPHER 3: a "Capture The Flag"-style contest in IT security for
  teams of students from universities around the world. CIPHER is
  co-arranged by GI SIG SIDAR and the Security and Privacy Research
  Group of the RWTH Aachen University. 
  
  Registration for CIPHER 3 is now open. For details, see
  
               http://www.cipher-ctf.org 

* a conference dinner on lovely Mount Pilatus. A gondola ride will
  bring all attendees there after the first day's technical
  sessions.

The registration for the conference is now open; early registration
discounts are available until June 10, 2007. Please check the DIMVA
web site for the detailed conference program as well as information
