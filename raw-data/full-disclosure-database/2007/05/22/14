Subject: Re: noise about full-width encoding bypass?

Dear Brian Eaton,

Converting  e.g.  Unicode  full-width  'A'  into ASCII 'A' is definitely
valid and expected behavior. A bug is using unfiltered input in HTML/SQL
generation.  As for inability of content filter to catch this situation,
it's just one more way to bypass it. See
