    >>But if all you're trying to do is retrieve SMS messages, it'd be a lot
     easier to just subpoena the carrier .. they keep the contents forever
     (even if they say they don't .. I know for a fact they do because I
     personally saw one of the major US carriers .. [ahem.. Verizon] ..
     deliver boxes of sent/received text messages -- for hundreds of phones
     -- going back at least a year).<<

What cases was this for?  I would love to see some paperwork to back this
up. The only messaging kept we could find is through Verisign, (yes
Verisign) they provide the inter-carrier messaging.  However, they only keep
the record of the "headers", not the actual body of the message.

Can you provide some details?
