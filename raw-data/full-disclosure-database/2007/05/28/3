Yes. And for typical systems, that also includes all of the mass storage
(i.e. the file systems) attached to it: your software needs to require
every single byte of data storage. I think such a system would come
close to have a self-provable integrity, but such a system must be
extremely carefully designed for it, and notably is non-expandable. Any
expansion breaks down the proved state by introducing external
unvalidated states, and you're back to square one.

Being able to validate the integrity of a system requires *at least* the
entire potential system, which is why systems in general cannot
self-prove: they require more than themselves.
