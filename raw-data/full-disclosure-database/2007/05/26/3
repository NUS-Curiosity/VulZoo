>>From a theoretical POV, it might be possible do it with a program
requiring all memory of the tested system (*all* memory, including memory
occupied by existing data -- whether it is possible to reconstruct them
after the fact is a different question...) to compute a correct result.
Several difficult conditions would have to be satisfied:

1. the program must be optimal, i.e. it is impossible to compute the 
correct result in less space (including the space occupied by the code 
of the program),

2. at some point during the computation, the contents of all memory 
(including the code of the program) must have maximum Kolmogorov 
complexity, i.e. it is impossible to simulate extra memory through data 
compression,

3. the system must be isolated, i.e. it is impossible to simulate extra
memory through interaction with the rest of the world. 

These condition might be made somewhat weaker by taking time into account 
and allowing the simulation of extra memory as long as it is impossible 
to do it quickly enough.
