Synopsis
========

The Blackdown JDK and the Blackdown JRE suffer from the multiple
unspecified vulnerabilities that already affected the Sun JDK and JRE.

Background
==========

Blackdown provides implementations of the Java Development Kit (JDK)
and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /    Vulnerable    /           Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-java/blackdown-jdk     < 1.4.2.03-r14         >= 1.4.2.03-r14
  2  dev-java/blackdown-jre     < 1.4.2.03-r14         >= 1.4.2.03-r14
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Chris Evans has discovered multiple buffer overflows in the Sun JDK and
the Sun JRE possibly related to various AWT and font layout functions.
Tom Hawtin has discovered an unspecified vulnerability in the Sun JDK
and the Sun JRE relating to unintended applet data access. He has also
discovered multiple other unspecified vulnerabilities in the Sun JDK
and the Sun JRE allowing unintended Java applet or application resource
acquisition. Additionally, a memory corruption error has been found in
the handling of GIF images with zero width field blocks.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted Java applet
or application that could read, write, or execute local files with the
privileges of the user running the JVM, access data maintained in other
Java applets, or escalate the privileges of the currently running Java
applet or application allowing for unauthorized access to system
resources.

Workaround
==========

Disable the "nsplugin" USE flag in order to prevent web applets from
being run.

Resolution
==========

Since there is no fixed update from Blackdown and since the flaw only
occurs in the applets, the "nsplugin" USE flag has been masked in the
portage tree. Emerge the ebuild again in order to fix the
vulnerability. Another solution is to switch to another Java
implementation such as the Sun implementation (dev-java/sun-jdk and
dev-java/sun-jre-bin).

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/blackdown-jdk"
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/blackdown-jre"
