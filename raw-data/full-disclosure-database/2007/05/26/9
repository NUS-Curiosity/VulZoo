Briefly:
1. Secure your php install - turn off allow_url_fopen and
allow_url_include in php.ini
2. Make sure your PHP app is not vulnerable - an attacker shouldn't be
able to control what's included. This should protect you from local
file inclusion as well.
3. Use suhosin and/or mod_security
4. (maybe) configure your firewall to disallow outbound connections
initiated by the webserver

cheers,
 Jamie
