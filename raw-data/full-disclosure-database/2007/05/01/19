Given the number of programs I've filed "Version XYZ segfaults under conditions
A, B, and C" bug reports, compared to the number of things that were obviously
exploitable, I have to conclude that either I'm a lot worse than Joe Programmer
at identifying what's exploitable, or that a lot of *other* programmers are
filing "Version XYZ segfaults" bug reports without understanding if they're
exploitable - and quite often the segfault gets *fixed* as "just a segfault"
rather than as a security-level bug.
