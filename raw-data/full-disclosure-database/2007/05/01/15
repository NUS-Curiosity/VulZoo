I saw this on television a few weeks ago. A lot of it is a bit
far-fetched IMO. But your point to IT security and how important of a
role it will play is definitely right. Not many people understand
whats at risk. Maybe the Discovery channel will make a show about
computer security that doesn't involve a boring story from 1996 :-\
