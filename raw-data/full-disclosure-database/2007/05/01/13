Subject: 2057 - The City

I stumbled across this documentary about cities of the future. For
those who hasn't seen it yet, it is highly recommend. It will take
only 43:29 minutes of your time. Believe me, it is worth looking at.

It is quite exciting to look into stuff that may happen in the future.
This documentary, in particular, is interesting because it depicts
what will happen when our highly computerized world crashes and burns.
Everything is so much dependent on IT security and I am not sure
whether people realize it.

So, I am not going to spam you more with this message. Those who are
