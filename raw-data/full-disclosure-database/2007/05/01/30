Subject: Re: Firefox 2.0.0.3 Out-of-bounds memory access
	via	specialy crafted html file

Nothing exciting to report on OS X 10.4 / fully patched / PPC. Kind of 
broke the properties dialog for the link, and used some cpu, but 
definitely caused no crashing.

On WinXP Norton real time protection detected the file in cache as a 
'hack tool.' I disabled that, but Firefox refused to return to the page 
afterward.
