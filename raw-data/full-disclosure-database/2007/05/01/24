Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ktorrent allowing for
the remote execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Ktorrent is a Bittorrent client for KDE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-p2p/ktorrent       < 2.1.3                           >= 2.1.3

Description
===========

Bryan Burns of Juniper Networks discovered a vulnerability in
chunkcounter.cpp when processing large or negative idx values, and a
directory traversal vulnerability in torrent.cpp.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to download a specially crafted
torrent file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Ktorrent.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ktorrent users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-p2p/ktorrent-2.1.3"
