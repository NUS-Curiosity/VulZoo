Subject: CyTRAP Labs - Urs+Nahum's Security Checklist



Dear Colleagues,

I thought this might be of interest....regulators have done their best to 
improve legislation to help organizations to better protect their 
information systems.

Unfortunately and as a result of this, organizations have been buried in an 
avalanche of conflicting requirements that are difficult to keep track 
off.  They are expected to demonstrate an acceptable standard of due care 
in managing their computing infrastructures and the information that 
networks and systems create, transmit, and store. Moreover, they have to 
show that all this helps reduce the risk against having their systems 
misused for criminal activities.

Hence, we thought we write Urs+Nahum's Security Checklist. It provides well 
structured information that enables high-level reporting, thus empowering 
executive and technical leaders with a greater ability to make informed 
decisions. It prioritizes numerous requirements that managers need, guiding 
them through the process that improves corporate risk management and 
information security while helping improve confidentiality of data and 
citizens' privacy.

You can get a short summary here:

it will be useful to you all.... in your daily work. Please let us know

Enjoy your long weekend.


Cordially
