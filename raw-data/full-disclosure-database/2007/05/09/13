Symantec Norton Internet Security 2006 COM Object Security ByPass
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 05.09.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 09, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Norton Internet Security 2006 is a comprehensive system security suite
that offers protection from spyware, viruses, identity theft, spam, and
malicious network traffic. More information can be found on the vendors
site at the following URL.

http://www.symantec.com/home_homeoffice/products/overview.jsp?pcid=is&pvid=nis2006

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a design error vulnerability in an ActiveX
control installed by Symantec Norton Internet Security 2006 could allow
for the execution of arbitrary code.

Norton Internet Security 2006 installs the following ActiveX control
which is registered as safe for scripting:

  Progid: Symantec.Norton.AntiVirus.NAVOptions
  Clsid: 085ABFE2-D753-445C-8A2A-D4BD46CE0811
  File: C:\Program Files\Norton Internet Security\Norton
AntiVirus\NAVOpts.dll
  Version: 12.2.0.13

This control was designed for use in a application embedded web browser
rather than a native Internet Explorer window. When this control is
loaded in a standard browser window, it throws an error during
initialization which leaves the browser in a defunct state. After the
error dialog displays, other Symantec ActiveX Controls can be created
without error even if they are not marked as safe for scripting. This
can lead to remote code execution if the unsafe controls contain
exploitable methods.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows malicious websites to load certain Symantec ActiveX
Controls which were not designed or secured for web use.

This condition can lead to the execution of arbitrary code in situations
where unsafe controls contain exploitable vulnerabilities.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability within version
12.2.0.13 of NavOpts.dll as distributed with Norton Internet Security
2006. Prior versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Setting the kill-bit for the ActiveX control will prevent this component
from loading in Internet Explorer. Although this will prevent potential
exploitation, it may also negatively impact the functionality of the
application.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Symantec has addressed this vulnerability with a software update. The
update is available via their LiveUpdate channels. For more
