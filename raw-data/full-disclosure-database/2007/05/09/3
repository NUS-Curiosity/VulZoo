Subject: Local police hacking,now?

Just read an article about local police being able(by law)to hack a 
suspects box from the net.

Really makes you wonder where the real problem lies.They(F-Secure)did a 
poll to gauge public response.

Take a look and say what you feel:

Mikko Hypponen wrote an article in SC magazine where he said,"Police are 
generally  trained in law enforcement and criminal investigation,not 
data security.".
"Online house searches",as they are called are already happening!DUH!

But do you want your local police hacking people,or would you rather 
just leave it to the NSA?Hmmmm.

Just a thought,
  Scott
