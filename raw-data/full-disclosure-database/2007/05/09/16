 Word RTF File Parsing Heap Corruption Vulnerability

Microsoft Word RTF File Parsing Heap Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 05.08.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 08, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Word is a word processing application from Microsoft Office.
Rich Text Format (RTF) is a document file format developed by Microsoft
for cross-platform document interchange. For more information about
Microsoft Word, see following web site.

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/default.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap corruption vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Word could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code under the
privileges of the target user.

This vulnerability specifically exists in the handling of property
strings of certain control words in an RTF document. In certain
circumstances, these property strings can be written into a memory
region which has already been deallocated and heap corruption can
occur.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code on the affected host within the context of the
user who opened the malicious RTF document with Microsoft Word.

Microsoft Word, if installed, will be the default application for
opening RTF files. If Microsoft Word is not installed, WordPad will be
the default application for opening RTF files, which is not vulnerable
to this attack.

Exploitation requires that the user opens a specially crafted RTF
document with a vulnerable application. The most likely exploitation
vector involves convincing a user to open an RTF document sent to them
via e-mail, or linked on a website.

Enabling hardware Data Execution Prevention (DEP) on systems that
support it (i.e., Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 on
hardware with AMD processors supporting NX or Intel processors
supporting XD) mitigates this vulnerability. While it may be possible
for attackers to bypass this protection, it can prevent some typical
exploitation methods.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed that winword.exe file version 11.0.8106.0, as
included with a fully patched Microsoft Word 2003 SP2, is vulnerable.
Previous versions of Microsoft Word are also likely to be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Since WordPad.exe is not affected by this vulnerability, changing the
default association for RTF files to use WordPad is considered an
effective workaround. However, simply changing the file extension can
bypass this workaround.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Microsoft has addressed this vulnerability within MS07-024. For more
