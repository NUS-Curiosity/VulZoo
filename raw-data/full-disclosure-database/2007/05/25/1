With those budget services like bluehost and dreamhost, lots of people
are renting servers and installing Wordpress (and other services) but
it's a one-click procedure (thanks Fantastico). 

They barely know how to log into their servers. don't have idea about
security, upgrades, etc. 

The bad guys are looking into it and I believe they'll love their (not
so) new playground.
