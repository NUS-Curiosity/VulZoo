"As long as there is technology, there will be hackers. As long as 
there
are hackers, there will be PHRACK magazine. We look forward to the 
next
20 years"

This is how the PHRACK63 Introduction was ending, telling everybody 
that
the Staff would have changed and to expect a release sometimes in
2006/2007. This is that release. This is the new staff, "The Circle 
of
Lost Hackers". Every new management requires a presentation and we 
decided
to do it by Prophiling ourselves. Useless to say, we'll keep 
anonymous,
mainly for security reasons that everyone understands.

Being anonymous doesn't mean at all being closed. Phrack staff has 
always
evolved, and will always evolve, depending on who really care about 
being
a smart-ass. The staff will always receive new people that cares 
about
writing cool articles, meet new authors and help them at publishing 
their
work in the best conditions. Grantee of freedom of speech will be
preserved. It is the identity of our journal.

Some people were starting to say that phrack would have never 
reborn. That
there would have never been a PHRACK64 issue. We heard that while 
we were
working on, we smiled and kept going on. Some others were saying 
that the
spirit was lost, that everything was lost.

No, Phrack is not dead. Neither is the spirit in it.

All the past Phrack editors have done a great work, making the 
Phrack
Magazine "the most technical, most original, the most Hacker 
magazine in
the world", written by the Underground for the Underground.
We are in debt with them, every single hacker, cracker or researcher
of the Underground should feel in debt with them.
For the work they did.
For the spirit they contributed to spread.
For the possibility of having a real Hacker magazine.

No, nothing is or was ever lost. Things change, security becomes a
business, some hackers sell exploits, others post for fame, but 
Phrack is
here, totally free, for the community. No business, no industry, no 
honey,
baby. Only FREEDOM and KNOWLEDGE.

We know the burden of responsibility that we have and that's why we 
worked
hard to bring you this release. It wasn't an easy challenge at all, 
we
have lost some people during those months and met new ones. We 
decided to
make our first issue without a "real" CFP, but just limit it to the
closest people we had in the underground. A big thank to everyone 
who
participated. We needed to understand who really was involved and 
who was
lacking time, spirit or motivation: having each one a lot of work 
to do
(writing, reviewing, extending and coding) was the best way to 
succeed in
that. This is not a "change of direction", next issues will have 
their
official CFP and whatever article is (and has always been) welcome.

We know that we have a lot to learn, we're improving from our 
mistakes and
from the problems we've been facing. Aswell, we know that this 
release is
not "the perfect one", but we think that the right spirit is there 
and so
is the endeavor. The promise to make each new release a better one 
is a
challenge that we want to win.

No, Phrack is not dead. And will never die.
Long live to PHRACK.
