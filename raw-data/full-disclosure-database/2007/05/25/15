Well, in fact you can easily recover the data directly on the phone using
something like FExplorer and an hex editor
just take a look at the files in the subfolders of C:\system\Mail

(hint hint: you can also copy attached files over to anywhere on the FS from
there)

what really sucks about this "feature" is that these apparently "deleted"
sms take space on the device with every attachment they have, even though
they've been deleted and they won't be overwritten because as files, they
haven't been deleted

Content of type "text/html" skipped
