Welcome to Phrack Pro-Phile. Phrack Pro-Phile is created to bring
info to you, the users, about old and highly important controversial
peoples. The first Phrack Pro-Phile was created in Phrack Issue 4 by
Taran King. Since this date, a total of 43 profile were realized. 
Some
well know hackers were profiled like Taran King, The Mentor,
Knigh Lighting, Lex Luthor, Emmanuel Goldstein, Erik Bloodaxe,
Control-C, Mudge, Aleph-One, Route, Voyager, Horizon or more
recently Scut.

This prophile is probably a little more different since it will 
introduce
the new staff. Since the people composing The Circle of Lost Hackers
want to stay anonymous, the Prophile will be more a "question-
answer"
prophile.

Open Interview
--------------

Q: Hello
A: Saluto amigo!

Q: Can you introduce yourselves in a few words?
A: The Circle of Lost Hackers is a group of friends overall. Two 
years 
   ago when TESO decided to stop Phrack, the voice of the 
underground  
   decided not to let Phrack dying. People started to wonder .. 
Phrack is
   really dead ? In no way it is. Phrack reborns, always, from the 
influence
   of multiple hacking crews to make this possible. But at the 
beginning it was not easy to
   create a new team, a lot of people agreed to continue Phrack but 
not
   really to write or review articles. Also, one of the most 
important
   thing was to have people with the good spirit. Now we think that
   we have a good team and we hope bring to the Underground scene a 
lot 
   of quality papers like in old issues of Phrack, but keeping the 
technical
   touch that makes Phrack a unique hacking magazine. The Phrack 
staff evolves
   and will always evoluate a new talents get interested in sharing 
for fun
   and free information.

Q: How many people are composing The Circle of Lost Hackers?
A: We could tell you, but we would have to kill you, after. The only
   important thing is that  "The Circle of Lost Hackers" is not a
   restricted club. More people will join us, others may leave, 
depending
   on who really believes in comunication, hacking and freedom of 
research
   and information. 


Q: When did you start to play with computers and to learn hacking?
A: Each one of us could answer differently. There's not a "perfect" 
age to
   start, neither it is ever too late to start. Hacking is 
researching. It
   is being so obstinated on resolving and understanding things to 
spend
   nights over a code, a vulnerability, an electronic device, an 
idea. 

   Hacking is something you have inside, maybe you'll never take a
   computer or write a code, but if you've an "hacking mind" it will
   reveal itself, sooner or later. 

   To give you an idea of the first computers of some members of the
   team, it was a 286, 486 SX or an Amiga 1000. Each of us started
   to play with computer at the end of 80' or beginning of 90'. The
   hacking life of our team started more or less around 97. Like 
with
   a lot of people, Phrack and 2600 mag were and are a great source 
of 
   inspiration, as well as IRC and reading source code.


Q: What's the story of your "hacking career" ?
A: [maybe explain that we start with stupid things, after we 
discovered phrack
    and real hacking techniques, we read a lot, joined a group (or 
made a group)
    meet new people, start new group, hack a lot, etc. Be original 
!]


Q: This interview is quite strange, you do the questions and the
   answers at the same time ?!?!
A: What's the problem, in phrack issue 20 Taran King did a prophile
   of himself!!!


Q: Can you tell us what is your most memorable experience?
A: Each of us has a lot of memorable experiences but we don't 
really have
   a common experience where we hacked all together. So to make 
easy we are 
   going to take three of our "memorable" experiences.
       
   1.
   A subtle modification about p0f wich made me finding documents 
   that I wasn't supposed to find. Some years ago, I had a period 
when 
   each month I tried to focus on the security of one country. One 
of
   those countries was South-Korea where I owned a big ISP. After 
   spending some time to figure out how I could leave the DMZ and 
enter
   in the LAN, I succeed thanks to a cisco modification (I like
   default passwords). Once in the LAN and after hiding my activity
   (userland > kernelland), I installed a slightly modification of
   p0f. The purpose if this version was to scan automatically all 
   the windows box found on the network, mount shared folders and 
   list all files in these folders. Nothing fantastic. But one of 
   the computers scanned contained a lot of files about the other
   Korea... North Korea. And trust me, there were files that I
   wasn't supposed to find. I couldn't believe it. I could do the 
   evil guy and try to sell these files for money, but I had (and 
   I still have) a hacker ethic. So I simply added a text file on 
   the desktop to warn the user of the "flaw". After that I left 
   the network and I didn't come back. It was more than 5 years 
   ago so don't ask me the name of the ISP I can't remember.

   2. 
   [sauron can you add one?]

   3.
   Learning hacking by practice with some of the best hackers world-
wide.
   Sometimes you think you know something but its almost always 
possible to find
   someone who prove you the opposite. Wether we talk about hacking 
a very
   big network with many thousands of accounts and know exactly how 
to handle
   this in minuts in the stealthiest manner, or about auditing 
source code
   and find vulnerability in a daemon server or Operating System 
used by 
   millions of peoples on the planet, there is always someone to 
find that
   outsmart you, when you thought being one of the best in what you 
are doing. 
   I do not want to enter in detail to avoid compromising anyone's 
integrity,
   but the best experience are those made of small groups (3, 4 ..) 
of hackers,
   working on something in common (hacking, exploits, coding, 
audits ..), for
   example in a screen session. Learning by seing the others do. 
Teaching 
   younger hackers. Sharing knowledge in a very restricted personal 
area.
   Partying in private with hackers from all around the world and 
getting 0day
   found, coded, and used in a single hacking session. 


Q: Is one of you has been busted in a previous life?
A: Hope no but who knows?


Q: What do you think about the current scene?
A: We think a lot of things, probably the best answer is to read the
   article "A brief history of the Underground" in this issue where 
   we are talking about the scene and the Underground.

   
Q: What's your opinion about old phracks?
A: Great. Old phracks were the first source of information when we 
were
   starving for more to learn. _The_ point of reference. But don't 
stop
   yourselves to the last 10 issues, all issues are still 
interesting.


Q: And about PHC?
A: Well, thats an interesting question. To be honest, PHC did not 
just do
   those bad things we were used to learn from the web or irc, we 
like some
   of them and even know very well a few others. Also, the two 
attempted 
   issues 62 and 63 of PHC had an incontestable renew in the spirit 
and t
   here were even some useful information on honeypots and 
protecting exploits. 

   However, we have a problem with unjustified arrogance. If it's 
true the 
   security world has a problem with white/black hats, we think 
that the good 
   way to resolve the problem is not to fight everyone, especially 
such a poor 
   demonstrative way. It's not our conception of hacking. Take the 
first 20 issues 
   of Phrack and try to find unjustified arrogant 
word/sentence/paragraph: you won't 
   find any. The essence of hacking is different : it's learning. 
Hacking to learn. 

   You can be a blackhat and working in the IT industry, it's
   not incompatible. We have nothing against PHC and we think the
   Underground needs a group like PHC. But the Underground needs a 
magazine
   like Phrack as well. The main battle of PHC is fighting 
whitehats but
   it's not Phrack's battle. It's never been the purpose of Phrack. 
   If we have to fight against something, it's against the society 
and 
   not targeting whitehats personally (that doesn't mean that we 
support 
   whitehat...). Phrack is about fighting the society by releasing 
information 
   about technologies that we are not supposed to learn. And these 
technologies 
   are not only Unix-related and/or software vulnerabilities.

   We agree with them when they say that recent issues of Phrack 
helped 
   probably too much the security industry and that there was a 
lack of 
   spirit. We're doing our best to change it. But we still need 
technical 
   articles. If they want to change something in the Underground, 
they are 
   welcome to contribute to Phrack. Like everyone in the 
Underground 
   community.


Q: Full-disclosure or non-disclosure? 
A: Semi-disclosure. For us, obviously. Free exchange of techniques, 
ideas
   and codes, but not ready-to-use exploit, neither ready-to-patch
   vulnerabilities.

   Keep your bugs for yourself and for your friend, do the best to 
not
   make them leak. If you're cool enough, you'll find many and 
you'll be
   able to patch your boxes.

   Disclosing techniques, ideas and codes implementations helps the 
other
   Hackers in their work, disclosing bugs or releasing "0-day" 
exploits
   helps only the Security Industry and the script kiddies.
   And we don't want that.

   You might be an Admin, you might be thinking : "oh, but my box 
is not
   safe if i don't know about vulnerabilities". That's true, but 
remember
   that if only very skilled hackers have a bug you won't have to 
face a
   "rm -rf" of the box or a web defacement. That's kiddies game, not
   Hackers one.

   But that's our opinion. You might have a totally different one 
and we
   will respect it. You might even want to release a totally 
unknown bug
   on Phrack's pages and, if you write a good article, we'll help 
you in
   publishing it. Maybe discussing the idea, before.

   As we said in the introduction, the first thing we want to 
garantee
   is freedom of speech. That's the identity of our journal.


Q: What's the best advice that you can give to new generation of 
hackers?
A: First of all, enjoy hacking. Don't do that for fame or to earn 
more
   money, neither to impress girl (hint: not always works ;)) or 
only to
   be published somewhere. Hack for yourself, hack for your 
interest, hack
   to learn. 

   Second, be careful. In every thing you do, in any relationship 
you'll
   have. Respect people and try to not distrupt their work only 
because
   you're distracted or angry. 

   Third, have fun. Have a lot of fun.

   And never, never, never setup an honeypot (hi Lance!).


Q: What do you think about starting an Underground World Revolution
   Movement against the establishment ?
A: Do it. But do it Underground. The nowadays world is too obsessed 
by
   "visibility". Act, let the others talk.


Q: What's the future of hacking ?
A: The future is similar to the present and to the past. "Hacking" 
is the
   resulting mix of curiosity and research for information, fun and 
   freedom. Things change, security evolves and so does technology, 
but the
   "hacker-mind" is always the same. There will always be hackers, 
that is
   skilled people who wants to understand how things really go.

   To be more concrete, we think that the near future will see way 
more
   interest in hardware and embedded systems hacking : hardware chip
   modification to circumvent hardware based restrictions, mobile 
and
   mobile services exploits/attacks, etc.
   
   Moreover, seems like more people is hacking for money (or, at 
least,
   that's more "publicly" known), selling exploits or backdoors. 
Money is
   usually the source of many evils. It is indeed a good motivating 
factor
   (moreover hacking requires time and having that time payed when 
you
   don't have any other work is really helpful), but money brings 
with
   itself the business mind. People who pays hackers aren't 
interested in
   research, they are interested in business. They don't want to 
pay for
   months of research that lead to a complex and eleet tecnique, 
they want
   a simple php bug to break into other companies website and 
change the
   homepage. They want visible impact, not evolved culture. 

   We're not for the "hacking-business" idea, you probably realized 
that.
   We're not for exploit disclosure too, unless the bug is already 
known
   since time and showing the exploit code would let better 
understand the
   coding techniques involved. And we don't want that someone with 
a lot of
   money (read : governement and big companies) will be one day 
able to
   "pay" (and thus "buy") all the hackers around. 

   But we're sure that that will never happen, thanks to the 
underground,
   thanks to people like you who read phrack, learn, create and hack
   independently.



Q: Do you have some people or groups to mention ?
A: (mentioning some people and say what do u thing about them, phc, 
etc)
  
   There are groups and people who have made (or are making) the 
effective
   evolving of the scene. We try to tell a bit of their story in
   "International Scenes" phile (starting from that issue with : 
Australia, 
   New-Zealand, Brazil and France). Each country has its story, 
Italy has s0ftpj 
   and antifork, Germany has TESO, THC and Phenolit (thanks for 
your great 
   ph-neutral party), Russia, France, Netherlands, or Belgium have 
ADM, 
   Synnergy, or Devhell, USA and other countries have PHC...

   Each one will have his space on "International Scenes". If 
you're part
   of it, if you want to tell the "real story", just submit us a 
text. If
   you are too paranoid to submit a tfile to Phrack, its ok. If you 
wish
   to participate to the underground information, how journal is 
your
   journal as well and we can find a solution that keep you 
anonymous.


Q: Thank you for this interview, I hope readers will enjoy it!
A; No problem, you're welcome. Can I have a beer now?
