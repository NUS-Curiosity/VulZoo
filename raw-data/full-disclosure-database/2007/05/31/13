Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in libpng may allow a remote attacker to crash
applications that handle untrusted images.

Background
==========

libpng is a free ANSI C library used to process and manipulate PNG
images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libpng      < 1.2.17                         >= 1.2.17

Description
===========

Mats Palmgren fixed an error in file pngrutil.c in which the trans[]
array might be not allocated because of images with a bad tRNS chunk
CRC value.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could craft an image that when processed or viewed by
an application using libpng causes the application to terminate
abnormally.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Please note that due to separate bugs in libpng 1.2.17, Gentoo does not
provide libpng-1.2.17 but libpng-1.2.18. All libpng users should
upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.18"
