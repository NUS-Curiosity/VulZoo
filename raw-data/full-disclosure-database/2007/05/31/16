           RE:     Certain Prior Notices Concerning the Unauthorized 
Distribution of HBO
                      Television Programming

Dear [me]

           Please be advised that some of the "Notices of Claimed 
Infringement‚Äù previously sent by us regarding infringements of HBO 
programs identified on either the BitTorrent or eDonkey protocols and 
occurring during the period 04/02 to 04/28, inclusive, might have 
incorrect time stamps.  Specifically, the offer to download referenced 
in the notice may have occurred four hours later than the time 
identified in the notice, which in some cases may also affect the 
referenced date.  As a result, out of an abundance of caution, we 
request that you disregard the notices that are described above, 
notwithstanding that we can and do confirm our prior information and 
belief that each such notice accurately identified an IP address owned 
by you that was utilized to offer a download of HBO television 
programming via BitTorrent or eDonkey.
	
           We regret any inconvenience this error may have caused.

           Please direct any inquiries to  Steve Rosenthal, Legal 
Department, Home Box Office, Inc., 1100 Avenue of the Americas, New 
York, NY 10036, 212-512-1780 (phone), 212-512-5854 (fax), email: 
notices@....com.

           Respectfully,

           Mark Weaver
           Enforcement Coordinator
