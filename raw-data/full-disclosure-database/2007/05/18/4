Subject: Microsoft claiming Linux infringing on 235 patents


    Imagine MS claiming patents on Linux(Unix redone)!


If MS can claim patents on an operating system that existed before they 
did,IBM better watch out!MS may claim patent infringements by the 
company that brought Bill Gates and Co. all their fame and fortune!

Wouldn't that be something?I can read the headlines now,"Big Blue being 
sued for infringing on offsprings patents"!LOL!!!

What else are they going to claim?...."We claim patent rights to all 
internet sites,because without MS,there would be no internet for the 
public to peruse".

Would not surprise me.

Regards(and watch your intellectual property closely)
