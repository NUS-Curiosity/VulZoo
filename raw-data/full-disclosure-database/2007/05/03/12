Not exactly, read first link carefully:

Tested on D-Link DSL-G624T
Version: Firmware Version : V3.00B01T01.YA-C.20060616

Discovered by:

Jose Ramon Palanco: jose.palanco(at)eazel(dot).es

These firmware date is even newer than yours :)

Jose  mentions  both  directory  traversal  and  3  examples of crossite
scripting.  Crossite  scripting examples are different from yours though
and require POST request. Your CSS is easier to exploit.

In  fact,  at least Russian D-Link support is very responsive to any bug
report,  but  it  seems  like  only  way  to get a response is to post a
problem on their forum.
