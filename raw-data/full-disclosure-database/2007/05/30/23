I agree, don't you know that these young PhD students had to rack up 
tons of debt and/or get their parents to shell out enough cash to feed a 
small town in a third world country in order to get a piece of paper 
that will apparently allow them to post on a public listserv? Give them 
a break, they've got enough worries.

and to Dr. Neal Krawetz - Stop being an elitist tool.
