Subject: The Next Super JavaScript Malware - the web has
	crashed

http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/the-next-super-worm

In this article I explain a technique that can be used by malicious
minds to build the next generation of JavaScript based malware. The
post is for education purposes and I welcome everyone who has ideas
how to stop these types of attacks to do so by sending an email or
posting a comment. We do really need to start thinking about how to
fight back and start developing strategies that can apply.

cheers
