Subject: Re: The Next Super JavaScript Malware - the web
 has crashed

Dear petko d. petkov,
I don't know if it was your intention, but you're giving a bad name to
xssed.com, which goal is to organize the public XSS vulnerabilities, make
statistics, and first of all to spread education about XSS
vulnerabilities. While the scenario you describe is somehow possible, it
relies on the availability of our web site, and we'd be able to stop it
quickly. Anybody would be able to build such list of XSS list without the
need of our site, and with their own discoveries. I wanted to clarify it.
Anyway i think that everybody here on the list knows the dangers and
advantages of full disclosure..

Kevin
