Subject: Re: [Dailydave] Vulnerabilities Hashes DB needed

Hi Dave,

It wasn't Microsoft this time, it seems they are not the only ones that
call 'buffer overrun' to 'buffer overflow' :)
About the 0days thing, I think that time to time people has to report
some stuff and you well know that there are so many 0days out there,
more 0days than reported vulnerabilities.

This game Mao sounds like fun, so I won't read the rules. :), the
problem is that somebody will have to, otherwise there won't be game to
play :(

Cheers,
  Sergio
