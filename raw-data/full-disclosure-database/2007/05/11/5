Meanwhile, Vint Cerf was estimating 140 *million* compromised hosts,
and they're sure as hell not all Linux boxes.

Those several thousand ssh-pounders are insignificant compared to the overall
problem. In fact, if you estimate that Linux has even a 1% market share, if
Linux was equally heavily exploited, you'd expect to see 1.4 million pwned
Linux boxes, rather than just a "couple of thousand".
