CVE-2007-2522

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Computer Associates AntiVirus Server. User
interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the authentication function of the inoweb
service that listens by default on TCP port 12168. The function copies
both the username and password into fixed-length stack buffers. If an
attacker provides overly long values for these parameters, an
exploitable buffer overflow occurs.

-- Vendor Response:
Computer Associates has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
