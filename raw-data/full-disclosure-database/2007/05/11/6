Title: [CAID 35330, 35331]: CA Anti-Virus, CA Threat Manager, and 
CA Anti-Spyware Console Login and File Mapping Vulnerabilities

CA Vuln ID (CAID): 35330, 35331

CA Advisory Date: 2007-05-09

Reported By: ZDI, iDefense

Impact: Attackers can cause a denial of service or potentially 
execute arbitrary code.

Summary: CA Anti-Virus for the Enterprise, CA Threat Manager, and 
CA Anti-Spyware contain multiple vulnerabilities that can allow an 
attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly execute 
arbitrary code. CA has issued patches to address the 
vulnerabilities.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2007-2522, is due to insufficient 
bounds checking on Console Server login credentials. A remote 
attacker can use carefully constructed authentication credentials 
to cause a stack based buffer overflow, which can potentially 
result in arbitrary code execution.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2007-2523, is due to insufficient 
bounds checking in InoCore.dll. A local attacker can modify the 
contents of a file mapping to cause a stack based buffer overflow, 
which can potentially result in arbitrary code execution. This 
issue only affects CA Anti-Virus for the Enterprise and CA Threat 
Manager.

Mitigating Factors: For CVE-2007-2522, the vulnerability applies 
only to an installation on the x86 platform with the Console 
Server installed.

Severity: CA has given these vulnerabilities a combined High risk 
rating.

Affected Products:
CA Anti-Virus for the Enterprise (formerly eTrust Antivirus) r8
CA Threat Manager (formerly eTrust Integrated Threat Management) r8
CA Anti-Spyware for the Enterprise (formerly eTrust PestPatrol) r8
CA Protection Suites r3

Affected Platforms:
Windows

Status and Recommendation:
CA has issued an update to address the vulnerabilities. The 
patched files are available as part of the product's automatic 
content update. The following components must be enabled in order 
to receive these updates: eTrust ITM Console Server must be 
enabled to receive InoWeb.exe updates, and eTrust ITM Common must 
be enabled to receive InoCore.dll updates.

How to determine if the installation is affected:
1. Using Windows Explorer, locate the files "InoWeb.exe" and 
   "InoCore.dll". By default, the files are located in the 
   "C:\Program Files\CA\eTrustITM" directory.
2. Right click on each of the files and select Properties.
3. Select the Version tab (or the Details tab if you are using 
   Windows Vista).
4. If either file version is earlier than indicated below, the 
   installation is vulnerable.
   File Name	File Version
   InoWeb.exe	8.0.448.0
   InoTask.dll	8.0.448.0

Workaround:
In situations where updating the product is not immediately 
feasible, the following workaround can be used as a temporary 
measure to reduce exposure.

For CVE-2007-2522, filter access to TCP port 12168.
