Subject: Michael Daw Anthology Award

michaeldaw.org is pleased to announce the first "Michael Daw Anthology"
award.

For those of you curious, anthology is a collection of published works. The
original idea behind the michaeldaw.org website was to build stories upon a
fictional hacking icon named, Michael Daw, as well as to host other security
related material. As a close friend pointed out to me, the name is very
relevant "when pondered upon". Some believe that the archangel Michael holds
the keys to the doors of Heaven.
The full details of the competition will be provided soon. We are currently
seeking sponsors to donate towards the winnings.

For those who want to take part, please see the following URL for more
