Exactly, isn't a 10k-strong botnet, kind of the average?

And tons of those children are using old-old-*OLD* worm/bots/whatever 
you want to call them.

Anyway, since you're probably just talking about a large imaginary 
number, I'd say linux hosts for raw processing power (since, if it's an 
AMD box or anything even slightly obscure, it can actually use the 
processor correctly).  Otherwise, in terms of ability to clog a network 
with garbage, I wouldn't care if they were linux or windows, I'd care 
about the speed of their connection.

I think the point is moot, being that we're talking about infecting a 
lot of hosts, your target is Windows...unless you're actually smart, 
then it's Cisco IOS.
