Just to clarify - I meant "mailing list" as in "mailing list 
subscribers". I did not mean "mailing list admin". The websecurity 
moderation is conducted solely for generally keeoing the discussion on 
topic, and with no attempt (I think) in general to verify the accuracy 
of the materials nor their novelty. And I respect that.
