The way I see it, and I think it addresses the rest of your points (in 
your original email) is that the researcher should attempt to find the 
most similar/relevant prior art, and then discuss how (if at all...) 
his/her findings differ. This provides the public with:
- Acknowledgment (and credit) of prior art
- Explanation of what is "really" new

So if say the web-app-sec researcher applies techniques from the AV 
world to the web-app-sec world, he/she should credit the AV prior-art, 
and explain that those techniques are applied in the paper to the 
web-app-sec world, with the twists X, Y and Z.
Or you can say something like: In this research I combine evasion 
techniques A (credit to...), B (credit to...) and C (credit to...) to 
bypass system X.

By subscribing to this scheme, the author makes it much easier to 
evaluate his/her paper. The author does most of the work (finding prior 
art, comparing their findings to prior art), and the readers judge 
whether this is new enough/interesting.

As for research in non-English languages - that's where *I* draw the 
line. I assume that everyone can (and should) read English nowadays, and 
I do not expect anyone to be aware of non-English prior art. However, if 
such prior art becomes known to the author, it's his/her duty to credit 
the authors of such text, of course.
