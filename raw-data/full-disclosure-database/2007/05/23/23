      player

  As many of you may or not know, the Spurs are a big deal here in San
  Antonio. (GO SPURS GO!)
  Anyhow, one of the stars of the Spurs is suing a local computer shop
  for $2 mil.

  From what I understand.....
  They used an off the shelf hard drive to ghost his PC, install a new
  drive and then ghost the image back to the pc. They then accidentally
  sold that hard disk in a pc to some lady. She notices there is stuff
  already on the disk. Opens up my documents and there is a TON of
  personal info on this millionaire nba star....

  From what I understand, it's bad charma coming back to haunt this
  company. everyone on a different list-serv that I am on has nothing but
  bad things to say about them, including former employees :P
