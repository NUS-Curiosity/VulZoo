what Knud was indicating is that rainbow tables work against unsalted
(or minimally salted) targets.  for example, lanman is a great target
- it uses md5, but does not salt.  if you have 200G to spare, this
works great.

properly salted md5 is immune to rainbow table attacks.

(now, as for generating collisions, there have been some nice advances
in md5 tunneling attacks, but the cost is still too large for targeted
md5 collisions iirc.  someone will correct me if i'm wrong, i'm
sure...)
