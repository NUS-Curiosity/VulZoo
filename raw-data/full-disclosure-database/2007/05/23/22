My *point* was that a rainbow attack against is a lot faster than a 
brute-force with JTR or similar. Might as well try the easier options first.

Of course, if the router is "in hand" it's even easier still to reboot 
it into ROMmon and reset the config register, but that's not what the OP 
asked.
