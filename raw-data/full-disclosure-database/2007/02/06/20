Subject: How To Force Your ISP to Stop Child Porn

Team,

The FBI is currently working on tracing the origins of a video where a
2 month old baby is being raped. The source ISP is not cooperating.
This is common.

If you want your isp to reveal the whereabouts of child abusers, put
yourself on the map at http://www.child-safe-isp.com hopefully, a
responsible isp will pop up and get all our business...
