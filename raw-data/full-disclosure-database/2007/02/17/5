Subject: Re: defacements for the installation of malcode

Hi, this is a old known "issue" many defacers put in mirrors some type 
of a trojan or some xss trick to stolen hotmail cookie. If someone like 
a "POC" just take a look in Iskorpitx defacements 
(http://www.zone-h.org/component/option,com_attacks/Itemid,43/filter_defacer,iskorpitx/) 
you will found some of this virus ;-)
Also default hotmail/msn site is vulnerable a xss ;-)
Fix: Just disable java runtime machine and never open a link with some 
char codes
Best Regards
