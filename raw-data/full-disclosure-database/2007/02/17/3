Noisy only on the screen/email output. However, notice that *only* the
IP addresses found running Solaris telnet servers are written to the
results file ($0.results).

Perhaps we should change it to the following so that only one email is
sent with all the IP addresses found:

#!/bin/bash

# solaris-telnetd-audit.sh

IPSFILE="./ips.lst"; # file containing IPs to scan
MESSAGE="possible-Solaris-telnet-server-found";
EMAIL="youremail@...ain.tld";

for IP in `cat $IPSFILE`
do
        echo "Trying $IP ...";
        if nmap -P0 -n -p23 -sS $IP | grep -i open > /dev/null
        then
                if nmap -P0 -n -p23 -sV $IP | grep -ie 'SunOS' -ie
'Solaris' > /dev/null
                then
                        echo "$MESSAGE -> $IP"; echo $IP >> $0.results;
                fi
        fi
done

cat $0.results | mail -s $MESSAGE $EMAIL


P.S.: I personally like using genip
[http://www.bindshell.net/tools/genip] for generating lists of IP
addresses.
