Subject: Re: Solaris telnet vulnberability - how many on
	yournetwork?

The following script might also help find Solaris telnet servers on
your network.

Note: I give no guarantees that it will work

# solaris-telnetd-audit.sh
IPSFILE="./ip-addresses.lst";
MESSAGE="possible Sun Solaris telned found";
EMAIL="youremail@...ain.com";

for IP in `cat $IPSFILE`
do
        echo "Trying $IP ...";
        if nmap -P0 -n -p23 -sS $IP | grep -i open > /dev/null
        then
                if nmap -P0 -n -p23 -sV $IP | grep -ie 'SunOS' -ie 'Solaris'
                then
                        echo "$MESSAGE on $IP"; echo $IP >>
$0.results; echo $IP | mail -s $MESSAGE $EMAIL
                fi
        fi
done
