                             CALL FOR PAPERS

                                IMF 2007

                      3rd International Conference on
                   IT-Incident Management & IT-Forensics

                           Stuttgart, Germany
                         September 11 - 12, 2007

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information technology has become crucial to almost every part of society.
IT infrastructures have become critical in the world-wide economy, the
financial sector, the health sector, the government's administration, the
military, and the educational sector.

Due to its importance the disruption or loss of IT capabilities results in
a massive reduction of operability.  Hence, IT security is continously
gaining importance.

Although security usually gets involved into the design process of IT
systems nowadays, the process of maintaining security in the operation of IT
infrastructures still lacks the appropriate attendance in most cases.
Especially the capability to manage and respond to IT security incidents and
their forensic analysis is established in the rarest cases. The quickly
rising number of security incidents worldwide makes the implementation of
incident management capabilities essential.

In order to advance the fields of IT-Incident Management and Forensics
the special interest-group Security - Intrusion Detection and Response
(SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI) organises an annual
conference in co-operation with Stuttgart University's Computer
Emergency Response Team (RUS-CERT) and the Fraunhofer Institute for
Industrial Engineering (IAO), bringing together experts from throughout
the world, to discuss the state of the art in the areas of Incident
Management and  IT-Forensics (IMF). IMF promotes collaboration and
exchange of ideas between industry, academia, law-enforcement and other
government bodies.

IMF invites to submit:
----------------------

 - Full papers of up to 20 pages, presenting novel and mature research
   results. 

 - Practice papers of up to 20 pages, describing best practices, case
   studies, lessons learned, or latest developments in technology. 

All submissions must be in English, and in either postscript or PDF
format.  Authors of accepted papers must ensure that their papers will
be presented  at the conference. Presentations should be held in
English.

Submitted full papers must not substantially overlap papers that have
been  published elsewhere or that are simultaneously submitted to a
journal or a conference with proceedings.

Details on the electronic submission procedure as well as detailed
registration information are provided on the conference Web site.
