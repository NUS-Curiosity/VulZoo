Agreed. But it would be nice to receive the credit ;-)

Guilty as charged. I remember working directly with document.location 
(which includes the hostname and path) when I investigated the issue, 
then when I wrote my text I decided that a more elegant way would be 
with the ".search" property, but I failed to verify that it actually 
works. Thanks for pointing this out, and here's the formal errata:

    In 
http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2005-10/msg00030.html, 
the example should be:

    http://target.site/vulnscript.cgi?injectme= 
<http://target.site/vulnscript.cgi?injectme=><script>eval(document.location.substr(...[fill 
in the offset here]...))</script>#...JS payload here...

    Thanks to "pdp (architect)" for pointing this out.  

Regardns,
-Amit
