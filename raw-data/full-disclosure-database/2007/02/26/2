Subject: Cursor Injection - A New Method for Exploiting
	PL/SQL Injection and Potential Defences

Hey all,
I've just put up a paper detailing a new method of exploiting PL/SQL 
injection flaws in Oracle and potential ways to protect against it. The 
method entirely removes the requirement for an attacker to create functions 
to be able to execute arbitrary sql. This should finally put to bed those 
arguments about whether such and such a PL/SQL injection flaw is exploitable 
in practice or not by a user with only the CREATE SESSION system privilege. 
They all are. For anyone going to Blackhat Federal, this'll form part of my 
talk. For anyone that wants, you can get a copy of the paper from 
http://www.databasesecurity.com/ - it's called "Cursor Injection - A New 
Method for Exploiting PL/SQL Injection and Potential Defences".
Cheers,
David Litchfield
