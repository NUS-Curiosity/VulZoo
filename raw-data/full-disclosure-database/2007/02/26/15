Subject: Extracting files from SMB packet captures

I have been working with extracting files from full-content SMB packet
captures. I would like to compare what I have found with other sources to
see how right/wrong I am about a few things.

Does anyone have good sources of examples on pulling files out of SMB packet
captures I can use as a reference? Tools or write ups would be great.

Thanks
Jim
