CVE:    CVE-2007-0819

Intro:

NNM  Remote  Console  is  remote administration tool for HP Network Node
Manager (NNM). Unlike the rest of NNM, it's installed on administrator's
workstation.  7.50  is the latest version of NNM Remote Console, because
console installation can not be upgraded to 7.51.

Vulnerability Description:

The bug is very simple: insecure installation folder permissions. During
installation  of HP Open View Network Node Manager Console this commands
is performed:

C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /C CALL cacls "C:\Program Files\HP OpenView" /T /C /P Everyone:F < "C:\Program Files\HP OpenView\yes.txt" >> "C:\Program Files\HP OpenView\log\setup.log"

This command recursively changes access permissions for

C:\Program Files\HP OpenView

folder to

Everyone:Full Control.

It  makes  it possible for any local user to replace any of HP Open View
executable files or ActiveX components with trojaned/backdoored ones and
gain  permissions of user running any of Open View applications (usually
network administrator user).

And worse: there is service installed into HP Open View folder, namely

HP Open View Shared Trace Service

with executable

C:\Program Files\HP OpenView\bin\ovtrcsvc.exe


It's  executed  with  highest possible Local System account. It makes it
possible  for  any local user to overwrite service executable and obtain
Local System privileges.


Exploit:

1. Rename  ovtrcsvc.exe to ovtrcsvc.old
2. Replace  ovtrcsvc.exe  with  any  application of your choice and
restart system.
3. Reboot (or wait for reboot).

Workaround:

Restore  permission  inheritance  from  parent  folder  for  "C:\Program
Files\HP OpenView\".
