Subject: WHM Exploit question

Is this one of the items patched in the recent update to WHM?
I see no info about it anywhere on the web or the Cpanel forums. Is this a
new 0-Day and if so does anyone know a security contact for Cpanel? Using
the forum, or general address are worthless at times.

Thanks

Steve
