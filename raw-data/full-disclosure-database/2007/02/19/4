On the talk schedule so far we have Zac showing some new access control 
stuff (this is a 'must see'), and no doubt Alien will come up with 
something cool for his regular 'Ask Alien' spot... :)

All are welcome, particularly if you've got something to talk about, but 
don't be shy if you haven't... We will apply alcohol and other 
lubricants until you loosen up... :)

Hope to see you there... More info here: http://www.dc4420.org

cheers,
Adam
