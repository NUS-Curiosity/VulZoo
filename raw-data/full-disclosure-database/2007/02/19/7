I am curious as to how one "automatically" logs on?

1. Internet Explorer disallows username:pass@http://192.168.1.0
2. Opera has a very clear warning that you are logging on
3. Firefox has a very clear warning that you are logging on

Are there any other methods to log on without any warning? If so
does it work with Internet Explorer?  Also when you do reset or
change parameters in the router, does it not require a reboot of
the router (auto after you hit save), whereby your connection is
lost for x amount of time?

1. Unless there are methods to log on without any warning you will
be informed of this, and

2. After you are informed you will lose your connection for a short
period with a notification of same.

Not exactly clear to me where this drive-by aspect comes into play.

Also not to mention find a method to cross domains into the routers
html, for each and every router out there.
