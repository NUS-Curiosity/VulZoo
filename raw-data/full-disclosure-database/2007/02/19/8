What kind of research?

Where?  Under whose/what's guidance?

Seems unlikley to me that you would have both a genuine "need" for such 
stuff _AND NOT_ the ready means of obtaining it...

Yep, except for the occasional phish where they simply use some 
stupidly "vulnerable" mail script which takes all its "instructions" as 
parameters to the script URL, or the phishers are such noobs/lusers 
that they rolled their own similar script, and then everything you 
really "need" is probably in the HTML.

Such sites though are increasingly rare, I think, though there was 
something of an "outbreak" of this technique late last year, it seems 
to faded into near total oblivion again...

I'm sure there are a deal more than "one or two" such sites, but 
because you cannot see the existence of those files without having more 
privileged access (either direct or indirect through some hosting amin 
firing copies your way) you can't know they are there.

Less common, but still far from unheard of, is a similar situation 
where the compromised (or ill-configured) server has directory indexing 
enabled, and you can simply discover the existence of such files 
through using a little address-bar editing fu.  I probably see 
something like 5-10 such sites a week and I seldom have time to look so 
closely at all the (likely) phish I receive in a day.

Of course, that applies equally whether the perp left a copy of the 
nicely archived contents or not...

...and even index-trawling as suggested above and/or guessing "obvious" 
non-public URLs has been deeemed dubious through outright illegal in at 
least some jurisdictions.
