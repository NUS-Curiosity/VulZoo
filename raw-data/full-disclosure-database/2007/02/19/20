There are several potential methods (depending on the victim's browser):
1) Older versions of Flash allow the spoofing of arbitrary http
headers [1] thus allowing the creation of attacker controlled
Authorization-headers.
2) Firefox does not display http-authentication warnings if the http
request was generated by the browser's link-prefetch mechanism [2].
3) An anti-DNS-pinning attack [3] can be executed to break the
same-origin policy. Then the low-level socket functions of either
Flash (all browsers) [4] or Java (Firefox and Opera) [5] could be
employed to create arbitrary http requests.
