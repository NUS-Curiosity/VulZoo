Keep in mind that the HTML is most likely directly lifted from the
site that the phishers are spoofing - the only thing that changes is
the action for the login form; you can't readily get to the source
code for the form action because it is done in some sort of server
side scripting (CGI, PHP, ASP, whatever...) that can't readily be
viewed from the client side.
That said, I have run into one or two phishers who compromise a site
(or create a throwaway site themselves), upload their scripts in a
tarball, install them - and then leave the tarball around for
posterity to analyze. I kid you not.
Unfortunately, the only good way to get to that source code is by
asking the administrator of a compromised site whether they found
anything that they would be willing to share; going in and poking
around yourself may put you into a legal position that you'd rather
not be in.
