I think there are still underlying problems in the code as the
following illustrates:

1. Put this in a web page, then view it in firefox.

<html>
<body onunload="location = self.location">
<a href="http://slashdot.org/">http://slashdot.org/</a>
</body>
</html>

2. Click on the link which should take you to slashdot and you'll end
up back where you were (this has been known about for ages).

3. Now do 'View Source' and you get shown the sourcecode to slashdot
rather than the source code for the page you're viewing.

Actual Results:
View source displays the contents of the wrong site

Expected Results:
I'd expect to see the source code for the page I'm viewing.

A web page could trigger the link itself using DOM events (or naviagate
away using javascript form submission) and use this technique to hide
the source code of a malicious page from the user. I did a quick check
that document.cookie wasn't chcking the wrong URL, but I have not
checked extensively which other parts of the browser can be spoofed
in this fashion.

I reported this via bugzilla, but it was closed as a duplicate of bug
253497 which was reported in 2004.

Cheers

Rich.
