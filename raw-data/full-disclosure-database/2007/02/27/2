I was wrong when I assumed that the 0.9.4 release on viewvc.tigris.org
was unpatched against the issues discovered by Jose Antonio Coret
(Joxean Koret). This issue was actually fixed by the ViewCVS developers
in version 0.9.3. I am sorry for the misconception and the confusion
this has caused.

This does not impact  how much the rest of my report applies. My
findings are now being discussed on the ViewVC developers mailing list
[1]. They apparently also impact ViewVC. Whether and to which degree
what I am reporting can be considered a security issue is, however,
currently subject to discussion.

For now, please follow up there only. I will be back to the security
mailing lists as soon as this has been sufficiently discussed and there
is something noteworthy to be said.
