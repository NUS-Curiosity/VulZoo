Yeah, and the other way round: http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ietrap/, when
used with FF 2.0.0.2, puts you on a page that:

  1) Has URL bar data and favicon from the target site,
  2) Views source of what you added with document.write(),
  3) Displays as blank.

Moreover, repeatedly setting document.location = "xxx"; on departure may
land you at slashdot.org/xxx instead (meaning the update is being
performed in the context of the new page).

Although this looks like a Really Bad Thing (tm), I didn't succeed in
modifying /ietrap/ to display a malicious payload (though feels like it's
sooo close), nor in manipulating DOM in the latter example to do anything
other than annoying the user (because 2.0.0.1 kept crashing ;-). Still,
I'm not gonna sleep well until this is fixed.
