Almost a year, looking at that original patch that caused the problem. To be
fair, nobody had commented on the security issues until I stumbled across them
a month ago though.

Yeah, scared me when I first saw it and realised how vulnerable I'd been for so
long. What's also scary is the complete lack of action on what is a fairly
serious problem. I used to think that the Debian project had a sane attitude to
security. Maybe all the good developers have gone to Ubuntu.
