Does anyone have any info on the security of Microsoft
Groove in Office 2007?  I was considering using it for
file sharing between two locations where security is
an absolute must.  I like using Hamachi for my
personal use but I like the ability to search with
Groove and the amount of data to be shared will be
changing daily and in large volumes so the search
ability is paramount, not to mention the familiarity
to the end users.  If anyone has any other ideas I
would love to hear them.  Thank you in advance.
