Synopsis
========

Two separate vulnerabilities have been found in Nexuiz allowing the
remote execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Nexuiz is a multi-player FPS game which uses a modified version of the
Quake 1 engine.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-fps/nexuiz       < 2.2.1                           >= 2.2.1

Description
===========

Nexuiz fails to correctly validate input within "clientcommands". There
is also a failure to correctly handle connection attempts from remote
hosts.

Impact
======

Using a specially crafted "clientcommand" a remote attacker can cause a
buffer overflow in Nexuiz which could result in the execution of
arbitrary code. Additionally, there is a Denial of Service
vulnerability in Nexuiz allowing an attacker to cause Nexuiz to crash
or to run out of resources by overloading it with specially crafted
connection requests.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Nexuiz users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-fps/nexuiz-2.2.1"
