Subject: Know your Enemy: Web Application Threats

Jamie Riden, Ryan McGeehan, Brian Engert and Michael Mueter just released
an Honeynet paper on Web security called: Know your Enemy: Web
Application Threats

You can find their paper here:
http://honeynet.org/papers/webapp/

The paper is very good, and deals with all kinds of web threats such as
SQL Injection and XSS. Of most interest to me were the Code Injection and
Remote Code-Inclusion due to my own research in that field.
The Honeynet paper deals with many issues other than these, and
is most definitely recommended reading.

Jamie Riden has written a paper on web honey pots in the past. These guys
know what they are talking about.
