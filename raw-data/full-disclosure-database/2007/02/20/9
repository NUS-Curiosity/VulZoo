It's a common and pretty shameless practice for Microsoft. They also
openly criticize such researchers in media statements (while mentioning
some overly comforting mitigating factors), and then "penalize" you for
not disclosing to them 3-12 months in advance by not crediting you in
vendor bulletins.

These ungrateful researchers, eh?
