Thanks.

I'm sure there are many ways to achieve each step separately (see
my reply to Andrew), to build this each and everything into
functional "drive by" attack seems far fetched. Your details below
add even more hurdles IMO. You'll be build a monster all
encompassing, browser, version, plus router mega exploit. Unless
the first two I mention to Andrew can be overcome easily. This is
all very far from a "drive by" vuln.
