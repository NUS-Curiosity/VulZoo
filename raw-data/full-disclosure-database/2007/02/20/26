There is something called "sandboxie" that seems to do this same kind of thing. Programs run inside the sandbox
can read whatever you allow, but writes get done to other directories so that it is more difficult for a rogue app to corrupt
anything outside the area it is allowed to write to.

Hello,




TB> You can duplicate this behavior by using multiple accounts

TB> and using runas (which is essentially, from what I gather, what

TB> winquota does.)




Hmm, it is not the same as I see. WinJail also provides way to re-map such folders like c:\* -> c:\NewPlace\* at file system level for every application, so such process (and all sub-processes) being accessing to c:\* files will use files from c:\NewPlace\* for all file operations instead.




So there is most interesting issue from this tool is ability to make chroot()-like environment, not managing additional permissions ;-) 




Best regards,

 Victor
