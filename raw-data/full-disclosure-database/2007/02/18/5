Subject: XSS & SQL bugs in Conference website

Hello list,

I have found multiple XSS & SQL bugs in this site, www.flconferences.com 
( LegionSec - Security Conference in India )

I have also contacted the concerned people, but they have failed to fix the bugs even after I sent a detailed advisory on the same.

Cheers :)
Kish
