That would run through nmap's list of default ports (2000). OS guess 
needs one closed, and one open port to be effective.

I will supply port 23 which will be open if the OS is reported and, by 
default, nmap will provide a closed one by probing a few (3?) random high 
ports.

-sV tests only what was supplied to it, because it starts a version scan
