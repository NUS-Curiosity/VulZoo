Subject: ALERT! A piece of internet security history is
	missing

Attention knights of the great Full Disclosure!

An important piece of internet security is missing.
The missing item is the logo, depicting a turkey, of GOBBLES Security.
It was last known to be present on [1] and [2].

Unfortunately the datastreams previously known to have been representing 
it have disappeared in the deep void of an infamous character-device 
node with major and minor number 1 respectively 3.

Please help to locate this missing antique.
It's a picture similar to [3], but a less happy turkey with its head and 
body pointing to the left.


Best regards,
The Anonymous Historian
