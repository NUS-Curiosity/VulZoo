Well the point is they accused us somewhen in October 2006 to have
already disclosed this attack against Internet Explorer 7 to the public.
At that time IE7 was just released and we never said a word about IE7 at
all. Actually the only thing we did was announce that there is a trick
to do this with Firefox.In reality we waited 3.5 months before any
detail was made public with yesterdays advisory.
