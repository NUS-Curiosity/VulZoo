Subject: Stealing Browser History Without Using JavaScript


 	In case anyone is interested, I was able to port the old CSS
history hacking stuff that Jeremiah Grossman originally found to a
version that does not require JavaScript to fire using images and
conditional logic built into CSS using a:visited and display attributes.
It works in both IE7.0 and Firefox 2.0.0.2.  Details at the link below:
