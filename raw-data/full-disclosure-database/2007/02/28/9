Subject: Quicksilver Social Bookmark plugin v.8F: password
	in clear text

Quicksilver http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/ is a tool to quickly
find/launch/do anything you like with all kind of files, bookmarks
etcpp on MacOSX (>=10.3)

There exists a plug-in "Social Bookmarks" to integrate and search
del.icio.us bookmarks. In version 8F this plugin logs the username and
password to Console.log. Console.log is archived in
/Library/Logs/Console/UID

Passwords should never appear anywhere on the disk in clear text.
The issue seems to be fixed in newer versions of the plug-in. Update now.
