Subject: New Variant of the Storm Virus

Was just reading an article about a new variant or what is believe to be a
varient of the Storm Virus and am trying to find out more information about
it in order to put appropriate IP/Domain blocks and counter messures in
place. 

Specifically I am looking to determing the Domain(s)and IP address to block
as well as possible obtaining a copy of the code to reverse engineer.

If anyone has more information on this I would appreciate the feedback. 

Article of interest:

Thanks,
Gerry
