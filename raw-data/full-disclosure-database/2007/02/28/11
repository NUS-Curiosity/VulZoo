Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Catalyst 6000, 6500 Series and Cisco
7600 Series NAM (Network Analysis Module) Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20070228-nam

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 February 28 

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Catalyst 6000, 6500 series and Cisco 7600 series that have a
Network Analysis Module installed are vulnerable to an attack, which
could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the system. Only
Cisco Catalyst systems that have a NAM on them are affected. This
vulnerability affects systems that run Internetwork Operating System
(IOS) or Catalyst Operating System (CatOS).

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers.

This advisory is posted at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070228-nam.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Catalyst 6000, 6500 series and Cisco 7600 series that have a NAM
installed in them are affected. A system that has a NAM can be
identified by the show module command. A NAM will be seen as
WS-SVC-NAM-1, WS-SVC-NAM-2 or WS-X6380-NAM in this output.

This vulnerability affects systems that run IOS or CatOS.

A sample output for a system that has a NAM-2 on it is provided
below:

Cat6k#show module
Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

  * Catalyst 6000, 6500 and Cisco 7600 series that do not have a NAM
    are not affected.
  * Network Analysis Modules for Cisco Branch Routers (NM-NAM) are
    not affected.

No other Cisco products are known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

NAMs are deployed in Catalyst 6000, 6500 series and Cisco 7600 series
to monitor and analyze network traffic by using Remote Monitoring
(RMON), RMON2, and other MIBs. More information about NAMs can be
found at the following URL:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps708/products_module_configuration_guide_chapter09186a0080394e09.html

NAMs communicate with the Catalyst system by using the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP). By spoofing the SNMP communication
between the Catalyst system and the NAM an attacker may obtain
complete control of the Catalyst system.

Devices running both Cisco IOS and Cisco CatOS are affected by this
vulnerability. This vulnerability is introduced in CatOS at 7.6(15)
and 8.5(1). Older CatOS images are not vulnerable.

This issue is documented in bug IDs CSCsd75273 ( registered customers
only) , CSCse52951 ( registered customers only) for IOS and
CSCse39848 ( registered customers only) for CatOS.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Cisco will
provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then compute
environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are
encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the
environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at 
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html.

Software Version and Fixes
==========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) describes a release
train and the platforms or products for which it is intended. If a
given release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible
releases that contain the fix (the "First Fixed Release") and the
anticipated date of availability for each are listed in the "Rebuild"
and "Maintenance" columns. A device running a release in the given
train that is earlier than the release in a specific column (less
than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable. The release
should be upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later
version (greater than or equal to the First Fixed Release label).

For more information on the terms "Rebuild" and "Maintenance,"
consult the following URL:

Workarounds
===========

No workarounds exist for this vulnerability.

This vulnerability requires an attacker to spoof SNMP packets from
the IP address of the NAM. Filtering SNMP traffic to an affected
device can be used as a mitigation. Filtering SNMP traffic needs to
be done on systems that are deployed in front of an affected device,
since it is ineffective to filter against such spoofed packets on the
device itself.

Anti-spoofing measures and infrastructure access-lists can also be
deployed at your network edge as a potential mitigation technique.
Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html for examples
on how to apply ACLs on Cisco routers for infrastructure protection.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion
document for this advisory: 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20070228-nam.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco will make free software available to address this vulnerability

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreement with third-party support organizations
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.
