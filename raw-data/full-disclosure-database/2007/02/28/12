Subject: PDF Strikes Back

http://www.gnucitizen.org/projects/pdf-strikes-back/

Just recently I have been researching on PDF vulnerabilities again. I
based my research on the work I did with David Kierznowski on PDF
backdoors.

My research does not show anything that is surprising but it outlines
some important issues that should be kept in mind.

cheers
