You're attributing malice to what could be equally well (or better!)
explained by incompetence or gross negligence. The latter two haunt large
companies far more often, compared to sinister conspiracies.

Yeah, a backdoor is a remote possibility. But it's also an arbitrary and
needlessly complex one. Maybe it's a nefarious plot by our UFO-appointed
shadow government, but chances are, it's not (they have better things to
do today).

Keep that in mind: when risking so much, of all the places to put a covert
backdoor to use for years to come, pulling out a known flaw that will be
spotted by many existing vulnerability scanners, and putting it in a
service that is often disabled as obsolete and generally unreachable from
the outside world, doesn't really make that much sense.

Unless, of course, it's a sabotage attempt orchestrated by a joint team of
IBM and SCO developers... now, that begins to make sense..
