Or, going with Solaris 10's 'SMF' thing: 

% svcadm disable svc:/network/telnet 

And, while you're at it, 

% svcadm disable svc:/network/shell:default
% svcadm disable svc:/network/login:rlogin 

(See man pages for in.telnetd, in.rshd, and in.rlogind.) 

At least one machine I run doesn't have the usual /etc/inetd.conf.
