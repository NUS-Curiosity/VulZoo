Synopsis
========

Multiple flaws exist in the Samba suite of programs, the most serious
of which could result in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Samba is a suite of SMB and CIFS client/server programs for UNIX.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-fs/samba      < 3.0.24                              >= 3.0.24

Description
===========

A format string vulnerability exists in the VFS module when handling
AFS file systems and an infinite loop has been discovered when handling
file rename operations.

Impact
======

A user with permission to write to a shared AFS file system may be able
to compromise the smbd process and execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the daemon. The infinite loop could be abused to consume
excessive resources on the smbd host, denying service to legitimate
users.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Samba users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/samba-3.0.24"
