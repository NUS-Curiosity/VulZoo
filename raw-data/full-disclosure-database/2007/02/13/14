Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 February 13 1600 UTC (GMT)

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) feature set of Cisco IOS
contains several vulnerabilities. These include:

  * Fragmented IP packets may be used to evade signature inspection.
  * IPS signatures utilizing the regular expression feature of the
    ATOMIC.TCP signature engine may cause a router to crash resulting
    in a denial of service.

There are mitigations and workarounds for these vulnerabilities. Cisco
has made free software available to address these vulnerabilities for
affected customers.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070213-iosips.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following Cisco IOS release trains with the IPS feature set enabled
are vulnerable to the fragmented packet evasion vulnerability:

  * 12.3T, except versions 12.3(2)T, 12.3(4)T, and 12.3(7)T
  * 12.4
  * 12.4T
  * 12.4XE

The following Cisco IOS release trains with the IPS feature set enabled
are vulnerable to the ATOMIC.TCP regular expression denial of service
vulnerability:

  * 12.3T, except versions 12.3(2)T, 12.3(4)T, and 12.3(7)T
  * 12.3XQ, 12.3XR, 12.3XS, 12.3XW, 12.3XX, 12.3XY
  * 12.3YA, 12.3YD, 12.3YG, 12.3YH, 12.3YI, 12.3YJ, 12.3YK, 12.3YM,
    12.3YQ, 12.3YS, 12.3YT, 12.3YX, 12.3YZ
  * 12.4
  * 12.4MR
  * 12.4T
  * 12.4XA, 12.4XB

To determine if the IPS feature set is active on an IOS device, use the
"show ip ips configuration" command. This command will list the
interfaces configured to use IPS inspection. You will then need to
further check the status of each interface to confirm if they are
enabled or not.

    router#show ip ips configuration
    Configured Config Locations: -none-
    Last signature default load time: 18:46:50 UTC Jan 5 2007
    Last signature delta load time: -none-
    Last event action (SEAP) load time: -none-
    IPS Auto Update is not currently configured
    IPS fail closed is disabled
    Fastpath ips is enabled
    Quick run mode is enabled
    Event notification through syslog is enabled
    Event notification through SDEE is enabled
    Total Active Signatures: 85
    Total Inactive Signatures: 61
    IPS Rule Configuration
     IPS name test
    IPS Category CLI is not configured
    Interface Configuration
     Interface FastEthernet0/0
      Inbound IPS rule is test
      Outgoing IPS rule is not set

    router#show ip interface FastEthernet0/0
    FastEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up


In the above example, interface FastEthernet0/0 is configured to use
IPS and is shown to be enabled.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco IOS Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is an inline, deep-packet
inspection-based feature that enables Cisco IOS software to mitigate
network attacks. Cisco IOS IPS enables the network to defend itself
with the intelligence to identify, classify, and stop or block certain
malicious or damaging traffic in real time. The IOS IPS feature set
contains multiple vulnerabilities. Only IOS images containing the IPS
feature set are affected by these vulnerabilities.

Fragmented Packet Evasion Vulnerability
+--------------------------------------

Some of the IPS signatures utilize regular expressions. Due to a
vulnerability, an attacker can evade those IPS signatures by sending
malicious network traffic as IP fragments. This may result in potential
malicious traffic bypassing signature inspection and possibly allow the
exploitation of protected systems. IPS signatures which do not utilize
regular expressions are not affected by this vulnerability. All IP
protocols (e.g. TCP, UDP, ICMP) are affected by this vulnerability.
There is a mitigation for this vulnerability. This vulnerability is
documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsg15598.

ATOMIC.TCP Regular Expression Denial of Service Vulnerability
+------------------------------------------------------------

Certain network traffic can trigger IPS signatures which use the
regular expression feature of the ATOMIC.TCP signature engine which may
cause the IOS IPS device to crash. This may cause a denial of service
resulting in disruption network traffic. Signature 3123.0 (Netbus Pro
Traffic) has been demonstrated to trigger this vulnerability. There is
a workaround for this vulnerability. This vulnerability is documented
in Cisco Bug ID CSCsa53334.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

Cisco will provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are
encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the
environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS
at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html.

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at 
http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the fragmented packet evasion vulnerability
may result in an attacker being able to evade detection by an IOS IPS
device. This could allow protected systems to be covertly attacked.

Successful exploitation of the ATOMIC.TCP regular expression denial of
service vulnerability may cause an IOS IPS device to crash.

Software Version and Fixes
==========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) describes a release
train and the platforms or products for which it is intended. If a
given release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible releases
that contain the fix (the "First Fixed Release") and the anticipated
date of availability for each are listed in the "Rebuild" and
"Maintenance" columns. A device running a release in the given train
that is earlier than the release in a specific column (less than the
First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable. The release should be
upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later version (greater
than or equal to the First Fixed Release label).

Workarounds
===========

The effectiveness of any mitigation or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied mitigation or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the
network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion
document for this advisory: 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20070213-iosips.shtml

Fragmented Packet Evasion Vulnerability
+--------------------------------------

There is a mitigation for the fragmented packet evasion vulnerability.
The "fragments" keyword of IOS transit Access Control Lists (ACL) can be
used to prohibit fragmented IP packets from transiting an IOS device.
More information about filtering IP fragments can be found here:

  * http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml#frag

Blocking IP fragments may have adverse affects on some protocols (like
HTTP, FTP and Kerberos/Active Directory), so this workaround should be
used with caution.

    access-list 100 deny tcp any 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 fragments
    access-list 100 deny udp any 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 fragments


ATOMIC.TCP Regular Expression Denial of Service Vulnerability
+------------------------------------------------------------

There is a workaround for the ATOMIC.TCP regular expression denial of
service vulnerability by deleting IPS signature 3123.0 from the IOS IPS
Signature Definition File (SDF). Disabling signature 3123.0 is alone
not sufficient for the workaround to be effective. The following
commands will delete signature 3123.0 from an IOS IPS device.

    router#configure terminal
    router(config)#ip ips signature 3123 delete
    %IPS Signature 3123:0 is marked for deletion
    %IPS The signature will be deleted when signatures are reloaded or saved
    router(config)#interface FastEthernet0/0
    router(config)#no ip ips test in
    router(config)#ip ips test in
    router(config)#exit


In the above example, signature 3123.0 is first deleted from the
Signature Definition File, then the IPS instance running on interface
FastEthernet0/0 is stopped and started to reinitialize the IPS state to
reflect the signature deletion. If the IPS feature set is configured on
multiple interfaces, then these steps must be completed for each
affected interface.

To determine if signature 3123 is active, use the "show ip ips signature"
command.

    router#show ip ips signatures | include 3123
    3123:0      N   A      MED     0      0     0   100    30 FA  N    S46


In the command output above, the N after 3123.0 indicates that the
signature is present in the configuration but not enabled. Once the
signature has been deleted, rerunning the "show ip ips signature" command
shows:

    router#show ip ips signatures | include 3123
    3123:0      N*   A      MED     0      0     0   100    30 FA  N    S46


In the command output above, the N* after 3123.0 indicates that the
signature has been deleted from the configuration. The IPS feature set
must be restarted on each interface configured for IPS to complete the
workaround. Once completed, the output of the "show ip ips signature"
command will show:

    router#show ip ips signatures | include 3123

    router#


This vulnerability may affect any IPS signature using the regular
expression functionality of the ATOMIC.TCP engine. Currently, Cisco
only ships one signature configured this way (3123.0). If custom
signatures have been added to an IOS IPS device configured use the
ATOMIC.TCP engine with a regular expression, these signatures must also
be deleted from the IPS configuration to ensure the effectiveness of
the workaround.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco will make free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. This advisory will be updated as fixed software
becomes available. Prior to deploying software, customers should
