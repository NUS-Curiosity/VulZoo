Subject: different Wordpress Vulnerabilities

Hey full-disclosure folks, i found several Wordpress flaws:

- Redirection Script in every Wordpress installation out there
- XSS in every wordpress.com blog (only accessible for the admin, but 
that's probably the main aim of the attacker)

- directory traversal in the wp-backup plugin allows you to download 
etc/passwd file (i hope this hasnt been found before, I didnt check it)

cheers beNi
