Paul Szabo pointed out that this is related to exploits posted by Charles
McAuley and Bart van Arnhem in June 2006 (CVE-2006-2894). These guys did
not demonstrate a complete attack, and their examples do not seem to work
well with MSIE 7 (which might be because of a half-assed attempt to fix
the problem, or perhaps not) - but a credit quite certainly is due.
