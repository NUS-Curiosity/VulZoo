Thanks for the report, Michal.

Filed as bug 370092 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=370092>

BTW: Your last bug (popup blocker + XMLHttpRequest + srand() = oops) was 
filed as bug 369390 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=369390>
The factors of the bug are filed as separate bugs, see "Depends on" list.

Next time, could you please file the bugzilla bug yourself directly and 
cite the bug number in the post and cc security@...illa.org on it? I 
wouldn't want us to miss a critical bug just because I don't read FD. 
Thanks,

Ben
