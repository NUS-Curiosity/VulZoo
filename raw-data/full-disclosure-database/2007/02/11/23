That argument would work for a patch deferred by a month or two - not for
seven years.

And it's not really that much of an issue: disallow script-assisted
focusing on file input fields, or a) prevent event target from being
changed in onKeyDown (this is what MSIE does) + b) prevent scripts from
reading file input field value (really no reason for them to).
