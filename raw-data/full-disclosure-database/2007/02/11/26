Good ideas.

I really hate to duplicate or relay discussion, but bz says in the bug 
that this has already been fixed on the trunk. You can't type *at all* 
in file input fields there, only use the File Open dialog, as I 
understood him.

I hope this fixes it once and for all. (Yes, this is a teaser. ;-) )
