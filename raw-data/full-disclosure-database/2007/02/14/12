Subject: MailEnable DoS POC

The POC attached exploits an out of bounds memory read in the NTLM authentication
routines of MailEnable Pro/Enterprise. The problem lies in the NTLM_UnPack_Type3
function of MENTLM.dll.

This appears to have been silently "patched" somewhere between versions 2.351 and
2.36-7. (observe the quotes).
