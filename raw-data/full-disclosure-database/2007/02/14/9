fun stuff; if you don't mind even a little more bloat you might want
to try out janusvm which gives you a transparent DNS/TCP proxy through
Tor using a virtual machine.

advantages:
- full transparent proxy, no SOCKS or wrappers required.
- avoids crappy windoze tcp/ip stacks via ethernet bridge. (for
network intensive Tor this can be a big problem)

drawbacks:
- requires vmware (player or workstation)
- users must take care to clean any necessary state in browser or
application between anonymous and non-anonymous modes.

latest january release trimmed off 12M of fat from the dc14 build.  at
least we're trying... ;)

fortunately stupidity leaves many traces; these idiots leave tracks
elsewhere and will face consequences for their actions at some point.
[this isn't limited to banned exit nodes either, these assholes are
also getting exit nodes confiscated in germany and elsewhere.  *sigh*]

P.S.  we've been trying for a number of weeks to get a qemu version
working like the vmware bridge with the tap device used by qemu.  this
causes problems due to windows routing tables, even in bridged mode
(2k/XP) when the VPN connects to janusvm and pushes a new default
route.  if anyone has dealt with this and knows the requisite tricks
for making a bridged tap route outside of the windows IP routes i'd
love to hear it...
