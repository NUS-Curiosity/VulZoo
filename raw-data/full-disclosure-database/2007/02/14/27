I could be wrong, but I strongly suspect the reason to be someone exploiting
the grok.org.uk with the 'full-disclosure' ID and mass-mailing every mail
sent to that address to those who are present in the "fd-request" ID's
addressbook. My mailbox too has been bombarded with all kinds of hacker
stuff, including the antics of this real funny n3tty dude. Let me know if
you want to see them, I could forward 'em to you.
