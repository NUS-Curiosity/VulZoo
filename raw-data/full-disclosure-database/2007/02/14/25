Subject: Sample Packet Captures

Hi All,

As it is not possible for everyone to setup different networks
quickly,I am thinking to start a wiki which will contain various
packet captures .It will help people in quickly getting the required
dump for analysis/refrence purpose. I have started a wiki here:-
http://secgeeks.com/packetland
i would like to hear your feedback regarding this.feel free to upload
any packet dump you might have.

Regards,
_CF
