== Overview ==

When thinking about buffer overflow vulnerabilities, a file can
sometimes
be as harmful as a packet. Even though past security issues have taught
us that it is unwise to use a string from a file/packet without first
checking its length, this is what happened here.

MS Interactive Training will open a file with a .cbo extension and read 
in the Syllabus details.

Through the creation of a corrupt file, with a long Syllabus string it
is 
possible to gain control of EIP and execute arbitrary code.

== Exploitation ==

Remote exploitation through Internet Explorer can be obtained through 
hosting a malicious .cbo file which will be downloaded and opened 
automatically.

== Solutions ==

- Install the vendor supplied patch.
