Talk about overkill

Sorry, I'm a noted Windows fanboy and I'm not sure I find that a plus

personally? I don't care. All I know is because of some greasy 
kiddyfucker in Armpit, Nebraska I can't get my daily fix of footsole 
fetish from /d/ without half the campus (and, oh, any buildings in 
neighboring blocks - thank you, Fastweb! You sure make me feel 
connected!) snooping on me for blackmailing purposes. I have a 
reputation, dammit

(haha, just kidding. I'm more of a shitting dicknipples person)

dammit Jim, I'm a kernel hacker, not a network admin! A couple ideas, 
though:
 * why not PPPoE instead of a VPN? Sorry if it doesn't make sense to 
you, I just have a thing for PPPoE. Not a fetish or anything like that. 
No way. Seriously, it sounds perfect for a bridged tunnel, to me
 * VMware works flawlessly because it attaches a protocol driver to all 
the bridged interfaces, simulating a bridge (duh). I suspect the tap 
driver is not as smart. Nowhere near as smart. I suspect, in fact, that 
the tap driver expects user-mode applications to open the NIC device 
directly, because that's how UNIX-heads think. It would be funny, in a 
very sad way, considering that the most prominent open source NDIS 
project, WinPcap, gets that right. One day, I swear, I will turn that 
pile of manure into a proper, well-behaving Windows component (I mean 
tap, silly! WinPcap is beyond my help now)
 * alternatively, my psychic debugging powers tell me Qemu might be 
trying to inject packets through a raw socket, or something similarly 
boneheaded that nevertheless works perfectly on Linux. As a general 
rule, if a bridging application doesn't install a bridging protocol, 
there you know something's wrong

Please ignore me if I am talking out of my ass

(... hey, did you know you can turn a Windows Server into a PPPoE 
terminal server if you install a PPPoE port driver and bind RRAS to it? 
easy like that! now ain't that... cool?)
