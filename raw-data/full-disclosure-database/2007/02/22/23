Can't readily be viewed BUT that part is sort of not-the-problem.

Those obvious server-side scripts Juergen mentioned would most probably
consist in a MVC-like design with persistence function code storing
collected data the simple way: in clear text... Since those fine illegal
gentlemen ain't gathering someone's Internet banking passwork in order to
encipher them and protect them from this bloodthirsty world...

Thus, concerning traditional phishing sites, the code itself is not really
an issue.
Code starts being problematic by the moment potential damaging load-time
scripts -- say AJAX techniques -- spread.
