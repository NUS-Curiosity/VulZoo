Subject: Re: phishing sites examples "source code"

Hi Andres,

We process and analyse phishing emails from several sources; the phish 
emails themselves and phish sites are listed and the data is publicly 
available on our website: http://phishery.internetdefence.net.
We also have a real-time monitor there of the phishing sites themselves; 
so from the live ones I'm sure you could scrape the data you're looking for.

Regards,
