Subject: 802.1q Vlan Packets

Hi List,

I am looking for some information on 802.1q vlan packets.i recently
seen some captures in which  the protocol type in their ethernet
header is 802.1q (some googling gave me the packet structure) bellow
that sometimes ppp strcutres comes and some times it doesn't come.my
question is why its happening and can i get some sample capture or a
decoder for this kind of protocol?
thanks for any help.

Regards,
