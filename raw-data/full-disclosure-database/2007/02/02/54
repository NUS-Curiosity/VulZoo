On the other hand, it's the sort of attack that is really handy to have
if you're doing a targeted attack against a corporation - send a crafted
spam that delivers the XSS to zombie the box, sleep for a few hours, and
when nobody's left in the office, crank up the volume and yell "PANTS DOWN!"
to every computer within range.... :)

(Remember - the average office is nice and quiet at 11PM if the janitors
aren't around - and nobody ever *said* the computer making the noise was
the one getting pwned... :)
