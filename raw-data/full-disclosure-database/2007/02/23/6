Will you give Opera some love, too? Opera has always been pretty 
terrible at preventing Javascript abuse (I believe you can still 
window.close() arbitrary windows without notification) but pretty good 
with XSS and spoofing. So what I get in Opera is some flashing text and 
then a blank page, and I mean exactly and completely blank, zero bytes 
and no MIME type. So will you give the fat lady some love? pretty prease?
