Subject Summary:         Programming Language
Subject Home:            http://www.php.net/
Subject Versions:        * <= 5.2.0

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2006-6383, CVE-2007-0905, CVE-2007-0906,
                         CVE-2007-0907, CVE-2007-0908, CVE-2007-0909,
                         CVE-2007-0910, CVE-2007-0988
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           local system, remote network
Attack Impact:           denial of service, exposure of sensitive
                         information, manipulation of data, arbitrary code
                         execution

Description:
    According to a vendor release announcement [0], multiple
    vulnerabilities exist in the programming language PHP [1], version
    up to and including 5.2.0.
    
    PHP 5.2.0 and 4.4 allows local users to bypass safe_mode and
    open_basedir restrictions via a malicious path and a null byte
    before a ";" in a session_save_path argument, followed by an allowed
    path, which causes a parsing inconsistency in which PHP validates
    the allowed path but sets session.save_path to the malicious path.
    (CVE-2007-0905; possibly duplicate of CVE-2006-6383)
    
    Multiple buffer overflows in PHP before 5.2.1 allow attackers to
    cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via
    unspecified vectors in the session, imap and sqlite extensions; and
    the str_replace function.
    (CVE-2007-0906)
    
    Buffer underflow in PHP before 5.2.1 allows attackers to cause
    a denial of service via unspecified vectors involving the
    sapi_header_op function.
    (CVE-2007-0907)
    
    The wddx extension in PHP before 5.2.1 allows remote attackers
    to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors.
    (CVE-2007-0908)
    
    Multiple format string vulnerabilities in PHP before 5.2.1 might
    allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string
    specifiers to all of the *print functions on 64-bit systems, and the
    odbc_result_all function.
    (CVE-2007-0909)
    
    Unspecified vulnerability PHP before 5.2.1 allows attackers to
    "clobber" certain super-global variables via unspecified vectors.
    (CVE-2007-0910)
    
    If unserializing untrusted data on 64-bit platforms the
    zend_hash_init() function can be forced to enter an infinite loop,
    consuming CPU resources, for a limited length of time, until the
    script timeout alarm aborts the script.
    (CVE-2007-0988)
