4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Internet Explorer
7, which can be exploited by a malicious website to spoof the address
bar.

The vulnerability is caused due to an error in Internet Explorer 7's
handling of "onunload" events, enabling a malicious website to abort
the loading of a new website. This can be exploited to spoof the
address bar if e.g. the user enters a new website manually in the
address bar, which is commonly exercised as best practice.

The vulnerability is confirmed on a fully patched Windows XP SP2
system running Internet Explorer 7. Other versions may also be
affected. 

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Close all browser windows after visiting untrusted websites.
