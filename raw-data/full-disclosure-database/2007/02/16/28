Subject: Re: Drive-by Pharming

One item is that I have not seen considered is how this could be used in a corporate network just the same as a home user scenario (it's possible I missed it). True that a good amount of Home users don't actually change device passwords, but lets be honest, same applies to many businesses as well.

Use a JavaScript port scanner to scan internal devices for web interfaces or telnet responses, and then add a few routines to try to login using default passwords, and then modify dns settings or other such settings (even hardcode entries into local hosts file) on the device and viola. 

As for defenses, let's state the obvious:

1). Change Default Passwords
2). Hard Code ACL's to allow administration from only certain IP's (this is more from a business environment admittedly)
3). Turn off JavaScript or use the No Script Plug-in

That's it off the top of my head, maybe some monitoring of outbound connections and log file analysis to round it off but really the common sense issue is #1.
