Subject: Phishmarket #2 (IFrame Spoofing/XSS on Austrian
	bank sites)

Dear Sir or Madam,

I want to point your attention to a new list, that shows up to 40 (!)
vulnerabilities on Bank sites of Austria and proves another time
how insecure online banking still is. The list is publicly available under:

------------------------------------------------------------
http://baseportal.com/baseportal/phishmarkt/at
------------------------------------------------------------

To every page a demo is provided, that shows how to trigger the
mostly IFrame Spoofing and XSS vulnerabilities on the page.

I would appreciate you taking a look at the list and spreading the
link to make those sites react quickly and fix the problem.

SkyOut
