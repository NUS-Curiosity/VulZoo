Subject: fd@...ty.ece.cmu.edu likes spam (but does spam
	like fd@...ty.ece.cmu.edu?)

It's true. I like spam. And one of the best ways to get spam is to post to a public security list which is mirrored all over the place (at least in my 
experience ;)). That's why myself and superspamcollector.bla@...il.com are teaming up to get great gobs of spam. It's all in the interest of tracking 
bots of course...just need to cast a wide net :)

p.p.s. n3td3v was doing the same thing, I'm just lazier than her ;)
