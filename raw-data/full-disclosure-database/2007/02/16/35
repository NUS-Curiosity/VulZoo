Subject: Axigen server version: 2.0.0-beta1 (Linux/i686) -
	pop3 remote shell

The code attached exploits a format string vulnerability in the V2 beta
version of Axigen.

The pop3 service calls syslog in a vulnerable way when the logtype, for the
pop3 service, been set to "system" and loglevel is number with 4th bit set.
Any unknown command causes the log call with overwriting consequences.

This problem is patched in the final release but I am informed that v1 is
vulnerable, couldn't get my hands on the binary to test though

Thanks to mu-b

Have fun
