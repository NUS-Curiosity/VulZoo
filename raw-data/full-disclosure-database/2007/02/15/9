I think you are a few days lagged. This was on-going and no real
"accusations" were made. Questions were asked. Information was made
available.

I'd like to re-iterate the following point, as just like you said, it has
staggering impact on how other vendors handle vulnerabilities.

Quoting -

Opinion:

Whatever my thoughts are on how silly, sad or funny this vulnerability is
(quaint really), how they use telnet (?!) and how Sun should be smacked on
the back of the head for it, I have to honestly admit Sun.s response and
the level they were open to the community and industry on this without too
many PR/legal blocks getting in their way are very encouraging, releasing
information on the vulnerability, how it happened and why, a quick beta
patch and even discussing openly on mailing lists.
I am in awe. Now it is time for others to follow their example.

This one, despite its simplicity and age, is going to be with us for a
while.

	Gadi.
