Subject: Not that new: Hotmail & Yahoo are insecure via
	WLANs

This may not be anything new to many of you but since many people I
have mentioned it to did not know it pays to repeat: Yahoo & Hotmail
are not secure when accessed via WLANs.  True, they use https when
logging in, but all subsequent page views are done via http.  For
further details see:
