Subject: Solaris telnet vulnberability - how many on your
	network?

Johannes Ullrich from the SANS ISC sent this to me and then I saw it on
the DSHIELD list:

----
    If you run Solaris, please check if you got telnet enabled NOW. If you
    can, block port 23 at your perimeter. There is a fairly trivial
    Solaris telnet 0-day.

    telnet -l "-froot" [hostname]

    will give you root on many Solaris systems with default installs
    We are still testing. Please use our contact form at
    https://isc.sans.org/contact.html
    if you have any details about the use of this exploit.
----

You mean they still use telnet?!

Update from HD Moore:
"but this bug isnt -froot, its -fanythingbutroot =P"

On the exploits@ mailing list and on DSHIELD this vulnerability was
verified as real.

If Sun doesn't yet block port 23/tcp incoming on their /8, I'd make it a
strong suggestion.

Anyone else running Solaris?

	Gadi.
