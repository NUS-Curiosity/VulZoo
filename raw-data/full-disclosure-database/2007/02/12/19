Everybody with the BSD tools had this bug 10-12 years ago; AIX stood out 
because there was some guy at IBM who was being... vocal about how much of a 
pain for him it was that people were exploiting the bug and making him work 
late.  Curiously, he disappeared off USENET and couldn't be found in the IBM 
directory shortly after his manager posted a public apology.... 

But this is pathetic.  It's 2007, this is a known attack vector for the 
rlogin/telnet family of commands.  And it does work on all our Solaris 10 
boxes.  At least they're behind a firewall.
