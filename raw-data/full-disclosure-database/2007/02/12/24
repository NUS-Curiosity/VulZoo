For root login; there is a setting in /etc/default/login. If CONSOLE is 
set, then root can only login
on that device i.e. "CONSOLE=/dev/ttya" means "root" can only login on 
ttya device. Any other user via
telnet/ssh/whatever has to login as themselves and "su" to root.

This doesn't prevent telnet -l "-fbin", or -flp; for those accounts best 
bet is to change /etc/passwd for the shell of system-account users to 
/sbin/noshell or /bin/false (noshell just logs the entry and exists)

Of course disabling in.telnetd in /etc/inetd.conf (and doing a pkill -HUP 
inetd) if possible is a safe bet,
but some sites are forced to use telnetd.
