Feb 02, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

BlueCoat WinProxy is an Internet sharing proxy server designed for small to
medium businesses. In addition to internet sharing Winproxy also hosts a
series of security, anti-spam and anti-spyware capabilities. More
information can be located at the link shown below.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a design error in Blue Coat Systems Inc.'s WinProxy
allows attackers to trigger a heap corruption vulnerability.  

The vulnerability can be triggered by sending an overly long HTTP CONNECT
request to WinProxy's HTTP proxy service.

potentially execute arbitrary code.

Overly long payloads will result in a non-exploitable DoS condition.
