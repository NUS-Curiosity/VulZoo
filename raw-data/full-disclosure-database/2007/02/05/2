Key-based logon is a bad idea in general because afaik, it's not
possible to implement any type of password policy on those keys. This
therefore potentially allows someone with access to those keys, access
to further accounts or resources on remote systems.
The exception to this where the task required, can be suitably
restricted to a small and preferably unprivileged set of commands,
such as in automated logons.
