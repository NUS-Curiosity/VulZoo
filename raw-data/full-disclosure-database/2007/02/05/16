Subject: Informix SQL injection

List,

    I'm doing a pentest on a website that uses informix web datablade and
found a sql injection point. I have been able to use the webexplode() stored
procedure to execute any SQL commands, and also operating system commands
using SYSTEM. The problem I have is that SYSTEM doesnt return the execution
result(its a procedure, not a function), so I have to save them to a file;
for example : SYSTEM 'ls /etc/ > /tmp/result' and then read that file... the
problem is... how do i read that file ? I have tried with "load from ..."
and it fails with a sintax error, and on the other side, when I use
FILETOCLOB('/tmp/result','server') i dont know how to get the contents of
the CLOB... anyone knows something informix ?

Cheers,
