latest VMWare Player [1.0.2 or above] also affected.  damn, was hoping
to use this for redistribution leverage. oh well... :)

you can also try the following in your vmx:
isolation.tools.hgfs.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.dnd.disable = "TRUE"
isolation.tools.copy.enable = "FALSE"
isolation.tools.paste.enabled = "FALSE"

but i have not verified against all workstation / player versions
across OS's.  feedback appreciated.
