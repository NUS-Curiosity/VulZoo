Subject: (Psexec on *NIX)

Hi,
some years later but we're having the same problem in our lab.
I'm developing an administrative tool through an internal website in 
PHP, which runs on a linux machine. We have 150 computers and we 
already use some linux commands to interact with our computers 
through the website.
Moreover I already use PSExec on my windows PCs to do all the stuff.
What I would like to do is use just the website platform and for that 
reason I'm looking for something similar to PSExec under linux.
Did you solve the problem? Have you been able to find out something 
interesting? Should I give up with this?

Thank you very much in advance for any suggestion you can give me.

Best regards

Gianluca Giacometti
