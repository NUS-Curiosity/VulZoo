Subject: umount crash and xterm (kind of) information leak!

Hi!
In the past few days I faced two "interesting" situations!
One was a "SEGFAULT" in umount command, and
other is some kind of "information leak" in terminal
emulators (tested in xterm). Here is the link os the posts,
so anyone can check it out.

Sorry for posting links, that is not a ADV. I just didnt want
to post it here again.. ;)

regards
