I'm genuinely surprised by the amount of (mostly positive ;-) feedback I
got! Just an one-time, quick heads up: in response to numerous
suggestions, I added a couple of fairly significant features to the tool
that should make it capable of discovering far more - so if you
downloaded it several days ago, you might want to update your copy:

  - It now supports SSL connections, custom-crafted requests including
    POSTs, and input from external sources (for evaluation of non-WWW
    tokens of any type),

  - It now uses GNU MP library to losslessly handle alphabets that do
not
    directly map to binary (this is big),

  - Can run spatial correlation checks as well as temporal analysis of
    bitstreams in acquired samples,

  - The output is much more readable, some minor bugs were fixed.

A much better documentation is available, as well. The tarball for
version
0.04 is available here: http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/stompy.tgz

Regards (and shutting up!),
