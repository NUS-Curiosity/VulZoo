Are you selling us the "javascript:" URL as "JaSiLDBG JavaScript inLine 
Debugger"? From all I can tell from your doc, you simply renamed 
"javascript:" to "JaSiLDBG".

Would have been more appropriate, and more useful, if you would have 
called your doc "How to use the javascript: URL
Dynamically inspect and modify webpages".

The doc does seem to be a useful as introduction.

It contains an error right on the second page, though (I didn't read 
much further): "the difference between properties and attributes is that 
you canâ€™t change attributes". That's not correct. Properties are (in C++ 
language) "member variables" of JS objects, while attributes are 
conceptually more or less the same, just on DOM/XML/HTML nodes. Most of 
them are not represented as JS properties due to potential name 
collisions, but you can get them via the getAttribute() function, and 
you can set/change them via setAttribute(). You mention it yourself on 
page 14. The whole DHTML / AJAX movement bases on that.

A very interesting and very stretching use of javascript: URLs can be 
found at <http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/>. Highly recommended.
