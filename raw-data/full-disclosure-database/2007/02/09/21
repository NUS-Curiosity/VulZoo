Looks like the classic conundrum of many security systems: If you
don't advertise it, people won't use it. If you do advertise it,
evildoers are going to figure out a way to circumvent it.
Next thing you know, abductors will strip their victims naked and ship
their clothes off to Timbuktu - just to make things more interesting for
law enforcement...
