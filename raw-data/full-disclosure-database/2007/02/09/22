I was thinking the same thing, I doubt it would be any different to just
track a cell phone the same way. Most (all?) cell phones now a days use
GPS, tracking someone using a cell phone would be easy as pie. Hell, you
probably just call them anyway, albeit the Alzheimer patients might not
be able to give great directions.

That said, giving your kid shoes with GPS isn't a bad idea by any means,
using your kids name as the password and having a pedophile call the
number and guess the password (trivial) and be able to track your kid is
where this is all going to go south.

don't advertise it, people won't use it. If you do advertise it,
evildoers are going to figure out a way to circumvent it.
Next thing you know, abductors will strip their victims naked and ship
their clothes off to Timbuktu - just to make things more interesting for
law enforcement...
