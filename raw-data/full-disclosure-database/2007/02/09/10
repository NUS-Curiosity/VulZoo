Subject: Denial Of Service in Internet Explorer for MS
	Windows Mobile 5.0

Denial Of Service in Internet Explorer for MS Windows Mobile 5.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Date of Release: 09/02/2007

Description: A vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer for Microsoft
Windows Mobile 5.0 (for smart phone and pocket PC) that impacts upon the
availability and security of devices operating on this platform. It is
possible for an attacker to create an overflow state within Internet
Explorer, resulting in the termination of the normal functionality of IE and
a Denial of Service, should the device browser access a WML page with
malformed content. Users of affected devices must perform a hard battery
reset in order to resume Internet Explorer and normal device operations.

Patch / Fix: No patch is available at this time

Advisory History: This issue was first reported to Microsoft on 31/01/07.

Full technical details of this vulnerability will be withheld for the next
ninety days, or until such time as a patch / fix is forthcoming (whichever
event happens first).

BTW: I know this is technically not Full Disclosure, but I'm 'attempting' to
play nice with MS - hence the 90 day delay  (or until patch). I'll keep this
list posted  regarding full tech details as soon as is possible, but thought
folks would like to know an issue exists in the interim. Cheers.
