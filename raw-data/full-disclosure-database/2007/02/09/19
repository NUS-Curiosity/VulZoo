Subject: Re: DVR (Digital Video Recorders) + hack?

I've DOS's one with ICMP before using fragmentation attacks (a Nessus 
plugin actually did it). Only crashed the web interface .. the unit 
still recorded, but you couldn't get to it remotely. Required a 
power-cycle to fix.

Vendor has since fixed it with new firmware.

If you're on the same L2 segment, do a MITM with ARP and stash a laptop. 
Then just wait for somebody to login.

Cheers,
