Subject: Hi, I'm v3dt3n

Hi,

I want attention.

Give it to me by replying to my troll posts.

Of course, to help you I would like to create the impression I know a
gazillion things about security and the way it should be applied. I'll come
up with my own philosophy and will coin words to change the world of
security.

Regards & troll forever,
v3dt3n
