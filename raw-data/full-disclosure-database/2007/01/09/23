Subject: IisShield 2.2 released

All,

KodeIT is proud to announce the new release of IisShield 2.2 with support
for IIS 4.0, IIS 5.x and IIS 6.0.

Some new features include the ability to define zones with specific rules.
With this feature, rules can be split into zones allowing the filtering
process to be applied in a per-zone scope versus a per-server scope. Zones
are used to specify which requests are included or excluded requests from
the filtering engine.

Cheers,
Tiago Halm
KodeIT Development Team
