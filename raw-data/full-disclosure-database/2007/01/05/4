- a variant of Java/ClassLoader (the applet)
- Internet Explorer (MDAC) Remote Code Execution Exploit (MS06-014)
- MoBB #18: WebViewFolderIcon setSlice

all these are http 1.1 download exec shellcodes pointed to some
exe files on nownames.org and the0count.com

http://www.now[REMOVEME]names.org/welded/get_exe.php
http://www.the[REMOVEME]0count.com/serv.exe
http://www.now[REMOVEME]names.org/images/funny.php
