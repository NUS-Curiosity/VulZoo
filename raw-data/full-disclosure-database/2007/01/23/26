 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDKSA-2006:217-2
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 Package : proftpd
 Date    : January 23, 2007
 Affected: Corporate 3.0
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 Problem Description:
 
 A stack-based buffer overflow in the sreplace function in ProFTPD 1.3.0
 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service, as
 demonstrated by vd_proftpd.pm, a "ProFTPD remote exploit."
 (CVE-2006-5815)

 Buffer overflow in the tls_x509_name_oneline function in the mod_tls
 module, as used in ProFTPD 1.3.0a and earlier, and possibly other
 products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large
 data length argument, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-5815.
 (CVE-2006-6170)

 ProFTPD 1.3.0a and earlier does not properly set the buffer size limit
 when CommandBufferSize is specified in the configuration file, which
 leads to an off-by-two buffer underflow.  NOTE: in November 2006, the
 role of CommandBufferSize was originally associated with CVE-2006-5815,
 but this was an error stemming from an initial vague disclosure. NOTE:
 ProFTPD developers dispute this issue, saying that the relevant memory
 location is overwritten by assignment before further use within the
 affected function, so this is not a vulnerability. (CVE-2006-6171)

 Packages have been patched to correct these issues.

 Update:

 The update for the Corporate 3.0 platforms had a bad patch for
 CVE-2006-5815, which prevented some clients from being able to use the
 server. This update corrects this issue.
