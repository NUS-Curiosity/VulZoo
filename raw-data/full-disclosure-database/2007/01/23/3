[Fred Cohen "invented" this anti-malware approach in discussing the
[mitigation of computer viruses in his seminal (Ph.D. thesis) research
[of the properties of computer viruses.  AFAIK he did not patent the
[idea, and he certainly did implement it in an unsuccessful commercial
[product so there is solid prior art.  Further, there are several more
[recent implementations of more-or-less the same idea.
