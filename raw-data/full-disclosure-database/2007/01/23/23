Synopsis
========

xine-ui improperly handles format strings, possibly allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

xine-ui is a skin-based user interface for xine. xine is a free
multimedia player. It plays CDs, DVDs, and VCDs, and can also decode
other common multimedia formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package  /       Vulnerable       /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  xine-ui     < 0.99.5_pre20060716            >= 0.99.5_pre20060716

Description
===========

Due to the improper handling and use of format strings, the
errors_create_window() function in errors.c does not safely write data
to memory.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media file
with xine-ui, and possibly execute arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-ui users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/xine-ui-0.99.5_pre20060716"
