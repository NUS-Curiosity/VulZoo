Subject: CSRF-ing “Blogger Classic”

A few days ago, an experiment on hijacking blogs through CSRF attacks
was published on GNUCITIZEN. In this particular case, the chosen
blogging platform for the experiment was Blogger. Now, a few days
later, I can confirm that Google has tokenized the requests that made
it possible to hijack a blog in a two-shots attack.
