You have re-discovered this already long known (mis-)feature (well,

here, and many other places, many times before...

Let's see -- does "made in Redmiond" not suggest the answer to you?

Hell, I'm only surprised if something MS made works _consistently_ 
across all seemingly similar conditions.  Screwed-up, semi-
understandable but all confused to hell shit like this is the _norm_ 
for MS software...
