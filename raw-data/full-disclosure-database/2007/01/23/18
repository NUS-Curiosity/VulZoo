I beleive that doesn't have anything to do with capitalism or whatever
social system. Is about not using the right developement politics that's
quite different.

You wanna be natural? Fine dress yourself  with some  animal skins(or maybe
stay naked) do no take baths do not shave yourself  and live till you get 30
years in cave eating roots you find somewhere or jeje killing animals and
you will be quite natural. Ahh and forget about internet and computers
because in the first place you won't have electricity, that is quite
artificial. Ahh and forget about medicines they are man made.

 Sure they are doing quite well. I beleive you are talking about something

I beleive that's the natural way of growing things. After all that's what is
civilization about otherwise we were only small tribes trying to not die of
hunger instead of having a society.

Hmm I beleive you have to read some more about that. Anyway in case it is
not infinite is so huge (I believe you still don't understand how much, is
like our entire galaxy is a little grain of sand on a beach, in fact less
than that) that you can assume it is for the next hmm... billions of bilions
of years to come. And that things they say about energy and oil... Jaj the
Sun is there wasting millions of megawatts every second throwing them to the
space and you all talk about some stupid oil or carbon that is going to
reach its end by some X year instead putting all of your efforts into
finding ways to get that energy shining in front of your face. And then if
the Sun becomes dead some day then there are billions of other stars out
there. As said Einstein "there are two infinite things, the universe and
human stupidity"  So in my opinion is a very stupid idea that one of stoping
developement with such excuses.
