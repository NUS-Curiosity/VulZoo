*ABOUT SYSCAN’07*

The Symposium on Security for Asia Network (SyScan) aims to be a very 
different security conference from the rest of the security conferences 
that the information security community in Asia has come to be so 
familiar and frustrated with. SyScan intends to be a non-product, 
non-vendor biased security conference. It is the aspiration of SyScan to 
congregate, in Singapore, the best security experts in their various 
fields, to share their research, discovery and experience with all 
security enthusiasts in Asia.

Besides main the conference, there will also be specialized security 
training courses in SyScan’07. These classes will be held before the 
main conference.

SyScan’07 will be held in Singapore over at the Swissotel Merchant Court 
Hotel. The main conference will be held on 5^th and 6^th of July and the 
training will be held on 3^rd and 4^th of July, 2007.
