well it depends on how you model the dependencies, in computational
terms, modeling unrestricted dependencies between bits is equivalent
to constructing propositional formulae over the binary variables in
question (for MD5 this would be input/IV bits).

Solving the resultant formula, and hence *breaking* MD5 (computing
collisions, invariant IV's [which has already been done by similar
techniques], etc..) is equivalent to SAT, and thus NP-Complete
requiring exponential time by conjecture. This would probably only
require polynomial space, but the time would kill you.



Out of interest, similar techniques have been applied to DES, an
obfuscated DES implementation computing DES blocks by constructing a
Binary Decision Diagram of several conjoined rounds of the cipher.
However, you will never be able to build the complete BDD (for all
rounds) as this would permit computing a key for a known plain-text in
time linear in the number of key bits!.
