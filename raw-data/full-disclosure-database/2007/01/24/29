Where do you see 1+ year? *Pre-existing* means there already existed a
"vaccine" that blocked vulnerabilities of this type released in '05. This
does not necessarily mean that was when ZDI received the bug submission. So
it was reported to the vendor in October and released to the public in
January... 4 months is not an outstanding patch time.
