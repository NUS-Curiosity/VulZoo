Speaking as someone whose current employer has chosen to subscribe
its NOC staff group email (a member of which, thankfully, I am not)
on an Exchange server to various security mailing lists, in the
interest of having the NOC monitor security alerts and open tickets
over those affecting systems and applications in use, for which
purpose they of course use Outlook... Yes, it pretty definitely
does, and gets you in places that are otherwise decently protected.

There's little cure for stupidity at the management level other than
patience.
