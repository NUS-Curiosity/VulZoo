Holy shit... your web host is using commie-source Stalinware! Don't
you know anything people work on without profit motivation is going to
end up in Great Purges and Nazi Holocausts?! Prove you are not working
with... THEM... and find a host who runs IIS on Windows like good
patriotic Americans! Or you are supporting genocide!

In other news:
- GW Bush, Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, and Colin Powell piloted the
planes on 9/11 (they jumped out at the last minute)
- Hurricane Katrina was caused by the Yakuza using weather control
technology developed in the 1960s- they are mad about the US using the
atomic bombs in WWII
- Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro dine together nightly and always split
the same dish: one human baby (this is what's keeping Castro alive)
- The Russkies are STILL after our precious bodily fluids
