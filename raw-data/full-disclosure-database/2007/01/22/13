Subject: Re: detecting targetted malware

Hi

What you are referring to is a 'white-list' of applications, e.g. you
have an application that runs at a low level and only allows a list of
approved or allowed applications to run.  These do not necessarily
need to scan you system as they can work at run-time - each time an
application of any sort tries to run the monitoring application checks
it against it's list off approved applications and decides whether it
can start or not (this obviously needs to be more than just the
application name some sort of checksum and / or other intelligence is
required to ensure a malicious application cannot masquerade as an
approved one).

Various tools can offer this service with varying degrees of
complexity / intelligence, AppSense springs to mind as one that
specializes in this service, but many desktop protection tools that
offer AV/ firewall / IDS etc also offer white / black list application
controls.

cheers
