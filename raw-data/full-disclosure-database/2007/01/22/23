Synopsis
========

Adobe Acrobat Reader is vulnerable to remote code execution, Denial of
Service, and cross-site scripting attacks.

Background
==========

Adobe Acrobat Reader is a PDF reader released by Adobe.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/acroread       < 7.0.9                          >= 7.0.9

Description
===========

Adobe Acrobat Reader in stand-alone mode is vulnerable to remote code
execution via heap corruption when loading a specially crafted PDF
file.

The browser plugin released with Adobe Acrobat Reader (nppdf.so) does
not properly handle URLs, and crashes if given a URL that is too long.
The plugin does not correctly handle JavaScript, and executes
JavaScript that is given as a GET variable to the URL of a PDF file.
Lastly, the plugin does not properly handle the FDF, xml, xfdf AJAX
request parameters following the # character in a URL, allowing for
multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF file
and execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running Adobe
Acrobat Reader. An attacker could also entice a user to browse to a
specially crafted URL and either crash the Adobe Acrobat Reader browser
plugin, execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's
browser, or inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the document being
viewed by the user. Note that users who have emerged Adobe Acrobat
Reader with the "nsplugin" USE flag disabled are not vulnerable to
issues with the Adobe Acrobat Reader browser plugin.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Acrobat Reader users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/acroread-7.0.9"
