Subject: Re: detecting targetted malware

Dear lsi,

This  approach  is  already  implemented,  at  least partially, to limit
functionality  of  unknown  applications.  It  can  be found in multiple
personal firewalls or things like http://www.securesize.com/GeSWall/

There  is  a better approach - every "good" application should be signed
and  unsigned  applications are not allowed to run. But any approach has
it's  weakness.  Malware  code should not necessary be an executable. It
can  be  html, doc, pdf, jpg, gif - anything that contain data processed
by  some  trusted application. Can you make signature or sign every html
or gif?
