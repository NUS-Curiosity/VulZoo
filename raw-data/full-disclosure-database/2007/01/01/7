Subject: Re: Vista Reduced Function mode triggered


  Didn't have the chance / interest to meet Vista myself as of yet, but
if what you wrote isn't user error or something specific and limited to
only a few computers then excuse me a moment while i lmao. BTW, is there
anything in vista's agreement in legalish that could be translated into
'you agree that you feed your software internet' ? Maybe micro$ says
that this is needed to verify that you're running a legal OS every now
and then, so $uck it ? :-) Sorry for not having ideas just raising more
questions, hope somebody replies in a few pointing out the obvious.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Vista Reduced Function mode triggered


The other day I used my router to limit my Vista laptop from talking to 
anything but one subnet on the internet. 3 days later suddenly some
things 
would not work.

Solitaire failed to start, click on it and you get the magic donut
showing 
it's starting up then nothing.

Right click on network and pick properties you get the magic donut
showing 
it's starting up then nothing.

So I removed the routes so Vista could once again phone home and within
a 
minute or two both solitaire and network properties worked just fine.

Now this Vista system is less than 30 days old and has already been 
activated. So the claims that Reduced Function mode only kicks in if you

don't activate within 30 days is bunk if this is Reduced Function mode.

So I decided to trigger RF mode on purpose to see how it responds. I
stopped 
the Software License service which claims that doing so will trigger RF 
mode. 24 hours later solitaire, network properties, and control panel
all 
show the same behavior, the magic donut showing they are starting up
then 
nothing. No events in event log, nothing.

I then started the Software License service and presto like magic these 
functions work again. So I'm convinced that the machine being routed so
it 
can't talk to MS triggered RF mode within a few days. Now to me this
seems 
pretty clear even though it wasn't a real scientific method of testing.
And 
further, this looks to me like an accident waiting to happen. I mean
imagine 
if MS fell off the planet we would have a pretty major problem as the
bulk 
of the worlds computers started shutting down, talk about a security
issue?

So anyone here with a bit more technical expertise want to pick up this
ball 
and run with it?

Geo.
