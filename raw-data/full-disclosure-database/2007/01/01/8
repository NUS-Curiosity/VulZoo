Subject: Jeff Bernstein

It has come to my attention that Jeff Bernstein has been falsely using the
names of SNOsoft Research Team members. Moreover, Jeff Bernstein has been
falsely associating himself with the SNOsoft/HP/DMCA vulnerability research
and development ordeal that happened earlier in 2001.

Jeff Bernstein has never been affiliated with the SNOsoft Research Team nor
will he ever be. Jeff Bernstein does not work with nor has he ever directly
worked with any of the SNOsoft Team Members.

If anyone has talked with, or speaks with Jeff Bernstein in the future and
if Mr. Bernstein mentions SNOsoft, please contact me immediately at
simon@...soft.com.

Thank you.
