---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The annual DIMVA conference serves as a premier forum for advancing the
state of the art in intrusion detection, malware detection, and
vulnerability assessment. Each year DIMVA brings together international
experts from academia, industry and government to present and discuss
novel research in these areas. DIMVA is organized by the special interest
group "Security - Intrusion Detection and Response" of the German
Informatics Society (GI). The conference proceedings will appear in
Springer's "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" (LNCS) series.

DIMVA solicits submission of high-quality, original scientific work. This
year we invite two types of paper submissions:

- Full papers, presenting novel and mature research results. Full papers
  are limited to 20 pages, prepared according to the instructions
  provided below. They will be reviewed by the program committee, and
  papers accepted for presentation at the conference will be included in
  the proceedings.
    
- Short papers (extended abstracts), presenting original, still ongoing
  work that has not yet reached the maturity required for a full paper.
  Short papers are limited to 10 pages, prepared according to the
  instructions provided below. They will also be reviewed by the program
  committee, and papers accepted for presentation at the conference will
  be included in the proceedings (containing "Extended Abstract" in the
  title).
    
DIMVA's scope includes, but is not restricted to the following areas:

- Intrusion Detection
  * Approaches
  * Implementations
  * Prevention and response
  * Result correlation
  * Evaluation
  * Potentials and limitations
  * Operational experiences
  * Evasion and other attacks
  * Legal and social aspects
    
- Malware
  * Techniques
  * Detection
  * Prevention
  * Evaluation
  * Trends and upcoming risks
  * Forensics and recovery
    
- Vulnerability Assessment
  * Vulnerabilities
  * Vulnerability detection
  * Vulnerability prevention

DIMVA particularly encourages papers that discuss the integration of
intrusion, malware, and vulnerability detection in large-scale
operational communication networks.

All papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the
