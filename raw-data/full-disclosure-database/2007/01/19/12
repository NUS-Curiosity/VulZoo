Subject: Re: iDefense Q-1 2007 Challenge -I WILL BUY FOR
 MORE

Dear NoBalls, 
    What specifically is a "fuckface" anyway and why are you hiding behind
an anonymous email account?

More importantly, my words were not:

"SAME TARGETS: ie7 VISTA 8k, I know someone who will pay much for up
to 75 for the same."

Hell that sentence doesn't even make any sense! What the heck does "much for
up to 75 for the same" even mean?

My EXACT words were:

"Amen!
    KF is 100% on the money. I can arrange the legitimate purchase of most
working exploits for significantly more money than iDefense, In some cases
over $75,000.00 per purchase. The company that I am working with has a
relationship with a legitimate buyer, all transactions are legal. If you're
interested contact me and we'll get the ball rolling.

-Simon
   

    $8000.00 USD is low!"

-End of my words- 

;]
