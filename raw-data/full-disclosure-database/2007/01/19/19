neither did he, he just reiterated your previous assertion of the
possibility of a $75k windfall for an exploit and made a comment about
that assertion.

Amen!
   KF is 100% on the money. I can arrange the legitimate purchase of most
working exploits for significantly more money than iDefense, In some cases
over $75,000.00 per purchase. The company that I am working with has a
relationship with a legitimate buyer, all transactions are legal. If you're
interested contact me and we'll get the ball rolling.

   $8000.00 USD is low!
