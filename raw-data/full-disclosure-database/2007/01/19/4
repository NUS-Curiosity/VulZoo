 MORE

Then you cannot assure that your buyer will make an ethical use of the
exploit. So what's the real difference against selling it to another people
(known or "unknown", where "unknown" could be black-hats, script-kiddies or
whoever making the higher bid)? The receipt? :) I mean, if I (as a
researcher) don't mind what the exploit will be used for, I'd simply look
for the higher bidder (I guess).

And you didn't really answer my former two questions... Please, could you
provide some specific examples of typical ways to justify ROI? Which is the
typical profile/s of enterprise/s buying exploits? (without naming
particular enterprises, of course).
