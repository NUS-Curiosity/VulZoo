This is complete bullshit nothing more than a social engineering 
honey pot to get bugs and vulns for their own use, this company 
couldn't affort 75.ooo USD if they tried, they cannot even find 
their own bugs, they got 4 or 5 shitty "reasearch and vuln" 
findings of thier own, that's it.

75.000 for a remote vista ie7 xploit, guaranteed you wont find it 
and if you do they won't pay

lose lose :(
