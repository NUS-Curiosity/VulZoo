It's a pretty easy proof actually.  If your password input routine allows
more different passwords than there are possible hashes, you *will* have
collisions.  For instance, if you use a 64-bit hash, and reasonable-length
passwords, you can create more than 2**64 of them, and 2 *have* to collide.

If you're using anything resembling a sane hash (such as MD5 or similar),
what happens is that you basically ignore the hash collisions - because
rather than "1234", your colliding password/phrase is probably a 32-byte or so
string, which is likely not even enterable at the keyboard (it ends up being
A # ctl-b 9 e alt-control-meta-$ etcetc - of the 32, likely only 10 or so
of the characters are from the 96-char printable ASCII set, and there's a good
chance that at least several of the bytes are ones you can't enter from the
keyboard at all....)
