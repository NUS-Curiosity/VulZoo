Agreed,  good sense helps in some cases ;)

Here again, I agree. Now, if one needs to exhaustively try every 
possible 32b hashes with the largest possible charset (or even bigger hashes
with a smaller - like those alphanumerical keys you just mentionned), to 
break a password hash, the it's not a "*BIG*" security issue like 
mentionned earlier imho.

Cheers,
