Synopsis
========

An assertion in oftpd could lead to a denial of service vulnerability.

Background
==========

oftpd is a small, anonymous only ftp daemon.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-ftp/oftpd     < 0.3.7-r3                          >= 0.3.7-r3

Description
===========

By specifying an unsupported address family in the arguments to a LPRT
or LPASV command, an assertion in oftpd will cause the daemon to abort.

Impact
======

Remote, unauthenticated attackers may be able to terminate any oftpd
process, denying service to legitimate users.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All oftpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/oftpd-0.3.7-r3"

References
==========
