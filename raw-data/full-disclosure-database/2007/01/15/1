#                                                                           

# ADtool is intended to help pentesters and admins in day a day work, there 

# is some other tools that can accomplish the work for listing domain       

# Servers, but unfortunately all other tools i had test are GUI based, and  

# in all was difficult to export a list of machines. So this tool is for    

# the work day a day, when you need to get a simple and easy to use list of

# all machines in a domain.                                                 

#                                                                           

# ADtool doesn't need any special membership, or user in the desired domain,

# just be connected on the same network, and information will come to you!. 

#                                                                           

#           Any comments or changes napa@...uritynation.com
