Well I think you should not ignore those collisions, in some cases binary
data could be entered as a password for example when sent over the network
so... do not count on having to type it on a keyboard machines can do that
for you ;).

BTW for that still do not beleive this bug is a BIG hole well... as an
example a friend of mine broke into a website about 2 days ago "reversing"
an MD5 hash. Using a similar bug in one of those php instant website
creation tools that disclosed the administrator password hash using some
sort of SQL injection. He was using a program similar to John the Ripper and
asked me for help since that was taking very long and he had no idea about
rainbow tables. I simply told him to use one of those online Rainbow tables
an the thing ended taking only a couple of minutes. And he was only learning
about SQL injection and was only one hash that popped when you typed in your
browser some sort of URL containing that SQL stuff. No imagine when you have
the whole database. No... is not BIG, is HUGE.
