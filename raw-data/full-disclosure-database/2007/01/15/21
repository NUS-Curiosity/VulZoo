Maybe because nobody was looking?
Here's a nice little exploit to overwrite any file on the system
courtesy of Rixstep.

Just run Undercover <ftp://rixstep.com/pub/Undercover.tar.bz2> once as
an administrator to create that nice little suid-tool.
Then run this app giving the path to the uc tool
(Undercover.app/Contents/Resources/uc) a file you want to overwrite,
and the file the data to overwrite with is located at.

The pwnies aren't just for everyone else Rixstep.
