    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-987
    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1002

Description:
    Previous versions of the rmake package do not drop supplemental users
    in the changeroot environment for builds.  This provides malicious
    packages with excess permissions that are configuration-dependent,
    and may allow local users to run arbitrary code as the root user.
    
    29 January 2007 Update: An audit uncovered one other part of rMake
    that contained a similar issue, enabling local users to provide
    malicious recipes that enable the same type of attack.  rMake 1.0.4
    resolves both issues.
