Subject: Re: Defeating Microsoft Office Genuine Advantage
	(OGA) Check

I would like to point out, that after some searching on the internet i
found a really easy "hack" to bypass OGA. The only thing that has to
be done, is to download de executable which generates the code and set
the compatibility mode of it to win2k. It seems to work for OGA (not
WGA).
As I did not examined the technical side of this 2 problems (why OGA
does work and WGA not and why an authentic code is generated in win2k
mode), this would be a nice subject for a paper or a poc like this.
