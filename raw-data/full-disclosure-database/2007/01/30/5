Jim, 
    In all reality you don't have to be an agent  to do this. You could just
write an exploit that when successfully executed would compromise the target
and then fetch an application from a remote site. I'm sure that things like
this have been done in the past. Hell imagine what you could do with a web
cam! ;]

    New telephones are no different I'm sure.
