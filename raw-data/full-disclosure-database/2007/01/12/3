Subject: Your free MacWorld Platinum Pass! Some hacking
	required.

Overview: IDG's website for conference registration performs client-side
	  validation of "Priority Codes" before being processed by the 
	  server.

Issue: 	  These codes are simple MD5 hashes included in the javascript.
	  In the case of MacWorldExpo, one of these codes allowed for heavily
	  discounted "Platinum Pass", valued at $1,695.

Result:	  The "Premier Pass" permits full access to the conference including 
	  the Power Tools series, MacIT Conference, Users Conference, Market
	  Symposium, Keynote (special line and seating so you will be able to 
	  see it), Free Lunch, etc.

Total cost after hack: $0.00

Details are blogged at:

This issue has been resolved by IDG and the conference is over. I wasn't
the only one who found it, just the only one who told them.
