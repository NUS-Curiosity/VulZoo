hi,
sorry but i know nothing about the real physical "quantic theory"
i'am not a physician
i just know there are 3 states : 0 ,1 and unknow

"How?  In what way?" >> look in the .rar

"> i used this lib for coding fuckmd5.cpp

You did?  I can't see any sign of tri-state logic in the final source
code."

ok for fuckmd5.cpp i just used qbyte.cpp only for know mask (the 0x1fff)
in reality the mask is dynamic but in this case this is static
and the code of fuckmd5.cpp is optimized :p but look in the .rar
maybe you will understand

:]
sorry if the name "qbyte" isn't really appropriate

if you have question : mail me
