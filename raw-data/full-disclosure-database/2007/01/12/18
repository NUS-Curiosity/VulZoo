Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities may allow the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/opera       < 9.10                             >= 9.10

Description
===========

Christoph Deal discovered that JPEG files with a specially crafted DHT
marker can be exploited to cause a heap overflow. Furthermore, an
anonymous person discovered that Opera does not correctly handle
objects passed to the "createSVGTransformFromMatrix()" function.

Impact
======

An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerabilities to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Opera by
enticing a victim to open a specially crafted JPEG file or a website
containing malicious JavaScript code.

Workaround
==========

The vendor recommends disabling JavaScript to avoid the
"createSVGTransformFromMatrix" vulnerability. There is no known
workaround for the other vulnerability.

Resolution
==========

All Opera users should update to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.10"
