Synopsis
========

The KDE kfile JPEG info plugin of kdegraphics could enter an endless
loop leading to a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

The KDE kfile-info JPEG plugin provides meta-information about JPEG
files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                             /  Vulnerable  /   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  kde-base/kdegraphics-kfile-plugins     < 3.5.5-r1     >= 3.5.5-r1

Description
===========

Marcus Meissner of the SUSE security team discovered a stack overflow
vulnerability in the code processing EXIF information in the kfile JPEG
info plugin.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted JPEG
image with a KDE application like Konqueror or digiKam, leading to a
Denial of Service by an infinite recursion.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All KDE users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/kdegraphics-kfile-plugins-3.5.5-r1"

References
==========
