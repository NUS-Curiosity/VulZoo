The policy is to strive to provide as much details as possible for 
administrators to determine their exposure but, at the same time, not to
make too easy for bad guys to exploit vulnerability. Again, the emphasis
is on exposure which does not necessary means that all technical details
are necessary. 

Sounds easy in theory but not always easy in practice. Therefore we
appreciate feedback on how are we doing.

Yes, the attacker must know the shared secret. Due to the vulnerability
the shared secret is the same for all affected devices. So, if you have
affected device then, in a way, you have and know it.

We can encourage customers not to do that by enforcing rules when they
change passwords. So we can help :)

There are no insolvable problems. 
The question is can you accept the solution?
