I am pretty sure no one noticed that I chose to gpg encrypt the Veritas 
exploits with lines from Pop Goes the Weasel last year...

22. VERITAS-Linux.pl.gpg - 'Veritas NetBackup <= 6.0 (bpjava-msvc) 
Remote Exploit (linux)'
      pass: allaroundthemulberrybush

21. VERITAS-OSX.pl.gpg - 'Veritas NetBackup <= 6.0 (bpjava-msvc) Remote 
Exploit (OSX)'
      pass: themonkeychasedtheweasel

20. VERITAS-WIN32.pl.gpg - 'Veritas NetBackup <= 6.0 (bpjava-msvc) 
Remote Exploit (WIN32)'
      pass: apennyforaneedle

check the interpretations section on Wikipedia for a hint as to why I 
may have done that.
(hint: it has something to do with getting paid in peanuts!).
