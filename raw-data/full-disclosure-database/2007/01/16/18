Subject: Re: Major gcc 4.1.1 and up security issue

Hi,

this looks strange.
I have made a test with gcc 4.03. The assertation was thrown correctly.
So, is this only with gcc > 4.1?
It seems that the interpretation of the standard was in gcc 4.03
"better".

~$ ./a.out
200 100
a.out: test.c:5: foo: Assertion `(int)(a+100) > 0' failed.
Aborted
kt1360@...006ru:~$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 4.0.3 (Ubuntu 4.0.3-1ubuntu5)
