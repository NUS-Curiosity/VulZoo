Maybe that's all they are worth to iDefense, since they aren't
monetizing them in the same way blackhats are.

Maybe for some people if they were going to just give them to Microsoft
anyway, a few thousand bucks is worth it.

Me, for example, if I were capable of of finding such vulns, I wouldn't
sell them to the guys writing the drive-by spyware installers. I might
sell it to iDefense or Tippingpoint, though.
