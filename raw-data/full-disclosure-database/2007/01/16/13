	were

It seems Rixstep thought they could fix their stupidity:
http://www.rixstep.com/1/1/20070115,02.shtml

Silent security updates aren't cool.

Unfortunately their bug fix was useless, maybe they forgot to actually
do any QA on it in their rush to say how fast they are at fixing
exploits. Or maybe they just don't have a clue.

And for the record Rixstep: I am not from Unsanity, I have not worked
for Unsanity, I do not own any Unsanity products. I just think that
you need to calm down on your "fanboy" pronouncements.

Oh and if you really wanted to give me a "free" license, feel free to
contact me at my evil data-mining gmail account. You told me not to
contact you (http://www.rixstep.com/0/contact.shtml) after all.

Same instructions as before folks. This version is written for
Undercover.tar.bz2 with an MD5 of a30aa6239181928953527c9579a56471.

Enjoy the pwnies.
