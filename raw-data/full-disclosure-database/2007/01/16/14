Subject: Re: Remedy Action Request System 5.01.02 -
	UserEnumeration

I regularly used to use Remedy in my previous duties. And okay, the 
authentication process does output a message specifying whether the user 
exists or not, and that is not a desirable aspect of any system.

I would like to say however, that Remedy was the most efficient system that 
I was aware of during the time of providing support with multiple 
systems+users. It has its problems, though I think it is fairly stable. And 
largley stable compared with other 'supposed call logging systems'. Having 
said that, I have not had any time to poke n probe it at all.

Seeing as most call logging systems for IT support are provided within a 
LAN/Secure W/LAN environment, the issue seems to be not so URGENT/SERIOUS. I 
mean, it is far easier to track instances of authentication login attempts 
in such a scenario, given certain security enforcements and params. I would 
think, others may disagree.

Yes, systems should not report whether a user does or does NOT exist, and 
such systems as Remedy can be used within any environment. But you would 
have to think that sys-admin's with any sense about them, would be aware to 
such issues with 3rd party app's, and take action accordingly ...
