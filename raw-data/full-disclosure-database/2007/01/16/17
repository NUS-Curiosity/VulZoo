PEBKAC, as usual. 

There was a spoofed login page at http://www.marcolano.com/login/
(Googlecache vers:
http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:u2RtwlpBqFcJ:www.marcolano.com/logi
n/+inurl:marcolano&hl=en&gl=uk&ct=clnk&cd=2) that was identical to the
myspace login page. My guess is that he's bounced people to it either
from his "funny" Tom Cruise joke page,
http://www.marcolano.com/funny/comic_tomcruise.html, which seems to be a
good bit of viral memeing, or the Marc Olano Editor (linked
(googlecache) from here:
http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:AT_1eXGvYf8J:profile.myspace.com/in
dex.cfm%3Ffuseaction%3Duser.viewprofile%26friendID%3D19262067+marc+olano
+editor+myspace&hl=en&gl=uk&ct=clnk&cd=1) which looks to be a layout
creator for myspace pages.

Either one would keep within his target demographic of myspace users,
though the Tom Cruise one less so.

Though I admit I have no idea what
"fuseaction=mail.inbox&Mytoken=C4A2B3AF-1320-5CEA-FA0C50BA36B05197421825
75" does, one of the hidden inputs in his spoofed login page.

That's from some relatively lo-fi google-fu, a look at the domain gives
registration info that's probably relatively current. Maybe someone
should call him and ask :)?
