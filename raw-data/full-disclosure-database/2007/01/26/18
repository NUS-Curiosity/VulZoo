A number of teams at EarthLink have reviewed both this claim and our  
code. We have concluded that this exploit does not exist. While we  
can not go into the details of our proprietary code, we can confirm  
validation methods are in place that would prevent an outsider from  
gaining access to the spamBlocker whitelist via these APIs.

Thanks,
