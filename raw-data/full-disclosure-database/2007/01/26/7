 string vulnerabilities]

Hi list,

I couldn't get a confirmation from the author of this post.
GLSAs are very often the best source of detailed information
on a given vulnerability imho ; at least, They provide indications
on the type of vulnerability and the afected function name.

Too bad they're inacurate :/

Regards,
