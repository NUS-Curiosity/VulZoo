Synopsis
========

Cacti has three vulnerabilities that could allow shell command
execution or SQL injection.

Background
==========

Cacti is a web-based network graphing and reporting tool.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/cacti      < 0.8.6i-r1                  >= 0.8.6i-r1

Description
===========

rgod discovered that the Cacti cmd.php and copy_cacti_user.php scripts
do not properly control access to the command shell, and are remotely
accessible by unauthenticated users. This allows SQL injection via
cmd.php and copy_cacti_user.php URLs. Further, the results from the
injected SQL query are not properly sanitized before being passed to a
command shell. The vulnerabilities require that the
"register_argc_argv" option is enabled, which is the Gentoo default.
Also, a number of similar problems in other scripts were reported.

Impact
======

These vulnerabilties can result in the execution of arbitrary shell
commands or information disclosure via crafted SQL queries.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cacti users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/cacti-0.8.6i-r1"
