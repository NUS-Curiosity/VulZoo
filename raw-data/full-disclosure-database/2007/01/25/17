	Server Print Provider Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Just before I call Citrix support, anyone know if this exploit works on PS4
R01?

Citrix's own document suggests that R02 is the problem release, however my
guess is that it also works in R01 (as it effects XP and PS3 also, why
wouldnt R01 be affected?).

Cheers.
