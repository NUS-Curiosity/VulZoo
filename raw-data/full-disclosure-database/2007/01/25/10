Sure... I was aware of an opening and inquired about it as I was trying 
to offload the Veritas bug perhaps? I am pretty sure I never directly 
applied for it or even took an interview for it. In reality I was not 
willing to relocate thus the position was not even an after thought.

hrmm how about those hushmail accounts.
