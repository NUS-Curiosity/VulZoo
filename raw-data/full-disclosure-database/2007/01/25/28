Subject: Re: Mac zealots backdating advisories

Whoever this idiot "rixstep_pwnies" is, please get him off this list. I 
am sick and tired of reading his rantings.

"Please use this list as the valuable resource we intend it to be."

Another Mac zealot who hides behind anonymity and still feels offended 
when called out? Admittedly it is funny BUT IT DOES NOT BELONG HERE.

And yes, he did backdate that advisory. That was obvious. But writing 
to this list to discuss such nonsense? In a word, "NO."

If this person has an issue with a company, he should write to that 
company and not to this list. My reading is he has never written to the 
company in question and even goes on a warpath because they express a 
dislike for Gmail. What has that to do with this list?

Such immature behaviour is not becoming for this list.
