Subject: Fair Exploit Price and Purchase

Hi List, 
    My recent post about purchasing exploits has generated more responses
than I can count. In response to the massive volume of email and questions
that I've received, I've posted the rules and requirements for using my
services to legitimately sell your exploits to authorized, legal U.S.
buyers. You can see this posting on the SNOsoft blog site at
http://snosoft.blogspot.com.

    Please keep in mind that I do not do this for a living. I'm just tired
of seeing security researchers getting taken advantage of. If this works and
if people like my honesty and the value that I can bring to them, then we'll
keep doing it. If not, then we'll just stop.

-Simon
