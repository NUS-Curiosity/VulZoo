-- CVE ID:
CVE-2007-0243

-- Affected Vendor:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sun Microsystems Java Virtual Machine
(JVM). User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in
that the target must visit a malicious website.

The specific flaw exists during the parsing of GIF image components.
When the image width in an image block of a valid GIF file is set to 0,
the Java runtime will allocate the specified size but subsequently copy
all data to the under allocated memory chunk. The overflow results in
the corruption of multiple pointers, at least one of which is later
dereferenced and can therefore result in execution of arbitrary code.

-- Vendor Response:
Sun has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
