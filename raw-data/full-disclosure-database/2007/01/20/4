no, the wikipedia ideology is NOT like communism. i even doubt they
have something like an ideology.

however, you should also apologize for your ranting about something
(communism) you don't even know the basics of (i.e., it's definition).

your superior system of capitalism destroys the planet for long time
now. at least, we're getting at an end as climate change (carbon
dioxide, methan, etc.) leads to mass extinctions within the next two
decades (at a maxmimum) due to 'the weather being reconfigured around
the planet'.

so in future those who cause this won't be able to satisfy their needs
on burgers, hot dogs etc., thus not being able to drive their SUVs.
nature will win :)

most interesting, alas Cuba is on its way to communism (no, it is no
communism there, this is socialism, the first step to) is the only
country with sustainable development (*although* the US put an embargo
on them *decades* ago):

capitalism is about exponential, endless growth; the physician will say
that this is not possible because the universe is not endless. the
doctor will tell you that the only thing that achieves this is:
cancer. (which, as capitalism, is its own murderer :)

haef phun,

t. <- at least anticapitalist and still waiting for a _single_
democracy that works as the definition says.
