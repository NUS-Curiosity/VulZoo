Subject: [funsec] AV and Marketing Babes

We discussed NOD32's marketing with putting "NOD32 protects your ass" on
babes while playing sports (!!!) -
http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/387 , now we need to
discuss something much more exciting, although less innovative.

Bit Defender! :)

Words are a-wasting, go watch their babes (not just booth-babes) at this
gaming show. Make sure and not just stare at the babes, but listen to the
Bit Defender song!

Note: not work-safe, and may be offensive to some viewers.
