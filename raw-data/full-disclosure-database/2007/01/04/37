well, there we go - that's google's response to the problem, and I
suppose it's hardly google's fault if we use crap passwords anyway.

BUT at the same time, it springs to mind, why would google opt for a
mechanism which sends all of this information, in plain text, to the
client? surely it would be possible to run the site checking mechanism
server-side, and if not, at least make it a bit more difficult to get
to the data?

I didn't spend too much time reading how the information was gathered,
but I'm guessing it was just your standard interception through a
paraos-type proxy. However, this begs the question of how much
personal data google should be allowed to store - let *alone* send it
to other users of the internet.

Regards,
Ronald.
