Subject: [OOT] Intrusion Prevention System Impelementation
	Methodology

Hello All,

I'm trying to find methodology for implementing intrusion prevention system
in my report. I'm reading about an improvement for system development life
cycle for information security. But it's really complicated for just a guide
how to implement intrusion prevention. Maybe someone willing here can't help
me? I'm really frustated here...

Thanks
