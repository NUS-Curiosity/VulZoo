Security Advisory: CT09-01-2007


=======================================================
Microsoft Outlook Advanced Find - Remote Code Execution
=======================================================

Advisory Date: 11th January 2007

Severity: Critical
Impact: Remote System Access
Solution Status: Vendor Patch

CVE Reference:  CVE-2007-0034


Affected Software
=================

Microsoft Outlook 2000
Microsoft Outlook 2002
Microsoft Outlook 2003


1. OVERVIEW
===========

Microsoft Outlook is a popular personal communication manager that
provides end users with a unified place to manage e-mail, calendar
and contact information.

As part of its standard offering, Outlook also includes an Advanced
Search facility (Finder.exe) enabling end-users to query any aspect
of their repository information.

Unfortunately, it transpires that Outlook/Finder is susceptible to
a remote Buffer overflow vulnerability, when processing the contents
of a specially crafted Office Saved Search (.oss) file.


2. TECHNICAL NARRATIVE
======================

The issue in question stems from a simple oversight in the design of
an intrinsic string manipulation function, which attempts to copy
1024 bytes of user supplied Unicode content, to a pre-allocated buffer
of only 512 bytes (even though sufficient length checks are invoked).

As the destination buffer is unable to accommodate the additional data,
the net result is that of a classic stack overflow condition, in which
Instruction Pointer (EIP) control is gained via one of several
available return addresses.


3. EXPLOITATION
===============

As with most file parsing vulnerabilities, the aforementioned issue
will require a certain degree of social engineering to achieve successful
exploitation.

However, Office Saved Searches (.oss) file types share very similar
display characteristics to that of harmless looking e-mail icons.
As such, end-users could be fooled into thinking the attachment is
a non-threatening mail forward.
