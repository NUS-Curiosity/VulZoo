    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-925

Description:
    Previous versions of the krb5 package are vulnerable to two types
    of attacks that are known to allow unauthenticated remote attackers
    to cause the kadmind process to crash.  (One of these vulnerabilities
    involves executing code referenced by an uninitialized variable, and
    so may possibly enable more serious attacks, up to and including an
    unauthenticated remote root privilege escalation.)
