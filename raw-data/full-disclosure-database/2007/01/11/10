Did you told them about it?

This is nothing new.
It is documented in the man-page and in the libc sources.

By coincidence I found such a bug while doing a code review
a few weeks ago. But in this case the return value was used
in calculating an pointer offset and using this pointer again
in sprintf(). At the end the result was an overflow. :-)
