Well the poster of the password link would've done better explaining how 
goog mines the data instead of easily disclosing valid e-mail passwords.

This shows yet again how crucial it is to use throw-away passwords that 
you can use for badly coded web sites that disclose passwords plain-text 
in the URL.

It's not really Googles' fault if some people don't know how 
web-security basics work. They grab the web, crawl it hideously and find 
all of it, including sensitive data.

As to whether the Blacklist should be public or not is up to personal 
believes. I for one think that it should be publicly available to have 
at least a good static reference of the most commonly used phishey sites...

thanks for the fish and

Goodbye!

Steve
