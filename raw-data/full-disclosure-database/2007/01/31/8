Synopsis
========

The default configuration of the Gentoo thttpd package potentially
allows unauthenticated access to system files when used with newer
versions of baselayout.

Background
==========

thttpd is a webserver designed to be simple, small, and fast.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/thttpd     < 2.25b-r6                     >= 2.25b-r6

Description
===========

thttpd is vulnerable to an underlying change made to the
start-stop-daemon command in the current stable Gentoo baselayout
package (version 1.12.6). In the new version, the start-stop-daemon
command performs a "chdir /" command just before starting the thttpd
process. In the Gentoo default configuration, this causes thttpd to
start with the document root set to "/", the sytem root directory.

Impact
======

When thttpd starts with the document root set to the system root
directory, all files on the system that are readable by the thttpd
process can be remotely accessed by unauthenticated users.

Workaround
==========

Alter the THTTPD_OPTS variable in /etc/conf.d/thttpd to include the
"-d" option to specify the document root. Alternatively, modify the
THTTPD_OPTS variable in /etc/conf.d/thttpd to specify a thttpd.conf
file using the "-C" option, and then configure the "dir=" directive in
that thttpd.conf file.

Resolution
==========

All thttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/thttpd-2.25b-r5"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
