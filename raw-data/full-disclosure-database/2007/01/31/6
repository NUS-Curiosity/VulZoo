It appears your ability to gather contextual clues "is crap."

It is clearly writtin in another language and run through a translator
into English (hence the quirky phrases).  Had YOU possessed a greater
mastery of the English language you likely could have noticed this on your
own and saved us the trouble of having to correct your "crappy"
assumption.

"Crap," by the way, is a noun or a verb.  The word you were looking for to
describe the "mastery", needing to be an adjective, would have been
"crappy", oh English master, as illustrated in the example sentence above.
