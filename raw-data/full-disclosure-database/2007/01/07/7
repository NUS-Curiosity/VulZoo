Subject: RFID open source library - RFIDIOt code release -
	version 0.1k

Folks,

Over the Christmas break I did quite a bit of work on the code and have 
added a hardware abstraction layer that allows support for readers other 
than the ACG, and to test it I've added limited support for the Frosch 
Hitag reader.

New features in this release:

   Program Hitag2 to EM4x02 / Unique
   Reset Hitag2 to default state (Frosch only)
   Read German passports
   Various tidy-ups and improvements

Code can be found here:

Enjoy,
Adam
