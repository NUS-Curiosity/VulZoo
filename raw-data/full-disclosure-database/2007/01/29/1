Subject: Internet Explorer 7 ActiveX bgColor property NULL
 pointer dereference (DoS)

I thought that after the success of MoBB last year, fuzzing browsers will be
pointless, since all vendors would take care of the easily-found bugs before a
release. It turns out that I was wrong. I ran a very simple ActiveX fuzzer
against Vista and found a NULL pointer dereference bug in no time. The
vulnerable ActiveX control is on the pre-approved list in IE7, which makes the
bug easy to trigger with no security warnings and no user interaction.

Try this:

<script language="JavaScript">
    obj = new ActiveXObject("giffile");
    obj.bgColor;
</script>

MSRC said that this is a reliability bug and not a security issue, and it will
be fixed at some point in the future. I agree that DoS bugs against IE are not
very important (as long as skape doesn't drop any more vulns like MS06-051 :-),
but it's interesting that such a simple bug in such an obvious part of the IE7
attack surface was not discovered and fixed before the release.
