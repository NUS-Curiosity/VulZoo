Subject: Re: Vista Reduced Function mode triggered

>>if you cut a vista's internet access after it's been activated, does
it go to reduced mode because of not being able to phone home? 

It just can't be that simple. There has to be more to what happened to
the guy. Lots of computers are offline for several days at a time, it's
inconceivable that they didn't test that.
