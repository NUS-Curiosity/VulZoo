UPCOMING CONFERENCES:
Black Hat DC 2007 Briefings & Training will be February 26 to March 1, held at the Sheraton Crystal City hotel in Arlington Virginia.

Register early to take advantage of our early bird rate and save when you register for the Briefings before January 1st.
Papers and requests to speak will be received and reviewed from October 1, 2006 until January 5, 2007. We strongly suggest that you submit earlier than later, since we will close the CFP early if we receive enough quality submissions to fill the slots. Please submit using the new on-line system at:
https://cfp.blackhat.com/ 

If you want to submit to the Call for Papers please note Black Hat does not accept product or vendor related pitches, or voodoo. If your talk is a veiled advertisement for a new product or service your company is offering, please do not submit. If your talk relies on voodoo techniques or tools you are not willing to share, then you should rethink the benefit the audience will get from sitting through your presentation.

Black Hat is launching its new electronic CFP submissions server with this announcement. You will be able to upload your submissions, make changes, select your co-presenters, etc. This system will allow you to submit multiple presentations as well as be able to change your info should you need to. This new submission and review process will enable the future possibility of peer review and on-line information exchange. For now we are looking forward to seeing your submissions and would like to hear any feedback you have on this new submission process.

Topic Focus for Black Hat DC 2007:
We would like presenters to think about offensive and defensive computer security operations and the application of your expertise and research. Think about its application in an operational process that can be defensive or offense, large enterprise or distributed organized criminal group, military or civilian. This is not a requirement to submit, but we want some differentiation for the DC conference. Thinking in terms of operational applicability will steer content in a direction we hope the DC audience will appreciate.
