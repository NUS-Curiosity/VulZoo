Subject: Re: Vista Reduced Function mode triggered

lol i want to see this happen in a .edu unit where you can only access the
internet by going through a limited HTTP proxy that does not allow the
connect function, think it would give humourous results. unless it 'phones
home' by visiting a page and printing said info, which in that case it would
probably be simple enough to modify the server it goes to and make it think
its going to microsoft, in that event you could easily get cd keys if thats
how it verifies its a real vista copy.
