Vista apparently needs to call the mother ship quite frequently or it will
go back into reduced operation mode.

You can get around it by putting in a KMS server which calls home for you
once every 6 months, or you can download an image of an already activated
KMS vmware image, and with a few settings chganges you only need to start it
up once in a while to ensure your machines stay enabled.
