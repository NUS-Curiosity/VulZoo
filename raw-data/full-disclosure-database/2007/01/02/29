Description:
    Previous versions of the firefox package are vulnerable to multiple
    types of attacks, including one that enables an attacker to run
    arbitrary attacker-provided executable code if JavaScript is enabled.
    
    29 December 2006 Update: The thunderbird package has also been updated
    to address the same vulnerabilities.
