personally i dont think its going to change at all, but with vista coming
out, as far as the pcs with xp home/pro, if a serious exploit is found in
those, guess whats gonna happen? every single one is going to be exploited
and botted/trojaned (same thing?). and if a serious vulnerability is found
in vista we're in even more trouble, with buisness versions of it out
already, that could be a serious compromise to a corperate environment..
other than that.. i dont think much is really going to change unless
something big happens, like every single dns provider implements dns
tracking and monitering. another idea, what about ISPs actually monitering
connection counts to their residental lines? i dont think over 10k
connections going TO, not from a regular home connection in under a few
hours is normal unless they're doing something like bittorrent with DHT
enabled.. then i could see alot of traffic, but still.. ISPs really should
start monitering connections and such. because most of the compromised
machines are connecting to a hacked ircd, and alot of times, these are on
home connections with long lease times on IP addresses (50day+). but these
are just my thoughts.  comments?
