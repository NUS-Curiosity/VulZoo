Sunbelt info: VIPRE.Suspicious is a generic detection for potential
threats that are deemed suspicious through heuristics.
VirusTotal is a free service offered by Hispasec Sistemas. There are no
guarantees about the availability and continuity of this service.
Although the detection rate afforded by the use of multiple antivirus
engines is far superior to that offered by just one product, these
results DO NOT guarantee the harmlessness of a file. Currently, there is
not any solution that offers a 100% effectiveness rate for detecting
viruses and malware.
