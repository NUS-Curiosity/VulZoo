Hey there,

> Funding doubled, so engineering some back doors?
I guess what you might be witnessing here is the fact that theres not
one "big bad us gov", but multiple partys which might or might not
agree on mass survilance and collection. Therefore one party is funding
research in anonymization software to help protect free speech whilst
the other party is trying to subvert it. 
As somebody funding a project usually has a agenda, it might not always
be the obvious or the "evil" ;)
