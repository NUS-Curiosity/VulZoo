Subject: Re: [FD] Jamming WiFi tracking beacons

This story set me wondering. Would it be possible to re-imagine WLAN and WWAN technologies such that, lets say smartphone-like devices don't have to broadcast unique, trackable IDs in the clear. I understand there's zero financial incentive for the telco industries  to do this. I'm looking for more of a thought experiment, i.e., could it be done? Feel free to scrap 802.whatever and Internet Protocol when considering how it might be done.

Subject: [FD] Jamming WiFi tracking beacons

Hey,

It's great that companies like Apple recognising the threat of tracking
people via their devices wifi cards' MAC addresses, by randomising them.

Naturally, I wondered i it was possible to jam the measurement beacon by
spoofing tons of wifi clients.  At one point in London, there was an
advertising firm with tracking bins [1] and I have a nice clip of a
technician looking puzzled at one beacon trying to figure out what's
wrong. (Unfortunately, it's bit too close to home (literally) to share.)
In the US I believe some ad "analytics" firms like SenseNetworks do
something similar. [2]

Consider this a call to arms then, to put those unused raspberry pies
you have lying around to good use.

best,
keira
