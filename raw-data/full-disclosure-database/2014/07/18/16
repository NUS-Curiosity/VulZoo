Subject: Re: [FD] Jamming WiFi tracking beacons

R-pi doesn't come with a built-in wifi adapter, so you'll need to get
some add-ons to do that--and keeping in mind that there's only one USB
controller for all the networking and suchlike, there's a decided limit
to the amount of bandwidth that they can handle.

Listening for connects is very doable, though that's really more the
province of the Pineapple

[ http://wiki.wifipineapple.com/index.php/Main_Page ]

and similar projects--the Pineapple also gives you various other
functionalities, like spoofing and MITM facilitation.

Right tool for the job and all that.
