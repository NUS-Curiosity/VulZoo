Subject: Re: [FD] Should it be better ...

Another possible consequence: This 'link-friendly' advisories lets the 
originator (a person, an institution or a fake of anyone of those) track 
the individual that routinely click on that links. Maybe just to build a 
list of people (IP->ISP->Country->Client of the ISP->Your home) 
interested in security, maybe not only for that. Who knows!? Just don't 
click on them ... or do it, nobody is watching! ;)

Regards,
Pablo.
