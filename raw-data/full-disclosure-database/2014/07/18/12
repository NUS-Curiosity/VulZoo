Also, remember that Tor was developed as a weapon to be used against
advanced threats and States of some power, as a way of providing
discontents of means of communicating and resisting authority. Its one of

used to avoid its own detection.

so yay for US cov-ops tech. Because there needs to be a justification for
things governments throw money at. Even if we don't see it.
