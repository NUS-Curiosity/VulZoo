That would be a logical assumption if you read the article and associated

is it? I think what the author was alluding to is their trying. Perry
thinks they can

Extremely well funded adversaries that are able to observe large portions
of the Internet can probably break aspects of Tor and may be able to
deanonymize users. This is why the core tor program currently has a version
number of 0.2.x and comes with a warning that it is not to be used for
“strong anonymity”. (Though I personally don’t believe any adversary can
reliably deanonymize *all* tor users . . . but attacks on anonymity are
subtle and cumulative in nature).
