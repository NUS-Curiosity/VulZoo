A presentation on a low-budget method to unmask users of a popular online
privacy tool, TOR, will no longer go ahead at the Black Hat security
conference early next month.

To my knowledge, TOR could easily be subverted. If you attack all your
known exit nodes, you can force your own nodes to have a higher priority
due to the relativity low traffic compared to those under attack. You could
then tag unencrypted packets and follow them back to the initiating
computer.

This scenario was proposed to me when I first started using TOR, and I was
under the impression that Anonymous had done something similar when they
exposed a number of illegal websites
