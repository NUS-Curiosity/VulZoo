Subject: Re: [FD] CVE-2014-2225: Ubiquiti Networks - Multiple products -
 Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

This is interesting. Ubiquiti knew about this issue since last year.

On 26 Sep 2013, I reported to them the following vulnerabilities
affecting UniFi Controller:

http://www.ikkisoft.com/stuff/UnifiSecurityBugs_Sep2013.pdf

#1 Insecure Java Random() to generate secret tokens
This was fixed in 3.1.5 as "security enhancements". See
http://pastebin.com/Xt0hVCPr for the change log.
java.util.Random was used across the entire codebase to generate
secret tokens, such as session cookies,
AP auth keys and reset tokens. Under some circumstances, it was
practical to predict the reset password
token and compromise the admin account, which would lead to full
compromise of the entire platform.

#2 System-wise Cross Site Request Forgery
In addition to the pdf detailing the vulns, I've shared with them a
PoC with the exact same attack.
After a few emails, trying to explain the criticality of CSRF in this
context, I simply gave up.

#3 Change password does not require old password
#4 Frameable response (ClickJacking)
#5 Credentials are saved in plain-text within MongoDB
#6 Multiple Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities (Stored and
Reflected) in /api/, abusing IE content sniffing

As far as I know, these are still open.

In addition, I've asked them to obtain CVEs for those vulnerabilities.
On Oct 30th, they confirmed that they would be disclosed to be public:
"Good point about CVE, we'll request an ID and disclose them later.
Will also address V2."

I don't think that CVEs have ever been assigned to these issues,
neither Ubiquiti has published those details
in a security advisory.

Cheers!
