All my Windows installations have
<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/download/SENTINEL.EXE> and
<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/download/SENTINEL.DLL> preinstalled as
C:\Program.exe and C:\Program.dll, so I'm notified when some poorly written
program tries to execute them.
The sentinels call MessageBox() with "MB_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION", so the
messages are recorded in the event log too where I can find them later.

I also preinstall an APPINIT.DLL <https://support.microsoft.com/kb/197571>
which logs all command lines of programs linked to USER32.DLL to a file:
filtering for "C:\Program " at column 1 lists all the culprits.

My third source is a SAFER.Log <https://technet.microsoft.com/cc786941.aspx>
where every execution attempt is logged, including the executables caller:
filtering this for "\program.exe" or "\program.dll" lists all the culprits.

So basically I just have to sit and wait...

In case one of my customers was hit, and this did not happen during an
installation, I have to interrogate them what they did... and hope they can
remember with sufficient detail.

But almost all hits occur during installations or the customization following
an installation (here it was the import of existing mails into a new account),
so these are not so difficult to reproduce.

regards
Stefan

PS: of course it helps if 8.3 names are disabled and "C:\Program Files\" can't
    be aliased as C:\Progra~1\
    To achieve this just run FORMAT C: /FS:NTFS /S:Disable in Windows PE
    before you start the installation of Windows 7 and later.
    For Windows NT5.x you'll have to use \i386\MIGRATE.INF
