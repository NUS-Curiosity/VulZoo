This is not true anymore. Any Apple representative wont tell you that nowadays. Even more, Apple has a small antivirus builtin in the system. But signatures based, focused on major OS X threats. No heuristics, no detection of windows malwares.

This is also true. Sadly. I work only on Apple products (and I use antivirus), I never seen a good product who don’t slow down the computer as shit.

From a sys admin perspective, Antivirus editors don’t take the Mac seriously, their product are slow and sometime published with too much bug inside. That don’t help Mac users to have any trust in it…
