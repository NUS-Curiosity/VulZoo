Dear list,

are filled with about 1000 tools.

A short ChangeLog:
    - added new gtk theme
    - added more locales for lxdm and system
    - replaced wallpaper and logos
    - added bash completions
    - added exploits to /usr/share/exploits using sploitctl
    - added a bunch of new tools / updated tools (more than 1000)
    - added new packages with help flags to each wm's menus
    - added missing users and groups in /etc/passwd and /etc/group

We wanted to say "thank you" to all users and supporters of BlackArch Linux
who
contributed, donated and motivated us for testings, fixes and improvements.
