Subject: [FD] Iron Mountain doesn't take physical security seriously

Went down into my office's lobby today and saw a few dozen boxes of 
confidential papers belonging to another company sitting there unguarded 
and not secured. The Iron Mountain guys were out front, but weren't 
keeping an eye on the boxes at all. I was able to open the boxes and 
snap a few pictures of the file labels for evidence. There were old 
employee records, I-9s, all sorts of very confidential stuff just 
sitting there in the lobby. Came back an hour or so later from lunch and 
some of the boxes were still there with nobody watching them.

Very disturbing to see this kind of mistake in a well-known security 
company.
