Subject: Re: [FD] AV scan on read vs write debate....



I agree with you, but from the outside, running "macintosh virus list" on google makes me share their point of view, why should I burn cycles for such a tiny threat?

They are right if they only think in terms of their own platform.

I would concentrate my effort in solidarity, perhaps you can agree on a lighter read scanning or an scheduled one. Yes, windows virus landscapes sucks, I wish a had a mac, please help me.


Show them that linux share the same scenario with mac and that you run AV in linux despite the low threat.


My only doubt is about word macro virus in macintosh:

Hope it helps you.

easy - ask them what the scan of a
 download helps
if it's executed later while due download there
was no matching signature

first comes the malware and then the signature to detect

if the dumb folk scan only once while store the malware
on a central fileserver that will greatly multiply damage
everytime a client opens the file with no scanning again

but if you are talk with Apple "the OS is secure" priests
forget it, they are learning resistent
