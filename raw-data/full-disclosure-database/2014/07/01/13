bad idea

daily is not doable -> see above
weekly is not enough

typically AV signatures are a few hours behind new malware, so it
helps at least if you download something now and don't open the
payload directly after download, maybe in a ZIP only specific
files are affected

the same applies for ZIP's you got from a person you know
which has a infected machine per email, while receive the
mail your signatures maybe not recent enough, in the time
between receive and open files you may get updates
