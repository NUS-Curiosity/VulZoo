Subject: Re: [FD] Beginner's error: import function of Windows Mail executes
 rogue program C:\Program.exe with credentials of other account

Well it was discussed a couple of times recently on FD that this is a bug,
but it's not a privilege escalation.
If you are admin (and you did mention that it's a prerequisite) you can
execute code as other users anyway - so there's no *escalation* here.

Therefore it's not a security bug (unless you are using a super old version
of Windows with incorrect ACLs on c:\, which sounds like a bug in itself),
just a "normal" bug.
Not sure if FD is the right place for non-security bugs tbh.

Cheers,
