Subject: Re: [FD] new pen-test tool!


I like it.  It's short - which is a blessing in these things.

However, the bigger the company the easier it is to answer positively to a general question. And generally people want to give you a positive answer.

SO, for a quick win make it shorter, but demand hard evidence that relates to the service you are buying. 

For example:

For insurance: check the certificate.  

For backups: check for records of tests. Backups don't count unless there's a test.  And only check the backups of the data that you care about.  Not any old tests the vendor happens to find a good result for.

The focused questions which require evidence are ten times as valuable - and you'll get a more consistent metric no matter what the company size or who you interview.
