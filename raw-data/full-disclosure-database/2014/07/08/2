Subject: [FD] Root command injection in ext-pack name for Virtualbox because
	of GKSu

A while back I noticed some funny behavior that I thought was in virtual
box at first, but it turn sour the reason I can do this is because of GKSu.
I felt like the ramifications were fairly large, and contacting the
(supposed?) maintainer of GKSu didn't work.

The timeline is included, but what is funny is about the same time I
noticed the behavior, someone opened a ticket eluding to this very thing,
but they didn't quite make the connection (bug linked in the blog post).

The reason I sat on it for so long was because I thought it was in
Virtualbox, and really had no time to dig into why it was happening, I just
knew it happened. Once I dug in, I realized it was GKSu that was actually
what was causing me to execute the commands because it wasn't sanitizing
its input.
