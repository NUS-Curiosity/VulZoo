Subject: [FD] Former NSA Chief: Why I'm Worth $1 Million a Month to Wall
	Street

Nice coin. Behavioral model predictions sounds like BS

Former NSA Director Keith Alexander says his services warrant a fee of up
to a million dollars, due to a cyber-surveillance technique he and his
partners at his new security firm IronNet Cybersecurity have developed,
Foreign Policy reported on Tuesday. The claim follows reporting earlier
this month that Alexander is slated to head a 'cyber-war council' backed by
Wall Street.

Alexander claims that the new technology is different from anything the NSA
has done as it uses "behavioral models" to predict hackers' actions ahead
of time.
