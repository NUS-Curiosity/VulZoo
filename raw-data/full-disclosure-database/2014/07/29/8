4. Affected Components Description

The SAP HANA XS Administration Tool is a web application used to
administer and maintain the HANA XS Engine.

5. Vulnerability Details

Functions within SAP HANA XS Administration Tool do not sufficiently
encode/filter output parameters, resulting in a reflected cross-site
scripting issue. A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to
non-permanently deface or modify displayed content from a Web site.

Reflected cross-site scripting can be used to steal another user's
authentication information, such as data relating to their current
session. An attacker who gains access to this data may use it to
impersonate the user and access all information with the same rights as
the target user. If an administrator is impersonated, the security of
the application may be fully compromised.

Technical details about this issue are not disclosed at this moment with
the purpose of providing enough time to affected customers to patch
their systems and protect against the exploitation of the described
vulnerability.

6. Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 1993349 which provides patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1993349.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
