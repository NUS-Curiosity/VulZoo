Vulnerability:  Confidential login information, including password is transmitted in plain text

This vulnerability has similar scope and threat as the HeartBleed bug.  Even though this exploit does not depend on the HeartBleed bug, it still has the potential to disclose confidential information that the user would reasonably assume to be sensitive or, in combination with their username, would be considered private, unpublished personal information.
The Home page of  www.united.com has a link to a ?Sign in? page in the upper right hand corner clicking on this link brings the user to another page, an html form that requests userlogin and password. Source code reveals that ?Sign in (Secure)? button links to http, not https page:

<div><span id="ctl00_CustomerHeader_spanNotSignedIn"><a id="ctl00_CustomerHeader_linkSignIn" href="apps/account/account.aspx">Sign In</a> | </span><a id="ctl00_CustomerHeader_linkMyAccount" href="apps/account/account.aspx">My Account</a> | <a accesskey="9" href="content/Contact/default.aspx">Contact Us</a></div>

When you select ?Sign in?, you are presented with a screen at url: http://www.united.com/web/en-US/apps/account/account.aspx and asked to log in.
The request is for MileagePlus Number or Username:
PIN or Password:
And the ?submit? button is labeled ?Sign In (Secure)?.

First thing to note is that this is an http (plain text, unencrypted) webpage, second thing to note is that the submit button calls a standard ?POST? which when the user presses the ?Sign In (Secure)? button, the information is transmitted from the user?s computer across the internet in plain text.
