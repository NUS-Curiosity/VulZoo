Subject: [FD] Bitstamp - Possible breach

Does anyone know someone from Bitstamp?

Someone has posted an alleged partial dump of their user database at
http://pastebin.com/WmpFfEmn.

Unfortunately, Bitstamp's homepage (http://www.bitstamp.net/) does not
list contact information or a link to give them a heads up.
