Subject: Re: [FD] Is the era of ezine txt files over?

As recently as 8 years ago?

I think it's pretty much over. The only remnants are probably from
nostalgia.

Information used to be decentralized and hard to find, so newsletters
served a useful purpose. Now things are decentralized and either easy to
find through search engines, or they float by through social media streams
when they're relevant and can be found later when needed.

I'm not saying I like it, I'm just saying...that's how it is, I think.
