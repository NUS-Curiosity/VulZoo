Subject: [FD] Should it be better ...

Should it be better to include the Advisory Details/exploit/code in the 
body of the email to FD, and not in a link to a blog/site/company so the 
list archive will be an archive and not a index to some, possible down, 
link?

I saw some reports using this format. It is good for a blog or site 
traffic, but in time, if that sites/blog/entry is deleted or down, the 
de FD archive (and its mirrors) will point to nothing usefull.

I am wrong or it is a good idea?

Sorry for my  poor english.
