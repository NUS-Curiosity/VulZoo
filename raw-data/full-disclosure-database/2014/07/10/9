Subject: [FD] Is the era of ezine txt files over?

Hi,

I am way too fresh in infosec to have seen many of the classic ezine txt 
files as they first appeared, but have enjoyed learning from them. Even 
as recent as 2006, there's been cool ones like:

Sure Phrack releases once in a while but in general, is the era of ezine 
txt files now over? Do people no longer pack everything into ascii art 
for the sake of learning?
