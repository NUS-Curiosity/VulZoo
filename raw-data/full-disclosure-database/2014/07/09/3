Subject: [FD] FireFox: Lab Mouse Security: Remote Code Execution via Browser
	(LZO)

I know nothing about this, but some friends kept posting a link to this
video.  I saw nothing about this in the mailing list, so I thought I would
post it to see if others have more info.

Title: Lab Mouse Security: Remote Code Execution via Browser (LZO)

Description: In which a shell is popped as a video exploit compromises
Firefox 30.0 on an updated Ubuntu x86_64. Just for fun, the shell executes
"telnet nyancat.dakko.us"! Notice it executes twice. Once when the video
starts playing, and once when it stops.

​Thank You For Your Time,​
