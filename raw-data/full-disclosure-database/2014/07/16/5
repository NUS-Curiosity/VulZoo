Vendor description:
- -------------------
OpenVPN Technologies is a privately held company based in the Pleasanton,
California, integrating a suite of leading-edge networking and software
technologies.

Source: http://openvpn.net/index.php/about-menu/about-us.html

Business recommendation:
- ------------------------
Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code and execute other attacks on
computers with the OpenVPN Access Server "Desktop Client" installed. Affected
users should upgrade immediately to the OpenVPN Connect client.

Taken from OpenVPNs advisory:
"This advisory only applies to the OpenVPN Access Server "Desktop Client" app
for Windows, and does not affect OpenVPN Connect, Private Tunnel, or community
builds of OpenVPN for Windows."


Vulnerability overview/description:
- -----------------------------------
The OpenVPN Access Server "Desktop Client" consists of two parts, a Windows
service that offers an XML-RPC API via a webserver on localhost and a GUI
component that connects to this API.

The XML-RPC API is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Using the
API commands an attacker can:
- - unmask a victim (e.g. by disconnecting an established VPN connection)
- - perform MITM attacks (by connecting the victim to an "evil" VPN server)
- - execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges (by adding a VPN profile that
  executes code)


Proof of concept:
- -----------------
Detailed proof of concept exploits have been removed for this vulnerability.

A video demonstrating this issue has been released by SEC Consult:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhgysgfvQh8


Vulnerable / tested versions:
- -----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been verified to exist in OpenVPN Access Server
"Desktop Client" version 1.5.6, which was the most recent version at the time
of discovery.
All other versions of the product are affected as well.


Vendor contact timeline:

            video.

            initial advisory) and provides link to version with implemented
			CSRF mitigations.

            validation is not covered.
