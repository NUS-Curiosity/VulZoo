Subject: [FD] Announcement: CEnigma tool!

Greetings,

We are happy to announce a little web-based tool named CEnigma to
disassemble input hexcode! CEnigma offers some advantages:

- Fast, simple & easy to use: just paste your hexstring, choose
architecture/mode/syntax, then submit to receive back assembly code

- User-friendly: accept input of all kind of formats (as long as it
contains hexcode inside)

- Provide instruction details (just hover the mouse on instructions)

- Link to assembly manual (just click into instructions)

- Save output for future references (choose "duration" before submitting)

- Update to modern instructions on all 8 architectures supported: Arm,
Arm64, Mips, PPC, Sparc, SystemZ, XCore, X86 (+X86_64)

Cheers,
Quynh
