Subject: Re: [FD] Is the era of ezine txt files over?

As one who compiled, edited and provided most of the content for an e-zine
that started in the 1990s and ran into the 2000s, I can tell you that
myself and the contributing writers all got busy (jobs, families, higher
education, etc) making it impractical to push out scheduled bundles of
articles in that format. Our writings were dormant for a few years, and we
decided it would just be easier to set up a blog and let the contributors
post to it whenever they had time and content. That works remarkably well.

To me, reading infosec blogs feels a lot like reading e-zines, but I'm
still using RSS feeds, which most people probably think are as dead as text
'zines... I think the spirit of sharing knowledge is still there but with a
new medium. I stumble across some really interesting reverse engineering
and malware analysis work, for example.
