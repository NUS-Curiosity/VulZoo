I can confirm that... QNap SS-839

[/etc] # pwd
/etc
[/etc] # ls -l shadow 
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    administ       13 Aug 15  2013 shadow -> 
config/shadow
[/etc] # ls -l config/shadow
-rw-r--r--    1 admin    administ      455 Jun 25  2013 config/shadow

That is also the reason that my NAS has no access (actively blocked IP address 
on firewall to deny access out the world interface).
I had notified QNap of that some years back - and as they didn't react, 
implemented my own countermeasures where one is to disallow access to the 
Internet.
