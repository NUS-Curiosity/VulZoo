Subject: [FD] Oracle Data Redaction is Broken

Hey all,
As part of yesterday’s Critical Patch Update, Oracle fixed 3 security flaws 
in data redaction services – one a privilege escalation vulnerability and 
two redaction bypass methods. I reported these issues to Oracle in November 
last year and have documented them here:

Cheers,
