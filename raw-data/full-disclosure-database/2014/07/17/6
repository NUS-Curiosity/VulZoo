Subject: [FD] Peeling the onion: Almost everyone involved in developing Tor
 was (or is) funded by the US government | PandoDaily

Funding doubled, so engineering some back doors?

In 2012, Tor nearly doubled its budget, taking in $2.2 million from
Pentagon and intel-connected grants: $876,099 came from the DoD, $353,000
from the State Department, $387,800 from IBB.

That same year, Tor lined up an unknown amount funding from the
Broadcasting Board of Governors to finance fast exit nodes.
