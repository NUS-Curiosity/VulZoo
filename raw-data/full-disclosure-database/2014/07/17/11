Subject: Re: [FD] Jamming WiFi tracking beacons

There's a project on github for just that kind of thing:

https://github.com/DanMcInerney/wifijammer

Regardless of the hardware you choose to use, however, keep in mind that
you're going to be using a much higher fraction of the radio amplifier
in the wifi adapter's time than normal use, so there will be
proportionally greater power consumption.

(Radio theory isn't really infosec, but is a design consideration for
something like this; I can talk about it out-of-band if you need to know)
