Subject: [FD] Mining website blacklists

Hey,

It's useful trick to use website black lists to
find interesting websites. Some are down, some host interesting
malware, and a lot are vulnerable to all manner of things you haven't
seen since the 90s.

Useful lists include:

http://squidguard.mesd.k12.or.us/blacklists.tgz
http://dsi.ut-capitole.fr/blacklists/
http://malc0de.com/bl/

That said, it's quite likely to come accross things you'd prefer not
to have seen, as well as things that just seem like the suppression of
freedom of speech.
