Subject: [FD] Finding page including parameters with google dorks

Hi,

Here's a google dork that doesn't seem to be listed anywhere but gets 
some good results:

inurl:"index.php?page="

Inside that parameter, there can be straightforward lfi's, rfi's but 
also subtle things too. The search does bring in a lot of false 
positives, so looking for urls ending with extensions helps.

(yes, i prefer startpage dork'ing)

Is there way of restricting to the search (wishfully thinking) to 
something like the below?

inurl:"index.php?page=*.(php|html|etc)"
