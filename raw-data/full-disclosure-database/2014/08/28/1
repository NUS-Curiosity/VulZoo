Aerohive Hive Manager and Hive OS Multiple Vulnerabilities

Affected Versions: Aerohive Hive Manager (Stand-alone and Cloud) >= 6.1R3 and HiveOS 6.1R3

+-------------+
| Description |
+-------------+

This document details multiple vulnerabilities found within the Aerohive Hive Manager and HiveOS software. These 
vulnerabilities have been disclosed to the vendor on or before the 24th of April 2014. 

-- Hive Manager Arbitrary File Disclosure --
Leveraging directory traversal, a malicious user can retrieve arbitrary files from the Hive Manager file system. As the 
Tomcat instance serving the Hive Manager software runs as the root user, this vulnerability can be used to read any 
file off the file system, including sensitive files such as /etc/shadow.

-- Hive Manager Arbitrary File Upload --
An authenticated malicious user may send a crafted post to the ‘upload’ servlet and upload arbitrary files. As the 
upload servlet is protected by HTTP basic authentication, this requires the knowledge of the scpuser’s password.

-- Hive Manager Debugserver Code Execution --
It was discovered that an authenticated user may send a crafted request to the Hive Manager ‘debugserver’ servlet 
and execute arbitrary commands on the Hive Manager server.

-- Hive Manager Multiple Password Disclosure --
Multiple methods within the Hive Manager web interface were found to expose sensitive information such as 
usernames and passwords. A malicious entity may leverage these disclosures to further compromise the Hive 
Manager.

-- Hive Manager Reflected Cross Site Scripting --
Multiple Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities were found within the Hive Manager software. These 
vulnerabilities allow a malicious entity to potentially gain JavaScript execution within a legitimate user’s browser. 
This is done with the aim of harming the user’s browser or hijacking their session.

-- Hive Manager SSH Keys Lacking Passphrase --
An SSH key was found on the Hive Manager file system without any passphrase set. This allows a malicious user 
with access to the file system to gain unauthorised access to the system with root user privileges.

-- Hive Manager Subshell Bypass --
By using a crafted SSH command, a malicious user may gain root access to the Hive Manager with a fully functional 
bash terminal, effectively bypassing the Aerohive subshell. This allows the malicious user to perform tasks on the 
underlying CentOS Linux operating system, including the retrieval of private keys, passwords and other sensitive 
information

-- Hive Manager Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload --
The Hive Manager HHMUploadServlet was found to suffer from an Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload 
vulnerability. By sending a crafted packet to the servlet, a malicious entity is able to gain arbitrary code execution on 
the Hive Manager server.

-- HiveOS Local File Inclusion --
Aerohive HiveOS was found to contain a Local File Inclusion Vulnerability within the web administrative interface. 
The Local File Inclusion allows a malicious entity to control what files are included by the vulnerable PHP page. In 
the event that the malicious entity is able to control an element on the file system, this results in arbitrary code 
execution. As user controlled information is present within the log-files of the application, this is easily achievable.

-- HiveOS Password Disclosure --
Log files within the HiveOS operating system were found to disclose sensitive information such as usernames and 
password. A malicious user may leverage this information to further compromise the Aerohive deployment or its 
users.

-- HiveOS Unauthenticated Firmware Upload --
Insufficient authorisation checking was found to be being performed on certain firmware upload functions. This 
allows for the upload of a backdoored or otherwise malicious firmware by an attacker.
