Subject: [FD] Hilariously Bad SQRL Implementation

If any of you are familiar with Stephen Gibson's SQRL protocol for user
authentication (really neat idea), you might have come across this PHP
implementation before: https://github.com/geir54/php-sqrl

Unfortunately, this library is actually pretty terrible. Not only does it
pass all of the data off to a Heroku app to perform the signature
verification, it is also vulnerable to SQL Injection:

https://github.com/geir54/php-sqrl/blob/0fa574520a1843a33a84c3985f934e84af6f2042/sqrl_verify.php#L39-59

I thought about submitting a pull request to fix this, but I don't believe
there is honestly much here to salvage. So, I'm writing my own
implementation here:

https://github.com/darkitecht/php-sqrl <- Not ready, at all, for even beta
testing.

P.S. Also, it uses mt_rand() for challenge generation in a crypto library.
Tsk tsk.
