Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Barracuda Networks
Product: Web Security Flex 4.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation vulnerability has been discovered in the official Barracuda Networks Security Flex v4.1 Application Web-Application.
The bug allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes in the vulnerable module on the application-side of the appliance service. 

The persistent vulnerability is located in the vulnerable Domain Alias, LDAP Host and Bind DN/Username values of the `Remote Filtering > Authentication 
> Add Authentication Server` module. Low privileged user accounts are able to inject via POST method request own malicious script codes to compromise 
the appliance web-application service. The attack vector is located on the application-side and the request method to inject malicious conext is POST.

The security risk of the persistent vulnerabilities are estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.0.
Exploitation of the security issue requires low user inter action (view listing) & a registered low privileged web application user account.
Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability results in session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Service(s):
				[+] Web Security Flex

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Remote Filtering > Authentication > Add Authentication Server > TEST SETTINGS or SAVE + Listing!

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Domain Alias
				[+] LDAP Host
				[+] Bind DN/Username


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent web vulnerability in the exception-handling can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account and low required user inter action. 
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of all invalid context exception-handling messages values. 
Disallow to redisplay the insecure input and filter wrong exception to prevent execution of persistent codes in the context of the security appliance application.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent exception-handling validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium.
