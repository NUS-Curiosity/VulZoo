Subject: Re: [FD] Hilariously Bad SQRL Implementation

Why would any sane rational human being implement something from
Gibson? I still remember him saying how implementing raw sockets in
Windows XP will totally and utterly destroy the entire internet. I
would implement time proven solutions based on real world testing not
an experimental solution from a rather dubious source.

I suppose, as an interesting side project, it might be interesting to
explore but for production, I wouldn't touch with a million foot
stick.
