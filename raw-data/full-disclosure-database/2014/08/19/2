Subject: [FD] PRESS RELEASE :: Phuture Conference Denver OCT 11

 Press Release August 2014
For immediate publication

At a press conference held today, officials from the Phuture
Conference,  have announced heretofore covert plans to stage a "Hacker
Conference" in Denver, Colorado on October 11th of this year,
beginning at or around 9 am in a location to be announced. The event
will end around 9pm with a dance party.

Phuture is a small scale relaxed technology conference held annually
in Denver Colorado. Topics include  hacker/infosec, maker scene, DIY
engineering, electronic + experimental music, gamers, anime,
underground computer topics and general geekery.  We will also be
screening the 2014 Austrian cyberpunk film "Gstettensaga"

"There will probably be a helluva a lot of inebriated script kiddies
and free PHUTURE tattoos offered there," Mr. Paco Nathan, was
overheard saying to some friends during the swank, three-hour press
conference.

Officials from the Department of Homeland Security based in the
Colorado region have refused comment, but one undisclosed source close
to the DHS claimed that the government had been tracking such Hacker
gatherings -- code words for what he termed as "Riotous Orgies" -- and
will probably take the organizers into custody long before any such
disturbance could actually be perpetrated. "We hear about these things
happening," the official remarked, "and we oftentimes just don't have
time to respond, let alone buy tickets." Tickets for the gathering are
rumored to be about 10 bucks, and will be available at the door just
prior to the event.  .

The conference will be a relaxed meet up, featuring one or two rooms
of mini presentations dealing with computer security & hacking but
also some talks on various aspects of underground cyberpunk culture.
Demos & vending area will be open all day.

The Phuture Honor award will be presented to Bill Heasty the owner of
the defunct NEWSLAND newsstands that flourished around Denver til the
net killed print. Mr. Heasty's shops featured zines such as 2600,
Paladin Press, Loompanics & other underground publications.
