Subject: [FD] XSS vulnerability in In-Portal CMS

Hello list!

After I informed developers in August about multiple vulnerabilities in 
In-Portal CMS and they answered they would fix them soon (so wait for 
disclosure of the first vulnerabilities), I found new hole in this CMS at 
their official site.

This is Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in In-Portal CMS. Besides tens 
millions of vulnerable web sites with affected flash files and vulnerable 
multiple plugins for different engines, there are a lot of other vulnerable 
plugins and themes - even five years since my original advisory. This time 
it's a theme for In-Portal CMS.

This XSS is similar to XSS vulnerability in WP-Cumulus, which I've disclosed 
in 2009 (http://securityvulns.com/Wdocument842.html). Because this theme 
uses tagcloud.swf made by author of WP-Cumulus. About such vulnerabilities I 
wrote in previous years, particularly about millions of flash files 
tagcloud.swf which are vulnerable to XSS attacks I mentioned in my article 
XSS vulnerabilities in 34 millions flash files 
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2010-January/006033.html).

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of In-Portal CMS with this theme. There can be 
other vulnerable themes for this CMS.

Details:

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

http://site/themes/theme_name/inc/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

XSS at official site of In-Portal CMS:

http://www.in-portal.com/themes/theme_in-portal.com/inc/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5476/). Also it's possible to conduct (like in 
WP-Cumulus) HTML Injection attack.

I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/7312/).
