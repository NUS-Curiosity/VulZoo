Business recommendation:
- ------------------------
Vulnerabilities have been identified that are based on severe design flaws in
the application. It is highly recommended by SEC Consult not to use this
software until a thorough security review has been performed by security
professionals and all identified issues have been resolved.


Vulnerability overview/description:
- -----------------------------------
1) Reflected & stored Cross-Site Scripting
An unauthenticated user is able to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks e.g.
create relogin Trojan Horses or steal session cookies in the context of the
affected web application "Process Director". Over 120 XSS issues have been
identified and it is assumed that many more exist.

Attackers are able to take over other user accounts and potentially gain
access to invoice data or other sensitive data.


2) Critical design issues
The Readsoft Invoice Processing software e.g. contains the tools / software
products "Manager", "Verify" or "Optimize". Those programs are usually
stored/installed locally on the user's system. They contain configuration
files that point to the global configuration which is stored on a file server
in a multi-user environment and accessed via network shares.

The software then reads this global configuration file which contains user
accounts and passwords (some of them in cleartext!) for other integrated
systems such as SAP or database connections.
The client program also connects to the database with a high-privileged user
and access rights are managed locally on the client!

All users of the software suite must be able to access this network share with
full access rights (read/write) in order for the program to work properly.

Therefore, attackers can not only gain access to sensitive data such as passwords in
cleartext (SAP backend connection, database), scanned invoices, log &
licensing files etc. but potentially manipulate configuration files /
invoices or replace existing executables with malicious code.


Proof of concept:
- -----------------
1) Reflected & stored Cross-Site Scripting

The following URLs are only an example of vulnerable functionality which can
be exploited without authentication. Over 120 different issues have been
identified during the crash test:

[ Proof of concept details removed as no patch is available ]


2) Critical design issues
The file "..." contains configuration parameters for the SAP and also database
backend connections.

The SAP password is stored in cleartext. The database password is encrypted
which can easily be retrieved by using a debugger (method [...] in [...].dll).
Anti-debugging mechanisms can be circumented by patching the application.

The database user needs full access rights to the database as the rights
management is done on the client. The user account information is stored in
the table "[...]".


Vulnerable / tested versions:
- -----------------------------
The vulnerability has been verified to exist in Invoice Servicepack 5.6 &
Process Director 7.2, which was the most recent version at the time of
discovery.

            contact or other suitable email addresses found online)
