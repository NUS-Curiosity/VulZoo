Subject: [FD] iTunes 12.0.1 for Windows: still COMPLETELY outdated and
	VULNERABLE 3rd party libraries

Hi @ll,

the just released iTunes 12.0.1 for Windows still (cf.
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jul/30>) comes
with  COMPLETELY outdated and VULNERAEBLE 3rd party libraries
(as part of AppleMobileDeviceSupport.msi):


* libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll 0.9.8d

  are more than SEVEN years old and have at least 27 unfixed CVEs!


* libcurl.dll 7.16.2

  is more than SEVEN years old and has at least 18 unfixed CVEs!
  the current version is 7.38.0;
  see <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html>
  for the fixed vulnerabilities!


Until Apple's developers, their QA and their managers start to
develop a sense for safety and security:
stay away from their (Windows) software!


regards
Stefan Kanthak
