Subject: [FD] XSS vulnerabilities in Megapolis.Portal Manager

Hello list!

These are Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in Megapolis.Portal Manager.

It's commercial CMS from Softline-IT (earlier Softline), which in 
particularly widespread among Ukrainian government sites (including 
ministry, parliament, two special services and many other web sites). In 
2012 I already wrote about multiple vulnerabilities in Megapolis.Portal 
Manager (http://securityvulns.ru/docs28651.html).

These particular vulnerabilities I found at zpd.gov.ua in 2012 and also at 
dcz.gov.ua in 2014. Where I placed a statement to the President 
http://on.fb.me/1sQ3vdq (screenshot and demonstration of the hole) to 
dismiss current Minister of Defense. And the President took it into account, 
dismissed him on Sunday and presented new Minister of Defense on Monday, 
which was voted by parliament the next day.

Timeline:
------------

2012.07 - found multiple vulnerabilities at multiple government sites, 
including web sites of ministry and parliament. In addition to all those 
holes during 2006-2012.
2012.07 - informed admins of these sites.
2012.07.13 - announced at my site about holes in Megapolis.Portal Manager.
2012.07.16 - informed developers.
2012.07.16 - developers answered, that they don't care about these holes 
(and so about all web sites on their CMS) and will not fix them.
2012.07.19 - I've disagreed with developers' position and suggest to not 
decline the support of the government sites for which they were paid. Later 
some holes were fixed, but not these two XSS.
2013.01.23 - disclosed holes at zpd.gov.ua (including these two ones).
2014.10.16 - disclosed these two holes at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/7398/).
