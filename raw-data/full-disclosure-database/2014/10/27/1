Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research team discovered a local file include web vulnerability via sync in the official iFileExplorer v6.51 iOS mobile application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2014-10-20: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
ColorfulPhone
Product: iFileExplorer - iOS Mobile Web Application 6.51


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local file include web vulnerability has been discovered in the official iFileExplorer v6.51 iOS mobile web-application.
The local file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system specific 
path commands to compromise the mobile web-application.

The vulnerability is located in the foldername and filename values if the wifi interface module. Local attackers are able to manipulate the 
wifi web interface by usage of the vulnerable sync function.  The sync does not encode or parse the context on add of a folders or files.
Local attacker are able to manipulate the input of the files and folder to exploit the issue by the sync method of the web-application. 
The execution of únauthorized local file or path request occurs in the index file dir listing module of the ifileexplorer application.
The request method to inject is sync and the attack vector is located on the application-side of the affected service.

The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.1. 
Exploitation of the file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account. Successful exploitation 
of the local file include web vulnerability results in mobile application or connected device component compromise.

Vulnerable Method(s):
				[+] [Sync]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Add Function & Rename

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] foldername
				[+] filename

Affected Module(s):
				[+] iFileExplorer Wifi Interface - Path Dir Listing


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The local file include web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with low privileged application user account without user interaction by a sync.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue. 

1. Install the ios app and start the app after the install (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifileexplorer/id355253462)
2. Open the wifi symbole in the first app sidebar category
3. Inject your own payload by usage of the `my files` section
Note: Include as Filename or Foldername your own payload to unauhtorized request the local file or device path
4. Sync after the add and open the wifi web interface of the application
5. The local index of the interface requests the path listing unauthorized the file- and foldername
6. Successful reproduce of the local security vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure restriction of the add file/folder and rename input fields.
After the restriction the input and output needs to be encoded by a secure mechanism to prevent the execution itself.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability in the filename and foldername sync function is estimated as medium.
