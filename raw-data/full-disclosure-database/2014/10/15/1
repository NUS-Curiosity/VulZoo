Vendor description:
- -------------------
"Oracle ADF is an end-to-end Java EE framework that simplifies application
development by providing out-of-the-box infrastructure services and a visual
and declarative development experience."

URL: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/adf/overview/index.html


Vulnerability overview/description:
- -----------------------------------
The ADF JSF implementation (ADF Faces) does not properly encode URLs specified
as a target to the goButton component. As this behavior is neither intuitive
nor documented in the component documentation [1] an application developer may
allow a user to specify destination URLs. In such an application, an
attacker is able to specify JavaScript code that is executed in the victims
browser as soon as the victim clicks on the goButton component.

[1] http://jdevadf.oracle.com/adf-richclient-demo/docs/tagdoc/af_goButton.html

Proof of concept:
- -----------------
The following snippet demonstrates a vulnerable JSF page:

[...]
<af:goButton destination="#{param['url']}" text="Continue to URL"/>
[...]

If this JSF page is called using the following URL, JavaScript code is
injected:

http://<host>/<path>?test=%27*alert%28%27XSS!%27%29*%27

As soon as the victim clicks on the goButton component the attackers code is
executed.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
- -----------------------------
The version 12.1.2.0 of ADF Faces was found to be vulnerable. This was the
latest version at the time of discovery.
