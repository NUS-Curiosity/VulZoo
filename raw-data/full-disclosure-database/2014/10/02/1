Subject: [FD] CarolinaCon-11 call for papers/presenters

h4x0rs, stuff breakers, InfoSec pros, g33k girls, international spies, and script kidz,


CarolinaCon-11 (also hereby referred to as "The Last CarolinaCon As We Know It") will occur on March 20th-22nd 2015 in Raleigh NC (USA).  We are now officially accepting speaker/paper/demo submissions for the event. 


If you are somewhat knowledgeable in any interesting field of hacking, technology, robotics, science, global thermonuclear war, etc. (but mostly hacking), and are interested in presenting at CarolinaCon-11, we cordially invite you to submit your proposal.  Please send;

- your name or handle/alias
- the presentation name/title
- a brief topic abstract (1-2 paragraphs)
- the estimated time-length of your presentation
- a brief bio (100% optional item, but if your talk is chosen it saves the time and trouble of asking for it later)

....via e-mail to:
speakers<at>carolinacon.org

*NOTE: All submissions are due BY January 1, 2015.  However we may be making some early selections again this year from amongst the submissions, so please be timely in submission if you're committed to being part of the elite cadre of chosen presenters.  We value diversity so please don't hesitate to propose your ideas no matter how outlandish.


If you present at the Con, you will receive;

- free CarolinaCon admission for you and one guest
- one free CarolinaCon-11 T-shirt  (l33t)
- free transportation between RDU airport and the conference hotel (if needed)
- minimal fame, glory, and possibly even notoriety
- mad props and much love from our staff and attendees


ATTENDEES:
If you are interested in attending, watch this space for more details: 
www.carolinacon.org
...and don't forget to mark the March 2015 dates on your calendar.


If you have any important (as in not-dumb and not-chinese-spam) inquiries about the event you can send email to:
info<at>carolinacon.org


We look forward to seeing you at our 2015 event.


SPONSORS and/or VENDORS and/or ADVERTISERS:
We don't accept any so please don't bother asking.  Capitalism (what you vendor/sponsor types do) and philanthropic knowledge-sharing (what we do) don't mix at CarolinaCon by design.  We keep our admission price to the bare minimum to cover our venue and equipment expenses.  All of our staff are volunteers who generously donate their time and energy.  All of our presenters generously donate their time and talent.  The only items sold at CarolinaCon are a limited quantity of single-design CarolinaCon t-shirts....and we only make and sell those because attendees and staff want them (and because they're cool).



Peace,
Vic
