Subject: Re: [FD] CSP Bypass on Android prior to 4.4

I've done a little more testing and what I've found is pretty startling.

I tested on a Galaxy Note 2 running Android 4.4.2 and the CSP bypass worked.

I also tested on an old version of Safari on an iPad (Safari/7534.48.3) and
the CSP bypass also worked.

If you are so kind, please use ejj.io/test.php to test this for me. If it
worked, please press the "IT WORKED" button.

This way I can compile a large finger print of browsers/phones/versions the
CSP bypass worked on (based on user-agent)
