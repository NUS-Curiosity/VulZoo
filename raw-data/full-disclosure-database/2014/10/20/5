Subject: Re: [FD] [oss-security] CVE request: remote code execution in
	Android CTS

Compliance Test Suite is one portion of the process OEMs use to certify
Android builds on shipping devices. I cannot think of any instance where
the average user would run the suite (which takes several hours to do and
is a fairly complicated process
https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts-intro.html )
Even if someone is building Android at home, there is no reason to run CTS
on home builds. I'm not saying this file shouldn't be patched, I'm saying
the risk is extremely low and is limited to engineers in the lab
environment.
