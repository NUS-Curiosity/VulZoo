this command need not be executed from within bash. the problem occurs
when bash is run by the command, and the shell that runs the command can
be anything. for example, on a system where i have deliberately not
patched bash, where sh is "ash" (almquist shell):

> $ foo='() { echo not patched; }' bash -c foo
> not patched 

here's me testing it from within tcsh:

> % env foo='() { echo not patched; }' bash -c foo
> not patched
> % (setenv foo '() { echo not patched; }'; bash -c foo)
> not patched

this is a minor issue, but i've found in matters of security bug
reports, tests, and discussions, that any minor matter can lead to deep
misunderstanding.

thanks again for your excellent report, and your continuing work on this
issue.
