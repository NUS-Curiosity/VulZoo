VMware Security Advisory

Advisory ID: VMSA-2014-0010
Synopsis:    VMware product updates address critical Bash 
             security vulnerabilities
Issue date:  2014-09-30
Updated on:  2014-09-30 (Initial Advisory)
CVE numbers: CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, 
             CVE-2014-7187
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware product updates address Bash security vulnerabilities.

2. Relevant Releases (Affected products for which remediation is present)

    vCenter Log Insight 2.0

3. Problem Description 

   a. Bash update for multiple products.

      Bash libraries have been updated in multiple products to resolve 
      multiple critical security issues, also referred to as Shellshock.
  
      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the identifiers CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, 
      CVE-2014-7186, and CVE-2014-7187 to these issues.

      VMware products have been grouped into the following four
      product categories:
      
      I) ESXi and ESX Hypervisor
      ESXi is not affected because ESXi uses the Ash shell (through
      busybox), which is not affected by the vulnerability reported
      for the Bash shell.
      ESX has an affected version of the Bash shell. See table 1 for
      remediation for ESX.
    
      II) Windows-based products
      Windows-based products, including all versions of vCenter Server 
      running on Windows, are not affected.

      III) VMware (virtual) appliances
      VMware (virtual) appliances ship with an affected version of Bash. 
      See table 2 for remediation for appliances.
      
      IV) Products that run on Linux, Android, OSX or iOS (excluding
virtual
      appliances)

      Products that run on Linux, Android, OSX or iOS (excluding 
      virtual appliances) might use the Bash shell that is part of the
      operating system. If the operating system has a vulnerable
      version of Bash, the Bash security vulnerability might be
      exploited through the product. VMware recommends that customers
      contact their operating system vendor for a patch.    
      
      MITIGATIONS

      VMware encourages restricting access to appliances through
      firewall rules and other network layer controls to only trusted IP
      addresses. This measure will greatly reduce any risk to these
      appliances.

      RECOMMENDATIONS

      VMware recommends customers evaluate and deploy patches for
      affected products in Table 1 and 2 below as these
      patches become available. 

      Column 4 of the following tables lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

      Table 1 - ESXi and ESX Hypervisor
      =================================

      VMware           Product    Running  Replace with/
      Product          Version    on       Apply Patch 
      ==============   =======    =======  =============
      ESXi             any        ESXi     Not affected

      ESX              4.0        ESX      Patch pending *

      * VMware will make VMware ESX 4.0 and 4.1 security patches available 
      for the Bash shell vulnerability. This security patch release is an 
      exception to the existing VMware lifecycle policy.
