Summary
ElectricCommander is a toolset that facilitates remote deployment of
environment configurations from 
a centralized server to attached agents. Due to excessive file system
permissions on two Perl source 
code files, an unprivileged local attacker can modify these files to insert
code. The attackers code is
then executed as the privileged user running these administrative tools.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------
Affected products
This vulnerability has been confirmed in version 4.2.4.71224 of
ElectricCommander.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------
Vendor information, solutions, and workarounds
This vulnerability has been addressed in later versions of the toolset.
ElectricCommander users should 
upgrade to version 4.2.6 (and above) or version 5.0.3 (and above).
As an alternate manual workaround, users may set the file permissions to
become read-only after 
installation of the RPM package management system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------
Details
Multiple commander tools are installed with ElectricCommander, including
eccert and ecconfigure. 
According to Electric Cloud documentation, eccert is a command line tool
used to manage the 
ElectricCommander Certificate Authority and the certificates configured on
the ElectricCommander
system. ecconfigure is a command line tool that can change the configuration
values for any locally 
installed ElectricCommander server, web, agent, or repository service. Both
of these tools involve 
manipulating write-protected files, so they need to be run as a privileged
user.
