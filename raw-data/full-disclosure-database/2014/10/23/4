Subject: [FD] [KIS-2014-11] TestLink <= 1.9.12 (execSetResults.php) PHP
 Object Injection Vulnerability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TestLink <= 1.9.12 (execSetResults.php) PHP Object Injection Vulnerability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://testlink.org/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 1.9.12 and prior versions.


[-] Weakness Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the /lib/execute/execSetResults.php script:

428.	    if(is_string($args->filter_status) && strlen($args->filter_status) > 1)
429.	    {
430.	      $args->filter_status = unserialize($args->filter_status);
431.	    }

User input passed through the “filter_result_result” request parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in
a call to the “unserialize()” function at line 430. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the
application scope, and could allow an attacker to delete arbitrary files, carry out Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF),
SQL Injection, or Local/Remote File Inclusion attacks via specially crafted serialized objects.


[-] Solution:

Update to version 1.9.13 when will be released or apply these hotfixes: http://mantis.testlink.org/view.php?id=6609
