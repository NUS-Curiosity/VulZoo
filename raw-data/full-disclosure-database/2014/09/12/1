Subject: [FD] Fwd: Security Access

Hello This is my first post .

Here are the details :

Website : http://www.comguard.net/    - (Security Expoerts)
I already sent them 2 emails and i didn't get a reply. The Security bug is
really simple , i was able to get to this link
http://www.comguard.net/include/  which lists all the files in the server.
You can even download php files containing sensitive data including db
password. Let me know if you need any additional details

Regards
