Subject: [FD] Wordfence v5.2.3 (Wordpress Security Plugin) - Multiple
 Vulnerabilities



Wordfence v5.2.3 suffers from multiple vulnerabilities.
Stored XSS in IPTraf.php resulting from failing to sanitize $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
Stored XSS in cached pages resulting from failing to sanitize $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] <-- Yep, you can put javascript in the host header
Insufficient Logging - One can trivially avoid having your requests logged because of some crappy code designed to filter out some types of requests
Throttle bypass - Unlogged requests won't trigger automatic throttling and banning
Revolution Slider exploit protection bypass - people seriously need to learn how $_REQUEST works.
Also, if you have a few bucks to buy a domain name, you can make the plugin tell the admin that your IP belongs to google when they try to ban you.
