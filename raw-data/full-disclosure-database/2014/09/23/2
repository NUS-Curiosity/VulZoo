Subject: [FD] [KIS-2014-10] X2Engine <= 4.1.7 (FileUploadsFilter.php)
 Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X2Engine <= 4.1.7 (FileUploadsFilter.php) Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://www.x2engine.com/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 4.1.7 and probably prior versions.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability exists because of the FileUploadsFilter::EXT_BLACKLIST constant, which is a regular
expression for blacklisted files. Due to a lack of case-insensitive matching, the global upload filter
could be bypassed by uploading a malicious file with capital letters within the extension. This can be
exploited to upload and execute arbitrary PHP scripts if X2Engine is running on a case-insensitive
filesystem or if the web server is configured to handle filesâ€™ extensions in a case-insensitive fashion.


[-] Solution:

Update to version 4.2 or later.
