Subject: [FD] SSH host key fingerprint - through HTTPS

This tool displays SSH host key fingerprint - through HTTPS.

SSH is about security; host key matters a lot here; and you can know for sure by using this tool. It means you know precisely how to answer this question:
The authenticity of host 'blah.blah.blah (10.10.10.10)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is a4:d9:a4:d9:a4:d9a4:d9:a4:d9a4:d9a4:d9a4:d9a4:d9a4:d9.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

We hackers don't want to get hacked. :-) SSH rocks - when host key is right. Enjoy!

Best Wishes,
