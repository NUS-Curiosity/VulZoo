Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
WWW File Share Pro can help you share files on the internet or on the local area network. You may use it to share files between your 
PC and other devices if they may access your PC with an internet browser, regardless of what Operating System is installed on them.

- Share office documents between Windows and other operating system: Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, Android, etc.
- View photos or play mp3 files stores on your PC from other portable computer or smart mobile phone: iPad, iPhone, Nexus 4, Note II, etc.
- Share files between you and other persons: your friends, your colleagues, etc.

What you need to do is to simply specify a download directory and a upload directory. Then run the internet browser on other devices to 
download files from your computer or upload files from those devices to your computer. All popular internet browsers are supported, such 
as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Opera, etc. There is no need to install this software or any other software on other devices 
because an internet browser is enough.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A critical stack exhaustion buffer overflow vulnerability resulting in remote denial of service has been detected in the 
latest WWW File Share PRO 7.0 software. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a large malformed HTTP GET request to 
the vulnerable server. e.g. GET /upload2.htm/A * 100000 resulting in an immediate crash of the application.

(199c.189c): Unknown exception - code c000008f (first chance)
(199c.189c): Unknown exception - code c000008f (first chance)
(199c.189c): Stack overflow - code c00000fd (first chance)

First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.
