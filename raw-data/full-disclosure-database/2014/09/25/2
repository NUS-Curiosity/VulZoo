That's a truth but not nec'ily a weakness. RLOGIN is more mature than
SSH, but, I prefer SSH every time I get a choice.

DNSSEC mostly doesn't work, since EDNS mostly doesn't work, since UDP
fragmentation of DNS mostly doesn't work. So, deployment (lack of) could
be called a weakness, except: in our community (readers of and
contributors to fulldisclosure@ and bugtraq@), DNSSEC mostly does work,
because we are mostly on networks controlled by competent well informed
modern technologists.

So, in my personal opinion, we ought to pile on the DNSSEC bandwagon for
SSHFP support, as our way to make SSH key confirmation more secure.
(Right now most of us don't even read the hex, we just say Yes.)
