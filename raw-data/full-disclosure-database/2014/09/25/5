Subject: [FD] [TOOL] Hakabana release

Hi list,

We are pleased to announce the release of Hakabana - A open source
monitoring tool to visualize network traffic using Haka and Kibana.

Hakabana leverages on the Haka framework to capture packets, dissect them
and extract various information on the network: bandwidth, geoip data,
connections info, http and dns details, etc. Hakabana exports extracted
information to an elasticserach server which are then made available
through a Kibana dashboard. Hakabana provides easy customization enabling
to export your own data (e.g. write a new protocol dissector using Haka
grammmar and expose some of the parsed
fields). More info are available here:
http://haka-security.org/hakabana.html.

Hakabana come with new release of Haka. Haka is an open source security
oriented language which allows to describe network protocols and apply
security policies on (live) captured traffic. This new version (0.2.1)
features new modules allowing to export network events such as protocol
details and haka alerts to an elasticsearch server.

Debian packages are available for download at http://haka-security.org

Your contributions are welcome through our github account
https://github.com/haka-security/haka where you can also check out the last
development and build Haka from sources.
