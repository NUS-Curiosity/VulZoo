It goes without saying, but I'm going to say it anyways -- you would do
well talking to a lawyer before starting your data collection.



I have seen debates about whether an unencrypted access point (e.g.

IANAL, but in the linked article, they linked a decision from the Ninth
Circuit:

It's been a while since I've read this decision throughly, so I'll just
refer to the summary of judgement on the second page:

Now, as I understand it, this is technically only legally binding to the
states to which the Ninth Circuit holds jurisdiction. However, from what
I've seen, a court will often look to other courts opinions where possible.
Buyer beware?
