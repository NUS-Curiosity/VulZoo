Subject: [FD] Ammyy Admin 0day

Not sure how long this will last, but I didn't want to sit on it forever:
http://www.scriptjunkie.us/2014/09/exploiting-ammyy-admin-developing-an-0day/
tl;dr - a counter-exploit against Ammyy Admin, best known for being used by
scammers to take over unsuspecting non-technical users' computers. Instead,
the scammer's computer would end up getting pwned by the "victim."

Tested against win Vista and 7 x86 and x64, with targets for latest two
versions.

Normally I don't go full disclosure on vulns I find, but in this case, I
see little potential for abuse.
