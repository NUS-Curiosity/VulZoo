Subject: [FD] WPScan Vulnerability Database

Hi,

The WPScan Vulnerability Database a WordPress Vulnerability Database was
released last week during the BruCON security conference.

The database is exclusively for Wordpress core, Plugin and Theme
vulnerabilities and is what the WPScan tool (an Open Source WordPress
vulnerability scanner) uses to detect and output vulnerabilities.

The database also has an API available for non-commercial usage. A
submission system, RSS Feeds and more.

Currently the vulnerabilities are classified by our own classification
system (needs improvement), which links to the OWASP Top 10 where
applicable. Soon we will also be linking to CWE classifications.

You can find the WPScan Vulnerability Database here - https://wpvulndb.com/

Any feedback is always welcome.

Thanks,
Ryan (WPScan Team)
