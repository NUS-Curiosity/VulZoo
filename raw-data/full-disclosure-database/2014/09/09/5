Subject: Re: [FD] Public WiFi Pcaps

If you're interesting in ensuring that you do so with appropriate
legality, then your best avenue would be to get the permission of the
WAP owner--tell them that you're doing research on wifi, that you wanted
to get their permission before doing so, and that you're sensitive to
privacy etc.

You're going to get a lot of "no" answers.

Proper social engineering/salesmanship will mitigate some of these if
you present it as something of value to the WAP owner--"free site survey
to help you increase your security" (provided you follow through with at
least some documentation derived from your pcaps) or "it's for a study"
might get you some better responses.

But yeah--get (written!) permission from the WAP owner and you're likely
to be entirely in the clear.

N.b. I am not a lawyer; this isn't legal advice; this is just a
practical interpretation from my individual perspective. Your mileage
may vary; void where prohibited.
