I guess it depends where you live.
In some countries this can be highly illegal.
I like your example with the radiostation!
But if the feds wanna srew you, they gonna do it this or another way.

And yes google lose the fight. No one aware, that any smartphone does
such things? DB's full of wifi's and where they are. Get sended from the
phone to a lot of unknown people. The Data get used to make a better
position track. And perhaps for a lot other things.

Perhaps you can get a special permission? But where to ask for?

Cheers!
