Details
================
Software: WooCommerce - excelling eCommerce
Version: 2.1.12
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/reflected-xss-in-woocommerce-excelling-ecommerce-allows-attackers-ability-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-user-can-do/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 6.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

Description
================
Reflected XSS in WooCommerce – excelling eCommerce allows attackers ability to do almost anything an admin user can do

Vulnerability
================
An attacker able to convince a logged-in admin user to visit a link of their choosing (for instance via spearphishing) can execute arbitrary JavaScript within the admin’s browser which could cause it to delete all posts, create new admin users, or leverage other functionality accessible only to admins.

Proof of concept
================
If a logged-in administrator visits the following url, a javascript alert will display on in the admin screen:
http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-reports&range=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E
Note that this will not work in a browser with reflected XSS prevention (e.g. Google Chrome)

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 2.2.3 or later
