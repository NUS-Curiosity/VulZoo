easy - ask them what the scan of a download helps
if it's executed later while due download there
was no matching signature

first comes the malware and then the signature to detect

if the dumb folk scan only once while store the malware
on a central fileserver that will greatly multiply damage
everytime a client opens the file with no scanning again

but if you are talk with Apple "the OS is secure" priests
forget it, they are learning resistent
