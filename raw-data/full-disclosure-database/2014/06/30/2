Subject: [FD] Local File Inclusion in Theme My Login 6.3.9 provides access
	to arbitrary files and could facilitate arbitrary code
	execution (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Theme My Login
Version: 6.3.9
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/lfi-in-theme-my-login/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 6.5 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)

Description
================
Local File Inclusion in Theme My Login 6.3.9 provides access to arbitrary files and could facilitate arbitrary code execution

Vulnerability
================
Users able to edit posts are able to use a shortcode which is vulnerable to local file inclusion. This can allow an attacker read-only access to any non-PHP file, or the ability to execute arbitrary code if they can upload a PHP file.

Proof of concept
================
Depending on the exact path to your WordPress installation, the following may or may not cause the contents of /etc/passwd to be displayed (adjust as necessary):
[theme-my-login login_template=\"../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\"]

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 6.3.10 or later.
Please note that while the changelog for version 6.3.10 labels this as a potential vulnerability, this plugin is in fact categorically vulnerable as described above. Users of this plugin should not consider version 6.3.10 to be an optional or low-priority upgrade.
