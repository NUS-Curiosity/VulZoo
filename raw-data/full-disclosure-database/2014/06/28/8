Introducing Titcoin – the first digital currency aimed at the porn
industry, announced by PornHub.

Many cryptocurrencies have come and gone since Bitcoin’s
<http://www.pcr-online.biz/news/read/bitcoin-making-a-virtual-mint/032266> boom
in popularity, but none have been aimed at a specific industry in the same
way Titcoin is.

Speaking to Vice
<http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/titcoin-is-a-brand-new-cryptocurrency-for-porn-purchases?utm_source=vicetwitteruk>,
one of the currency’s founders, Edward Mansfield, explained that due to the
popularity of Bitcoin, porn users may want to use another type of private
currency: “In the future, you might have a Bitcoin account with your
spouse. You may not want them to see you purchasing products or
subscriptions on adult sites, so having an industry-specific coin has
certain advantages for consumers.”

Rather confusingly, a video explaining Titcoin has been uploaded to
YouTube, which implies that it’s a scheme that lets women pay for goods by
flashing their own goods at shop assistants. It turns out this was actually
an entry for a contest to become Pornhub’s creative director, and Titcoin
is in fact a normal cryptocurrency that works just like the others.

Once all have been mined, there will be a total of 69 million Titcoins in
circulation (of course), but while the likes of Dogecoin and Litecoin have
managed to carve out their own section of the market – which currently has
over 275 trading cryptocurrencies – only time will tell if this one goes
tits up like many others have before it.

Other digital currencies that have failed to truly take off include Nyancoin

 and Flappycoin.
<http://www.pcr-online.biz/news/read/flappy-bird-spawns-two-flappycoin-currencies/033242>

While these two might be struggling, they are still around. Meanwhile,
Kanye West made sure that Coinye
<http://www.pcr-online.biz/news/read/coinye-is-dead-you-win-kanye/032953> well
and truly died after he got his lawyers on the case…
