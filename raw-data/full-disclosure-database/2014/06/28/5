Subject: [FD] CSRF Vulnerability on LinkedIn

Hi,

I have discovered a CSRF vulnerability on LinkedIn which allows attacker to
delete any Recommendation of any user.

Attached complete details. I would like to know when can you publish this.

I have informed LikedIn that I am going to publish this on mailing lists.
And they are agreed with it.

Best Regards,

Kishor S.
