Hello.

I'm just curious, what was the reason to send information about "some
bug" that affected WoT servers if you are not disclosing any details ?
I may be wrong, but the list is called Full Disclosure and I don't
think it was made to showoff.

Sorry for getting a bit out of context.

Have a nice day.
