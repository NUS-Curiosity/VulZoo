Product Description:
- --------------------
openSIS, is a free student information system that rivals costly
commercial alternatives in looks, functionality, ease of use and
administration.


Description of Vulnerability:
- -----------------------------
openSIS versions 4.5 and 5.3 suffer from a Login Cross Site Request
Forgery Vulnerability (Login CSRF) owing to it's failure to secure the
login form with CSRF tokens.
The vulnerability is futher exarcebated by the fact that a HTTP Get
request can be used to perfom login actions, allowing login requests
to be forged via urls.


System impacted:
- ----------------
openSIS versions 4.5 and 5.3 were tested and found to be vulnerable.

Impact:
- -------
This vulnerability allows a malicious attacker to log a victim into an
account other than theirs, and have the victim update the account with
their personal information (identity theft), perform actions in the
name of the account, or mount other Social Engineering attacks.

- -----------------
1. Install OpenSIS 4.5 or 5.3 and create user login credentials
(username and password).
