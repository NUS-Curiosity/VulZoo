I'm mostly siding with the others on the list saying this is both very
old, and mostly a non-issue, but the problem shown isn't in called
programs, like rm, but of the shell.
If there ever is to be a fix for this, it'd probably be to have an
option of the shell to warn the user that there are strings in any
expanded variables that may be interpreted as -arguments.
