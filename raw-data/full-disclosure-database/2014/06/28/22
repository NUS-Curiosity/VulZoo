to be honest, bash shouldn't expand * to "file1 file2 file3 -rf..." it
should do it to "  'file1' 'file2' 'file3' '\-rf'..." instead, with all
meta chars escaped properly. A few weeks ago, we had this discussion
here about windows 7 starting program.exe when you have "/program
files(...." as a path name. That's the same "mishandling" of filenames
like the above is. Both should be properly escaped before it gets processed.
