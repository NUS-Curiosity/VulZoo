Subject: [FD] Enom.com security contact? (Account Hijacking -- Google Apps
 integrations vulnerable)

Hello! :)

Anyone have a security contact at Enom? I believe I have located an
arbitrary account hijacking issue that affects all Google Apps domains
that utilize Enom for the domain registrar integration. This could
potentially be 100,000s of Google Apps / Enom domains. Google Security
does not handle issues in third-party integrations, otherwise I would
escalate with them.

Any contacts you can share would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
