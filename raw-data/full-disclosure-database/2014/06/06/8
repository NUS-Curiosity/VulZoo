I can see where this could be abused. Its a lot like the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the USA:

     But a new offence of 'unauthorised access to a computer'
     will be created - carrying a maximum life sentence.

On the good side, its a tool to use against spammers. In the US,
there's already some opinions on it:

  * A PRACTITIONER’S GUIDE TO THE COMPUTER FRAUD
    AND ABUSE ACT: FINALLY, A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR
    “ANYTHING WRONG” [1]
  * SPAM and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
  * Facebook wins $3M Judgment Under CAN+SPAM
    and CFAA [3]

Who would not like to see Network Solutions prosecuted for a CFAA-like
violation due to the spam they spew?
