Subject: Re: [FD] More OpenSSL issues

Per the security advisory:

"The attack can only be performed between a vulnerable client *and* server."

This would have produced quite a media nightmare if most browsers used
OpenSSL instead of NSS, etc.

Chrome for Android was affected and is patched in 35.0.1916.141.
