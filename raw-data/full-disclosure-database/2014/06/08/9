i am not a lawyer either. i started MAPS, the first anti-spam company,
in 1997 or so, and became the most-sued person i know. i may be the
most-sued person you'll ever know. and i've been sued by some experts. so:

this is concerning, for two reasons.

first, for enforceability, a contract requires exchange of
consideration. what's yours? i can see that the vendor is receiving
something of value (the disclosure) but it's not clear what you're
getting in return beyond the opportunity to have your good deeds go
unpunished. absence of a negative does not amount to a positive in the
eyes of the law.

you're also treating this as a one-off. i suggest you make it
continuous, and make continuity be a value they are trading for. so,
make this a relatively standard bilateral NDA stating the violation by
them will result in (a) cancellation of the NDA, (b) unwillingness by
you to enter into another NDA with them for three years, and (c) naming
and shaming them for who they are and what they did, over on slashdot.

it's generally good text other than these structural matters. you'll
want a real lawyer to look at it before you try to use it, and maybe
before you process my suggestion above. we have two non-practicing
lawyers in the computer security field, david dagon and anne mitchell.
let me know if you'd like an introduction to either.
