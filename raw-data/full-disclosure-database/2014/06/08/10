Subject: Re: [FD] Responsible disclosure: terms and conditions

Keep in mind you can always be sued. No matter what 'legal' document you may have. I'm the third down on that attrition list. 

This brings to mind this recent blog from John Strand: http://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/pen-testing/2014/06/04/five-things-every-pen-tester-should-know-about-working-with-lawyers

Not specifically regarding disclosure but worth the read.
