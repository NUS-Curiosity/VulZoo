Subject: [FD] [Tool] Pcredz

Pcredz was designed to dump useful information on the fly, from a pcap file
or from a pcap directory.

Unlike tools like, for example Breachprobe, Pcredz is highly effective and
fast just to meet your pentest needs.

What Pcredz does right now from a live interface or pcap file:

   - Identify Card Holder Data (CHD) on any port.
   - Dump NTLMv1/v2 (DCE-RPC,SMBv1/2,LDAP,MSSQL,HTTP,etc) hashes on any
   protocol and port.
   - Dump Kerberos (AS-REQ Pre-Auth etype 23) hashes (TCP/UDP 88).
   - Dump HTTP Basic (any port).
   - Dump POP credentials.
   - Dump SMTP credentials.
   - Dump IMAP credentials.
   - Dump SNMP community strings.
   - Dump FTP credentials.

All hashes are displayed in hashcat format (use -m 7500 for kerberos, -m
5500 for NTLMv1, -m 5600 for NTLMv2).
All credentials are logged to a file (CredentialDump-Session.log).

Pcredz was designed to be highly efficient, specifically with ARP poisoning
attacks.
