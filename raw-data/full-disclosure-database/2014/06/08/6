Subject: [FD] Responsible disclosure: terms and conditions

As you all know, responsible disclosure can be hard.
You want to do the right thing, give the vendor some time to fix the
issue, protect its customers, etc; but the first thing the vendor does
is to threaten to sue / arrest / beat up / kill you.

Fortunately this is happening less and less, but there are still
plenty of examples as it can be seen in
http://attrition.org/errata/legal_threats/.

I had this idea of making Terms & Conditions that you would send to a
vendor prior to disclosing the vulnerabilities. The vendor (or someone
responsible) would have to accept these terms by replying to your
email and only then you would reveal the vulnerabilities. If they
didn't accept, you would release them to the public (full disclosure)
immediately.

I am not a lawyer, so I would like everyone's opinion (lawyer or not)
on whether this would actually provide any protection.
