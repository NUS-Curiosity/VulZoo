Subject: Re: [FD] Session Hijack Vulnerabilty on ebays german want ad?

Dear Christian,
obviously you have a cookie in your browser on computer A. Assumed, that kleinanzeigen.ebay.de does not match the IP addresses of different attemts to access the user page, this seems to be the only way to verify, that you are still you. So, you could take a look into your cookie and see, what is saved there. I would say, you wonâ€™t find your password in there, nor a hash of your password, but a session ID. How long the session ID is valid after the last server request using this ID, depends on the website. But yes: You can hijack a session of any other user, when you find a way to steal their cookie. You should avoid this. Firefox has an option to automatically delete all cookies when closing the browser.
Love
Torsten
