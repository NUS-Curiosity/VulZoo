Milky Way

The Event:


Balkan Computer Congress has been conceptualized as a three days
gathering of the international hacker community in the organization of
LUGoNS – Linux Users Group of Novi Sad and Wau Holland foundation from
Hamburg and Berlin. The first part of the program has been envisaged
to be a set of presentations, workshops and lectures on the current
topics regarding privacy, technology, software development, free
software & socio-political issues. Hands-on projects and hacking have
been planned for the second part of the program. We admire and tend to
find a role model in the large scale conferences such as Chaos
Communication Congress, organized by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC).
The Location:

Novi Sad is the centre of Vojvodina, northern province of Serbia,
famous for its multicultural history and active artistic and
technological scene (e.g. music festival Exit and digital-media event
Share). With a prestige night life combined with the warm and
welcoming character, Novi Sad offers inexpensive prices for lodging
and dining, compared to the neighboring EU. If you’re in Novi Sad, or
somewhere in the neighborhood, during these dates, this is the place
you want to be!
Our Goal:


Our goal is to gather all the communities from the region, continent
and the World in an effort to hack, play, learn, pass knowledge and
exchange experience. BalCCon aims to become the central hacker
community in South East Balkan, as well as to provide the opportunity
for all the people in this part of Europe to connect and to cooperate.

Having said that, we would like to invite you to make and send us
proposals for talks, lectures and workshops on all topics of
relevance. As a suggestion, we would love to see things about:

    Free Software
    Electronics & Microcontrollers – things like Arduino’s, ARM,
RaspberryPi, etc
    Hardware / Embedded Reverse Engineering
    Mobile Communications (LTE/3G/GPRS/HSDPA etc)
    RFiD, Bluetooth and NFC
    Network Security
    Software Security
    Programming Languages

    Cryptography, Cryptanalysis and Crypto-politics
    Social Engineering
    Robotics – humanoid, football playing, autonomous vehicles,

    Forensics and Anti-Forensics
    Clouds – hacking, breaking, unexpected usage
    Future or No Future of IT Security – state of fail, new concepts
and methods, implications for society and infrastructure
    Net and Device Neutrality – ownership, censorship, circumvention
and the politics of de-facto standards, search engine politics
    Revolutions and Hacktivism
    Transparency and Participation in Politics and Governance
    Copyright and Patents – the war on file-sharing, alternatives to
the current system
