This sounds like modified prisoners' dilemma to me:

Prisoner 1 (the researcher):
Cooperate: give information to the company
Not-cooperate: deny information, release publicly

Prisoner 2 (the company):
Cooperate: don't sue the researcher
Not-cooperate: sue the researcher

With the result table of:

[cooperate][cooperate] - Company gets vuln info; researcher doesn't
get sued.
[cooperate][no-cooperate] - company gets vuln info; researcher gets sued
[not-cooperate][cooperate] - researcher discloses vuln publicly;
company sues
[not-cooperate][not-cooperate] - researcher discloses vuln publicly;
company sues

With [nc][c] being a case where the researcher doesn't bother making
themselves known to the company, for this to hold true.

As I recall, the optimal strategy for that situation is to cooperate
until the other party doesn't, and then no longer cooperate at all.

I think that in a situation where the researching community -as a
whole- acted as the 'researcher' in this situation, i.e. if a company
sues a researcher, then no researcher discloses vulns about that
company's products to the company before public release, that would
most closely model the win/loss strategy and make it very easy for all
parties to understand the situation.

And since, despite the fact that humans are not rational, we keep on
trying to assume people act in a rational and informed manner,
rational actors would behave according to the optimal strategy--to
cooperate until they get betrayed.

That's my two cents on the matter, anyway.
