A contact without an enforcement clause is mostly useless since a violation will, at most, allow the opposing party to disregard the contract. This works great in a "I will mow your lawn as needed for $80/week" contract, in which case in the event of a breach, the other party would stop complying with their terms.

If the company chooses to pursue legal action against the researcher, the researcher has no remedy in the contract.
