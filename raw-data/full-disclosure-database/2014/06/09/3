you have had interesting experiences!

how many of these lawsuits have been dropped before heading to trial?
(numbers or percentages?)

how many legal motions went back and forth before trial in various
motions or other tactics?

how many plaintiffs were multiple offenders, or behind multiple legal
filings against you in multiple venues?

how any of these lawsuits encountered procedural or judicial
complications by nature of being technical in nature?

(and if you're answered these elsewhere please forgive and point in
the right direction :)


best regards,
