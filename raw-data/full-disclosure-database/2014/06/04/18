https://madiba.encs.concordia.ca/~x_decarn/truecrypt-binaries-analysis/ 
claims to have managed to build a reasonably identical build (such that 
the remaining differences can be identified and explained as build 
date/time stamps). The site includes instructions to reproduce the work.

I haven't tried it personally, but it might be an interesting exercise 
to see if anyone else can independently reproduce the binaries.
