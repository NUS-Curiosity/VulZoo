It is - but itÂ¹s also the risk you run with any open source crypto, or
kernel, or anything else. Plus anyone, no matter how familiar you are with
a codebase, can introduce stupid bugs. I speak from personal experience. :)

My guess would be that, after the audit is complete, a lot of people
(myself, and those a lot smarter than I am about crypto) will be keeping a
close eye on the diffs.

Cheers,
Greg
