Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a local command inject web vulnerability in the official IScan Online Mobile v2.0.1 iOS web-application.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
iScan Online Inc.
Product: iScan Online Mobile - iOS Web Application 2.0.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local command/path injection web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official IScan Online Mobile v2.0.1 iOS web-application.
The vulnerability allows attackers to inject local commands via vulnerable system values to compromise the apple mobile iOS application.

The vulnerability is located in the vulnerable `devicename` value of the `Settings` module. Local attackers are able to inject own malicious 
system specific commands or path value requests in the vulnerable `devicename` value. The execution of the local command inject occurs in the 
`Device Settings` module of the iscan online mobile application. The attacker is able to manipulate the settings module of the application 
by preparing to change the local devicename. The encoding of the vulnerable values in the settings > registration information module is broken.

The attack vector is on the application-side and the injection requires physical device access or a local low privileged user account. 
Local attackers are also able to exploit the filename validation issue in combination with persistent injected script codes to execute different 
local malicious attacks requests.

The security risk of the local command/path inject vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.2.

Exploitation of the command/path inject vulnerability requires a low privileged iOS device account with restricted access and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized execution of system specific commands and unauthorized path value requests to 
compromise the mobile iOS application or the connected device components.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Settings > Device Registration

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] devicename

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Registration Information


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The local command inject web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with local low privileged iOS device account without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...

1. Login to your iOS device and download+install the mobile application ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iscan-online-mobile/id658461644 )
2. Change the iOS devicename (device information > settings) to the local command inject payload and save the details after the update
Note: Request mobile var path or application files with local command
3. Open the iscan online mobile application and click the settings button on the buttom of the app navigation
4. The local command execution occurs in the `Device Name` output context of the registration information
5. Successful reproduce of the local command inject web vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The local command inject web vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of vulnerable devicename output context in the 
registration information (settings) module.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the local command/path inject vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.2.
