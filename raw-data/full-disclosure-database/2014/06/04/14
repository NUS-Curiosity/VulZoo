Subject: [FD] IPSwitch IMail Server WEB client 12.4 persistent XSS

# Exploit Title: IPSwitch IMail Server WEB client 12.4 persistent XSS

# Date: 3 june 2014

# Exploit Author: Peru (GoSecure!)

# Vendor Homepage: www.ipswitch.com

# Software Link: http://www.imailserver.com/try/

# Version: Tested on 12.3 and 12.4 before 12.4.1.15

# Tested on: WindowsServer2008R2 STD SP1

# CVE : 2014-3878 (Calendar section)

 

Four injection points were useful to create a persistent Cross Site
Scripting. All the injections are reached using default Web Client
interface, but the Web Client Lite seems to be not vulnerable to these
tests. 

 

1. Contacts section: 

A persistent XSS can be reached adding a new contact with a specific string
in the Name field and whatever image: 

 

PoC string: 

G<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>S! 

 

When the contact is saved and on mouse over the picture the Name is been
displayed in a bubble activating the JS. 

 

2. Contacts section: 

A vulnerability can also be reached in the Adding Group task. 

 

PoC string: 

<iframe src="http://www.google.it" height=500 width=500 frameborder=1
align=center></iframe> 

 

3. Calendar section: 

A persistent XSS can be reached adding a new event in the Calendar; this
event can be spread adding the Meeting Request option. 

Since, using this injection point, the XSS can be spread to other users,
this is the most dangerous of the four and can be used to spoofing sessions
and therefore compromising the attacked users account. 

 

The JavaScript is executed simply viewing the calendar or when the Reminder
pops up. 

 

PoC string: 

GS!<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME> 

 

4.Task section: 

In a similar way also the tasks are vulnerable to persistent XXS. 

 

PoC string: 

<iframe src=http://www.mysite.com/remote/xss_h.html>
