I'm not sure how to put it mildly, but I think you might have been
scooped on this some 1-2 decades ago...

Off the top of my head, there's a rant about this behavior in "The
Unix-Haters Handbook", and there are several highly detailed articles
by David Wheeler published over the years (e.g.,
http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html).

Yup, it's a counterintuitive behavior that leads to security problems.
The odds of changing the semantics at this point are very slim. Other
operating systems have their own idiosyncrasies in this area - for
example, Windows it not a lot better with parameter splitting and
special filenames.
