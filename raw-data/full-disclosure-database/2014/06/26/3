Subject: Re: [FD] Boolean algebra and CSS history theft

After reading your history theft with CSS article,  it got me wondering if
that's what the Passpack service is doing. I've been using passpack.com for
a while and after logging in to my account it always asks to 'click on the
black square to continue'. The page shows 8 white squares with one black
square being randomly positioned on every new log in. I've emailed passpack
asking them what it's for and am waiting for their response.
