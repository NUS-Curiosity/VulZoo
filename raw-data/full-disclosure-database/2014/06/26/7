Subject: Re: [FD] Session Hijack Vulnerabilty on ebays german want ad?

Hi all,
Yes Christian, this might be a security vulnerability, but it's an edge
case.

To me, the problem here is the difference between the user expectation and
what really happens.
A clear case of a similar vuln is when you log out of a website and what
the website actually does is just deleting the cookies on your browser, but
not invalidating the session Id server-side (so the session is still valid
for any attacker holding onto the cookie).
In your case, you click the "forgot password" button. One might say you
have no expectation of this killing any other session you might have on the
application. But in reality, the password reset function might be used in
the case of a (suspected) account compromise; either you cannot login
because an attacker has changed your password, or you can't be bothered to
log in to change your password but you suspect someone might have gained
access to your account. In both cases this is clearly not the intended
behaviour as the attacker remains in control of your account.

You might want to try changing your password while logged in and see if
when the password is changed this way, the other sessions are invalidated.

Regards,
--rob'
