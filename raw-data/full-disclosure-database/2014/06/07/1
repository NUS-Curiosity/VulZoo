Subject: Re: [FD] More OpenSSL issues

Yeah, definitely not in the same ballpark as heartbleed fortunately.

I have posted a detection script on the Tripwire blog to identify servers
permitting the early CCS:
http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/incident-detection/detection-script-for-cve-2014-0224-openssl-cipher-change-spec-injection/

It should detect potentially vulnerable hosts with a variety of
configurations.

Thanks,
Craig
