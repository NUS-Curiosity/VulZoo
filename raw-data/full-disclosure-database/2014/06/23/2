It's an interesting-sounding idea, with the stated goal of encouraging
greater use of OpenPGP by "ordinary" folks who commonly find GPG too
"difficult" to use.

As you say .... this is the bit that most readers are finding
mystifying, horrifying, and alarming.  Why would you do that, and why
would they want you to do that ?!?

There was a discussion about it earlier this year (April) on the
debian-project list, which you might find informative :
https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2014/04/msg00001.html

It linked to this blog post which is also an interesting read :
http://blog.lrdesign.com/2014/03/thoughts-on-keybase-io/

One possibly relevant point to emerge from that post is that the
keybase.io developers are some of the developers of the dating website
OkCupid.com, which is mildly infamous for (AFAIK) refusing to
implement SSL protection for its users in the wake of the release of
FireSheep et al.

Cheers,
Nick
