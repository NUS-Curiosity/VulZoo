While this is true, I think that keybase.io is providing something that is
arguably better than nothing, and they do make a point of saying that their
command line tools remove the web horribles that we are all aware of.

PGP/GPG has a horrible history of not being adopted. It's seen as hard to
use, elitist, and therefore something to be evaded by the general computing
populace (if they are even aware of it!) Projects like keybase.io,
mailvelope, and so on give some assurance of privacy, depending on one's
threat model. It's not perfect, but its still Pretty Good.
