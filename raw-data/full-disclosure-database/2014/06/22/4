They are willfully creating a less secure system in hopes of making it
popular. Supporting private key upload completely changes the threat model,
from the end-to-end system they are allegedly trying to supplement, to one
that's no different from just using TLS and a central service.

I hope it's clear to any security enthusiasts where their priorities lie.
Security takes a backseat to popularity. That's the wrong set of priorities
for secure software.
