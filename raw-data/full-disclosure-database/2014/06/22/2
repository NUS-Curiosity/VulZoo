There is an option to create as well as upload your private key. I'm
very new to this type of encryption, having only worked with
Truecrypt, SSH, and Bitloccker prior, but I was under the impression
that the private key was the last thing you should part with. Why
would a website focused on providing security allow users to upload
their private keys?

<orcnote>
  It is not necessary to store the private key at keybase.io.  I have
  Not done so.  When the private key is at keybase.io, it is in an
  Encrypted form for which keybase.io does not have the key.  If users
  Want to operate in the browser, instead of the client, there needs
  To be a way to apply the private key there, and that is only when
  the one at keybase.io is needed.  
     Just the same, I see no reason for adding to my private key's 
  "threat surface" by having a copy of it at keybase.io.

As mentioned, there are github, twitter, and website ownership
verification options, tied to your GPG public key. This does no more
than verifies that someone that has access to @username on twitter and
example.net (which are both listed on a user's keybase.io profile) are
controlled by the same person, but not the identity of said person,
correct?

<orcnote>
  Correct.  The keybase.io schemes associates identifiers of various
  Kinds with proofs that someone with authority over the private key
  Made the verified claims.  In my case, you can see by my public key
  at <https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc>, 
  <http://keybase.io/orcmid>, or your favorite PGP key server that I
  Have also achieved email verification via the PGP Global Registry.

I also have keybase.io invites if this interests anyone.

<orcnote>
  Me too.
