          CVE Name        CVE-2014-4046                                       

    Description  Manager users can execute arbitrary shell commands with the  
                 MixMonitor manager action. Asterisk does not require system  
                 class authorization for a manager user to use the            
                 MixMonitor action, so any manager user who is permitted to   
                 use manager commands can potentially execute shell commands  
                 as the user executing the Asterisk process.                  

    Resolution  Upgrade to a version with the patch integrated, apply the     
                patch, or do not allow users who should not have permission   
                to run shell commands to use AMI.
