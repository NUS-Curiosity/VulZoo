         CVE Name       CVE-2014-4045                                         

    Description  A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the     
                 PJSIP channel driver's pub/sub framework. If an attempt is   
                 made to unsubscribe when not currently subscribed and the    
                 endpoint's "sub_min_expiry" is set to zero, Asterisk tries   
                 to create an expiration timer with zero seconds, which is    
                 not allowed, so an assertion raised.                         

    Resolution  Upgrade to a version with the patch integrated, apply the     
                patch, or make sure the "sub_min_expiry" endpoint             
                configuration option is greater than zero.
