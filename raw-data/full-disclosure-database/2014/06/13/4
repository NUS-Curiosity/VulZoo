         CVE Name       CVE-2014-4048                                         

    Description  When a SIP transaction timeout caused a subscription to be   
                 terminated, the action taken by Asterisk was guaranteed to   
                 deadlock the thread on which SIP requests are serviced.      
                                                                              
                 Note that this behavior could only happen on established     
                 subscriptions, meaning that this could only be exploited if  
                 an attacker bypassed authentication and successfully         
                 subscribed to a real resource on the Asterisk server.        

    Resolution  The socket-servicing thread is now no longer capable of       
                dispatching synchronous tasks to other threads since that     
                may result in deadlocks.
