Subject: [FD] Embeded Device Security Conference 2014 // CFP

EDSC is an annual security conference focusing on embedded systems,
hardware, and anything behind the silicon curtain.  Embedded systems
testing is a rapidly expanding area of the security industry and staying
current is important for engineers, researchers, and testers alike.  EDSC
brings the top thought leaders in the embedded security field together for
two days to share knowledge, techniques, and research.

EDSC goals are to:

* Promote a common forum to discuss knowledge and research of embedded
security
* Accelerate the frontier of new research in the field, and adoption of
current research by the industry
