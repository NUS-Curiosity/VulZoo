VMware Security Advisory

Advisory ID: VMSA-2014-0006
Synopsis:    VMware product updates address OpenSSL 
             security vulnerabilities
Issue date:  2014-06-10
Updated on:  2014-06-10 (initial release)
CVE numbers: CVE-2014-0224, CVE-2014-0198, CVE-2010-5298, and 
             CVE-2014-3470
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware product updates address OpenSSL security vulnerabilities.

2. Relevant Releases

   ESXi 5.5 prior to ESXi550-201406401-SG


3. Problem Description

   a. OpenSSL update for multiple products.

      OpenSSL libraries have been updated in multiple products to
      versions 0.9.8za and 1.0.1h in order to resolve multiple security
      issues.
 
      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

      has assigned the names CVE-2014-0224, CVE-2014-0198, 
      CVE-2010-5298, CVE-2014-3470, CVE-2014-0221 and CVE-2014-0195 to
      these issues. The most important of these issues is 
      CVE-2014-0224.

      CVE-2014-0198, CVE-2010-5298 and CVE-2014-3470 are considered to
      be of moderate severity. Exploitation is highly unlikely or is
      mitigated due to the application configuration.

      CVE-2014-0221 and CVE-2014-0195, which are listed in the OpenSSL 
      Security Advisory (see Reference section below), do not affect
      any VMware products.     
  
      CVE-2014-0224 may lead to a Man-in-the-Middle attack if a server
      is running a vulnerable version of OpenSSL 1.0.1 and clients are
      running a vulnerable version of OpenSSL 0.9.8 or 1.0.1. Updating
      the server will mitigate this issue for both the server and all
      affected clients.

      CVE-2014-0224 may affect products differently depending on
      whether the product is acting as a client or a server and of
      which version of OpenSSL the product is using. For readability
      the affected products have been split into 3 tables below, 
      based on the different client-server configurations and
      deployment scenarios.

      MITIGATIONS

      Clients that communicate with a patched or non-vulnerable server
      are not vulnerable to CVE-2014-0224. Applying these patches to 
      affected servers will mitigate the affected clients (See Table 1
      below).

      Clients that communicate over untrusted networks such as public
      Wi-Fi and communicate to a server running a vulnerable version of 
      OpenSSL 1.0.1. can be mitigated by using a secure network such as 
      VPN (see Table 2 below).
      
      Clients and servers that are deployed on an isolated network are
      less exposed to CVE-2014-0224 (see Table 3 below). The affected
      products are typically deployed to communicate over the
      management network. 

      RECOMMENDATIONS

      VMware recommends customers evaluate and deploy patches for
      affected Servers in Table 1 below as these patches become
      available. Patching these servers will remove the ability to
      exploit the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-0224 on both
      clients and servers. VMware recommends customers consider 
      applying patches to products listed in Table 2 & 3 as required.

      Column 4 of the following tables lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.
