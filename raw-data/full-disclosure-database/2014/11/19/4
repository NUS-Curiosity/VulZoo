Subject: [FD] CVE-2014-8600 - Insufficient Input Validation By IO Slaves In
 KDE e.V. KDE

Vulnerability title: Insufficient Input Validation By IO Slaves In KDE e.V. KDE
CVE: CVE-2014-8600
Vendor: KDE e.V.
Product: KDE
Affected version: kwebkitpart <= 1.3.4, kde-runtime <= 4.14.3, kio-extras <= 5.1.1
Fixed version: Contact distribution vendor
Reported by: T. Brown and D. Burton
Details:

Whilst investigating how KDE handles custom protocols, it was discovered that a number of the protocol handlers (referred to as IO slaves) did not satisfactorily handle malicious input. It is possible for an attacker to inject JavaScript by manipulating IO slave URI such that the JavaScript from the manipulated request is returned in the response. Example IO slaves that trigger this behaviour include:

        zip
        trash
        tar
        thumbnail
        smtps
        smtp
        smb
        remote
        recentdocuments
        nntps
        nntp
        network
        mbox
        ldaps
        ldap
        fonts
        file
        desktop
        cgi
        bookmarks
        ar

The following code will trigger all vulnerable IO slaves:

for x in /usr/share/kde4/services/*.protocol do proto=`basename $x | cut -f 1 -d\.` kfmclient newTab "$proto://hhdhdhhdhdhdh.google.com/\"><script>alert(\"$proto\"+document.domain);</script>"
done
