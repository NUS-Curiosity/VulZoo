Subject: [FD] Vulnerabilities in D-Link DCS-2103

Hello list!

There are Directory Traversal and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities in 
D-Link DCS-2103 (IP camera).

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: D-Link DCS-2103, Firmware 1.0.0. This model 
with other firmware versions also must be vulnerable.

I found these vulnerabilities at 11.07.2014 and later informed D-Link. But 
they haven't answered. It looks like they are busy with fixing 
vulnerabilities in DAP-1360, which I wrote about earlier.

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

Disclosure:
----------------

I disclosed these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/7250/).

I found this and other web cameras during summer to watch terrorists 
activities in Donetsk and Lugansks regions of Ukraine 
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2014-October/009056.html). 
You can watch my videos in the playlist Ukrainian Cyber Forces: video 
reconnaissance
