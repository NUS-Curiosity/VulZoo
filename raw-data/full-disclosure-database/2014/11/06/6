Subject: [FD] DAVOSET v.1.2.2

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. At 31st of October DAVOSET v.1.2.2
was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

Download DAVOSET v.1.2.2:

In new version there was added support of https URL for target sites. Also
there were changed default settings and removed non-working services from
full list of zombies.

In total there are 170 zombie-services in the list. In last two versions I
removed a lot of vulnerable sites from the lists, because admins became
fixing holes at their web sites in summer - after significant increase of
use of my tool.

Best wishes & regards,
