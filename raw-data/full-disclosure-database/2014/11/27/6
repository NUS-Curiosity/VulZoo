Subject: [FD] All Links in Two Topics of Indiatimes (indiatimes.com) Are
 Vulnerable to XSS (cross site scripting) Attacks

*All Links in **Two Topics of Indiatimes (indiatimes.com
<http://indiatimes.com/>) Are Vulnerable to XSS (cross site scripting)
Attacks *




*Domain Description:*

http://www.indiatimes.com


"According to the Indian Readership Survey (IRS) 2012, the Times of India
is the most widely read English newspaper in India with a readership of
7.643 million. This ranks the Times of India as the top English daily in
India by readership." (en.Wikipedia.org <http://en.wikipedia.org/>)







*Vulnerability description:*


The vulnerability occurs at Indiatimes's URL links. Indiatimes only filter
part of the filenames in its website. All URLs under Indiatimes's
"photogallery" and "top-llists" topics are affected.


Indiatimes uses part of the links under "photogallery" and "top-llists"
topics to construct its website content without any checking of those links
at all. This mistake is very popular in nowaday websites. Developer is not
security expert.



The vulnerability can be attacked without user login. Tests were performed
on Firefox (26.0) in Ubuntu (12.04) and IE (9.0.15) in Windows 7.

However they are still unpatched.
