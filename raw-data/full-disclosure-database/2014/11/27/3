Subject: [FD] The Weather Channel weather.com Almost All Links Vulnerable to
	XSS Attacks

*The Weather Channel weather.com <http://weather.com/> Almost All Links
Vulnerable to XSS Attacks*





Domain Description:

http://www.weather.com/


"The Weather Channel is an American basic cable and satellite television
channel which broadcasts weather forecasts and weather-related news and
analyses, along with documentaries and entertainment programming related to
weather."


"As of August 2013, The Weather Channel was received by approximately
99,926,000 American households that subscribe to a pay television service
(87.50% of U.S. households with television), making it the most common
cable channel in the country." (Wikipedia)






*Vulnerability description:*


Almost all links under the domain weather.com are vulnerable to XSS
attacks. Attackers just need to add script at the end of The Weather
Channel's URLs. Then the scripts will be executed.


10 thousands of Links were tested based a self-written tool. During the
tests, 76.3% of links belong to weather.com were vulnerable to XSS attacks.


The reason of this vulnerability is that Weather Channel uses URLs to
construct its tags without filtering malicious script codes.


The vulnerability can be attacked without user login. Tests were performed
on Firefox (26.0) in Ubuntu (12.04) and IE (9.0.15) in Windows 7.
