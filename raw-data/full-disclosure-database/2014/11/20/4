Subject: [FD] DAVOSET v.1.2.3

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. At 15th of November DAVOSET v.1.2.3
was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/).

Download DAVOSET v.1.2.3:

In new version there were added new services into full list of zombies, made
a list of web sites which require "http" for target URL and removed
non-working services from full list of zombies.

In total there are 170 zombie-services in the list. I removed 10 vulnerable
sites and added 10 new sites.

Best wishes & regards,
