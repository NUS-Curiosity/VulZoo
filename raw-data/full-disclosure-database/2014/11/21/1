         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  Many modules in Asterisk that service incoming IP traffic    
                 have ACL options ("permit" and "deny") that can be used to   
                 whitelist or blacklist address ranges. A bug has been        
                 discovered where the address family of incoming packets is   
                 only compared to the IP address family of the first entry    
                 in the list of access control rules. If the source IP        
                 address for an incoming packet is not of the same address    
                 family as the first ACL entry, that packet bypasses all ACL  
                 rules. For ACLs whose rules are all of the same address      
                 family, there is no issue.                                   
                                                                              
                 Note that while the incoming packet may bypass ACL rules,    
                 the packet is still subject to any authentication            
                 requirements that the specific protocol employs.             
                                                                              
                 This issue affects the following parts of Asterisk           
                                                                              
                   * All VoIP channel drivers                                 
                                                                              
                   * DUNDi                                                    
                                                                              
                   * Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI)                         

    Resolution  The ACL code has been amended to compare the incoming         
                packet's source address family against the address families   
                for all rules.
