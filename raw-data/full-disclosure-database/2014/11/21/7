         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  The DB dialplan function when executed from an external      
                 protocol (for instance AMI), could result in a privilege     
                 escalation.                                                  

    Resolution  Asterisk now inhibits the  DB function from being executed    
                from an external interface if the live_dangerously option is  
                set to no.
