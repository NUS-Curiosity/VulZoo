         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  The CONFBRIDGE dialplan function when executed from an       
                 external protocol (for instance AMI), could result in a      
                 privilege escalation. Also, the AMI action                   
                 "ConfbridgeStartRecord" could also be used to execute        
                 arbitrary system commands without first checking for system  
                 access.                                                      

    Resolution  Asterisk now inhibits the CONFBRIDGE function from being      
                executed from an external interface if the live_dangerously   
                option is set to no. Also, the "ConfbridgeStartRecord" AMI    
                action is now only allowed to execute under a user with       
                system level access.
