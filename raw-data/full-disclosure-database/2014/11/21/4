         CVE Name       Pending                                               

    Description  The chan_pjsip channel driver uses a queue approach for      
                 actions relating to SIP sessions. There exists a race        
                 condition where actions may be queued to answer a session    
                 or send ringing AFTER a SIP session has been terminated      
                 using a CANCEL request. The code will incorrectly assume     
                 that the SIP session is still active and attempt to send     
                 the SIP response. The PJSIP library does not expect the SIP  
                 session to be in the disconnected state when sending the     
                 response and asserts.                                        

    Resolution  Asterisk has been patched so any queued actions that occur    
                after a SIP session has been disconnected will not execute.
