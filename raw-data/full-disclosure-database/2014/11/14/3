Subject: [FD] Bypass Google Open Redirect Filter Based on
	Googleads.g.doubleclick.net

Bypass Google Open Redirect Filter Based on Googleads.g.doubleclick.net
<http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/>
-- Google Covert Redirect Vulnerability Based on Googleads.g.doubleclick.net
<http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/>



The vulnerability exists at "Logout?" page with "&continue" parameter, i.e.
https://www.google.com/accounts/Logout?service=writely&continue=https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net



The vulnerability can be attacked without user login. Tests were performed
on Firefox (26.0) in Ubuntu (12.04) and IE (9.0.15) in Windows 7.



(1) When a user is redirected from Google to another site, Google will
check whether the redirected URL belongs to domains in Google's whitelist
(The whitelist usually contains websites belong to Google), e.g.
docs.google.com
googleads.g.doubleclick.net



If this is true, the redirection will be allowed.

However, if the URLs in a redirected domain have open URL redirection
 vulnerabilities themselves, a user could be redirected from Google to a
vulnerable URL in that domain first and later be redirected from this
vulnerable site to a malicious site. This is as if being redirected from
Google directly.

One of the vulnerable domain is,
googleads.g.doubleclick.net (Google's Ad System)




(2) Use one webpage for the following tests. The webpage address is "
http://www.inzeed.com/kaleidoscope". We can suppose that this webpage is
malicious.



Vulnerable URL:
https://www.google.com/accounts/Logout?service=writely&continue=https://google.com/
