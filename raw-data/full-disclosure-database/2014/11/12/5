*[ESNC-2039348] Multiple Critical Security Vulnerabilities in SAP
Governance, Risk and Compliance (SAP GRC)*

Please refer to http://www.esnc.de for the original security advisory,
updates and additional information.




*------------------------------------------------------------------------1.
Business
Impact------------------------------------------------------------------------*

According to SAP, "SAP Governance, Risk, and Compliance solutions (SAP GRC
solutions) offer your organization a preventive, real-time approach to
governance, risk, and compliance. Automated risk and compliance monitoring
activities can help you proactively prevent risk events and compliance
violations, helping you protect the value of your organization"

SAP GRC Access Control has multiple remote vulnerabilities, which may allow
an attacker to elevate privileges, bypass SoD restrictions and execute
arbitrary programs. An attacker can also exploit these vulnerabilities
remotely using RFC protocol or if SOAP-RFC is active, through http/https.

Due to the nature of the business functionality SAP GRC modules offer, we
believe the issue is rather critical.

*Risk Level: High*
