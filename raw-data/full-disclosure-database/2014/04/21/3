Subject: [FD] RAT C2 Domains

This is going out to a few lists, so apologies for those who get this a few
times.

As part of my project researching RATS - http://malwareconfig.com
http://techanarchy.net/2014/04/rat-decoders/

I am finding myself with a large dataset of known Bad C2 Domains and IP's,
Most of these are hosted on service like no-ip.

So my question, other than an email to the abuse@.... email address are
there any services that can make use of this data. As they are not web
services on 80 im not sure if the normal range of web reputation databases
can make use or not.
