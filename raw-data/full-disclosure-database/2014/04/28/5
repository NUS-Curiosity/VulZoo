Subject: Re: [FD] Telegram authentication bypass

Hello,

like Telegram said, this is definitely out of normal security models!
You assume that the client app has been compromised, e.g. by downloading
an unofficial one.
If you assume that, every crypto protocol out there is broken! What
about downloading a forked Firefox version? Maybe it includes some MitM
certificates...
Nothing protects you against your attack...

Regards from a suprised
Dominik
