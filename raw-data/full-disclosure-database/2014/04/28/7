You don't seem to understand the difference between authentication
bypass and man-in-the-middle scenarios.

Why, yes, of course if you can install a trojanized client it can
connect to a different server that you own. It can also connect to the
proper server and forward all messages in the background. Or collect all
credit card numbers and send them by email. It's a trojan, you can do
anything. How is this a vulnerability in Telegram?
