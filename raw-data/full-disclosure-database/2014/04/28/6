I haven't read the details, but can you please explain how it is an
"attack" if I can control a user if I manage that he installs a
modified client?
I can do anything if a user installs a client I can modify. That's
no surprise and has nothing to do with the protocol in use.

I'm certainly not a fan of telegram's strange security protocol, but
this seriously sounds like strange FUD (haven't read the paper, maybe
it's just a joke or a fake).
