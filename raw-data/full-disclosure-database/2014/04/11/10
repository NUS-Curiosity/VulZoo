thanks for whatever respect may be due, but bruce is still wrong. the
cost to fix this is:

1. replace all private keys
2. replace all passwords
3. upgrade all SSL software

that rates 9 out of 10, where 10 is the worst thing i could have
imagined pre-heartbleed, which is remote file modification and/or remote
code execution, because the costs in that case would be:

1. inclusive of [1..3] above
2. replace all operating systems
3. audit or replace all user data

we already have to do that, since we have to assume the worst whenever
we don't have log files which somehow prove a negative.

bruce was spouting nonsense. heartbleed's costs will not be higher than
previously imaginable.
