And also burn the hardware, given that if you're assuming the
worst-case scenario, all your firmware is now replaced with that of
Roomba.

I mean, it's a very cool bug. I'm jealous of Neel.

But it's also one of the most weird PR cycles I have seen in recent
history and I don't think it happened entirely on its own. I think
it's funny that apparently the first thing Codenomicon did was to
register heartbleed.com on Saturday - and then waited with contacting
OpenSSL for at least two more days, as if that mattered less.
