3. Problem Description

   a. vSphere Client Insecure Client Download

      vSphere Client contains a vulnerability in accepting an updated 
      vSphere Client file from an untrusted source. The vulnerability may 
      allow a host to direct vSphere Client to download and execute an 
      arbitrary file from any URI. This issue can be exploited if 
      the host has been compromised or if a user has been tricked 
      into clicking a malicious link.

      VMware would like to thank Recurity Labs GmbH and the Bundesamt
Sicherheit
      in der Informationstechnik (BSI) for reporting this issue to us

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
      assigned the name CVE-2014-1209 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

      Known Issue

      Under certain circumstances a user may see a warning dialogue box 
      appear prior to downloading the vSphere Client. The warning dialogue 
      box may appear when connecting to a different vCenter Server version
that 
      the vSphere Client was intended for. This issue is documented in 
      VMware Knowledge Base article 2074148. 

   b. VMware vSphere Client spoofing vulnerability

      VMware vSphere Client contains a vulnerability in the validation 
      of the server security certificate. Exploitation of the issue may
      lead to vCenter server being spoofed. A user would have to be tricked
      into clicking a malicious link.
