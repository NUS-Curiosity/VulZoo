Subject: Re: [FD] Andrew "Weev" Auernheimer's Conviction Thrown Out

The sad part is that he's been released back under the terms of his original pre-trial bail, which includes such things as no non-windows computers, no computers without government-chosen spyware/monitoring, and AFAIK they have to approve in advance any offer of employment he may receive.

The amount of freedoms one loses long before trial (when presumed innocent) or after the vacation of a guilty verdict is astounding and underscores the insane amount of power granted the FBI/DoJ. His original criminal complaint from the FBI that lead to his arrest (long before his indictment) was riddled with tons of obvious factual errors and clear misunderstandings.
