Updated version, the heartbleed leak returned incorrect TLS record sizes
(kudos to Andrea Shepard @ tor for pointing this out) but was still leaking
the requested amount. Earlier code was returning only 16k of data as I
relied on the TLS record size. This version will leak upto 64K of data from
client or server heap.
