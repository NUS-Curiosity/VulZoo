Subject: [FD] The state of infection in Uanet 2013

Hello participants of Mailing List.

Since 2006 I publish security reports about hackers activity in Uanet and
since 2012 I begun publishing reports about web applications at infected web
sites (among all my reports). About which I wrote in WASC Mailing List.

In my publication The state of infection in Uanet 1h 2013
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-October/008906.html)
I wrote you about the state of infection in Uanet in the 1st half year of
2013. Now I want to tell you about the state of infection in Uanet in the
second half and totals of 2013
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2014-April/009018.html).

After publishing the results of hackers activity in Uanet for the second
half of 2013, I have published separate reports concerning state of malware.
Among my reports there are the next:

- Web applications at infected web sites in the second half of 2013
http://websecurity.com.ua/7089/
- Web applications at infected web sites in 2013
http://websecurity.com.ua/7096/

This information can be interesting for you.
