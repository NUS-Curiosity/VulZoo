No idea on pop3.

But a long-lived imap4 connection waiting in IDLE may cause a stateful
firewall (such as common consumer NAT routers) to time-out a connection as
"inactive" after a while. That might result in apparently hung connections
or otherwise unreliable services. TLS heartbeats would be a convenient
way to keep the connection alive through such firewalls and provide a
more reliable service to users.

Thanks
