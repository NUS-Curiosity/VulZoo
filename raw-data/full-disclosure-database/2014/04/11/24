Subject: [FD] MRI Rubies may contain statically linked, vulnerable OpenSSL

https://gist.github.com/chapmajs/10473815

Apparently some MRI build scripts copy only the OpenSSL version at time of build, so the provided test is not necessarily 100% accurate. PoC confirmed with RVM on OS X 10.9, Arch Linux, Slackware 14.1
