Subject: [FD] AIMSICD: Developers for Android-App WANTED!


Listen up, we need your help!

As you may already know. we're developing an Android App to detect IMSI-Catcher attacks: https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector. The project is fully Open Source and has been making progress in the last few days and the Android IMSI-Catcher Detector (AIMSICD) does *not* need ROOT any longer. FemtoCell protection for CDMA phones works already!

How can you help us progress to make this thing more awesome?

* Grab the App: https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/releases
* Help us figure out how to pass an OEM_HOOK_RAW request from command line and read the results!
* Report Feedback on XDA: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1422969
* Leave your ideas: https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/WANTED_FEATURES

Our project is cool and fresh, we're looking for skilled hackers and developers. Don't be shy!
