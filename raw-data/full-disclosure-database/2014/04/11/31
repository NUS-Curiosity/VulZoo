Subject: Re: [FD] heartbleed OpenSSL bug CVE-2014-0160


When I first heard it, I suspected that there was something more behind it.
Thing is - as secret services are not able to actually brute-force encryption, 
they needed to find a way around. And the only one way around was to either 
use existing bugs/weaknesses, or implant some (as NIST).

Don't you guys feel that in the last 12 months, there are very many bugs 
related to SSL showing up ?

IMHO that is not a coincidence... these are too many for me to believe this is 
coincidence. I really believe that some secret service agencies have made sure 
that certain weaknesses are implanted or if discovered, remain where they are 
(in the dark) so they can actually use these if required.

The best about that is the media coverage. I have rarely (except when I hear 
politicians talk) heard so much junk in so short sentences.
