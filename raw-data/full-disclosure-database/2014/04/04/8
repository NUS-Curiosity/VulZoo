Subject: Re: [FD] Legality of Open Source Tools

Hi. As w3af's project leader I've not received any legal threats over
the seven years this project has been alive.

Only a couple of months ago, and just to be sure, I added this
disclaimer which users need to accept to run the tool.

DISCLAIMER = """Usage of w3af for sending any traffic to a target
 without prior mutual consent is illegal. It is the end user's responsibility to
 obey all applicable local, state and federal laws. Developers assume
no liability
 and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this program."""
