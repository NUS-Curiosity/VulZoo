Subject: [FD] Legality of Open Source Tools

Greetings

I am a security researcher who is working on a project in my free time,
without going into details - the project will end with a powerful tool
being publicly released.

Obviously most cyber security tools have the potential for abuse. What sort
of legal hurdles (if any) do you need to overcome to protect yourself when
releasing software along the lines of metasploit?
