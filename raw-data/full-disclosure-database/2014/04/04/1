Subject: [FD] Security Industry Scams and Lies

Much of the infosec industry is perpetuating lies. It may have started
with good reason but now it's a huge mess. And those lies have become
part of the culture, the education, and the laws. It's a huge scam.

"We have many new infosec professionals joining the workforce every
year who have been schooled in product configurations, best practices,
and vendor whitepapers as to what security is. Everything they know
about protection has been carefully cultivated through marketing
relationships with colleges and training centers with insights
specially prepared and spoon fed through sponsored news headlines."
