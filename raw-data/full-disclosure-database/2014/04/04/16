Real people can die if you move the right electrons attached to say life support systems in buildings, water treatment plants, hydro electric dams, and power stations.  Real people will be affected if you manipulate electrons associated with banking, investing and finance.

Software is SO different to a gun... you can't really compare them.
Real people will die in most cases when a gun is misused, only electrons are disturbed (in the great majority of cases) if you misuse a hacking tool.
