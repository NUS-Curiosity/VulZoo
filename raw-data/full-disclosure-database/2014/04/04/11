Subject: [FD] Credit Cards for 1.2 Million Drivers Vulnerable at TxTag.org

There is a serious flaw at TxTag.org, the Texas Department of
Transportation's toll road account management system. This flaw exposes
personal information for the (as of December 31) 1.2 million drivers with
active TxTags, including names, full mailing addresses, email addresses,
phone numbers, and credit card numbers with expiration date.

TxTag.org uses predictable account names - an 8-digit number beginning with
the number 2. Account holders may select a custom account name, but the
original 8-digit TxTag number assigned to the account remains valid.
Further, TxTag.org limits users to a 4-digit numeric PIN. That in and of
itself is a recipe for abuse. To make matters worse, TxTag inexplicably
stores the complete credit card number with expiration date as a hidden
field on the Update AutoPay Methods page.
