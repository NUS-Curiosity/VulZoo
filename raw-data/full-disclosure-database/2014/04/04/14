Subject: Re: [FD] Legality of Open Source Tools

After a dozen-ish years of Nikto and some other tools, it's not been a
problem for me either.

However, it doesn't have to be illegal for someone to sue you, or include
you in a court case, which can ruin your day and possibly cost you money
regardless of right or wrong.  Having disclaimers and a license with a
forum selection clause can make your life easier should the worst case
thing happen.

Just my $.02--the closest I am to being a lawyer is having watched Boston
Legal.
