Subject: Re: [FD] Remote Command Execution within the ASUS RT-AC68U Managing
 Web Interface

Hi Paula,
SOHO router security is quite bad.  This is far from an isolated ping
injection as most home routers don't bother to sanitize input going to
ping functionality.  It is common enough that I have begun just
referring to it as ping injection.

FYI - For tracking purposes, the CVE I had assigned when I alerted
Asus to this about 6 months ago is CVE-2013-5948.

More information on my SOHO router research with Tripwire VERT is
available here:

Thanks for sharing,
Craig
