Subject: [FD] New tool: sn00p - Automation framework for security tests.

Servus,

Today, nullsecurity just released a new tool: sn00p. It is available on
nullsecurity.net and in BlackArch Linux (http://www.blackarch.org/).

It is recommended to read the man page before using it.

[ DESCRIPTION ]

sn00p is a modular tool written in bourne shell and designed to chain and
automate security tools and tests. It parses target definitions from the commandline
and runs corresponding modules afterwards. sn00p can also parse a given
nmap logfile for open tcp and udp ports. All results will be logged in specified
directories and a report can subsequently be generated.

- final stable version in future >= 1.0 releases.
- send bug reports / feedback directly to noptrix[at]nullsecurity.net


Cheers,
