Partly true.

OpenSSH does utilize the libraries of OpenSSL for cryptographic purposes (ldd will reveal the presence of libcrypto.so), but this is for generating and utilizing asymmetric keys. CVE-2014-0160 impacts the heartbeat extension of TLS and since the SSH protocol does not use SSL/TLS, you should be fine.

As a general rule of thumb for this vulnerability, any binary/service dynamically linked to libssl.so should be considered compromised.

SSH does not usually use OpenSSL libraries, so no.
