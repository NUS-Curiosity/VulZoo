Subject: [FD] DAVOSET v.1.2

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. At 26th of April DAVOSET v.1.2
was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/). This is Nuclear Edition. Because of
anniversary, I wish you a peaceful atom.

In new version there were added support of Socks proxy. Now you can not only
send request to target site via zombie-server as proxy, but send the initial
request to zombie-server via proxy. Also there were added new services into
full list of zombies and removed non-working service from this list.

In total there are 200 zombie-services in the list, which are ready to
strike against dictatorship.

Best wishes & regards,
