Subject: [FD] Divx plugin suite heap-based buffer overflow

Introduction:

DirectShowDemuxFilter as part of Divx plugin suite is vulnerable to heap-based buffer overflow,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system. The vulnerability is
caused due to a signedness error in the processing of "STRF" (Stream Format) chunks.
This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted AVI file.
Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code by tricking a user into visiting a
malicious website.

DirectShowDemuxFilter is used by DivX Web Player, Divx Player and any application using
Divx plugins like Windows Media Player (When Divx is installed).
