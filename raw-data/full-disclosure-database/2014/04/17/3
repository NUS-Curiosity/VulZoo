Subject: Re: [FD] ldd for OS X WAS:Auditing systems for vulnerable 3rd-party
 OpenSSL (Gabriel Brezi)

There are quite a few Homebrew[1] formula that depend on OpenSSL. They may
be vulnerable to Heartbleed on OS X if 'brew update && brew upgrade' hasn't
been ran and the machine rebooted. Attached at the bottom of this email[2]
is the full list of the formula that depend on OpenSSL for one reason or
another.

Cheers!
