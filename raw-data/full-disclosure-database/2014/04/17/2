 OpenSSL (Gabriel Brezi)

Hi Gabriel,

In OS X there is no 'ldd' command. Instead, the synonym is:

#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/otool -L "$1"

Also, I think you will find up to the latest OS X version (10.9.2 ?) the
bundled Openssl version is 0.9.8y. So, safe from Heartbleed unless the user
has installed a different openssl.
