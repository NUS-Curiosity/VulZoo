g = 2 is not a generator though its often used. Its possible to leak
information depending on parameter selection (or only generate half
the values of the group). See, for example, "Diffie-Hellman Parameter
Check (when g = 2, must p mod 24 == 11?)",
http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12961/diffie-hellman-parameter-check-when-g-2-must-p-mod-24-11.
