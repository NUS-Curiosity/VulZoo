Subject: Re: [FD] Suspect arrested who used Heartbleed to infiltrate the
 Canada Revenue Agency (Our IRS)

"The CRA also declined to explain how it determined which SINs were
hacked, since Heartbleed intrusions are hard to detect.²

My guess is he was probably quite proud of himself and went and told the
agency. ³Hey you¹ve got Heartbleed, look at all the SIN¹s somebody can
get.² and then they promptly turned around and arrested him. He¹ll be
touted as the latest evil hacker and the CRA will bang on about how they
³detected and captured² him.

Remember kids, if you don¹t have a signed authorization form, stay out or
at the very least, keep your mouth shut.
