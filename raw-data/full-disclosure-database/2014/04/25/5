At this point in time, it was true. The RCE is not exactly a Struts
issue alone, the Struts issue just opens the door to an unprotected
field in a certain servlet container environment.

Better suggestions are always welcome. We have a mail address to reach
us for any concerns regarding security: security@...uts.apache.org

We try to protect users who are not using a properly configured security
manager, as it is always recommended when working with application
servers. Sometimes we seem to fail, indeed. As others, we don't seem to
be perfect. BTW, we are not only blacklisting - the blacklist is applied
for special cases that make it through the whitelist.

To what alternative? UEL? The attack vector is just using a simple
getter semantic which basically works with any EL. Throwing out EL
capabilities is no option for most users. Anyway, if somebody likes to
help with more than just fingerpointing, he/she is heartly welcome!
