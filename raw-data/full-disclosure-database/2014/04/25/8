 (security | critical)


Also, I'm a tad confused by the regex you have as a stop-gap.  For the
readers' convenience:

(.*\.|^|.*|\[('|"))(c|C)lass(\.|('|")]|\[).*,^dojo\..*,^struts\..*,^session\..*,^request\..*,^application\..*,^servlet(Request|Response)\..*,^parameters\..*,^action:.*,^method:.*


If your regex evaluation is case-sensitive, then clearly you need to
check for "class" and "Class", since OGNL converts "foo" to "getFoo",
and would likely also convert "Foo" to "getFoo".  But if the blacklist
is case sensitive, then don't you also need to check for
"^Request...", "^Session...", "^Struts...", and so on?  Or is it
actually case insensitive and you're just being unnecessarily careful
with "class"?

Also: Thought about unicode lately?

PS- yes, I'm too lazy to actually look at the Struts code right now.
