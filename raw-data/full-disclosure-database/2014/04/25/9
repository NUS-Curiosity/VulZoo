It's bullshit. They say: 'A missing bounds check in the handling of the
variable "DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS"'. That's not a variable, the "D" is
not actually part of the name, and it's a compile-time macro that
configures whether heartbeats will be compiled in or not. And because
it's a compile-time thing, it's nothing that an attacker could ever
influence.
