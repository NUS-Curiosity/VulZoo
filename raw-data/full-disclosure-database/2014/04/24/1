Subject: [FD] [ANN] Struts 2 up to 2.3.16.1: Zero-Day Exploit Mitigation
 (security | critical)

In Struts 2.3.16.1, an issue with ClassLoader manipulation via request
parameters was supposed to be resolved. Unfortunately, the correction
wasn't sufficient.

A security fix release fully addressing this issue is in preparation and
will be released as soon as possible.

Once the release is available, all Struts 2 users are strongly
recommended to update their installations.

* Until the release is available, all Struts 2 users are strongly
recommended to apply the mitigation described in [1] *

Please follow the Apache Struts announcement channels [2][3][4][5] to
stay updated regarding the upcoming security release. Most likely the
release will be available within the next 72 hours. Please prepare for
upgrading all Struts 2 based production systems to the new release
version once available.
