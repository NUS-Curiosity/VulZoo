Subject: [FD] Advisory: Security Industry Scams and Lies

Hello List,

I want to warn you about entities that exploit public internet
infrastructure for self promotion.
I will do so by example, entity Pete Herzog (PH):
  - PH abuses the ability to post to public mailing lists ( for example
seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Apr/55 ).
  - PH creates wikipedia pages en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Herzog
  - ... ('m lazy)

PH complains about itsec being a scam, however isearch shows us PH never
contributed vulns or tools himself (
http://packetstormsecurity.com/search/?q=pete+herzog ).
The most value PH has created is entertaining the crowd by violating the
first rule of itsec ( http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2004/Nov/1404 ) .
PH seems to feel entitled to complain about the state of the craft. It is
indeed saddening to see 44 year old script kiddies do exist.
