Hi Nick.  Yeah, Mailman does that sort of thing.  But to their credit, on
the list description/signup page at (
http://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/fulldisclosure), the text above the
password box says:

"You may enter a privacy password below. This provides only mild security,
but should prevent others from messing with your subscription. Do not use a
valuable password as it will occasionally be emailed back to you in
cleartext."

They should probably just call it a confirmation token or something instead
of password, as the point is just to prove you're the one getting email at
the given address so you can edit your list subscription preferences.  I
never enter a token and let Mailman choose one for me.

Cheers,
Fyodor
