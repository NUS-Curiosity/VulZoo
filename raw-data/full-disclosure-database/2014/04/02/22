Of course. That patch (one liner) is just to prevent the bulk monthly
reminders (which often end up in spam filters or in some admins
dead.letter box) from containing the actual insecure password which
could be used to produce no actual harm.   As someone else noted,
mailman never claims to securely store your password, and my patch
simply keeps a list from defaulting to distributing that plainly
stored password.
