That's not quite right. The manufacturer of the ATM chooses the OS. 

When you -- as a bank -- buy an ATM you get a preinstalled device with
an underlying OS (Windows mostly) and a software stack consisting of
drivers for the card reader, dispenser, keyboard an so on. On top of
that you install your own application so the ATM will work with the
software running in your datacenter.

Yours sincerely
Stefan
