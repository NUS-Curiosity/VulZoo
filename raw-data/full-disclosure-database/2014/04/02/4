You are right on most of these.
The only way to gain a "small" control over it, is host it on your own hardware at home, and 
provide only links on other side on information of your site.
Then, if you want remove it from the net, you cannot just delete the links, as these are still 
there (crawler bots, search machines etc.). You'll have to also modify "the" information. 
Actually, this is called provide misinformation as to invalidate the information you have so far.
The question that then comes to my mind is - how many information/versions do the Bots 
cache of your site ? This will determine the number of disinformation changes you will have 
to make on your site ... :}

The alternative of course - is to not have a E-Mail address, no contact to social sites, no 
Credit card, no Social security number, and live as an hermit :) somewhere in a cave (as a 
hermit on a mountain, the spy satellites can spot you :) ) ...
