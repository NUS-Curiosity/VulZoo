This goes for all banks and is probably one of the reasons most ATMs
still run windows and are skimmable time after time by the simplest
exploits. 

It's simply cheaper and easier to cover the losses and spin the news
after an incident than to spend money on preventive security and
research... They made the cost/benefit calculation eons ago,
concluding this way is cheaper, and it obviously still proves.

Probably goes for lots of other areas part from banking aswell.
