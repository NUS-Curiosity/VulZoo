I think this part says it all. I'd even drop the "unrealistic" out of
it. Keeping someone "private" on FB is like spraying it over a wall
and hoping nobody will notice, while a certain person is already
running an exhibition business out of it.

The whole concept of "online privacy" is a delusion IMO. How can
something be private if it leaves traces and records all over the
place? Traffic, logs, DB records... So please, please let's stop
thinking that something can be "private" when we share it with a
multibillion company and its partners, advertisers, developers, and
whoever makes a legal claim.

If you want something to be private -- don't share it. Period.

Cheers,
Z.
