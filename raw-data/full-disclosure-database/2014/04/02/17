You don't need to worry about that on this list (or any other list I run)
since the monthly password "reminder" feature is fully disabled.  But these
are great instructions for people to use on any lists which do send the
annoying reminders.  Mailman on this list does still send the "password" it
generates at list subscription time and if you request a password reminder.
 This is just used for people to edit their individual list preferences.

Cheers,
Fyodor
