Subject: [FD] Synergy's Crypto Sucks

Synergy is a cross-platform mouse and keyboard sharing tool.

    http://synergy-foss.org/

Last year I wrote a tool that decrypted Synergy's horrible encryption.

Article: https://defuse.ca/cracking-synergy-bad-cryptography.htm
Code:    https://github.com/defuse/synergy-crack

To fix it, they just disabled the stream cipher modes, which breaks my
specific attack but doesn't fix the actual problem. I'm confident that
it's still vulnerable to some type of attack.

Don't use their crypto. Keep SSH tunneling.
