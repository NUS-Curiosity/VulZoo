Subject: [FD] DoS condition mt-daapd/Firefly Media Server 0.2.4.2

Hi All,

I don't have much more on this other than I have a installation of
Firefly 0.2.4.2 on a Drobo5N(available for download on all drobo
dashboards currently) and every time it mt-daapd indexes the linked
mp3 "05 Everybody.mp3" it stalls and then exits.

MP3 for download

I'm putting it up here as I don't have the time to tear it apart and
thought someone would enjoy it.

Enjoy,
-Eric.
