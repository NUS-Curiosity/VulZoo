The Heartbleed Challenge was solved, so no more mistery about the
possibility of private key compromise.

The Heartbleed Challenge
Can you steal the keys from this server?
Has the challenge been solved yet? YES
So far, two people have independently solved the Heartbleed Challenge.
The first was submitted at 4:22:01PST by Fedor Indutny (@indutny). He sent
at least 2.5 million requests over the span of the challenge, this was
approximately 30% of all the requests we saw. The second was submitted at
5:12:19PST by Illkka Mattila of NCSC-FI using around 100 thousand requests.
We confirmed that both of these individuals have the private key and that
it was obtained through Heartbleed exploits. We rebooted the server at
3:08PST, which may have contributed to the key being available in memory,
but we can't be certain.
