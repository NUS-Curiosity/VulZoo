Stefan, you're actually suggesting the ATM market dictate banking
security policy (and the budget for it)?

The banks are the ones ordering the machines they see fit for their
chosen model of security, and are coincidentally the same bunch of
critters actually defining those models. Which, in regards to for
example PCI-DSS is something the ATM manufacturers has to comply with,
as far as i know. 

Correct me if I'm wrong about that ecosystem.
