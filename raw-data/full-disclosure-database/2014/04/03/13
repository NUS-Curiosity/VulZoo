FYI: the email address is infosec@...interactive.com. Also, their
responsible disclosure policy discourages responsible disclosure:
"CBS Responsible Disclosure Guidelines Thank you for your interest in
keeping CBS systems, websites and applications secure.  Please inform
us immediately regarding any suspected vulnerabilities by emailing the
CBS Information Security Group at security.incidents@....com. Allow a
reasonable time for us to investigate your findings and to take
appropriate steps to remediate any related issues. While we welcome
your assistance in identifying potential issues please note that any
individuals who compromise or degrade our information or systems in
any way will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
