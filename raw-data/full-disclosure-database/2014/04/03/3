Vulnerability Report


Author: Justin C. Klein Keane <justin@...irish.net>
Reported: 19 Feb, 2014


Description of Vulnerability:
- -----------------------------
Drupal (http://drupal.org) is a robust content management system (CMS)
written in PHP and MySQL.  The Custom Search module "alters the default
search box in many ways. If you need to have options available like in
advanced search, but directly in the search box, this module is for
you."  The Drupal Custom Search module
(https://drupal.org/project/custom_search) contains a persistent cross
site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the fact that it fails to
sanitize filter labels before display.


Systems affected:
- -----------------
Drupal 7.26 with Custom Search 7.x-1.13 was tested and shown to be
vulnerable


Impact
- ------
Users can inject arbitrary HTML (including JavaScript) in order to
attack site users, including administrative users.  This could lead to
account compromise, which could in turn lead to web server compromise,
or expose administrative users to client side malware attacks.


Mitigating factors:
- -------------------
In order to inject arbitrary script malicious users must have the
ability "administer custom search."


Proof of Concept Exploits:
- -----------------
1.  Install and enable the Custom Search module
2.  Navigate the Custom Search configuration at
?q=admin/config/search/custom_search/results
3.  Change the 'Position' drop down to 'Above results'
4.  Enter "<script>alert('xss');</script>" in the 'Label text' input
field
5.  Click the 'Save Configuration' button
6.  Submit any search to view the JavaScript on the results page.


Vendor response:
- ----------------
Vulnerability is fixed in the latest versions of the Custom Search
module (ref https://drupal.org/node/2231665)
