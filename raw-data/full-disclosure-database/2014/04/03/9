Sad, but true. I doubt they have the hacking insurance, though.

There's a reason US banks suffer losses at a rate of 600x that of a
German bank. For the discussion, see Gutmann's Engineering Security,
page 542 (www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/book.pdfâ€Ž).

I'm amazed that the losses get passed onto shared holders, and then
executives give themselves a bonus for a job well done.
