Hi,

I agree. But it's not _one_ bank that has to say, it's more of them.
Because they would have to pay more for the "secure" ATM (development,
testing anyone?) and they have to wait a bit. That's completely doable. 

But: In the end it's the bank's customer who has to pay for it. And if
BoA charges him higher interest rates on his loan, what's he gonna do?

He just wants a simple device (like in: card in -> money out) and he
simply doesn't care about the OS.

Again, I fully agree. But as long as the customer doesn't care (he gets
his money back in case of fraud, right?) the banks won't care, too.

We won't see banks turn until the financial damages grow beyond the
costs for security. Like anywhere else in IT-security.

Yours sincerely
Stefan
