Subject: [FD] Capstone 2.1.2 released!

(Sorry, the last annoucement mail was without tittle)

Greetings,

On the occasion of Syscan 2014, we are happy to announce Capstone
disassembly framework version 2.1.2!

This stable release makes no update on the API, so bindings from version
2.1 can still be used with this new release 2.1.2 just fine.

Important changes:

- Support cross-compilation for all iDevices (iPhone/iPad/iPod).
- X86: do not print memory offset in negative form.
- Fix a bug in X86 where Capstone cannot handle some short instructions.
- Print negative numbers in range [-9, -1] without prefix 0x (Arm, Arm64,
Mips).
- Correct the SONAME setup for library versioning on Linux, *BSD & Solaris.
- Set library versioning for dylib of Mac OSX.

Source code, precompiled binaries & further details are available at
http://www.capstone-engine.org


Thanks,
Quynh
