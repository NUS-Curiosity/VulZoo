Subject: [FD] Announcing sysdig: a new open source system exploration tool

I'd like to announce a new open source project called sysdig.

http://www.sysdig.org/
https://github.com/draios/sysdig

You can use sysdig to capture system state and activity from a running 
Linux instance, then save, filter and explore. Think of it as strace + 
tcpdump + lsof.

It has a couple of nice features like a tcpdump-like filtering language 
and Lua-based scripting that I believe could provide nice value in the 
fields of incident investigation and forensics analysis, so I would love 
to hear the feedback of the list.
