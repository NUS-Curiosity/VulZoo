Basic examples, which I have personally encountered:

1) Not allowed to port scan. Some ISPs are already monitoring and warning users
in case they do port scanning, but the reason for alerting might only be that
they monitor and try to get rid of malware in their networks.
2) Not allowed to list vulnerable systems. I can't for example list all
non-updated WordPress installations with their version numbers even this
information is available to anyone.
