I did not mention this on my earlier post because it is offtopic,
but as you asked for reference here it is:

The Finnish Criminal Code sections 9 a and 9 b do contain
passwords, access codes or other corresponding information
which can be used to endanger or harm information and
communication systems.

The sections are in the translated document on pages 143 and 144.
