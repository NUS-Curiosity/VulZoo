Item 2 is kind of interesting. Can you cite a reference?

I ask because the US's DMCA has provisions for Security Testing &
Evaluation and Reverse Engineering. So we are allowed to "test" the
system (some hand waiving), but its unclear [to me] what can be done
after the testing.

The ST&E exemption is in Section 1205 (i) SECURITY TESTING. The RE
exemption is in Section 1205 (f) REVERSE ENGINEERING.

Sorry to wander off-topic...
