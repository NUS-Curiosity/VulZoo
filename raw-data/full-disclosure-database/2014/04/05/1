Subject: Re: [FD] Legality of Open Source Tools

Greetings from Finland.

I know that here it is illegal to import, manufacture, sell
or otherwise distribute such machine or software which
are designed to endanger or harm information and
communication systems.

This is stated in chapter 34 ยง 9a. Then again ยง 9b states
that it is illegal to posess machine, software and access
information into systems which you can use to endanger
or harm information and communication
systems.

Basically this means that I am not allowed to have ping,
nmap or other networking / penetration testing tools
which can be used for harm installed on my computer.
Though I am not certain if any of these computer
security laws have been used to penalize someone.

I am not certain if penetration testing tools belong to
the category of tools which are designed to endanger
or harm information and communication systems.

It's quite harsh if I could get fines or maximum of 2 years jail
for having Linux distribution with some networking tools
installed on my computer.
