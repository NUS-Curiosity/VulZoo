Sorry.

For the last message and that I forgot to include where
the chapter 34 sections 9a and 9b can be found..

They are on the following translated document of the
Finnish Criminal Code:

http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf

You can find sections 9a and 9b on pages 143 and 144.
