=== LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH - Security Advisory 2014-04-10 ===

Sitepark Information Enterprise Server (IES) - Unauthenticated Access
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Affected Versions

Issue Overview
==============
Technical Risk: high
Likelihood of Exploitation: medium
Vendor: Sitepark GmbH

Advisory URL: https://www.lsexperts.de/advisories/lse-2014-04-10.txt
Advisory Status: Public
CVE-Number: CVE-2014-3006

Issue Description
=================
While conducting a penetration test LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH
discovered that the installer of the Information Enterprise Server (IES)
was available to unauthenticated users over HTTP.

When updating from previous versions of IES, an installation form was not
disabled after installation. In this case the servlet "/ies/install" was
exposed to unauthenticated users.

By accessing the servlet at URI "/ies/install/" on an affected IES server,
an unauthenticated attacker was able to set a new password for the manager
account. Additionally sensitive information regarding the IES
installation was displayed.

Temporary Workaround and Fix
============================
LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH advises to prevent access to the
URI "/ies/install/" by configuring web servers or proxy servers accordingly.
For example using the Apache webserver a "Directory" directive would be
needed:

<Location /ies/install>
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from all
  Satisfy all
</Location>

A hotfix is available from the vendor via the automatic update functionality
for IES versions 2.9 until 2.9.6.

Impact
======
An attacker is able to learn the license key and sensitive directory names
of the IES. Additionally the password for the account "manager" can be
reset which grants full access rights with the management role.

According to the vendor this issue affects only installations that are
updated from previous versions of IES to versions 2.9 until 2.9.6.
