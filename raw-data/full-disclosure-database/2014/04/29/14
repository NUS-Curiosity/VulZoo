Although it's rarely used, WordPress does have the capability to support 
multiple levels of administrators, in which case one may have access to 
an already installed plugin, but not to install their own.

The same may be true if this plugin were installed in multiuser mode, 
although I haven't kept up on what is permitted in multiuser mode, or 
whether this plugin works in multiuser mode or not.
