Ouch... Have any details of the "encryption" been analyzed or

AOL's investigation is still underway, however, we have determined
that there was unauthorized access to information regarding a
significant number of user accounts. This information included AOL
users' email addresses, postal addresses, address book contact
information, encrypted passwords and encrypted answers to security
questions that we ask when a user resets his or her password, as well
as certain employee information...
