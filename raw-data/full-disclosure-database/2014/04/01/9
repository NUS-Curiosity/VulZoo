 Access anyone's Facebook "profile picture" in full resolution regardless of the ACL restriction

Again they need the URL.

If you have a way to determine the URL of a specific user's profile image from public info that would be a vulnerability.

Simply the ability for a user or allowed visitor to copy the URL is not.

You can determine who can see the URL in your Facebook privacy settings.

Hi,

the POC is about "anyone being able to access anyone's facebook
profile picture in full resolution" + regardless of the ACL set to
their facebook profile picture (say; even when your profile picture
permission of your facebook is set as... viewable to "only me" or
"friends" ) ...anyone can see your full resolution profile picture
even without logging on to facebook with the following method!

(Assumption: maybe if you (your ISP?) are using CDN and someone in
your ISP / region have already viewed the profile picture and as it is
already fetched locally / cached in local CDN so, other party can
access it? Does CND have IP restriction for a region / ISP ? )

Try... it works for me, Make sense ?
