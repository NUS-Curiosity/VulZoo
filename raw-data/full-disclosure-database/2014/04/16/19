I agree with you here.  It seems that Lucky13 requires much more
access and is much harder to pull off in practice.  Unless there's
new techniques out there that I haven't kept up on

This I think is a misconception, or at least overstated.  Anyone on
the same network as you can MitM you.  Anyone on the same network as
the remote end point can MitM you.  For some reason in this day and
age people have all forgotten about ARP poisoning, netbios name
poisoning, DHCP hijacking, and a whole host of other ways to redirect
traffic.  And apparently random people halfway around the world can
hijack your DNS resolver[1].

The dividing line between "internal network" and the Internet is
becoming fuzzier every day.  It is getting easier to get inside and
yet everyone still seems to run an unsegmented internal "trusted"
network.
