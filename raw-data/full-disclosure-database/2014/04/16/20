agreed, but was i meant was that the attack surface in a known, maintained
LAN is way lower than for Heartbleed where for sure straight after it
was made public zombie-botnets startet to randomly attack around the
web port 443, 993 and 995, pulling a unknown amount of data which mostly
is not analyzed now and will be used for all sorts of attacks, spamming
and so on if the found user credentials are not changed in the meantime

that hardly happens inside a closed network - even a server in the network
of a public hotspot has a limited attack surface in that context

sadly true after every random guy installs a WLAN-AP without any
thougt about security or people don't get a punch from the sysadmin
if their brother enters the company and pulls his infected notebook
straight into the next ethernet port he finds

the latter is also the fault of the admin patching every unused port

on the other side in a well managed network with a isolated guest LAN
coming with NAT and the outgoing IP restricted on the main network
as well as on the AP/Router itself there is not much room for ARP
spoofing or DHCP hijacking, even cheap WLAN routers support blocking
traffic between the client stations
