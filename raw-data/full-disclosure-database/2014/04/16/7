Subject: Re: [FD] Audit: don't only focus on heartbleed issue

Are there actually any real-world attack scenarios for BEAST, CRIME, or
Lucky-thirteen?

Heartbleed has been used in actual legitimate attacks, but those earlier
attacks all seem pretty tame in comparison. Worth fixing, of course, but
they don't seem *as* critical to me.
