I'd really like to hear some arguments to back that claim.
Basically, Lucky13 is a protocol problem and thus the fix is a bit less
obvious than for heartbleed.

But appart from that: Lucky thirteen only poses a threat if you can
capture insane amounts of the same data encrypted. I never saw any
scenario where I thought this is really a practical threat.
"Getting the private key and other random stuff from Server's memory"
definitely is.

I am all for fixing things like BEAST and Lucky13 and I hope we can
soon all switch to either AES-GCM or AES-CBC with the hopefully soon
released Encrypt-then-MAC extension. But we should keep perspectives:
Heartbleed is a big problem, Lucky Thirteen is minor in comparison.
