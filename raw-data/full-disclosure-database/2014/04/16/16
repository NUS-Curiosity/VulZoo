Subject: Re: [FD] Audit: don't only focus on heartbleed issue

The fact that for BEAST, CRIME and LT there is not a fully implemented
and *public* PoC, doesn't mean
that those attack were/are not critical.

They were very critical when they came out, and involved more trickery
than Heartbleed to work.

I guess you can find full PoC implementations if you search hard ;-)
