Downgraded and tested again.
Testing Tor with ssltest.py shows successful SSL connection and no
response to the heartbeat request, reports not vulnerable.
Testing OpenVPN - TCP connection OK, SSL connection fails, server
reports MTU discrepancy. Complaining that a 277 byte frame does not have
a length between 0 and 1559 - possibly not vulnerable.
Apache, Postfix and Courier instances were all vulnerable.

I used the tool Kirils linked (http://possible.lv/tools/hb/) and my
unpatched servers running a Tor node or an Openvpn server returned
correct (old) version of openssl but not vulnerable.
Is it the bug or the tool that seems to be limited to https I wonder?

Patched now so can't test with this tool...

This seems to be the best test so far:

http://s3.jspenguin.org/ssltest.py

Other tests false-positive on patched versions from what I can see.
