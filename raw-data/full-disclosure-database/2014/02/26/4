   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-025
   * Project: Open Omega [1] (third-party theme)
   * Version: 7.x
   * Date: 2014-February-26
   * Security risk: Less critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This theme is a sub theme of omega used as as a sample theme for the open
Public Distribution.

The theme doesn't sufficiently check the users menu access when building the
header and footer menus, so that it can expose the title and path of
restricted items in the menu.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that that it is only present when
this menu has items with restricted access that differ by role.
