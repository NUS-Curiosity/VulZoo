Subject: CVE-2014-1220 - Disclosure Of Database
	Credentials in IT2 Workstation

Vulnerability title: Disclosure Of Database Credentials in IT2 Workstation
CVE: CVE-2014-1220
Vendor: IT2
Product: Workstation
Affected version: 7.212
Fixed version: N/A
Reported by: Alejo Murillo Moya

Details:

IT2 Workstation 7.212, and potentially earlier versions have a design
issue that discloses the database credentials during the application
start-up process (before authentication).


During the binary client initialization, the database password is being
disclosed to the client (using Windows named pipes). Any user with
access to that named pipe will obtain the database password, and
potentially the database credentials, as the default credentials are
hard-coded in the binary.
