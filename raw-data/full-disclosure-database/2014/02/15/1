Subject: CVE-2013-1643 - Unauthorised Access To Other
 Users Email Messages in Symantec PGP Universal Web Messenger

Vulnerability title: Unauthorised Access To Other Users Email Messages
in Symantec PGP Universal Web Messenger
CVE: CVE-2013-1643
Vendor: Symantec
Product: PGP Universal Web Messenger
Affected version: All Prior to 3.3.2
Fixed version: 3.3.2
Reported by: Richard O'Donnell

Details:

Authenticated Web Messenger users are able to view other users email
messages, by following these steps:


1) Log into the Web Messenger console
2) View the list of sent emails
3) Click on any of the sent emails
4) Click on the `Print' option and then copy the URL from the page that
appears.


The URL will look similar to this:
   
https://x.x.x.x/b/ps.e?sid=BoomerangMail:72e56j3a-a3r6-5d43-6ef4-aae9c23422ca&showScrollbars=true&dialogId=SentPrintableView1747635619&OWASP_CSRFTOKEN=M22N-J4L3-R3T2-P1AZ-TP1Q-TEFG-IUGH-N6EF


5) Using this URL, brute-force the following part of the `sid' parameter:

    72e56j3a-a3r6-5d43-6ef4-aae9c23422ca


6) Upon identifying a valid value, access to the corresponding email
message will be obtained.


Although there is a risk of obtaining unauthorised access to another
users email, the likelihood of successfully brute-forcing a correct
`sid' value is considered low, due to its complexity.


It is also noted that encryption of messages was not enabled when this
issue was identified and no additional testing was performed with this
option enabled.
