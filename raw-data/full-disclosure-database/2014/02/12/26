	Access Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2194639

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-015
   * Project: FileField [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 6.x
   * Date: 2014-02-12
   * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

FileField module allows users to upload files with in conjunction with the
Content Construction Kit (CCK) module in Drupal 6.

The module doesn't sufficiently check permissions on revisions when
determining if a user should have access to a particular file attached to
that revision. A user could gain access to private files attached to
revisions when they don't have access to the corresponding revision.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have access
to upload files through FileField module while creating content, and the site
must be using a non-core workflow module that allows users to create
unpublished revisions of content.
