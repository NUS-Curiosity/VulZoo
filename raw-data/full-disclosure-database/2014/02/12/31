-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to add social sharing widgets to your content and
pages.
The module doesn't sufficiently validate block titles when a user creates a
custom block from within the module's admin interface.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer easy social".
