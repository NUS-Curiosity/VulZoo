Subject: Barracuda Load Balancer Remote Authenticated Root

liek hey guyz

I found this and don't know what to do with it, so here you go. Needs
admin creds.

An admin can run commands on Barracuda Load Balancers by using a
specially crafted NTP server. These are run in the context of the root user.

Tested against 4.2.2.007 340-series VM.
