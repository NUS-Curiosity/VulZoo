Subject: Re: DoS via tables corruption in WordPress

Hello.

After reading the original 2009'th post
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3152), in the last paragraph the author
says that it is possible(in Wordpress 2.0.x) to corrupt wp_users table
by automatically registering multiple accounts, so I think the problem
is to be found there.

Just a small reminder, youtube has lot's of "proof" for unbelievers of
all sorts including water to wine, ddosing by ping, etc, but in my
opinion, the POC code is normally used to show the proof in security
communities.

Have a nice day.
