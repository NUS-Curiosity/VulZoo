	Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2194671

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-018
   * Project: Webform [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 6.x, 7.x
   * Date: 2014-February-12
   * Security risk: Critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

The Webform module enables you to create forms which can be used for surveys,
contact forms or other data collection throughout your site.

The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize field label titles when two fields
have the same form_key, which can only be managed by carefully crafting the
webform structure via a specific set of circumstances.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "create webform content".
