	suite (ctools) -	Access Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2194589

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-013
   * Project: Chaos tool suite (ctools) [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 6.x, 7.x
   * Date: 2014-02-12
   * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module provides content editors with an autocomplete callback for entity
titles, as well as an ability to embed content within the Chaos tool suite
(ctools) framework.

Prior to this version, ctools did not sufficiently check access grants for
various types of content other than nodes. It also didn't sufficiently check
access before displaying content with the relationship plugin.

These vulnerabilities are mitigated by the fact that you must be using
entities other than node or users for the autocomplete callback, or you must
be using the relationship plugin and displaying the content (e.g. in panels).


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

   * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

   * Chaos tool suite (ctools) 6.x-1.x versions prior to 6.x-1.11.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Chaos tool
suite (ctools) [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.
