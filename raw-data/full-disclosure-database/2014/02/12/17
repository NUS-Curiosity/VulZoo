Subject: CVE-2014-1219 - Unauthenticated Privilege
	Escalation in CA 2E Web Option

Vulnerability title: Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation in CA 2E Web
Option

CVE: CVE-2014-1219
Vendor: CA
Product: 2E Web Option
Affected version: 8.1.2
Fixed version: N/A
Reported by: Mike Emery

Details:

        CA 2E Web Option (r8.1.2) and potentially others, is vulnerable
to unauthenticated privilege escalation via a predictable session token.
The POST parameter session token W2E_SSNID appears as follows:

W2E_SSNID=W90NIxGoSsN1023ZYW2E735182000013CLSpKfgkCJSLKsc600061JKenjKnED
JuNX9GoVjCEbqIuKh6kFRvbzYnUxgQtONszJldyAar3LtTSwsmBLpdlPc5iDH4Zf75


        However, this token is poorly validated, leading to

W2E_SSNID=W90NIxGoSsN1023ZYW2E735182000013

        being accepted as a valid session. By incrementing and
decrementing the digits at the end of the value given above, it is
possible to control the session at the given ID. This token is sent as
part of the login page, and as such, can be manipulated by an
unauthenticated attacker, giving them access to any valid session.
Consequentially, it is possible to access the following page as such:

https://app.domain.co.uk/web2edoc/close.htm?SSNID=W90NIxGoSsN1023ZYW2E73
5182000026

        Ending the session specified, which could lead to a denial of
service condition.
