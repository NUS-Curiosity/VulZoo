	Commons - Cross Site	Scripting (XSS)

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2194877

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-020
   * Project: Drupal Commons [1] (third-party distribution)
   * Version: 7.x
   * Date: 2014-02-12
   * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

Drupal Commons is a ready-to-use solution for building either internal or
external communities. It provides a complete social business software
solution for organizations. Drupal Commons displays an "activity stream"
containing messages about actions users take on the site.

In some cases, messages about content creation are not properly sanitized,
leading to cross site scripting in those messages.

The vulnerability is mitigated in that only certain kinds of activity stream
messages are affected, and not all arbitrary script can be executed.

     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./
