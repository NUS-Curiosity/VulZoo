Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2014-017- Image Resize
	Filter - Denial	of Service (DOS)

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2194655

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-017
   * Project: Image Resize Filter [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 6.x, 7.x
   * Date: 2014-February-12
   * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Denial of Service (DOS)

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to resize images based on the HTML contents of a
post. Images with specified height and width properties that differ from the
original image result in a resized image being created.

The module doesn't limit the number of resized images per post or user, which
could allow a user to post a large number of images that need to be resized
within a single piece of content. This could cause the server to become
overwhelmed by requests to resize images.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
that allows them to post content that utilizes the image resize filter.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED

     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./
