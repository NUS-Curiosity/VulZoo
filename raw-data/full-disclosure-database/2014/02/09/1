Justin - I think we're all pretty tired of your lack of maturity. 
There's a reason why you're no longer at IOActive, and I think its
about time everyone knew the real you.  Doing a Google search on you
turned up quite a bit of interesting information, including this dox
on you by the people you burned a few years back when you were trying
to become a member of Anonymous with all your conspiracy theories:

Oh, and I think we will all get a kick out of your photos:
