Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Deutsche Telekom AG (English: German Telecom) is a German telecommunications company headquartered in Bonn, 
North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Deutsche Telekom was formed in 1996 as the former state-owned monopoly

Deutsche Telekom (German Telecom)
Product: Profil Bild Online Service - Web Application 2014 Q1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An arbitrary file upload web vulnerability has been discovered in the official German Telecom Profile Picture tool website web application.
The web vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload an arbitrary (malicious) file to compromise the dbms, website or web-server system. 

The arbitrary file upload vulnerability is located in `/scripts/php/process.php` file. After executing the query through the process.php 
page, the query result can be seen from `/scripts/php/downloadImage.php`. Remote attackers are able to manipulate the POST method request 
with of the process.php file to upload unauhorized own malicious files. 

Exploitation of the remote web vulnerability requires no user interaction and also no privileged web application user account.
Successful exploitation of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability results in web-server, web module, website or dbms compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):

				[+] profilbildtool
Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] /scripts/php/process.php


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The arbitrary file upload vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account 
and without required user inter action. For security demonstration or to reproduce the web vulnerability follow the provided 
information and steps below.

a) The attacker should visit the main page 
    http://profilbildtool.telekom.de/imagecropper.php?lang=en to create an image using the system
b) In Choose network section: Twitter can be chosen as our network
c) In Type of activity: 
    1) "Official use" radio button should be used
2) "Lead accounts" from the dropdown menu
3) The country should be chosen is "Austria AT"
4) in Select Logo: "T-Systems" should be used 
d) Types of background
1) Choose "Picture" for background 
2) Browse and choose a specially crafted php or exe file. For example, we will use test.php
3) Press upload
    At this point we should intercept the request and change
        
Content-Type: text/php to Content-Type: image/jpeg 
        
This will help us to bypass the type checking on the server Side
       
The other constraint is the size of the file, We can change this by generating a specially crafted php file where 
the php code is in the EXIF section of the file. By this, the file will run as php correctly once its extension is php.

Our request will be similiar to this ...

POST /scripts/php/process.php HTTP/1.1

662283032583176423330776453
Content-Disposition: 
form-data; name="upImg"; filename="test.php"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

[The file content] 

It should has the header of an image to bypass the type checking also 
The response of this file request will be similiar to 

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0

Connection: Keep-Alive
<img src="../../tmp/thmb_aef0de6638bc51419334299c100bb095.php" />

The extension of the uploaded file depends on the extension in the name of our file.
This gives us the ability to upload any file type we want to upload.



Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability is estimated as high(+).
