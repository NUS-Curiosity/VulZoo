 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:031
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : drupal
 Date    : February 14, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple security issues was identified and fixed in drupal:
 
 The OpenID module in Drupal 6.x before 6.30 and 7.x before 7.26 allows
 remote OpenID users to authenticate as other users via unspecified
 vectors (CVE-2014-1475).
 
 The Taxonomy module in Drupal 7.x before 7.26, when upgraded from
 an earlier version of Drupal, does not properly restrict access to
 unpublished content, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain
 sensitive information via a listing page (CVE-2014-1476).
 
 The updated packages has been upgraded to the 7.26 version which is
 unaffected by these security flaws.
