Subject: CVE-2014-1610 description incorrect

http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-1610

It states that authentication is required to exploit this and this is not
true.

What does require authentication usually is uploading the file. If there is
already a djvu file that has been uploaded by another user, you do not need
authentication to exploit this.

I believe this should be revised as the exploit itself does not require
authentication. I think that will also result in a score change as well.
