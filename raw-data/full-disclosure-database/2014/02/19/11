Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IPS Software

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20140219-ips

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2014 February 19 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities:

    Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Cisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Cisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability

The Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability and the Cisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process to become unresponsive or crash. When this occurs, the Cisco IPS will stop inspecting traffic.

The Cisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the MainApp process to become unresponsive and prevent it from executing several tasks including alert notification, event store management, and sensor authentication. The Cisco IPS web server will also be unavailable while the MainApp process is unresponsive, and other processes such as the Analysis Engine process may not work properly.
 
Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate some of the vulnerabilities are available. This advisory is available at the following link:
