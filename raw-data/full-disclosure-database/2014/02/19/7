 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:042
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : tomcat6
 Date    : February 19, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated tomcat6 packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled certain requests
 submitted using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could
 use this flaw to cause the Tomcat server to stop responding, resulting
 in a denial of service (CVE-2012-3544).
 
 A frame injection in the Javadoc component in Oracle Java SE 7
 Update 21 and earlier, 6 Update 45 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 45
 and earlier; JavaFX 2.2.21 and earlier; and OpenJDK 7 allows remote
 attackers to affect integrity via unknown vectors related to Javadoc
 (CVE-2013-1571).
 
 A flaw was found in the way the tomcat6 init script handled the
 tomcat6-initd.log log file. A malicious web application deployed on
 Tomcat could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to change
 the ownership of an arbitrary system file to that of the tomcat user,
 allowing them to escalate their privileges to root (CVE-2013-1976).
 
 It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled certain
 authentication requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this
 flaw to inject a request that would get executed with a victim&#039;s
 credentials (CVE-2013-2067).
 
 Note: With this update, tomcat6-initd.log has been moved from
 /var/log/tomcat6/ to the /var/log/ directory.
