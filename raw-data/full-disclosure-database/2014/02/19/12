Summary
=======

A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take complete control of the affected device.

The vulnerability is due to a default root user account created during installation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the server command-line interface (CLI) remotely using the default account credentials. An exploit could allow the attacker to log in with the default credentials, which provide full administrative rights to the system.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
