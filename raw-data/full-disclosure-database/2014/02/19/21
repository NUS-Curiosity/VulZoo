GrrCON 2014 Call For Papers is open. 

The CFP will close by June 1, but likely MUCH earlier if we fill all
available slots. We will give priority consideration to any we receive
before May 1 as this helps us set our schedule early to the benefit of
speakers and attendees. We keep GrrCON small at around 1,000 attendance
to allow us to provide those things other events leave out.

•50 or 25 minute talks
•Dynamic and interesting speakers. If you plan to kill people with
terrible, unreadable slides go to SecurePlanet whatever conference…
•Topics of interest to Hackers & Information Security professionals.
•No sales pitches 

What do you get?

•Speaker Badge with VIP access 
•Invitation to Speaker dinner on Oct 15th 
•Bragging rights… to nobody who cares
•Our undying love
•Small honorarium (50 minute talks)
•We do not typically pay for travel. If you think you are worth it,
let us know. we’ll decide

What is GrrCON?

GrrCON is an information security and hacking conference put together to
provide the community with a venue to come together and share ideas,
information, solutions, forge relationships, and most importantly engage
with like minded people in a fun atmosphere without all the elitist
“Diva” nonsense. 

We provide three+ presentation tracks, CHEAP workshops & training, and
more. 
And yes, free food & beer.
