Subject: Re: A question for the list - WordPress plugin
 inspections

Hi Seth,

There really isn't time for us to do that, in the context of an 
inspection. It's a very light-touch assessment.

When we find vulnerabilities we do also report those, after working with 
the vendor. And they are more detailed. For example:

https://security.dxw.com/advisories/moving-any-file-php-user-has-access-to-in-bp-group-documents-1-2-1/
