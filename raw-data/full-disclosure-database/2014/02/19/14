Subject: A question for the list - WordPress plugin
	inspections

Hello list,

We write and publish light-touch inspections of WordPress plugins that 
we do for our clients. They are just a guide - we conduct some basic 
checks, not a thorough review.

Would plugins which fail this inspection be of general interest to the 
list and therefore worth posting, as we would a vulnerability?

Here's an example report:

Grateful for a steer...

Harry
