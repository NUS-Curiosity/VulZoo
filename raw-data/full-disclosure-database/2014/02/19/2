Package        : libtar
Vulnerability  : directory traversal
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4420
Debian Bug     : 731860

A directory traversal attack was reported against libtar, a C library for
manipulating tar archives. The application does not validate the
filenames inside the tar archive, allowing to extract files in arbitrary
path. An attacker can craft a tar file to override files beyond the
tar_extract_glob and tar_extract_all prefix parameter.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.11-6+deb6u2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.16-1+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.20-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtar packages.
