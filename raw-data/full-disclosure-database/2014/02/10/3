Subject: Re: DoS via tables corruption in WordPress

I have a similar frustration. We operate a lot of WordPress sites and 
our clients value us, in part, because of our good security posture.

As such your emails always catch my attention and I always read them 
promptly. But I often find a lack of detail that allows me to understand 
whether they're issues that need me to take action, or just stuff it's 
interesting to be aware of.

It would be useful if you could include steps to replicate the issues 
you find.
