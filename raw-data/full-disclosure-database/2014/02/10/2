Subject: Re: DoS via tables corruption in WordPress

Hi,

In none of your papers you document (in english) how you manage to
produce a table corruption in mysql, let alone from the web layers. I
still think that's possible because I experienced it on my own wordpress
+ mysql (had to do a manual repair), be it from an accident or your own
exploit.

Don't you think that's a bug in mysql itself ? Being able to corrupt
tables using basic SQL statements like insert and select should not be
possible.

Thanks,

Aris
