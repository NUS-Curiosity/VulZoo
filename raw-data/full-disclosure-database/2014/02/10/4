Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1477 CVE-2014-1479 CVE-2014-1481 CVE-2014-1482 
                 CVE-2014-1486 CVE-2014-1487 CVE-2014-1490 CVE-2014-1491

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors, 
use-after-frees, too-verbose error messages and missing permission checks
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security 
checks or information disclosure. This update also addresses security 
issues in the bundled version of the NSS crypto library.

This update updates Iceweasel to the ESR24 series of Firefox.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
