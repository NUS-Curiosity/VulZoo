 Start NEW CONFERENCE DATES!

Hey all, again. 
It has come to our attention that our conference dates again collided with the dates of the UK conference 44CON. So out of our infinite wisdome and kindness to everyone in our business we have decided to make a tear in space-time and move our previously unmovable dates one week into the future.

This years SEC-T Conference will therefore be held on the 18-19:th of September. We would like to thank everyone in advance for the overwhelming gratitude you undoubtedly will show us for this. ;) 

So if you are interested in that trip to the lovely city of Stockholm, Sweden to speak at one of the loveliest one-track security cons out there... well it's time to bring on your papers and speaker submissions.
 
The SEC-T conference is an information security conference strongly rooted in the technical realm. Talks on technical subjects with no applicability to information security are admissible as long as they are cool!
 
Speaker slots are either 20 or 60 minutes long so please indicate length of your presentation in your submission. 60 minute talks are preferred but we don’t mind seeing that you submit for both if you can. We will allow additional time for audience questions if needed. Talks that actively engage the audience to participate are preferred. Every submission will be considered and we will judge each proposal by its content and not the name attached. Proposals should include a description of the talk contents and what attendees will learn from it. The paper, talk and material must be presented in English and you must be able to hold your talk on the 18:th or 19:th of September 2014 at the conference venue in Stockholm, Sweden.
 
If your talk is accepted, the SEC-T conference will arrange or help you arrange and pay for travels between your location and the venue as well as provide you with accommodations during the conference.
 
The speakers are also eligible for two separate €1000 prices; one for best submitted paper and one for most popular talk given at SEC-T 2014
 
The deadline for submissions and participation in the contest for best submitted paper is August 1:st 2014, unless you have a really good excuse for being late (settled by popular opinion). The SEC-T speakers committee will vote on and accept incoming presentations and announce speakers that are accepted continuously during the call for papers period so submitting your abstract early is encouraged.

Sincerely,
