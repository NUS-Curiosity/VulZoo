Subject: DAVOSET v.1.1.7

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. At 13th of February DAVOSET v.1.1.7
was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/). This is New Hope Edition.

In new version there were added new services into full list of zombies,
added support of hours in timer and improved support of plugin Google Maps
3. About vulnerabilities in Google Maps plugin for Joomla I wrote many times
for last two years.

In total there are 151 zombie-services in the list, which are ready to
strike against ill-intentioned regime.

Best wishes & regards,
