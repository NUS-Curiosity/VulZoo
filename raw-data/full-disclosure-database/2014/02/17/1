Subject: Shopify (Bug Bounty) - XML External Entity
	Vulnerability

Shopify suffered from an XXE attack within their online stores domain - 
*.myshopify.com

They were extremely quick in confirming and fixing the issue (even 
though it was a Sunday).

Full details with the usual screen shots can be found at
