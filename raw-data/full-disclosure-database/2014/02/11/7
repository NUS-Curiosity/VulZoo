This happened again last night. The mysql corruption was caused by an
OOM random kill (thanks linux) that chose mysql daemon as a victim. The
cause of the OOM was either wordpress or piwik, probably made possible
through apache misconfiguration (too many children). I have yet to
determine if that was an accident or an attack.

If Mustlive has any real and concrete information (URL, exploit code),
please share with us.
