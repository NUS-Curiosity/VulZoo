	Information	Disclosure

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2187453

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-009
   * Project: Tagadelic [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 6.x
   * Date: 2014-February-05
   * Security risk: Less critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Information Disclosure

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module provides an API and a few simple turnkey modules, which allows
you to easily create tagclouds, weighted lists, search-clouds and such.

The 6.x-1.x version does not account for node access modules, thus leading to
information being disclosed.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a site must be using a node
access module.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

   * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

   * Tagadelic 6.x-1.x versions.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Tagadelic [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Tagadelic module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to Tagadelic 6.x-1.5
[5] and then disable node access modules, such as taxonomy_access and
content_access.

Also see the Tagadelic [6] project page.
