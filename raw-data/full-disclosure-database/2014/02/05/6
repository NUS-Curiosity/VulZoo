Whilst you may be correct, Securatary is working toward the reason why 
it exists in the first place - Crowd Sourcing - 
http://www.securatary.com/PPPs/Pentester-Info.  With this in mind, 
making user registration an easy and no hassle process was the reason to 
include these social log in features as an OPTION.  Since March last 
year I have been trying to get investment to get it up and running but 
no such luck as of yet.

Anyway, that is the reason for these log in options.  Using these are at 
the users discretion so I see no need to pull them down and to be 
honest, its my website, I would not dream of telling you (strongly 
recommend) what to do with yours.

Thanks

Mark
