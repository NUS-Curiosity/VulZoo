-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

The Services module enables you to expose an API to third party systems using
REST, XML-RPC or other protocols.

.... User update access bypass vulnerability

An authenticated user is able to assign additional roles to themselves, which
means they can escalate their privileges by assigning an administrative role.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the user must be able to log
in on the site, the update operation on the user resource configuration must
be enabled, and a site must have an role with more permissions than the
authenticated user.

.... Comment access bypass vulnerability

As an authenticated user an attacker with the permission to post comments is
able to update other users' comments.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the update operation on the
comment resource configuration must be enabled.
