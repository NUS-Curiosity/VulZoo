Let me check.  Normal registration should also be available ? Infact I 
will remove the registration.

The purpose of this whole registration in the first place was to allow 
for future postings I am going to make later this week that would only 
be available to registered users.  Not necessarily vulnerabilities, but 
useful "stuff" for pentesting.  Also all registered users would be given 
a 48 hours head start on any new vulnerabilities that I post in the future.

All the best
