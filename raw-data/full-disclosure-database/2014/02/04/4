Subject: [CVE-2014-1860] PHP object insertion / possible
	RCE in Contao CMS <= 3.2.4

Hi,

I have discovered a vulnerability that might lead to code execution in
Contao CMS <= 3.2.4
Contao CMS <= 3.2.4 does not properly validate user input in several
locations which is then passed directly into PHP's unserialize.

This has been fixed in Contao 3.2.5 as per commit:
https://github.com/contao/core/commit/8c9cb044bdc887a8202bb65a64545c025664f957
and
https://github.com/contao/core/commit/1717336598fdcf1ed3f4ad488e140147cb31516d

Announcements can be found at

Thanks to the Contao developers for being so responsive.
The full report can be found at my repo in
