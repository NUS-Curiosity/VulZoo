Subject: [CVE-2014-1836] Arbitrary file deletion in
 ImpressCMS < 1.3.6 and two XSS issues

Hi,

I have discovered two vulnerabilities in ImpressCMS. These have been
fixed in the new 1.3.6 version, which you can get at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/impresscms/files/ImpressCMS%20Official%20Releases/ImpressCMS%201.3%20Branch/ImpressCMS%201.3.6/.

One is an arbitrary file deletion and the other is two cross site
scripting issues.
Note that I was unable to exploit the XSS issues due to the inbuilt
protection module, but someone smarter / with more time might be able
to do it.

The tickets containing the information are available here
https://www.assembla.com/spaces/dW4voyNP0r4ldbeJe5cbLr/tickets?report%5Bestimate_show%5D=true&report%5Bid%5D=0&report%5Bmilestone_id_cond%5D=1&report%5Bmilestone_id_val%5D=4129593&report%5Btitle%5D=All+Tickets+for+%27ImpressCMS+1.3.6%27&report%5Btotal_estimate_show%5D=true&report%5Btotal_invested_hours_show%5D=true&report%5Bworking_hours_show%5D=true.

Thanks in advance, and thanks to the ImpressCMS team for being so responsive.
