Subject: Ektron CMS TakeOver Part (2) -
	PaylPal-Forward.com demonstration

As previously stated, I would post an update for Ektron CMS bypassing 
the security fix.

A full step by step with the usual screen shots can be found at - 
http://www.securatary.com/vulnerabilities

In this example, we use www.paypal-forward.com as a demonstration site.  
I would like to say that PayPal fixed this issue with their own 
workaround extremely quickly.  Excellent work by their security / dev team.

All the best
