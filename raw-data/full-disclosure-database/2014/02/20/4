Subject: Re: A question for the list - WordPress plugin
	inspections

It is valuable
I concur (# line of code, file names and CVE submission).

I would also suggest to use common classifications (or a mapping) such
as OWASP TOP10, WASC, CWE (CAPEC) for your criterias.

Providing details regarding the methodology or/and tools used for the
assessment would be also valuable.
(i.e. Checklist, RIPS,

Thank you
Best regards
