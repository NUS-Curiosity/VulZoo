People behind plugins@...dpress.org can help you with coordination. They can
also disable plugins so that there won't be new installations before maintainer
fixes issues. Note that security@ address should not be contacted when dealing
with plugin issues. It is important to get vulnerabilities fixed in upstream
codebase. I can also help you with communication, verification and such in my
own time.
