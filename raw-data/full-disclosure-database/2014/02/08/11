feel free to try it yourself, probably takes less time than you know,
reading policies they quite obviously bend. I mean, seriously, this is
on the first page of hits:
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_iETEKI6kCkJ:www.sharkonline.org/index.php/take-action/contact-corporate-sponsors/1332-get-bank-of-the-west-out-of-rodeo+&cd=12&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us

This is on the second:
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:h1khHCwhgBQJ:leasingnews.org/PDF/Email_Capitalwerks.pdf+&cd=19&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us

et cetera, but hey, cool story bro.
