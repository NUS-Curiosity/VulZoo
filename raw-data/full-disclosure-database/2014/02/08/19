Oh noes. Owasp guy wants to admonish me.

And yes, I called your "local data at rest is not encrypted despite there
being no way to secure a key unless you think the subway app deserves it's
own password" bullshit because well it was bullshit. I was at least
respectful enough to tell you that it was bullshit clogging my inbox
privately instead of pulling some imaginary weight on the n3td3v all stars
mailing list.

There is nothing professional about F-D. But yes, from time to time when I
happen to read particularly absurd piles of crap sent to me, I do respond
by saying "this is a giant pile of crap". In all earnest if you Google a
bit, this is pretty tame, I've not once saw fit to include a picture of my
bare backside.

At any rate, I appreciate your maternal behavior, what the world needs is
more CISSP-esque discussion on professional behavior on the internet. I'm
fairly positive that at this point, anyone whose opinion I care about is
well aware that I am at times outspoken, and the rest (*@...sp.com) are
irrelevant.

You have to be polite to random people who don't deserve it, such is life
with subway app bug finders.

Sincerely,

Justin N. Ferguson I
