And to call woody on his claim of my trolling him, here's the text there.
The entire thread was four emails long, inclusive of his original post.

Apparently if you say "fuck" the owasp nanny police gets butthurt.

No, it's a bullshit bug. PCI doesn't regulate how the data is stored
on consumer devices, perhaps *you* should read it instead of web 2.0
drone blather. What are you going to have them do, encrypt it and
where the fuck are you storing the key? Oh great, so now I need to
have a password for all of my 34324234324 apps? or I need to give my
apps my password to a central keystore for all of my keys? ... Do you
people think or just live to see your names in psuedo e-fame lights..

The problem isnt OWASP, its that its brought on an apocalypse of
retarded people working in security and validated them and insanely
stupid bugs like yours. Funny you should reference common sense here.

The hack doesn't even make sense. Stay tuned.

EULA dope.

BREAKING: your computer stores sensitive data and you cannot store
other sensitive data (crypto keys) next to the sensitive data it
stores to secure the sensitive data.

> You apparently didn't read the full disclosure details carefully enough.

Of course not, its a fucking local "bug" about data at rest being
clear text on a local device where there is really no sane way to
secure the data other than to make the entire device more insecure.
And, its a subway application, which is a clever way of saying a
crappy web-browser for people who know how to write javascript and are
too lazy to write proper HTML to work with mobile web browsers.

> really all severity ratings are subjective anyways.

The amusing part is that you saw fit to write up a fucking advisory
for it. Seriously I didn't even write up an advisory for this
http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-bugs&m=131435177207230 even though it
would've been hilarious considering the entire internet went looking
for backdoors put in by the USG in that exact code like a month
earlier.

I'm not saying your severity rating is a joke mate, I'm saying the
fucking bug is. Couldn't you be more productive and like pull apart a
banks app and audit its xml-rpc interfaces or something? ...

oh noes. subway doesnt crypto its data on local storage guy is worried
i will be voided as irrelevant by someone whom himself is ...
irrelevant and proclaims to speak for an entire industry ... Don't
worry fellah, I'm sure Jeremiah Grossman still has some VC to give out
welfare to you kids.

follow your own advice you posted (sic Neutron Star commentary). What the

was fixed by the vendor and really all severity ratings are subjective
anyways.

in a public forum, however, Intersec Worldwide has forced my hand due to
their untrue statements.
>>>
>>> I never signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement with Intersec Worldwide when
I started my contracting work for them.  Now that?s not to say I am going
to start publishing all the vulnerabilities of their clients, far from it.
 I am stating this because prior to this email going out, I was called by
Jeff Tutton the ?CISO? about the matter.  We talked briefly for about 10
minutes on Wednesday, December 11, 2013.  During this phone call I
mentioned the fact that no NDA had been signed.  He said he would look into
this and work with his client on the matter regarding the vulnerability
disclosure.  I never heard back from him or anyone at Intersec Worldwide
after this.
>>>
>>> I emailed Jeff/Intersec this morning when I saw Fyodor?s post and
Mikken?s/Intersec email alleging I violated their NDA.  I gave
Jeff/Intersec until EOB today to provide the original email with the signed
NDA I sent to them, however, I have yet to receive this.  I asked for a
copy of the allegedly signed NDA last week as well.  Failure to provide a
legitimate copy of my sent email with a signed NDA proves to me that they
forgot to have me sign an NDA.  I should not be held liable for a lapse in
their own processes.  If they are able to come up with a legitimate copy of
the signed NDA and email with legitimate email headers - I will gracefully
apologize?which won?t occur since I did not sign such a document.  In this
email, I also informed Jeff that I am terminating my 1099/contractor
agreement with Intersec Worldwide effective immediately.
>>>
>>> Due to the mention of legal action in their email, I have now retained
the services of an attorney and will be ready to see this matter to a
close.  Instead of focusing on the fact that information was disclosed
after they had 6+ months to fix the vulnerability, they should be focusing
on the positive aspect that they were able to fix the vulnerability and
that it does not affect their product?s current release version.
