Subject: Fwd: Re:  Bank of the West security contact?

For the record, while the "real bugs are hard" crowd tries to make my
private posts sound netdevish, here was my incessant trolling.

There's really no need to respond further, none of this was worth this
pretty lame attempt at character assassination.

You're on the internet, when you say really dense crap, sometimes people
say mean things.
