Hi

When Len and I created the Full-Disclosure list way back in July 2002,
we knew that we'd have our fair share of legal troubles along the way.  
We were right.  To date we've had all sorts of requests to delete 
things, requests not to delete things, and a variety of legal threats 
both valid or otherwise.  However, I always assumed that the turning 
point would be a sweeping request for large-scale deletion of 
information that some vendor or other had taken exception to.

I never imagined that request might come from a researcher within the 
'community' itself (and I use that word loosely in modern times).  But 
today, having spent a fair amount of time dealing with complaints from 
a particular individual (who shall remain nameless) I realised that 
I'm done.  The list has had its fair share of trolling, flooding, 
furry porn, fake exploits and DoS attacks over the years, but none of 
those things really affected the integrity of the list itself.  
However, taking a virtual hatchet to the list archives on the whim of 
an individual just doesn't feel right.  That 'one of our own' would 
undermine the efforts of the last 12 years is really the straw that 
broke the camel's back.

I'm not willing to fight this fight any longer.  It's getting harder 
to operate an open forum in today's legal climate, let alone a 
security-related one.  There is no honour amongst hackers any more.  
There is no real community.  There is precious little skill.  The 
entire security game is becoming more and more regulated.  This is all 
a sign of things to come, and a reflection on the sad state of an 
industry that should never have become an industry.

I'm suspending service indefinitely.  Thanks for playing.

Cheers
- John
