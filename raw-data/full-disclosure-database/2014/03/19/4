What is USSD?
USSD stands for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data and it's mostly use to make requests to a mobile operator. If you want to check how much money you have on your mobile sim card you can use a USSD Command for that. Entering for example *#100# to the vodafone network, you will receive an USSD message as a result.

USSD Sender Hacktool is a complex tool that let any web user to send a text message in a USSD command to any number. By default the message is "You have been hacked!" but you can send any text. In the target phone a message will pop up with the text and a OK button. If it get's undelivered an actual sms will be send.
