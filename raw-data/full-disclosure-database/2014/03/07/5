Subject: DAVOSET v.1.1.8

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. At 7th of March DAVOSET v.1.1.8
was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/). This is Bots Strike Back Edition.

As the world knows, last week Putin declared war against Ukraine
(https://soundcloud.com/mustlive/war-against-ukraine). So the army of bots
will come in handy to strike back against dictator.

In new version there were added support of security bypass in plugin Google
Maps, added new services into full list of zombies and removed non-working
services from lists of zombies.

Also there was added BYPASS method into the format of the list of
zombie-servers. It allows to bypass protection of web applications, such as
domain restriction in Google Maps. About this vulnerability in Google Maps
plugin for Joomla I wrote earlier
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Feb/53).

In total there are 170 zombie-services in the list, which are ready to
strike against dictatorship.

Best wishes & regards,
