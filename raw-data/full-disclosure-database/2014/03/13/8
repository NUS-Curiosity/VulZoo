# Exploit Title: Byte CMS Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
# Date: 02/03/2014
# Exploit Author: projectzero labs
# Projectzero ID:   projectzero2014-003-bytecmsxss

27.0.1


About the software:
===================

Byte CMS is a commercial content management system developed by
BitsnBytes (www.bitsnbytes.gr)


Vulnerability Details:
======================

projectzero labs identified a cross site scripting vulnerability in 
many
variables of the Byte CMS software, which allows an attacker to execute
a dynamic script (e.g. JavaScript) in the context of the application.

This allows several different attack opportunities, mostly hijacking 
the
current session of the user or changing the look of the page by 
changing
the HTML on the fly to steal the user's credentials. This happens
because the user input is interpreted as HTML/JavaScript by the 
browser.

Cross-site scripting targets the users of an application instead of the 
server. Although this is a limitation,
since it allows attackers to hijack other users' sessions, an attacker
could target an administrator in order to gain full control over the 
application.

Proof Of Concept:
=================

The cross site scripting vulnerability was found in many variables e.g. 
id,
cid, images etc.The security issue might exist in additional variables 
but wasn't verified
due to the nature of the audit (black-box).

We must mention that the CMS applies a typical XSS filtering that can 
be
easily bypassed.

For the proof of concept we provide some of the vulnerable sites
with the XSS payload trigger:
