That would require a way to retrieve the stored data, which - as I
understand - isn't possible here (although the report seems a bit
hard-to-parse). From what I recall, you can just upload a blob of data
and essentially see it disappear.

We do have quite a few services where you can legitimately upload and
share nearly-arbitrary content, though. Google Drive is a good
example.
