selected (CVE-2014-2319)

Background

ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl/pub/crypto/cracking/pkzip.ps.gz

Description

The compression tool PowerArchiver version 14.02.03 creates files with
an insecure encryption method even if the user selects a (secure) AES
encryption in the GUI.

If a user clicks on the "Encrypt Files" and selects "AES 256-bit" for
encryption, the outcoming file will not be AES-encrypted. It will
instead use the legacy PKZIP encryption, which uses a broken
encryption algorithm.

Note that there are different ways in PowerArchiver to create an
encrypted ZIP file, the issue only appears when using the "Encrypt
Files"-Button.

The PKZIP encryption has been broken by Biham/Kocher in 1994.

The vendor ConeXware has released version 14.02.05 which fixes the
issue. It also disables completely support for creating archives with
the broken legacy ZIP encryption.
