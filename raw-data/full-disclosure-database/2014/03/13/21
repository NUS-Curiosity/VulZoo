Subject: Re: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

If you were evil, you could upload huge blobs and just take up space on the google servers. Who knows what will happen if you upload a couple hundred gigs of files. They dont disappear, they are just unretrievable afaict. It is a security risk in the sense that untrusted data is being persisted *somewhere*.

Upload a couple terabytes, cause a DoS because some hdd in the DC fills up. Who knows.
