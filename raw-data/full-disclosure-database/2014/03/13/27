It's not even clear at this point that the uploaded data is even being persisted! Since the uploaded file is not made available for download, it's entirely possible that it is being deleted as soon as Google's video transcoding systems discover it isn't a supported video format.

The comments on the Softpedia article are painfully stupid, by the way. I recommend not reading them. :)
