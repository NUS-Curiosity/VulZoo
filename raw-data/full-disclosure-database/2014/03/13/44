Subject: Re: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

The YouTube service is there to serve harmless media files. The upload
functionality is there to upload files legitimately. But what type of
files, and who can write those files?

What's the difference between a Youtube admin (admin.youtube.com) and a
Youtube user in terms of permissions sets ?

Why does Youtube accepts only a certain type of media-files? Isn't it
because that's the scope of its function .... ?



A good point made, however based on recognised practise and core principles
of Information Security and not just 'experience' or personal belief, once
the information security flow of a design is tampered - that constitutes to
a security issue.

Second point - a security vulnerability is present when the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of data is affected. In this
case the integrity of the service is impacted.
