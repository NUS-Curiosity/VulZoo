Subject: Re: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

I think Adam was right replying that way, so that it's not a security bug.
You haven't found anything exploitable.

The only reasonable way to 'exploit' the bug is using youtube as a
"personal storage" uploading non-video files to your own profile: so what?

It's like saying that you have a normal file upload functionality in a
PHP application on Apache that expects files with extension .png only,
and you manage to upload an .asp file. Security-wise that's not a risk.
