Subject: Re: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

So in terms of permissions. What's the different between
admin.youtube.comand a normal youtube user?

I assume that the admin has a full permission set. If that's the case, that
means it is a valid vulnerability for the reason being that the integrity
of the service is impacted. The youtube user circumvents the design and
gets arbitrary write (w) permissions of any file-type. (The access control
matrix is bypassed here)

Since YouTube by design is not an FTP Service, and even Google drive is a
paid service - Then yes it is a vulnerability. Why are you guys looking for
impact elsewhere? The impact is to the integrity of the service - arbitrary
write permissions.
