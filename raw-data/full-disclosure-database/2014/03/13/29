Subject: Re: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

Keep in mind that YouTube allows files to be uploaded by definition. What
you have achieved is upload a file for an extension type that is not
allowed.
It is definitely a vulnerability but a low risk one since you haven't
demonstrated if it has any ill effects.

Can you somehow find the URL to where the file was uploaded? I would guess
not, since a well designed service like YouTube should hide those details
and no leak them in any way. Maybe if you are able to find that you can
combine with this vulnerability and get them to open their wallet?

Regards
Pedro
