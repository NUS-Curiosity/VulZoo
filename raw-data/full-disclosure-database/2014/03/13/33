Did you even read that article? (Not that OWASP has any sort of credibility
anyways). From what I saw in your previous post you are both unable to
execute the files or even access them and thus unable to manipulate the
content-type the files are returned with, therefore there is no
vulnerability (According to the article you linked.).

BTW, you should look for more cool vulnerabilities in amazons EC2, I'm sure
you will find some "Unrestricted File Upload" holes.
