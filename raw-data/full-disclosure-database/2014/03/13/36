Hello Julius,

I appreciate your interest to learn more. OWASP is quite credible, and has
gained some international recognition. It is a benchmark for many vendors.
I suggest you to read on OSI/7-Layer Model. A website may disallow uploads
of certain file types for security reasons, and let's assume at the
application layer. If we manage to get past the security controls, that
means  we can write unrestrictedly any type of file to the remote network.
That also means that we get past their firewall, since the communication is
through HTTP (port 80). CDN nodes are deployed to multiple colocation
(thousands of nodes and thousands of servers across the world). The files
(let's say a self-executing encrypted virus like Cryptolocker? ) are cached
deeply in the network across thousands of servers.
