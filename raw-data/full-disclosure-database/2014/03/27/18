Interesting effort indeed.

Your README in https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector states that
"In addition they can all crack the A5.1-3 encryption on the fly!" - could you
provide any references to back this claim?

To the best of my knowledge there is no "on-the-fly" cracking for A5/3 yet. I'd be
happy to learn otherwise :)

thanks,
Max.
