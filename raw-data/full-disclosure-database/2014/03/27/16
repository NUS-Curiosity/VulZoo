There are a variety of security concerns with the Smart Key system,
addressed by Shane Lawson (valanx) in some con talks at ShmooCon and
elsewhere.  Also documented in (self-citation alert) my second book.

If the list supports attached photos i could drop in some documentation
of all of this... but instead i might just pop them up on a web gallery
and link to them in a future email this weekend.
