Thank you, I will forward these warm words to our current main developer "xLaMbChOpSx" and Jofre Palau, who coded RawPhone in the first place. As much as I'd like to be the one who coded the stuff that is already there - I haven't. Nevertheless, I'm still learning and will continue to contribute.

Oh, is that the case? Thank for your offer, you're very welcome to do so!

If you're not yet registered at XDA, I encourage you to so. You should definately participate in our official development thread here where most of the talking takes place: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1422969 - I'll be happy to see you there!

Would you please re-post this on mentioned XDA-thread? I'm sure others will profit from that, too.

No worries. Having you here as a support is awesome enough. ;-)
