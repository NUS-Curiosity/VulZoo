Subject: Re: [FD] Master Lock random key code generation/distribution Fails

This still reduces the overall key space to only a handful in a given
year, over a large area covered by distribution centers, compared to the
full key space of any pin tumbler lock.

Rather than carrying around thousands og possible keys, only around 52
assuming a new stock every week for a particular lock. If the store
orders a larger batch and every two weeks, then 26 keys.
