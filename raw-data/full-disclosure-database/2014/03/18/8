I might just stand corrected here (if it withstands appeal):

http://www.slyck.com/story2351_Data_Breach_Settlement_Class_Action_Lawsuit_Wins_Appeal_in_Court:

With so many recent data breaches and lacking security measures in
place, we know that there are likely to be many more lawsuits
forthcoming. However, in whatâ€™s believed to be a first win for a class
action lawsuit as a result of a data breach where none of the
plaintiffs suffered identify theft or direct losses, AvMed, a
Florida-based health insurer, lost its case in court to the tune of a
$3 million settlement agreement. On February 21, 2014, a federal judge
in the Southern District of Florida approved an Order granting motion
for final approval of a Class Action Settlement Agreement, and filed a
motion for attorneys' fees and expenses, as well as for incentive
awards.
