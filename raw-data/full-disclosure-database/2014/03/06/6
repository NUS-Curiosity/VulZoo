Subject: Re: OT What is happening with bitcoins?

1. The people losing their bitcoins from hacks were amateurs at software engineering.

2. One of bitcoins greatest purported strengths (anonymity) is becoming a severe weakness because you cant easily track down who stole the bits.

3. I dont think any of this is a result of bugs in bitcoin.
