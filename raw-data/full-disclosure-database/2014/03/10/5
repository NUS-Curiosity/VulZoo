More to the point, has the transaction malleability issue been fixed that caused Magic’s downfall?
Even though most exchanges just code around it, it’s still kind of a really big issue if it isn’t fixed. :d

Bitcoins are doing great actually. =)
Used to be worth 0 a few years back, useless, and now you can use them to buy some stuff.

Read on theregister that bitcoins are in trouble.

Allegedly mtgox lost $400M maybe related to
transactions.

Are the bugs in bitcoin or just sufficiently
many ones got rooted?

Is bitcoin still alive?
