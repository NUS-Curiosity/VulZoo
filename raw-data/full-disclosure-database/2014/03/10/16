         CVE Name       CVE-2014-2289                                         

    Description  A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the     
                 PJSIP channel driver's handling of SUBSCRIBE requests. If a  
                 SUBSCRIBE request is received for the presence Event, and    
                 that request has no Accept headers, Asterisk will attempt    
                 to access an invalid pointer to the header location.         
                                                                              
                 Note that this issue was fixed during a re-architecture of   
                 the res_pjsip_pubsub module in Asterisk 12.1.0. As such,     
                 this issue has already been resolved in a released version   
                 of Asterisk. This notification is being released for users   
                 of Asterisk 12.0.0.                                          

    Resolution  Upgrade to Asterisk 12.1.0, or apply the patch noted below    
                to Asterisk 12.0.0.
