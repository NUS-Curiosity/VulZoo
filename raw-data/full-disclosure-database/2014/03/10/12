Subject: Re: OT What is happening with bitcoins?

Well, from my understanding. the transaction malleability issue,
 isn't a problem with the protocol itself.
but the specific exchanges implementation of it.
not all exchanges where even effected by it to begin with.
and with japans decision to keep bitcoins completely unregulated.
it's unclear if mtgox stole the coins and used all this as an excuse.  or
what.
