Subject: [FD] Introducing APSAM - Beyond Military Grade Security

Security researchers develop AP$AM the most advanced, and
persistent, threat information valuation services.

In an effort to combat advanced, malicious hackers
worldwide, researchers have developed a unique, and proven
methodology to locate and attribute, high level,
sophisticated attacks.

"We see nation states all the time. They come in and out
of networks, lurking like ghosts. They're advanced,
they're persistent, and they likely have nuclear cyber
packets. Some even have horrific names like UglyGorilla.
They seem to ONLY emanate from China, and when they don't
we quickly re-assess, and re-label them as Chinese. It's
slowly becoming Cyber Pearl Harbor. From China!. An
electronic cybergeddon" said Patrick Kilpatrick, a Senior
Suicidal Security Engineer.

AP$AM allows for digital, analog, and electronic
processing of mission critical information. The secret is
in the patent pending $uper Holistic Intelligence and
Techniques approach we use to mitigate against threats
from the cloud, mobile, radar, telekinetic, and Von Eck
threats. AP$AM contains CyBOX, MAEC, CAPEC, STIX, and
TAXII capabilities which are answered in the FAQs

US based Infiltrated Networks founded in 2004, is a
boutique security, and research group composed of one
individual, and his personas. They are internationally
known, to rock a microphone.
