Subject: [FD] Multiple vulnerabilities in Js-Multi-Hotel for WordPress

Hello list!

There are multiple vulnerabilities in Js-Multi-Hotel plugin for WordPress. 
Earlier I wrote about two other vulnerabilities.

These are Abuse of Functionality, Denial of Service, Cross-Site Scripting 
and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities in Js-Multi-Hotel plugin for 
WordPress. There are much more vulnerabilities in this plugin (including 
dangerous holes), so after two advisories I'll write new advisories.

Besides conducting DoS attack manually, it's also possible to conduct 
automated DoS and DDoS attacks with using of DAVOSET 
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html).

DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool:
