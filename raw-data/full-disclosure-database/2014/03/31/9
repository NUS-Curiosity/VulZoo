Subject: Re: [FD] Introducing APSAM - Beyond Military Grade Security

I fear that its too late for AP$AM. I believe it has already been
compromised by the true foe. After all, It has been turned from a possible
beacon of safety in these troubled times, to yet another harbour for those
"Nation-States" to slither into and out of our systems like the foe they
are. After all, can we yet trust that which has none?
