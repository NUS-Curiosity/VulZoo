probably around here. We suggest to use good internet connection to avoid
video lags and setup good audio device to hear voice without noise.

*If you have not used Youtube Live Stream before, then do not worry it is
similar as watching videos on the Youtube. If you require technical
assistance with webcast , please contact abhaythehero@...age4hackers.com
