So in ohter words, you haven't proven it. The upload in itself is not a
vulnerability (and if you understood that it is, please read again that
OWASP document).

How does it impact the integrity? Again, unexpected functionality does not
necessarily equal exploitation.

Not proven either. At this point I feel you're just making stuff up. All
you did was upload stuff you can't download afterwards.

Again, you need to be able to download the stuff you uploaded, and have it
executed directly. Otherwise you could do the same thing more efficiently
with Google Drive.

You need to explain how that is an attack vector.
