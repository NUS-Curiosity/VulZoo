Subject: Re: Fwd: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

Then that also means that firewalls and IPS systems are worthless. Why
spend so much time protecting the network layers if a user can send any
file of choice to a remote network through http...

As for the uploaded files being persistent, there is evidence of that.  For
instance a remote admin could be tricked to execute some of the uploaded
files (Social Engineering).

So our report sent as part of Google's security program, should not be
treated as a non-security issue.


Thanks,
