Being a CDN means it is very hard to find out where your file went.

I agree with was said on this thread by other people.

As an external penetration testing consultant, I would put this on a client
report as a low risk finding / possible vulnerability and recommend it to
be fixed.

As an internal vulnerability manager I would push the developers to fix it,
but I would give it a low priority and only real press then once all the
higher priority ones have been fixed.

However in the "real world" it is not a vulnerability, and don't expect
Google to pay you for it.

Pedro
