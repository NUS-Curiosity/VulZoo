Subject: Re: [FD] Master Lock random key code generation/distribution Fails

Keycodes on padlocks do not (normally) have the bitting code numbers on 
them. The keycodes have no relation to the bitting codes. Master locks 
that I've seen certainly don't, and even the cheap locks on our cabinets 
in the office do not either.

When I had a set of locks custom-keyed for a previous house, the 
locksmith put the bitting code on one key of each time to make it 
simpler to set up if/when I needed more keys. I never carried these keys 
around, since anyone spotting the bitting code could easily make a copy. 
I recommend that people never carry keys with the bitting code on them, 
put them away in a safe place.

For my current house I keyed it differently. There is a master key that 
opens everything. There is a front-door-outside key that only opens that 
one lock, so that if someone (read - some kid :-) ) loses that key I 
only have one lock to change. There is an 'inside' key that only opens 
the inside deadbolts, and when the house is occupied we leave inside 
keys in those locks - and if someone wanders off with one, they're not 
useful for getting into the house. For these keys, the locksmith did not 
stamp bitting codes on any of them. It depends on the locksmith.
