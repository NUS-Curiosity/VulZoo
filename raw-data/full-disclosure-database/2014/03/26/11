Probably old but still an issue:

The first hit gives you access to phpmyadmin.

There are TONS of credentials pushed to public repositories. This query
gives 57k results:
https://github.com/search?q=define%28%22DB_PASSWORD%22&type=Code&ref=searchresults

It's easy to prevent from a developers perspective, but still - there are
probably hundreds of thousands of database or other credentials pushed to
public repos.
