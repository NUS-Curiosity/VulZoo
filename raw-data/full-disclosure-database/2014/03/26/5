IMO, the problem with radical alternatives is that they sound good in
theory, but they usually lack the ease of use *and* the long-term
reliability of a broadly-mirrored mailing list. Even with the original
list defunct, the old F-D content won't rot too soon and will be very
easy to search for years to come.

browser-related thing that doesn't really deserve a separate thread:
