How is this the providers fault? Isn't this a core issue with the GSM 
protocol, and simply camping to the strongest source? Which is why the 
catchers are usually mobile (like the recent case in Florida with the 
Verizon data card). Also not sure how this works with CDMA. I guess they 
can push a forced PRL update perhaps?

  To get back to my point: IMSI-Catchers are a real problem.

It's not? Then how does your program work?

I've forked it and starred it.

Didn't know about https://www.gsmmap.org/ , that's pretty neat.

So can't the base stations all be turned into IMSI catchers essentially? 
Why even bother with MITM and passthrough, when you can just NSL a 
telco. I'm pretty sure all the gear is CALEA compliant. I mean sure, 
criminals can make use of a mobile IMSI catcher. However I think it's 
far more effective to stick with phishing and other traditional internet 
attack vectors. Not to mention Android malware. Why spend the time/money 
to hack layer 1 (which requires proximity) when layer 7 is wide open?

Or they'll just infect the users with malware. Way easier.

Can you explain in a few sentences the core of the idea/algorithm you 
are using to do this? I'm looking over all the linked materials and 
haven't really seen that detailed.

I presume you are in close touch with oscombb already?
