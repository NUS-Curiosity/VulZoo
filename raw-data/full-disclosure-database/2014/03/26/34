Jon,

The key code is used to identify locks that share the same key. For a 
pin tumbler lock, it usually corresponds exactly to the height of each 
of the pins in order. So the key code 2685 in the image probably looks 
something like this:


|^\
|..|
|..\___
|......|
|......\_
|........|
|......_/
|.....|
