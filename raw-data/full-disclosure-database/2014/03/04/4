original videos, and educational videos. Most of the content on YouTube has
been uploaded by individuals, but media corporations

their material via YouTube, as part of the YouTube partnership program.
Unregistered users can watch videos,
and registered users can upload an unlimited number of videos.. YouTube,
LLC was acquired by Google for US$1.65 billion in November 2006 and now
operates as a Google subsidiary.


Description
============================
A security report was made to Google Inc. on the 26th of February, in
reference to Google's coordinated security reward program that encourages
responsible disclosure.
The security issue presented, allowed circumvention of web-based control
handlers used by the YouTube API, which determined the file-types permitted
to be written on YouTube's store-servers.
The validation occurred at the application-layer, through a web-based form;
Therefore a user could tamper with the Http data, in order to bypass any
web-based file-type validation checks,
and consequently to upload, any file of choice to the remote storage
network. However it is pertinent to note that remote code execution has not
been confirmed in this report.
