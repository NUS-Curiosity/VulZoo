Subject: Tool Release: nsdtool - netgear switch discovery

Hi List,

we are happy to publish a tool written some months ago to discover
netgear switches using python.

Abstract

nsdtool is a toolset of scripts used to detect netgear switches in local
networks. The tool contains some extra features like bruteforce and
setting a new password.
Netgear has its own protocol called NSDP (Netgear Switch Discovery
Protocol), which is implemented to support security tests on the
commandline. It is not bound to the delivered tools by Netgear.

Cheers,
 CRT
