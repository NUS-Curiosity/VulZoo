	Access Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2211419

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-029
   * Project: Mime Mail [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 6.x, 7.x
   * Date: 2014-March-05
   * Security risk: Less critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Access bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

The MIME Mail module allows to send MIME-encoded e-mail messages with
embedded images and attachments.

By default the module only allows files to be embedded or attached that are
located in the public files directory.

The module doesn't sufficiently check the file location, considering similar
paths in different roots as being located in the public files directory,
possibly allowing to send arbitrary files as attachments without permission.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must be able to
compose and send e-mail messages to an arbitrary address and the attached
file's location must partly match with the system path of the public files
directory.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

   * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./
