You can also access the CFP from the Welcome page of our website at
bsideslv(dot)org

BSidesLV consists of the following tracks:

Breaking Ground - Ground Breaking Information Security research and
conversations on the "Next Big Thing". Interactively discussing your
research with our participants and getting feedback, input and opinion. No
preaching from the podium at passive attendees.

Common Ground - Other topics of interest to the security community. e.g.,
Lock-picking, hardware hacking, mental health, Burnout, Law, Privacy,
Regulations, Risk, Crypto, Activism, etc. Be prepared to engage your
audience - and have them engage you.

Proving Ground - Speaker Development Program. 30-minute presentations from
up-and-coming first-time national speakers, teamed with one of our
experienced volunteer mentors.

Underground - OTR talks on subjects best discussed AFK. No press, no
recording, no streaming, no names. Just you and your peers, behind closed
doors. Think about it.

Training Ground - Workshops and classes to give your students hands-on
experience learning the latest and greatest. We accept proposals for 1/2
day, full-day and 2-day workshops.



BSidesLV is committed to selecting our speakers based on merit of current
research and the abstract submitted. To ensure this, we have instituted a
double-blind CFP vetting process. Names and Bios will be stripped from the
abstract before it is submitted to our 7 member CFP team and no member of
the team (with the exception of the Chair) will see another member's vote
or comments. This should assist in maintaining a fair and equal vetting
process for all that submit.


For clarification purposes, please understand that BSides' events,
including Las Vegas, are free labors of love and education, for the
community, by the community, and all events - including workshops - are
free to attend for all participants. No remuneration of any kind is offered
to presenters*. We do provide breakfast and lunch both days of the
conference, a t-shirt, a badge for you and a +1 for a friend, and a Speaker
Thank You reception. If you are looking for a conference that can reimburse
or off-set your travel and lodging, and offer you a stipend, please
consider one of the bigger, paid admission conferences.

*We are offering a travel & lodging scholarship pilot program for accepted
Proving Ground speakers that qualify. Directions to apply are in the CFP.

BSides Las Vegas will be held at the Tuscany Suites and Casino, Las Vegas,
Nevada, on August 5th and 6th, 2014.

Thank you for your interest and we hope to see you in Vegas!
