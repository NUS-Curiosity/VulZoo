	Theme - XSS

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2211381

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-027
   * Project: NewsFlash [1] (third-party theme)
   * Version: 6.x, 7.x
   * Date: 2014-March-05
   * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

Newsflash is a theme that features 7 color styles, 12 collapsible regions,
suckerfish menus, fluid or fixed widths, built-in IE transparent PNG fix, and
lots more.

The theme does not sanitize the user provided theme setting for the font
family CSS property, thereby exposing a cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer themes".
