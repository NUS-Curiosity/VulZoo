Subject: Re: Fwd: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

The thread read Google vulnerabilities with PoC. From my understanding  it was a RFI vulnerability on YouTube, and I voiced my support that this is a vulnerability. 

I also explained a JSON Hijacking case as a follow up, and you said you didn't follow.  So I am just saying that treating security that way, there are other parties like NSA who welcome them happily.

I'm not sure how RFI came into play on this thread - the original
report wasn't about RFI.

I don't have an agenda here; I'm just trying to get to the bottom of
it and make sure that we converge on a common understanding of the
issue. As in any argument, it's fairly likely that one of us is wrong,
and I accept that it could very well be me - I have been wrong quite a
few times in my life, and it's always a valuable learning opportunity.

I think it's unfortunate that the thread has devolved into various
accusations and credential-slinging, because it reduces the likelihood
of such a productive outcome. Please feel free to ping me directly any
time, though - I'm happy to chat.

Cheers,
