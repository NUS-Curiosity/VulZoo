Subject: Re: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

Some of the replies in this thread are very unfair to the original poster.

 

I have read the news story and have thoroughly read the proof of concepts which in my opinion indicate that this is surely a security vulnerability.  I have worked for Lumension as a security consultant for more than a decade. 

 

I have never thought that Google would have gone that far. Quite scary if you ask me... Do not be discouraged, as a security researcher I have also been getting that. I can certainly certify that this is a security problem, no doubts about that.
