I'm just a lurker on the list, which I have always found valuable. 

But for what it's worth, this thread is an awful bore. Who cares 
about people's credentials? 

I'm not asking for administrative intervention, which I hate, but 
rather that the various entrants in the pissing contest empty their 
bladders elsewhere. Please!
