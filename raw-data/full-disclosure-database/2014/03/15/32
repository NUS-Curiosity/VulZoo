<disclaimer>
Compared to probably most of the folks on this list, I have absolutely
no idea what I'm doing.
</disclaimer>

However, at the time I accessed your latest URL (around 2:51 AM EST, or
6:51 GMT), I got a message saying "The video is currently being
processed."

So, for all we know, the file is in some queue, waiting for Google to
notice that it's invalid, at which point it will be deleted.

Please get back to us when we are able to download your invalid file,
via YouTube, on our various machines scattered across the globe.

Also, please stop sending so many damn short emails in a row.
Consolidation is nice.

Thank you,

BW
