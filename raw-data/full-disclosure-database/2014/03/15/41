Subject: Re: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

On top of that, Google spent millions of dollars to buy Chrome exploits,
sandbox bypasses
and webapp bugs. So, if this was a REAL bug with some REAL security
impact, I don't think Google wouldn't have paid.

They have a REAL budget for that, they are not like Yahoo that sends you
a t-shirt.

The security industry has become a big business for many, with bug
bounties, no more free bugs (and hugs),
100 pages of low/info risk findings bumped to high risk to scare the
customer, and so on.

At least do not pretend money when there is no security bug,
and in general don't be a pretender if you don't have a clue.

Cheers
