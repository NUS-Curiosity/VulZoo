Subject: Re: Fwd: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

The thread starter is right about this. It is a vulnerability, and I think Google should start considering this.
 
The JSON service responds to GET requests , and there is a good chance that the service is also vulnerable to JSON Hijacking attacks.
 
As a professional penetration tester , I believe that Google was false not to award this.
