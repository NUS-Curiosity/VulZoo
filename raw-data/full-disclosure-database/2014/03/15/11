well, if you are running a file upload system, or any webserver, you really
should block any incoming traffic to port 80, and if you can't of course
your IPS knows what a video file is and can whitelist that /s
That's why server-side controls are in place, and your POC doesn't show you
circumventing them.
>As for the uploaded files being persistent, there is evidence of that.
No. You have evidence they were uploaded. You don't have evidence they will
stay forever. When reporting a vulnerability, please try to not include
hyperbole, the reporters will do that for you.
>For instance a remote admin could be tricked to execute some of
the uploaded files
As I said, your uploaded files are not accessible to any user, unless you
prove me wrong. They are not executable (in the context of the webserver)
for any remote user, unless you can prove me wrong. They are not executable
in the context of an admin browsing the server content, unless the guys at
youtube made a major mistake, and you can't tell if they are, and neither
can I.
> (Social Engineering).
Ohai, youtube admin, could you please copy that file I can't give you the
path of, or even the server where it resides, to your home folder and
please chmod it 777 and then run it? For debugging purposes obviously

Have a nice day, and may the bug elves fill your socks with awesome
presents,
