Subject: Re: Fwd: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

Nicholas, seriously, just stop.

You have found an 'arbitrary file upload' in a file hosting service and
claim it is a serious vulnerability. With no proof that your 'arbitrary
file' is being used anywhere in any context that would lead to code
execution - on server or client side. You cite OWASP documents (which are
unrelated to the case), academia papers from 1975 just to find a reason
it's theoretically serious, not paying any attention to what service you're
actually attacking and what have you really achieved in that (which is
demonstrating a filtering weakness at best, low risk).

Everyone on this list so far explains why you're wrong, but you just won't
stop. So you start throwing out certificates, your academia experience and
your respected company. Then - name calling everyone else. Seriously, it's
just a good laugh for most of us.

Dude, please, just because you did not qualify for a bounty, there's no
point in launching a whole campaign like you are. You're essentially
following the path of Khalil Shreateh (the guy who posted on Zuckerberg FB
wall) - he DID find a vuln though. Do you really want that? Go ahead, start
a crowdsourcing campaign!
