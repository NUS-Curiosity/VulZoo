Subject: Re: Fwd: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

> The thread read Google vulnerabilities with PoC. From my understanding  it was a RFI vulnerability on YouTube, and I voiced my support that this is a vulnerability.

I don't think this is accurate, at least based on the standard
definition of RFI: a server-side scripting language - usually PHP -
accidentally executing a script fetched from a remote server because
it passed an attacker-controlled string to an API that allows both
local file paths and remote URLs.

The report talks about a different behavior: the ability for users to
upload video and non-video content using legitimate functionality of
the site, without a way to make the server do anything interesting
with the received data. This may or may not be interesting on its own
merit, but I think it's pretty far from RFI.

> I also explained a JSON Hijacking case as a follow up, and you said you didn't follow.

Yup, I am genuinely not familiar with the attack vector that *I think*
you are describing, or why it would matter in this context. My earlier
message in this thread explains my reasoning (in essence, there are
certain conditions that have to be met for a typical XSSI bug, and I
don't think they are met here), but if my understanding is wrong, I'd
really like to learn about the proposed attack.
