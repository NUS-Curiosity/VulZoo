Subject: Re: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

Dear Mario,
 
There is nothing to gain being on either side. I have already read the thread replies by M. Zalewski. I believe Google is false and does not honor the security community.
 Rgds,

M. Kirschbaum

I believe Zalewski has explained very well why it isn't a vulnerability, and you couldn't possibly be calling him hostile. :)

As a penetration tester, writer, and malware analyst with a long and rewarding career...it would be absurd to admit that this is not a vulnerability. If the content-type fields can be altered and the API accepts it that is undoubtedly a vulnerability, I believe that it shouldn't be there. It would be a shame to say that this is not a security problem. I have seen different responses on this thread but having seen the proof of concept images as well I just think that some of the people commenting here are just being hostile.
