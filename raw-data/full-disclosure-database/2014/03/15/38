Wow. I seriously can't tell if you're trolling or unbelievably narcissistic.

Your work has serious flaws, and have been pointed out with facts over and
over - but you think they're ad-hominem attacks based on the tone of their
replies. Zalewski here is just trying to be nice and patient with you - but
you somehow seem to believe he agrees with you based on the tone of his
replies.

You're either faking it and pulling a massive prank on all of us, or you're
so self absorbed you can't get past your own emotional responses to people
pointing out your mistakes. The actual contents of what they tell you are
irrelevant to you, all that matters is if people praise or criticize you.

I'm beginning to think you may have issues and we should all back off for a
while.
