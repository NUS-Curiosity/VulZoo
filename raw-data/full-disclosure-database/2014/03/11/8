Julius hit the nail on the head here. Transaction malleability is not some heretofore undiscovered bug in the Bitcoin implementation. It was a known entity long ago, and presumably with the creator(s) awareness. It really isn’t a problem itself; it’s perfectly mitigable with the correct implementations on the exchange’s side. It’s worth noting nearly all of the FUD surrounding BTC comes down to mistakes made with and among exchanges. Exchanges of any kind carry risk, and a new kind of exchange such as this is bound to have some serious question marks in the first many years of existence.

For more on transaction malleability and the technical considerations, see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Malleability, noting especially the following:
“...this does mean that, for instance, it is not safe to accept a chain of unconfirmed transactions under any circumstance because the later transactions will depend on the hashes of the previous transactions, and those hashes can be changed until they are confirmed in a block.”

The above is a huge note, and is made clear elsewhere as well. However, mistakes around this were still made, and continue to be made today. Live and learn, caveat emptor, etc.
