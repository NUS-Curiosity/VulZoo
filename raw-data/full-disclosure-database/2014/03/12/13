   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-030
   * Project: SexyBookmarks [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 6.x
   * Date: 2014-March-12
   * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Information Disclosure

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

The SexyBookmarks module is a port of the WordPress SexyBookmarks plug-in.
The module adds social bookmarking using the Shareaholic service.

The module discloses the private files location when Drupal 6 is configured
to use private files.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that only sites using private
files are affected.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

   * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

   * All SexyBookmarks 6.x-2.x versions.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed SexyBookmarks
[4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

   * If you use the SexyBookmarks module for Drupal 6.x you should disable it.
   * Users can also consider using the Shareaholic [5] module which provides
     similar features. However, the Shareaholic module is currently only
     available for Drupal 7 so affected users would have to upgrade to Drupal 
7
     first.

Also see the SexyBookmarks [6] project page.

-------- REPORTED BY

   * Don Morris [7]

-------- FIXED BY
------------------------------------------------------------

-------- COORDINATED BY
------------------------------------------------------

   * Greg Knaddison [8] of the Drupal Security Team
   * Cash Williams [9] provisional member of the Drupal Security Team
