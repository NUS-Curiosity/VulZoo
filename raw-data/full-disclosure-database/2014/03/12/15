Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2014-031 - Webform
	Template - Access	Bypass

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2216607

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-031
   * Project: Webform Template [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 7.x
   * Date: 2014-March-12
   * Security risk: Less critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Access Bypass

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to copy webform config from one node to another.
The module doesn't respect node access when providing possible nodes to copy
from. As a result, a user may be disclosed the titles of nodes he does not
have view access to and as such he may be able to copy the webform
configuration from otherwise hidden nodes.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the system must be using a
node access control module and an attacker must have a role that has access
to edit nodes of the "webform template destination" type.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

   * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

   * All Webform Template 6.x-1.x versions.
   * Webform Template 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.3.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Webform
Template [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

   * If you use the Webform Template module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to a newer
     version. The issue is fixed as from 7.x-1.3 [5].
   * If using an older version, be aware of the risks & consequences.

*Note: *For some people, the previous behavior was actually exactly how they
used this module. To restore the original functionality, go to the settings (
admin/config/content/webform_template ) and check the "Defeat node access"
checkbox.

Also see the Webform Template [6] project page.
