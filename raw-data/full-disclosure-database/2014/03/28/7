Subject: [FD] CSRF vulnerability in WP HTML Sitemap 1.2 (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: WP HTML Sitemap
Version: 1.2
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-html-sitemap/
CVSS: 4.3 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF vulnerability in WP HTML Sitemap 1.2

Vulnerability
================
A CSRF vulnerability exists which allows an attacker to delete the 
sitemap if a logged-in admin user visits a link of the attacker’s choosing.
Line 202 of inc/AdminPage.php says “// check whether form was just 
submitted” but the following if/elseif statements only check whether a 
particular button was pressed without checking nonce values. The form in 
question is printed in wp_html_sitemap_AdminPage::createSitemapForm() 
around line 146 of the same file.

Proof of concept
================
This form deletes the sitemap without requiring a nonce value:
<form 
action="http://not-a-real-site.local/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-html-sitemap&tab=general" 
method="POST">
<input type="text" name="deleteSitemap" value="Delete Sitemap">
<input type="submit">
</form>

Mitigations
================
Disable the plugin until a fix is available.
