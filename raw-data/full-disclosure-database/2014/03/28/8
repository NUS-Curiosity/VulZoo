Subject: [FD] Wireless Security Paper

Hello everyone. I am a new subscriber to this list after I heard about the recent change in management (thanks Fyodor), so please excuse me if this is not the most appropriate place to share this. I am a high school student interested in computer science, mainly computer security, and I did a science fair project on exploring the effectiveness of wireless based attacks. Nothing I did is new and I am sure many of you know most of the techniques and information described in the paper. However, I am sharing this as I am looking to gain some feedback on any aspect of it. I am only fifteen and am inexperienced in many ways, so please excuse any errors or misinformation encountered. Nevertheless, I am eager and excited to learn more about computer security and will correct any information or make improvements as quickly as possible. The link to the paper can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16rpRCOCOFQYmKd4FsrtYDI035JsIt5r9ZuivjfBg3zM and I have included additional
  information including an abstract, screenshots, slides, and an image of the display board here: http://dillonkorman.com/2014-science-fair. Again, any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
