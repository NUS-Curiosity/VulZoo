Subject: [FD] Canon Printer Exposes WiFi Password

Affects: Canon PIXMA MX722 Printer (and probably other Canon printers).

After typing my WPA2 WiFi password into the printer (through the
built-in hardware keypad), it exposes the cleartext password to the LAN
through an admin page that isn't password protected:

You can enable password protection of that page, but:

1) There is no password protection by default. It silently exposes your
   password, and you'll never know unless you go looking for it.

2) There's no need to embed the actual password in the HTML form anyway.
   They could have used placeholder text instead of the real password.
