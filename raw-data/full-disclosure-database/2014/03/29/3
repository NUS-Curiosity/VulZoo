interesting work; and a good example of the limits of traffic analysis
protection in low latency, stream oriented protocols.

an even more effective approach is using active DoS as a signal for
confirmation, like your sequence of activity:

one other trick, try hosting the webserver on a common "long lived
port".  not sure if this will make much difference, but it should
improve the odds of your entire few minute sequence staying on the
same circuit...
