Subject: Re: Fwd: Google vulnerabilities with PoC

Let's try some scenarios and if those can be pulled out then I'd say it's
safe to assume this is an issue:

1. Upload a webshell (in a war, php, asp[x], jsp or similar file) and have
it executed by YouTube;
2. Upload a malicious file (pdf, swf, jar or similar file which exploits a
known or unknown vulnerability in the respective aps) and have it served by
YouTube;
3. Upload a file which alters the behavior of the YouTube application
(i.e., a configuration file, HTML or Javascript template, even a UI image).

Otherwise you just uploaded a file which went into a bitbucket, but you
have no way of pulling this file out of said bitbucket in a way that can
cause harm to either the application or its users.

Should YouTube restrict file uploads to known valid mime types? Sure, but
that's only how you got the data in there to begin with. It's what happens
after the data is in that will make all the difference.
