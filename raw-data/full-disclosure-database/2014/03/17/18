The risk equations favor "do nothing". Its cost effective to simply
persue profits and not spend money on data security.

If (when) they are breached, it only costs them the cost of a
notification. In the US, that's the cost of bulk mail [0]. 46 states,
DC, and Territories have Data Breach laws, and nearly none (none?)
have any useful provisions for damages. [1]

You can't recover for your time lost or services like credit
monitoring. Every class action get tossed out [2]. I've never seen one
go to court, and I've been watching them for years.

In the US, the risk equations must be unbalanced (or swayed to favor
of the consumer, who is the ultimate victim). That will take a policy
change. However, that likely won't happen as long as corporate america
and special interest purchase and trade politicians like sports
trading cards.

(I've been watching data breaches and responses for years because I
got burned somehow and it cost me over 10K to fix in the 1990s. I
never got a notification. I found out after I got sued for unpaid
bills and the collection agencies contacted me).
