Subject: Re: Bank of the West security contact?

Just wanted to post a follow-up to this and provide some context to
make it known:

* Bank of the West was contacted in 2011 to report a security issue

* No response for 2 years

* In late 2013, I receive a breach notification saying my own
sensitive personal information was compromised via the EXACT SAME
ISSUES I REPORTED. I also am led to believe employee information was
compromised, which may include Social Security Number (SSN) details.

Conclusions?

* Bank of the West has NO WORKING SECURITY REPORTING MECHANISM for
outside researchers and NO BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM

* Bank of the West does not seem to take security and privacy
seriously enough, as far as I can tell

You should know this if you are an existing or potential customer /
employee of Bank of the West...
