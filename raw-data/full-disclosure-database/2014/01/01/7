no CVE for the oops you were entirely dependent on RDRAND issue,
 predictable.

no release from OpenSSL with fix either? ... hard to check right now,
i think their site had some issues lately. *cough*


no list of affected packages, who may have generated potentially week
long-lived keys if a future leak or other incident identifies RDRAND
as mass produced and distributed vulnerable to attacks against key
space / DRBG output.


i know we're all fucked six ways to sunday[0],
 but is that sufficient excuse to slack off or conveniently shy away?
