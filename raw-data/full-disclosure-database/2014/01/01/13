Subject: DAVOSET v.1.1.5

Hello participants of Mailing List.

Happy New Year!

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. At 31st of December DAVOSET v.1.1.5
was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/). This is New Year Edition ;-).

Use, don't abuse. Happy holidays ddosing.

In new version there was added error handler in GetCookie(), added new
services into lists of zombies and removed non-working services from lists
of zombies. Since during 2013 many sites with vulnerable web applications
removed these webapps or closed sites completely. But many new vulnerable
sites have come, so lists of zombies can be easily extended.

Best wishes & regards,
