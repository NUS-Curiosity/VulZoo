All talks must be 55 minutes in length and can be on any security/privacy
related topic. Note that we will not accept submissions which are
sales/marketing.

RVAsec has many speaker perks, including con admission (and half-off for a
friend), speaker party, shirt/swag, awesome badges, and the opportunity to
