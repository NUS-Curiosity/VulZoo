Subject: Re: Making waves on Twitter!

Good points on all of those. I've been trying to keep it on track as a
security issue and I think it is actually getting there. I had a
conversation with the CISO over HHS which just took over the
infrastructure. He seems pretty awesome and wanting to do the right things
to get the things addressed and wants to understand them all. So on that
front, I think it's gotten the light that it's needed to do change. My hope
was that it would be not just hc.gov but the federal government as a whole.
FISMA + 800-53 != security in any shape or form and we're seeing the
ramifications of that now on an entire federal/state level. FISMA has
messed us up for the next 10 years to come. Instead of proactive type
solutions, its how do we get the check box and skirt around the NIST
guidelines - same thing goes for any other regulatory/compliance standard -
SOX/PCI no different.

I may have been too ambitious to think we could change the larger problem
as it become a political show instead of the focus on security. Regardless
- lots of good done on that front and lots of things have changed since the
last testimony.

Regarding the script, its an embarrassing urllib2 request - happy to
release it as soon as its fixed (still open as far as I know). Tickets #'s
have been submitted to the devs.

On the getting blasted front - it's actually been quite light except for
Waylon/NoBiasInfosec crazy talk. For the most part, it's been received well
and seems like a lot of folks interested in addressing it.  To the point "Let's
recap: we can't prove the website is insecure without breaking the law, and
our politichildren are not concerned about proving it is secure."

I agree - I tried using the analogy that if I was a mechanic instead and
had 14 years of working on cars and a car drove past me with the engine
making clanking sounds, blue smoke everywhere and leaking oil, chances are
it's probably got an engine issue, either that or its fine and just a
honeypot. I can't say that the internal guts are insecure, but based on
doing this type of testing for years and years, there's much more
symptomatic problems out under the hood. I could be wrong, but I would be
blown away if everything looked great on the inside.

That's why I grabbed 7 other security folks to provide their opinion on it,
most are application security folks and do this as a profession - same
conclusion. Regardless, I have to say that I'm pretty finished on the
politics stuff - at least for now. I'm not a political person, I stay away
from it as a practice. I was hoping that it would be a focus on bringing
awareness and light to a pretty bad situation. It's such a
hostile environment where folks are more bent on winning their political
views than it is about doing the right thing. Unfortunate but the world we
live in.

All good points Brandon - appreciate the responses.

-Dave
