Subject: DC4420 - London DEFCON - January meet - Tuesday
	28th January 2014

Well here we go again...

It's a new year, but we're still in the same place and still going 
strong! Last year we continued to grow and to host many fantastic and 
interesting talks, as well as performing the more important tasks such 
as drinking beer and drinking more beer... This year we hope to do the 
same, and to this end we are kicking off with an 'open mic' evening, as 
well as launching a couple of competitions...

The first is the international 2014 DEF CON Groups Challenge:

   https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=13743

we will discuss how we can participate, and provide resources to those 
that wish to do so...

Secondly, it's about time we had a new t-shirt! In the very early days 
we produced a limited number of shirts, and, frankly, mine is worn out 
and I need a new one, so WTF? Why hasn't someone come up with a nifty 
design? Get to it!

Finally, open mic/lightning talks... This is your forum, and your 
opportunity to speak to your peers in London and shape the meetings to 
come... Have your say and/or tell us about the cool shit you did over 
Christmas!
