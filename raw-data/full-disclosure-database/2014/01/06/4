No, in most countries this was taken in account and rejected
by the authorities because the certification is tied to the
electronics apparatus and not to the software/firmware that
drives it (with the frequency range exception in the mobile
domain, but this is already covered by other rules than
certification).

For once, authorities where quite wise (but don't take that for
granted in other domains;)
