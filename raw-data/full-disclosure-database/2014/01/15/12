	Posting - Cross	Site Scripting (XSS)

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2173321

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-002
   * Project: Anonymous Posting [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 7.x
   * Date: 2014-01-15
   * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module allows anonymous users to fill in their contact information
(name, email and homepage) when posting any content type including Forum
Topics. This allows the submitted name to be shown instead of the usual
anonymous string provided by Drupal core.

The module doesn't properly sanitize the name submitted by the anonymous user
before it is output.

This vulnerability is mitigated only by the fact that use of anonymous
posting data must be enabled on a per content type basis by a user with
permission to do so since it is not enabled by default. However when
configured for it's intended purpose, the vulnerability is not mitigated.


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

   * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./
