Subject: CVE-2013-6430 Possible XSS when using Spring MVC

Severity: Low

Vendor: Spring by Pivotal

Versions Affected:
- Spring MVC 3.0.0 to 3.2.1
- Earlier unsupported versions may be affected

Description:
The JavaScriptUtils.javaScriptEscape() method did not escape all characters that
are sensitive within either a JS single quoted string, JS double quoted string,
or HTML script data context. In most cases this will result in an unexploitable
parse error but in some cases it could result in an XSS vulnerability.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:
- Users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.2 or later

Credit:
This issue was originally reported to the Spring Framework developers by Jon
Passki and the security implications brough to the attention of the Pivotal
security team by Arun Neelicattu.
