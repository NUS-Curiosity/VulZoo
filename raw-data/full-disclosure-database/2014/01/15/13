Depends upon the browser. For Firefox, see:

/usr/lib/firefox/distribution/searchplugins/locale/en-US/duckduckgo.xml

The merge at
https://code.launchpad.net/~caine/chromium-browser/duckduckgo/+merge/182416
gives me the strong impression that it will be harder to change in
chromium-browser; it may take a recompile. Probably it would be easier
to add your own search engines to chromium-browser without recompiling,
though I don't know chromium-browser well enough to suggest them.

Thanks
