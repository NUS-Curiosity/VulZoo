Subject: Dates for the opening of registration for Rooted
	CON 2014

Hello dudes,

We announce that on *Monday January 13*, the registration form will be open
to purchase your tickets for the next edition of Rooted CON, the fifth,
which will be celebrated in *March, from 6th to 8th*.

Here are the sections of tickets by type (*Student, Professional,
Professional with Discount*):
  Date rangeStudentsProfessionalProfessional with discount  *January 13
2014* → *January 31 2014*40€90€80€  *February 1 2014* → *February 13 2014*

2014* → *March 5 2014*140€320€280€  *Sale in congress*180€400€340€

We recommend you to *carefully read the general conditions* since the past
year a number of restrictions on the purchase of tickets with student
discount was added. Specifically, as student we will only accept people who
are NOT active in some form and prove their student status with the
*registration
for the current course* (we won’t accept student ID cards). And above all,
we will not issue invoices to people who have registered as a student.

New this year, after many requests from you, *the payment of the ticket
will be possible during the process of registration and by credit card*.
