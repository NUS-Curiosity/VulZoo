You have a cite for this? I'm pretty sure I've seen stats saying exactly the
opposite although I don't have them at hand. Nobody says PCI is perfect or will
prevent you from being compromised. Like any security control, it just makes it
less likely. PCI compliance is point-in-time. What often happens is that they
have an audit (one a year so it is "current" even 6 months later) where they
are found to be compliant and then over time things slide and then they are
breached.

PCI is a standard which provides actuall security for card data making it worth
doing yet doesn't bankrupt the industry. Nobody says it is perfect. No standard
ever will be. Arguing against a standard on that basis is not reasonable.

Someone has to audit otherwise there is no way to ensure appropriate security
is in place. Your assertion that auditing/certification cannot be involved in
any security mandate is a non-starter.
