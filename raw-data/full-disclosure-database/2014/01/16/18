 ask nicely

So really there's nothing to do then. We just have to accept that large
corporations will continue to roll out products with poor security and
that's the way it will always be. A good environment to make some money in
as a security consultant I guess!? If you can go in to pentest and find
some easy catches like the EE BrightBox then there's good money to be made
- and easy money at that lol ;-)
