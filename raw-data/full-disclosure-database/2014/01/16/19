No standards are needed. Attach a nominal dollar amount to the data.
That will unbalance the risk equations and the industry will act on
its own.

For example, if it takes 2 hours to reset  to all your passwords
(password reuse is rampant), then allow a consumer to recover $250 for
their time. If PII is lost allow them damages of 7 years of credit
reporting (about $150) plus actual damages from any loss.

Hell, I had to overnight a credit card last summer while on business
that was cancelled due to a breach. That cost me $75.00. Perhaps
triple damages are in order, too.

Computing is a privilege, not a right.

Should Sony continue to be allowed to compute when they suffered at
least 50 incidents, including dataloss
(http://attrition.org/security/rants/sony_aka_sownage.html)? Hell,
Sony suffered 7 different incidents in one month
(http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201121/7185/Seven-security-incidents-in-two-months-Sony-s-nightmare-grows).

How much time an aggravation have they caused to institutions and consumers?

That's driving drunk on the information superhighway.
