Subject: Re: EE BrightBox router hacked - bares all if you
 ask nicely

No sir, I believe I should have been more explicit at that than I was
-- I did not mean to say it is about nationalities. What I meant was a
simple matter of development costs when hiring personnel, and I think
you won't argue that a developer in UK costs less than a developer in
e.g. China or Pakistan, or Poland, or Belarus to that matter, will
you? It doesn't have anything to do with their culture at all, and
this point is proven by businesses hiring more and more from those
countries, simply because it is cheap. Please do not try to find any
point to start a "is this because I'm {insert something here}" thread
-- there was no intention to hurt anyone, and I did mean no offense to
any of the people of whatever race, nationality, or sexual
preferences, or whatever else, and I apologise if it sounded like
that. Let's abstract from whatever is used to differentiate between
social groups and concentrate on costs and expenses alone, alright?

What I was trying to say is that making a good and secure product is
not that important for the industry. Making a product that is "good
enough" is, and note that "good enough" does not include exhaustive
usability or security testing -- nobody is really willing to pay for
that. Maybe this is the problem we all should try to solve instead of
being shocked by another "0day haxx" of a cheap router provided by a
cheap ISP?

True, there are folks that care, like Scott, but how many of them are
out there? I bet it is well below 1% of all the users of that ISP.
Even if he would be willing to pay more for "more secure" product,
this likely won't justify the ISP's expenses on actually implementing
the additional security measures for existing products, testing them,
and, more important, keeping the firmware images up to date with
latest security patches (I bet it is not patched regularly, same as
all the others). So how can a company spend an extra budget on a SIRT
team + dev trainings + ... and still be competitive on the consumer
device market, where price is all that matters to most of buyers?
Discuss?
