OK.. What standard do you want to hoist as a legal mandate?

Bonus points for finding a standard that provides enough *actual* security
that it is worth doing, but yet won't bankrupt the industry.  Consider that
of all the credit-card breaches we've seen so far this century, something
outrageous like 97% of the victim companies had current audits that listed
them as being 100% PCI compliant at the time of the incident.

So how do you do it so it actually adds security, rather than just being
a huge government-mandate money transfer to the auditing/certification
groups involved?
