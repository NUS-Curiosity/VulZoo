Subject: Re: EE BrightBox router hacked - bares all if you
 ask nicely

True, some sort of legislation might do the trick, but there is always
this nasty question which we all really hate: who is going to pay for
that? We can't burden national budgets with stuff like that, ISPs do
not produce more than they are paid by customers, so... end users! So
technically, we'll be forcing end users to pay more for something they
do not care as much about. :-) Also, the "standards" would need to be
defined somehow (see Huawei vs U.S. of A. and other countries).

With regards to security costs, my freelance programming experience
tells me that people tend to produce no more than they are paid for;
assuming someone would work extra hours to implement something not
previously negotiated (see above) and hence not paid for is a bit
naive (no offense). Same goes for companies that do outsourcing
contracts, they are paid by hours and they pay by hours, so sometimes
you are actually asked NOT to put in extra effort. :-) As for basic
security practices, well, the device does ask for password, doesn't
it. :-) Seems we should define "basic" here.

A somewhat related point is that these "basic security practices" you
mention are not actually taught anywhere on CS courses one would
usually take, even less so on some "teach yourself {a language} in 21
days" sort of courses/books. It is a ground-breaking revelation for
many development folks that you can compromise an application via a
crafted data file exploiting some sort of a buffer overflow!
