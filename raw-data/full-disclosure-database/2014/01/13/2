BlackArch Linux is an Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution for pentesters and
security researchers. The BlackArch package repository is compatible with
existing Arch installs.

Here is our website: http://www.blackarch.org/

Here are some of BlackArch's features:

  - Support for i686 and x86_64 architectures
  - Over 600 tools (constantly increasing)
  - Modular package groups
  - A live ISO with multiple window managers, including dwm, Fluxbox, Openbox,
    Awesome, wmii, i3, and Spectrwm.
  - An installer with the ability to build from source.

Soon we will release:

  - ARM support
  - Documentation for all tools

We are also releasing a tool to fetch and search exploit archives called
sploitctl[0].

Nullsecurity[1] is an official supporter of BlackArch Linux.

We have a relaxed development structure. We welcome pull requests of all sizes
through Github[2] and email[3].

Also see our Twitter account[4] and IRC channel[5].

Please report bugs and feature/tool requests through Github, email, twitter, or
IRC. Feel free to post requests for your own tools.
