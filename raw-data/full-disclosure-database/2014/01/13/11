Subject: Re: Microsoft Twitter accounts,
	blog hijacked by SEA

respectfully , almost a whole country+1 pwned with a retard wmd trick and
many massacres later they don't look embarrassed or anything .
why would a targeted attack by extremely skilled n determined dudez on a
lame big biz be embarrassing ?
btw , not into "the next big thing" theme -- but like to add : Watering
hole vectors are going get more sophisticated exponentially widespread
almost indistinguishable from Psycops from a Civilian POV . the kinda folks
i know able to finger MS definitely have better things to do than
"only" teenage games of tweet hacks -- here is an angle ;)
