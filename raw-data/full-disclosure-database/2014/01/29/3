-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

A tribune is a type of chatroom.

The module doesn't sufficiently filter user provided text from Tribune node
titles.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission to create a Tribune node.

     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

   * Tribune 7.x-3.x versions.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Tribune [4]
module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Remove the module or otherwise mitigate the issue.
