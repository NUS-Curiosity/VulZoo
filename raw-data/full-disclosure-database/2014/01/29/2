Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2014-007 - Services -
	Multiple access	bypass vulnerabilities

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2184843

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-007
   * Project: Services [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 7.x
   * Date: 2014-January-29
   * Security risk: Highly critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Multiple access bypass vulnerabilities

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to expose an API to third party systems using REST,
XML-RPC or other protocols.

The form API provides a method for developers to submit forms
programmatically using the function drupal_form_submit(). During programmatic
form submissions, all access checks are deliberately bypassed, and any form
element may be submitted regardless of the current user's access level.

To facilitate this, a new, optional
$form_state['programmed_bypass_access_check'] element has been added to the
Drupal 7 form API. If this is provided and set to FALSE, drupal_form_submit()
will perform the normal form access checks against the current user while
submitting the form, rather than bypassing them.

Services relies heavily on programmatic form submission and therefore needs
to use this new $form_state['programmed_bypass_access_check'] so that access
control parameters and hooks are performed for untrusted users.
