This won't work quite as expected. FF only hides search plugins when you
"Remove" them from the list. If you attempt to add the DDG plugin
directly from their webpage, an error message will notify you that a
plugin of that name already exists whether it's hidden or not.

The only real solution is to edit the plugin definition file (as root).
I found it under:

/usr/lib/firefox/distribution/searchplugins/locale/en-US/duckduckgo.xml

Remove this line near the bottom:

  <Param name="t" value="canonical"/>

I'm fairly sure you'll have to do this after each update too.

[Sorry if this doesn't thread right; I just joined the list]
