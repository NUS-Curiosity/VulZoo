Subject: Re: Romanian hacker unknown string

It could mean anything. I'm just asking how you got that string. Hell, the
string of numbers '199403' could be there because in the 1994 world cup
Romania got to the 3rd to last game from the World Cup Final. Given enough
random chars in a random file you could probably get lots of allusions to
Romania. Given a string in a passwd file somewhere it could be less likely
to be a coincidence.
