 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:010
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : memcached
 Date    : January 17, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0, Enterprise Server 5.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in
 memcached:
 
 The process_bin_delete function in memcached.c in memcached 1.4.4 and
 other versions before 1.4.17, when running in verbose mode, allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault)
 via a request to delete a key, which does not account for the lack
 of a null terminator in the key and triggers a buffer over-read when
 printing to stderr (CVE-2013-0179).
 
 memcached before 1.4.17 allows remote attackers to bypass
 authentication by sending an invalid request with SASL credentials,
 then sending another request with incorrect SASL credentials
 (CVE-2013-7239).
 
 The do_item_get function in items.c in memcached 1.4.4 and other
 versions before 1.4.17, when running in verbose mode, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a
 request to delete a key, which does not account for the lack of a null
 terminator in the key and triggers a buffer over-read when printing to
 stderr, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0179 (CVE-2013-7290).
 
 memcached before 1.4.17, when running in verbose mode, allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a request
 that triggers an unbounded key print during logging, related to an
 issue that was quickly grepped out of the source tree, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2013-0179 and CVE-2013-7290 (CVE-2013-7291).
 
 The updated packages have been upgraded to the 1.4.17 version which
 is unaffected by these issues.
