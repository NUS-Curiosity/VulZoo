   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-004
   * Project: Secure Cookie Data [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 7.x
   * Date: 2014-January-22
   * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]

   * Vulnerability: Information Disclosure, Multiple vulnerabilities

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module allows for storing data securely in a cookie through implementing
the Secure Cookie Protocol [3].

.... Ability to alter trusted data in the cookie

The module did an incorrect comparison of the HMAC [4] value, allowing a
bypass of the HMAC verification which allows changing the cookie value.

.... Known encryption key value

The key for the HMAC provided a default that was hardcoded. The module relied
on the extension of the base class to provide a per site specific key.
