Subject: [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2014-003 - Doubleclick
	for Publishers	DFP - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

View online: https://drupal.org/node/2179085

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-003
   * Project: Doubleclick for Publishers (DFP) [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 7.x
   * Date: 2014-January-22
   * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module enables you to create blocks to place advertisements from the
Google Double Click for Publishers API (DFP).

The module doesn't sufficiently sanitize the slot names prior to output into
HTML.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role
with the permission "administer dfp".


-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

   * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

   * DFP 7.x-1.x versions prior to 7.x-1.2.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Doubleclick
for Publishers (DFP) [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:

   * If you use the DFP module for Drupal 7.x, upgrade to Google DFP 7.x-1.2
     [5]

Also see the Doubleclick for Publishers (DFP) [6] project page.
