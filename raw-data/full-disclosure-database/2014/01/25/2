it is in my best interest not to pursue this effort any further.  the
donations received for this have gone to Cryptome instead for their
FOIA efforts.



if you would like to pursue your own requests please do so:

"Citizen's Guide on Using the Freedom of Information Act"
https://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/citizen.html

and  DOJ_361_revised_2-certification_of_identity.pdf if making
requests on behalf other individuals.



freedom of information laws are important and should be supported!
  perhaps i can do more at a later date...
