Subject: Dictatorial laws in Ukraine

Hello participants of Mailing List.

Last week I wrote about multiple vulnerabilities at president.gov.ua 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jan/125). This is continuation of 
that letter.

I remind you, that in Ukraine last week parliament in non-constitutional way 
voted for "Dictatorial laws" 
(https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPR/status/425224768334225408) and president 
quickly signed them. The dictatorial laws (especially #3879 one) forbid a 
lot of things and introduce censorship, including censorship in Internet - 
SOPA can't be even compared to it. Because president ignored all protests 
against these laws (the same as previous two months of protests), it leaded 
to more active protests since 19.01.2013.

At this week these laws were officially printed and since 22.01.2013 they 
are working. And on Wednesday after 16:00 two my sites were closed (domains 
were deactivated) by provider due to "decision of special services". It was 
due to that video about our president, which I "published" at president's 
site via Content Spoofing vulnerability.

This is dictatorial law in action. Now they can turned off any site for 
defamation (and other things). And they can do it without decision of a 
court - very quickly close any site on Ukrainian hosting and domains.

After wasting a lot of time till the end of the day I returned my domains 
back. But removed flv-file from my site. And last night I put video-file to 
foreign server, so Ukrainian special services can't shut it down :-).

So here is "republished" video at president's web site, in which Victor 
Yanukovich told about his corruption and criminal actions (on Ukrainian 
language).

Use this new URL. Spread it all over social networks, as I did last night in 
my accounts.
