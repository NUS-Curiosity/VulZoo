0x001. “L’apéritif” / Introduction


“L’apéritif” (/ɑːˌpɛɹɪˈtiːf/, /əˌpɛɹɪˈtiːf/) Borrowing from French
“apéritif”: An alcoholic drink served before a meal as an appetizer.

The “Nuit Du Hack” conference was initiated in 2003 by the French
hacking group: HackerZvoice. This event has been gathering people
willing to learn and share their knowledge around lectures and
challenges since. Originally reuniting 20 persons, the Nuit Du Hack has
never stopped growing by gathering more and more people from passionate
to the professional area.
Since 2010, in order to improve the quality and the accessibility of
this event, talks and workshops in English are possible.
In 2013, the event announced several lecturers of international reknown
and rallied more than 1500 fans including more than 50 challengers
fighting in teams.

The 13th edition of the Nuit Du Hack will be held at Disneyland Paris
convention center on June 28th, 2014. So if you’re interested in
Hacking, This is Le place to be if you’re in Paris during the summer. Mkay?

0x010. “À la carte” / Topics
