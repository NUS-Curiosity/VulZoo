Subject: DAVOSET v.1.1.6

Hello participants of Mailing List.

After making public release of DAVOSET
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-June/008850.html),
I've made next update of the software. At 24th of January DAVOSET v.1.1.6
was released - DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool
(http://websecurity.com.ua/davoset/). This is Revolution Edition.

In new version there were added new services into full list of zombies and
removed non-working services from lists of zombies, added support of
trailing slash in URL for translate.yandex.net and improved algorithm of
work with open files. There were added three sites of Yandex - in addition
to sites of Google, W3C and a lot of other web sites (who don't want to fix
their holes for many years).

In total there are 141 zombie-services in the list, which are ready to
strike against ill-intentioned regime.

Best wishes & regards,
