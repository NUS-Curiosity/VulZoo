 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2014:022
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : augeas
 Date    : January 24, 2014
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated augeas packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Multiple flaws were found in the way Augeas handled configuration files
 when updating them. An application using Augeas to update configuration
 files in a directory that is writable to by a different user (for
 example, an application running as root that is updating files in a
 directory owned by a non-root service user) could have been tricked
 into overwriting arbitrary files or leaking information via a symbolic
 link or mount point attack (CVE-2012-0786, CVE-2012-0787).
 
 A flaw was found in the way Augeas handled certain umask settings
 when creating new configuration files. This flaw could result
 in configuration files being created as world writable, allowing
 unprivileged local users to modify their content (CVE-2013-6412).
