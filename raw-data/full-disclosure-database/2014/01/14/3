Subject: Ubuntu, duckduckgo, and additional info

Any particular reason when setting duckduckgo as the default search
and searching from the url bar we get an additional nugget of info
sent?  Case in point:

GET /?q=add+duckduckgo&t=canonical HTTP/1.1
Host    duckduckgo.com
User-Agent    Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:26.0)
Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0
Accept   
text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language    en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding    gzip, deflate
DNT    1
Connection    keep-alive

I didn't add canonical...so why is it there?  In about:config I see

distribution.id             canonical

Why is this being sent?  Duckduckgo didn't respond, so I thought I'd
ask here.  Ironic...
