Package        : curl
Vulnerability  : information disclosure
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0015

Paras Sethia discovered that libcurl, a client-side URL transfer
library, would sometimes mix up multiple HTTP and HTTPS connections
with NTLM authentication to the same server, sending requests for one
user over the connection authenticated as a different user.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze7.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy8.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.35.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
