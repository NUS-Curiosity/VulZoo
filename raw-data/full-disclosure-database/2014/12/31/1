Subject: [FD] [KIS-2014-14] Osclass <= 3.4.2 (Search::setJsonAlert) SQL
 Injection Vulnerability

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Osclass <= 3.4.2 (Search::setJsonAlert) SQL Injection Vulnerability
-------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://osclass.org/	


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 3.4.2 and probably prior versions.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability exists because user input passed through the "alert" parameter when subscribing
to a search alert is not properly validated before being stored into the DB (s_search field of
the oc_t_alerts table). This can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
SQL commands via several parameters passed to the "Search::setJsonAlert()" method, which are
later used to make a SQL query within the "Search::doSearch()" method.

NOTE: this vulnerability might be abused to reset the administrator's password and consequently
gain access to the administration panel in order to achieve arbitrary PHP code execution.


[-] Solution:

Update to version 3.4.3 or later.
