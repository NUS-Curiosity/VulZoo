Subject: [FD] Positive Hack Days V — Call for Papers

Every night when we go to sleep we have a chance to wake up in another universe. At any time, the expanding to infinity universe may turn back and then rush to the start point. Or maybe finish point. Back to singularity.

The cyber universe has plunged into turmoil. Cyber criminals and special agencies operating beyond the society control start us thinking whether it is a good decision to live in a cyber world, where threats are real while justice is impossible. A world where boundaries are transparent for some people but turn into the walls of a prison for others. A world where students can build a satellite in a lab and automatic call centers determine you mood from your voice. A world where anybody can create his or her own universe, but most people prefer to stay passive observers of others' creations. A world where every word you say will be stored, indexed and used against you. A world that knows about every step you make and every cent you spend.

Now we are close enough to the bifurcation point and even an insignificant influence can cause a shattering avalanche. So what is lying ahead? Is it going to be a high-tech Barbarism from The Bridge trilogy by William Gibson and the land of of Pelevin's "zukerbrins" or the new Noon, XXII century when human civilization raises up to the next level, overcoming the diseases and exploring other planets?

We invite you to do part for the world future and participate in the Forum as a speaker. Positive Hack Days V will take place on May 26 and 27, 2015.

What is PHDays

Positive Hack Days is a annual international forum on practical information security held by Positive Technologies since 2011. The PHDays programme consists of two large blocks combining theory and practice. These are the conference and the contests.

What is waiting for you at PHDays V? 3,000 specialists from all over the world, six conference flows, 15,000 online participants, CTF and competitions based on real incidents, no cliches and advertisement propaganda, an opportunity to experiment with hard-to-get equipment, excitement of path breaking, hackers and security experts networking.

Topics

We are expecting researches that develop and advance modern information technologies. If you have found a new vulnerability, developed new protection methods, organized an international CERT, or estimated the moonlight influence on people behavior in social networks and credit card fraud — then the PHDays Forum is an excellent place to share your results with thousands of experts.

This year, we are organizing something new — a separate flow for developers to discuss the problems of high-load and embedded systems development, Big Data practical use, and Internet stability improvement.

If you believe your talk will be interesting for the community, please, feel free to apply. The most important thing for a research to apply is to be unique and provide a fresh, hacking look at modern information technologies and their role in our life.

Participation format and selection principles

• Talk (50 minutes)
• Fast Track (15 minutes)
• Hands-on Lab (up to 4 hours)

If you have something interesting and surprising to show, but no of the above-listed formats is good for you, please, feel free to apply anyway and be sure we will consider your work.

There are no tight restrictions: anyone from a novice to a recognized expert in information security can be a speaker. Every application is considered by our international program committee traditionally consisting of the most competent experts. They will select the best works!

Please, submit your application at http://cfp.phdays.com/en/phd5/cfp/session/new.

We will not accept applications from PR or other representatives of researchers. We will not accept works aimed at promoting products, services, or companies.

The works based on the recent investigations will be preferred, as well as the reviews of new program tools and vulnerabilities.

The application should contain the following information:

1) Speaker's name, country and city of residence and contacts (e-mail address, phone number).
2) Curriculum vitae including education, main speeches and published articles.
3) The topic, title, and brief summary of the talk.
4) Other investigations in this field. Why is your work especially noteworthy?
7) Places where the investigation has been already shown including events, blogs, online and offline titles.

Please, specify whether you will be able to provide us with the full text of your research or with the presentation only. Mark what the preferred language of speech for you is.

It is recommended that you send additional materials, utilities, and practical examples to help us understand the essence of your work. You are welcome to submit several applications, but all separately.

For additional information, please write to cfp@...ays.com<mailto:cfp@...ays.com>. We urge you to use this e-mail address instead of asking the program committee members personally.

IMPORTANT DATES

The applications for participation in the conference will be accepted in two stages:

• the first stage: from December 3, 2014 to January 30, 2015,
• the second stage: from February 16, 2015 to March 31, 2015.

Every applicant will receive a response with the results within two weeks after the stage closing.

BUG BOUNTY

For CFP, we use an open-source system Frab. We will appreciate if you pay attention to this service in the course of traditional examination of the conference resources (the source code can be found at https://github.com/frab/frab).

We are going to invite those who will reveal unknown vulnerabilities in Frab to visit PHDays for free. Please, do not perform destructive actions against the Frab site lest we lose our speakers.

TRANSPORT AND ACCOMMODATIONЕ

Talk:

• return economy air tickets,
• one ticket to the Forum per speaker,
• a hotel room for three nights per speaker.

Fast Track: one ticket to the Forum per speaker.

Hands-On Lab:

Every speaker (except FastTrack authors) will receive two additional "student" tickets to the Forum. These tickets can be used by high school graduates, students, and Ph. D. candidates.
We guarantee all the participants two days of good mood, interesting people, and new experience.

We are waiting for your applications!
