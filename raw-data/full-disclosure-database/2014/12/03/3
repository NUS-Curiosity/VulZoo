Subject: [FD] hack4 is coming - hackercon in berlin - date: end of the year
	2014

h4ppy hello!

Intr0:	

we have decided to not drive to hamburg this year, instead bringing up our own 
conference in g00d 0ld berlin. 

hack4 aims on tech talks and tech stuff - no politix.

even though we are looking for talks it is completely fine to just bring your 
box put it on the table and connect it to the inet. spending whole time 
exploring and discussing with (new) friends about networks, languages, 
applications and how to break them.

please be aware we have only a limited number of seats, first come first serve.

cfp: 
you want to do a talk? awesome send more infos to: talks@...k4.org
we are not looking for any sort of rocket science here. pragmatic first.

where: Berlin
date: 29th/30th of December
entry fee: 	none

Confirmed events:
* Exploit Alchemy - how to aquire privileges in system services? by kingcope
* Cryptoanalysis for beginners - A handson into Numbertheorie and linear 
algebra with sage - by theAluc
* ShellcodingLab - Well its about shellcode - by dash
