Subject: [FD] SpoofedMe - Social Login Impersonation Attack

Hi,

We have discovered an impersonation attack on social login protocols (e.g. 
Oauth 1.0 / 2.0 used for authentication) based on a combination of an 
implementation vulnerability existing in some identity providers (e.g. 
LinkedIn, which has fixed the issue) and a known design problem in the 
relying (third-party) website side.

The identity provider vulnerability is allowing the use of un-verified 
email in the social login authentication process, making it possible for 
an adversary to fake ownership of an email address and log into a victim's 
account.

By exploiting the vulnerability we successfully impersonated a Slashdot 
(test) account using the (now patched) LinkedIn provider.
