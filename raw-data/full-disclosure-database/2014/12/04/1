Subject: Re: [FD] XSS (in 20 chars) in Microsoft IIS 7.5 error message

I believe that's the asp.net error page you're seeing (Was it yellow?) 

That exception is from Request Validation (which we don't consider a security boundary any more, and we advise folks to validate themselves, as validation is context specific).

You're seeing the dev error page, which by default is only shown if you're accessing via //localhost. Developers can override that setting to always show the default detailed errors to any client - we advise folks to not release with that enabled, but of course people don't always take that advice. The default "safe" error page wouldn't have any details of the exception thrown. (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/h0hfz6fc%28v=vs.100%29.aspx)

The Yellow Screen of Death should be encoding the exception message regardless. If you find it's not then I'll be very interested :)

Thank you all for the replies,

Unfortunately, I can no longer really test this (it was on some internal network, so for example link shortening wouldn't work), but I wanted to know if anyone had encountered this stuff before. I should try on a clean install as suggested - if it works I'll let you know.

For some unknown reason there was no HTML encoding in this error response, however the payload was truncated to 20 chars. I googled it and all I found was some discussion about the validateRequest attribute in web.config, however I didn't have the configuration of the server to check this.

This was also part of some commercial app that uses IIS, but I think it's more related to IIS itself.

Thanks all
