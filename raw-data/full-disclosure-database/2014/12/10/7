         CVE Name       

    Description  When handling a WebSocket frame the res_http_websocket       
                 module dynamically changes the size of the memory used to    
                 allow the provided payload to fit. If a payload length of    
                 zero was received the code would incorrectly attempt to      
                 resize to zero. This operation would succeed and end up      
                 freeing the memory but be treated as a failure. When the     
                 session was subsequently torn down this memory would get     
                 freed yet again causing a crash.                             
                                                                              
                 Users of the WebSocket functionality also did not take into  
                 account that provided text frames are not guaranteed to be   
                 NULL terminated. This has been fixed in chan_sip and         
                 chan_pjsip in the applicable versions.                       

    Resolution  Ensure the built-in HTTP server is disabled, upgrade to a     
                version listed below, or apply the applicable patch.          
                                                                              
                The change ensures that res_http_websocket does not treat     
                the freeing of memory when a payload length of zero is        
                received as fatal.
