 Privilege Escalation Security Vulnerabilities

*ESPN espn.go.com <http://espn.go.com/> Login & Register Page XSS and Dest
Redirect Privilege Escalation Security Vulnerabilities*





*Domain:*
http://espn.go.com/

television households (85.58% of households with at least one television
set) in the United States.[2]
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN#cite_note-2> In addition to the flagship

*Vulnerability description:*

Espn.go.com <http://espn.go.com/> has a security problem. It is vulnerable
to XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and Dest Redirect Privilege Escalation (Open
Redirect) attacks.


Those vulnerabilities are very dangerous. Since they happen at ESPN's
"login" & "register" pages that are credible. Attackers can abuse those
links to mislead ESPN's users. The success rate of attacks may be high.

During the tests, besides the links given above, large number of ESPN's
links are vulnerable to those attacks.


The vulnerability occurs at "espn.go.com"'s "login?" & "register" pages
with "redirect" parameter, i.e.
http://streak.espn.go.com/en/login?redirect=
https://r.espn.go.com/members/login?appRedirect=http%3A%2F%2Fr.espn.go.com
http://games.espn.go.com/world-cup-bracket-predictor/2014/es/login?redirect=
https://register.go.com/go/sendMemberNames?regFormId=espn&appRedirect=http://register.go.com/


Tests were performed on Firefox (33.0) in Ubuntu (14.04) and IE (8.0. 7601)
in Windows 8.
