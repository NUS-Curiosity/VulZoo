3. Problem Description 

   a. VMware vCSA cross-site scripting vulnerability

      VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a vulnerability
      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this 
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter. 

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for 
      reporting this issue to us. 

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
      has assigned the name CVE-2014-3797 to this issue. 

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is 
      available.

      Product        Version	on        Apply Patch

      vCSA           5.0        any       Not Affected

   b. vCenter Server certificate validation issue

      vCenter Server does not properly validate the presented certificate 
      when establishing a connection to a CIM Server residing on an ESXi 
      host. This may allow for a Man-in-the-middle attack against the CIM 
      service.

      this issue to us.
