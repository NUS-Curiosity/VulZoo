Subject: [FD] XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities in CMS Pylot

Hello list!

These are Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery 
vulnerabilities in CMS Pylot ("Пилот" on Russian).

It's Ukrainian commercial CMS from Delta-X.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of CMS Pylot.

Developers from Delta-X haven't answered and haven't fixed these 
vulnerabilities.

Details:
----------

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

Example of XSS for IE:

http://site/index_admin_login.php?return_path=%27%22%20style=xss:expression(alert(document.cookie))%201

Cross-Site Request Forgery (WASC-09):

http://site/index_admin_login.php

Lack of protection in login form, such as captcha, leads to possibility of 
conducting CSRF attacks, which I wrote about in the article Attacks on 
unprotected login forms 
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2011-April/007773.html). 
It allows to conduct remote login. But the from isn't vulnerable to Brute 
Force, since captcha appears after the first attempt.

Also it can be used for redirection. For these attacks it's needed to have 
working login and password:
