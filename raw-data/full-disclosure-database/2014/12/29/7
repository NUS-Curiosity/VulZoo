Subject: [FD] Reminder and Extension CanSecWest CFP deadline tomorrow,
	December 30th.

We were trying to push schedules up, but it was too close to Christmas, so
we've extended the deadline for the CanSecWest CFP to December 30th (or as
close to there as you can get, conf on March 18-20th).

 

Cheers, and a Happy New Year,

--dr
