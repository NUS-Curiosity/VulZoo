Subject: [FD] Vulnerabilities in Samsung SyncThru Web Service

Hello list!

There are Information Leakage and Insufficient Authorization vulnerabilities 
in SyncThru Web Service. This is web application for Samsung printers, 
particularly I found it with Samsung ML-1865W and other printers. Earlier I 
informed Samsung about it.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are SyncThru Web Service, Network Firmware 6.01 and previous 
versions (there are 7 different firmware in Samsung ML-1865W, as stated at 
Firmware Version page).

Details:

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

http://site
http://site:631

There is access without authorization to information about all settings of 
the printer (read only).

Insufficient Authorization (WASC-02):

In section Print Information it's possible to print test documents without 
authorization. Thus without login and password it's possible to waste paper 
and cartridge of the printer.

Also I found other Samsung printers (with earlier version of firmware), 
where function Direct Print was accessible without authorization. Which 
allows to print arbitrary documents.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/7513/).
