Subject: Re: [FD] The Misfortune Cookie Vulnerability

The most technical it seems to get is the following:

<quote>
The Misfortune Cookie vulnerability is exploitable due to an error within
the HTTP cookie management mechanism present in the affected software,
allowing an attacker to determine the ‘fortune’ of a request by
manipulating cookies. Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP cookies
that exploit the vulnerability to corrupt memory and alter the application
state. This, in effect, can trick the attacked web server to treat the
current session with administrative privileges.

From
http://mis.fortunecook.ie/misfortune-cookie-tr069-protection-whitepaper.pdf.

Would be very useful for the rest of us if this information were less of an
advert and more technical.

Shahar, are there plans to release proper technical details?
