Subject: Re: [FD] The Misfortune Cookie Vulnerability

Hi Sandro,
As I commented before, we are bound by policy that is out of my personal reach at the moment.
I can tell you, however, that when any independent researcher looks into the HTTP cookie parsing function in the RomPager 4.07 binary, his bounds will not be checked.

Cheers,
Shahar

Subject: Re: [FD] The Misfortune Cookie Vulnerability

The most technical it seems to get is the following:

<quote>
The Misfortune Cookie vulnerability is exploitable due to an error within the HTTP cookie management mechanism present in the affected software, allowing an attacker to determine the ‘fortune’ of a request by manipulating cookies. Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP cookies that exploit the vulnerability to corrupt memory and alter the application state. This, in effect, can trick the attacked web server to treat the current session with administrative privileges.

From http://mis.fortunecook.ie/misfortune-cookie-tr069-protection-whitepaper.pdf.

Would be very useful for the rest of us if this information were less of an advert and more technical.

Shahar, are there plans to release proper technical details?

I think you might have accidentally pasted the wrong link. This one
doesn't seem to contain additional information.
