Notes on stored XSS:  You could argue that stored XSS on an router
admin application that is only used by one person is not that big of a
deal, mainly because the attacker would need authenticated access to
"plant" the malicious payload.   Unfortunately, because the tested
version was also vulnerable to CSRF and reflected XSS, the risk is
much greater.  An admin who fell victim to a CSRF or reflected XSS
attack once could be forced into planting a JavaScript backdoor, that
would call back to the attacker every time the victim admin visits the
page with the malicious stored XSS payload.

Solution:
-------------
I tested my Comcast Xfinity device on December 10th, 2014 and it is no
longer vulnerable (version 7.6.86L.CT).  If you have an Arris
modem/router, contact your ISP (or Arris) to verify that your firmware
has been updated to address this vulnerability... or you could fire up
Burp and see for yourself ;)
