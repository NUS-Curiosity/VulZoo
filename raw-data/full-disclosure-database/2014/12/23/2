Vulnerability Description:

==========================


 The Content Management System Serendipity v.2.0-rc1 has a stored
XSS-vulnerability in its comment functionality. Arbitrary HTML- and/or
JavaScriptcode is stored in the database. On the frontend side, it gets
sanitized, while on the administrative backend, where new comments are
displayed to the administrator after login, it gets immidiately executed.


 ==================

Technical Details:

==================


 If an attacker is posting arbitrary HTML- and/or JavaScriptcode in a
comment, which for example is located in the following URL, it will be
stored in the database without being sanitized.


 http://
{HOSTNAME/DOMAIN}/serendipity/index.php?/archives/{TITLE-OF-THE-BLOG-ENTRY}.html#comments


 When the comments are displayed on the frontend, they will be sanitized,
while on the administrative backend it gets displayed unsanitized and is
being executed, because the latest comments are shown, after an
administrative user has been logged in to the following URL:


 http://{HOSTNAME/DOMAIN}/serendipity/serendipity_admin.php
