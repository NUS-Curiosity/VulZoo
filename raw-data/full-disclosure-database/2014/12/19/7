Subject: [FD] BF and XSS vulnerabilities in D-Link DCS-2103

Hello list!

There are Brute Force and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in D-Link 
DCS-2103 (IP camera). If previous Path Traversal and Full path disclosure 
vulnerabilities were post-auth, then these BF and XSS vulnerabilities are 
pre-auth.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: D-Link DCS-2103, Firmware 1.0.0. For BF 
vulnerability version 1.20 and previous versions are vulnerable.

Developers refused to fix BF vulnerability (they think that it's problem of 
a user to have strong password) and XSS vulnerability was fixed in firmware 
version 1.20.

2014.05.22-2014.11.26 - conversation with D-Link about vulnerabilities in 
DAP-1360.
2014.08.01 - announced at my site about vulnerabilities in DCS-2103.
2014.11.14-2014.12.13 - conversation with D-Link about vulnerabilities in 
DCS-2103.
2014.12.16 - disclosed at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/7288/).

I found this and other web cameras during summer to watch terrorists 
activities in Donetsk and Lugansks regions of Ukraine 
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2014-November/009062.html) 
and also I took under control web cameras in Russia 
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2014-December/009065.html).
