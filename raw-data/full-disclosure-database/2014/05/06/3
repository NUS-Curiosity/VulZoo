ACK. Unfortunately not all people follow your and my advice...

This poorly crafted plague also creates the following "Run" command lines

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]
"iCloudServices"="C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Apple\\Internet Services\\iCloudServices.exe"
"ApplePhotoStreams"="C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Apple\\Internet Services\\ApplePhotoStreams.exe"

which run "C:\Program.exe" (and "C:\Program Files.exe" on x64),
"C:\Program Files\Common.exe" (and "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common.exe"
on x64) or "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Apple\Internet.exe" (and
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Apple\Internet.exe" on x64) during
user login, and COM resp. "shell" objects

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{81E8B13B-EDEA-FF08-90CB-47D97550AD14}\Shell\Open\Command]
@=expand:"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Apple\\Internet Services\\iCloud.exe"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{FF982CA0-9F7A-42D5-82B8-155B74904925}\LocalServer32]
@="C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Apple\\Internet Services\\AppleOutlookDAVConfig64.exe"

with still more unquoted command lines.


It's a shame that developers still dont know how to handle pathnames
containing spaces properly and that their QA is sound asleep!
