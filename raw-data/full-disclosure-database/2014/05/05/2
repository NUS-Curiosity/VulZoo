Subject: [FD] Heartbleed client side analysis tool published

Hi List!

We are happy to announce hbad (heartbleed analysis daemon).

If a request is sent to the hbad server by any client (e.g. IRC,
Fetchmail, browser), the server initiates the SSL handshake and checks
the SSL header for the Heartbeat addon. If it is available, it indicates
the client uses OpenSSL. Thereupon the hbad server sends a Heartbeat
request back to the client. If the client runs a vulnerable OpenSSL
version, it sends back the Heartbeat response, which contains the
sensitive data.

Find the blogentry here:
