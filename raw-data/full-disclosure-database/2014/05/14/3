Subject: Re: [FD] So You Like Pain and Vulnerability Management? New Article.

Pedro,

I think you misinterpreted the article.  I can see how his writing style can be confusing with all the joking and contradictions throughout. I had to reread it twice to make sure I was taking away what was intended 

Just to be clear though, I agree and don't think it really adds value for those of us that already do vulnerability management, however, if written clearer, I could see this as being beneficial to those that don't understand VM and to drive away the misconception that VM is just patching and will make you secure. 

One thing I would like to see us get away from as a community is silo'ing VM as something special. I think we need to be more holistic and include threats (TVM) as part of the larger picture. Doing so increases you VM ROI and actually gets you closer to a more secure baseline as you can select appropriate controls (caveat: if done properly). 

Daniel
