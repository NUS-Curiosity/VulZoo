Subject: [FD] CVE-2014-3447 - Remote Denial Of Service in BSS Continuity CMS

Vulnerability title: Remote Denial Of Service in BSS Continuity CMS
CVE: CVE-2014-3447
Vendor: BSS
Product: Continuity CMS
Affected version: 4.2.22640.0
Fixed version: N/A
Reported by: Jerzy Kramarz

Details:

By repeatedly calling node enumeration script, a remote unauthenticated
attacker can overload the underlying database within a few minutes. An
average number of GET requests that would stop the database supporting
the CMS were found to be 70, and in this point the Database daemon have
to be restarted. The vulnerability exists within the system due to heavy
processing invoked by the 'fix paths' script, which attempts to connect
to every node in the system and reiterate its properties via database
update function.
