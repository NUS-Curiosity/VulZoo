Subject: [FD] 2 security bugs in Dlink router DIR-605L

DIR-605L (Hardware version Ax, firmware 1.14) has two severe security bug:

1. The login password is printed out in clear text in the "Current Network Setting" page (just after login) "Device Info" section.

2. The router can be controlled using a crafted URL (GET request), even without login

e.g. use any browser to visit "http://192.168.0.1/Status/wan_button_action.asp?connect=true"

Since the "report vulnerability" function of the Dlink website not work, the bug has been reported to "webmaster" of Dlink via e-mail.
