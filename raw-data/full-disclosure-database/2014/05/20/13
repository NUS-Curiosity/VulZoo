Subject: Re: [FD] A way to trigger CVE-2014-1322 (userspace read kernel
	pointer)?

Yes and no.

On the first machine (OS X 10.9.2 (13C1021)) I got no pointer. Compiled
with Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn).

On the second machine (OS X 10.9.2 (13C64)) I got a pointer. Compiled
with Apple LLVM version 5.0 (clang-500.2.79) (based on LLVM 3.3svn).

Br,
Christian
