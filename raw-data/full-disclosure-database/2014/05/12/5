Subject: [FD] So You Like Pain and Vulnerability Management? New Article.

"Hi, Im your friend and security researcher, Pete Herzog. You might
know me from other public service announcements such as the widely
anticipated, upcoming workshop Secrets of Security, and critics
choice award winners: Teaching Your Teen to Hack Police Cars, and
Help! My Monkey is Posting Pictures to Facebook!

But Im here today to take a moment and talk to you about the pain of
neglect, isolation, abuse, and infection, better known as
vulnerability management. In many ways vulnerability management can
be part of a healthy system and over-all good security. But theres
many important differences between vulnerability management and
security that you should know about:"

That's how my new article starts. 5 points on the pain of
vulnerability management and how to make it hurt less. It's posted
here:

and #helpmymonkeyispostingpicturestofacebook ;)

Sincerely,
-pete.
