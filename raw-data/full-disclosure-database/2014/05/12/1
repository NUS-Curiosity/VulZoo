Subject: Re: [FD] [oss-security] CVE-2014-0196: Linux kernel pty layer race
 condition memory corruption

Hi,

I've written a "slightly-less-than-POC" privilege escalation exploit for
this vulnerability that works on newer kernels:
http://bugfuzz.com/stuff/cve-2014-0196-md.c (SHA1:
6b1c5c651231b33a5e11b5c8c6ed07cd15f658f5)

Note the warning mentioned in the header; run it at your own risk ;)
