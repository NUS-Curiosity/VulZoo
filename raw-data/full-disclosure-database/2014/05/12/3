Yes, 2.6.31-rc3 and newer:

Luckily, apparently the bug was not backported to RHEL5:

https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0196

"This issue does not affect the versions of the kernel package as
shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2 may address this issue."
