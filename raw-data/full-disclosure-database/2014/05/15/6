Subject: Re: [FD] AirDroid Lock Screen Bypass

Good Morning,
Although this is not something that I would personally call a
vulnerability, I can see your reason for concern. In order for an attacker
to successfully exploit this, they would not only have to gain access to
your physical phone but also gain access to your Airdroid account.

You have 2 options if you want to eliminate this concern.
1) Revoke "Device Administrator" access to AirDroid. This can be done in
the Android Settings > Security > Device Administrator menu.
2) Set AirDroid not to prompt you for remote access.
