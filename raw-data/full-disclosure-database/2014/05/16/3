Subject: [FD] UPS Web/SNMP-Manager CS121 authentication bypass,
	credentials leak, ...

UPS Web/SNMP-Manager CS121 by Generex comes in with a default enabled "service"-port, that makes it possible to bypass any specified login for HTTP(s), snmp or telnet. 

CS121 is a widely used management card in ups systems from Legrand, Rittal, Eaton,  AEG, Masterguard....

Attached is a poc, found and proofed on Legrand ups with different firmware releases. If you are hardcore enough, you may also flash your own HyNetOS-firmware and take over the world ;-)
