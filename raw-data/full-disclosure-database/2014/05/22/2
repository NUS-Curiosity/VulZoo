Subject: [FD]  rcrypt packer/crypter writeup and POC tool

I've written and released a packer/crypter called rcrypt that might be 
fun for some of you to play around with. The latest public version is 
1.4 although there is a functional 1.5 non public version currently in 
progress.

The general summary is as follows:

rcrypt is a Windows PE binary crypter (a type of packer) that makes use 
of timelock techniques to cause a delay in execution. This delay can 
cause analysis to fail on time constrained systems such as on disk 
scanners. rcrypt can pack exes and dll files.

It bypasses KAV and many others. I'm always interested in feedback and 
suggestions/criticisms.

There are many other features and functions as well!

Released on my site: http://www.0xrage.com/?p=210
Writeup also available: http://www.0xrage.com/?p=200

enjoy!
