Nobody said anything about it being "unlikely". What's being argued is that
if your bug requires ad-hoc conditions to be exploited then it's more than
likely not a security bug at all - in all the scenarios proposed here, the
ad-hoc conditions are the problem, and there would be infinite more ways of
"exploiting" them.

This way of reporting fake security problems is good for gaining publicity
real fast, but not for much else. It's just noise.
