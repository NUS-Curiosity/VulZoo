Microsoft has been clear on this point, even from Vista as an old 
Symantec report notes:

"This message has been echoed by others at Microsoft in response to 
vulnerabilities being discovered in
UAC. Microsoftâ€™s message is that UAC vulnerabilities are not considered 
security issues, as UAC does
not provide a security boundary."

and they

"observed that the User Account Control can be easily disabled 
manually... via the Local Security Policy tool included in Windows 
Vista."
