Subject: [FD] LE, BF and IAA vulnerabilities in Catapulta I.W. Edition

Hello list!

These are Login Enumeration, Brute Force and Insufficient Anti-automation 
vulnerabilities in Catapulta I.W. Edition.

This is commercial CMS. It's used at web site of one presidential contender 
in Ukraine (the elections were last Sunday), where I found these 
vulnerabilities at 28.01.2014. This politic never cared about security of 
his web site and his site was hacked in 2009, so no surprise he used 
vulnerable CMS this year too and still haven't fixed holes - as these ones, 
as many others. There are many interesting Information Leakage 
vulnerabilities at that web site, but as I found they are related to site 
configuration or non-default CMS configuration and are not present at other 
sites on Catapulta.
