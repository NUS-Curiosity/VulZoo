Subject: Re: [FD] F5 BIG-IQ authed arbitrary user password change

This issue has been fixed in all releases after BIG-IQ 4.1, including 4.2
and 4.3.
Please see F5¹s technical solution at
http://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/15000/200/sol15229.html
BIG-IQ 4.1 was in limited release and customers had already been asked to
upgrade.
No versions of BIG-IP are vulnerable.

Please use security-reporting@...com for any further reports. This email
