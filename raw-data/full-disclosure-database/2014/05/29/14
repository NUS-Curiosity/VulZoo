The Crypto mailing list offered a few additional factoids (in addition
to the three offered in the first link):

    1) Microsoft ended support for XP.
    2) Elcomsoft claims the ability to retrieve master & secondary (XTS mode)
        keys for TrueCrypt volumes/partitions from hibernation files.
    3) Passware same as above.
    4) https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/iSec_Final_Open_Crypto_Audit_Project_TrueCrypt_Security_Assessment.pdf-
        header key derivation uses low iteration count

And as one other person noted in the crypto mailing list thread, the
same kind of thing happened to Lavabit.

See http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2014-May/thread.html
and http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2014-May/006561.html.
