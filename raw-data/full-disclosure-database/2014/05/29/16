Disclosing information that is available to the public is not hurting anyone.

If they are hurt in the markets due to poor data security practices, the only person or entity responsible is the one that chose and implemented those data security practices.

Please donâ€™t misattribute responsibility.  Insecurity is not the fault of the discloser.
