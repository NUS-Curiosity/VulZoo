How's this for timing... "Mobile security struggles continue to plague
LifeLock", http://www.mobilecommercepress.com/mobile-security-struggles-continue-plague-lifelock/8512293/:

    LifeLock, a giant in the identity theft industry, has
    now suspended its app following the massive
    mobile security issues that had plagued it...

    The target share price had reached the point that
    it was slashed in half, by the time this article was
    written. The Tempe-based company’s stock price
    has been riding a virtual roller coaster and it doesn’t
    look as though it will be slowing down quite yet. This
    was all in response to the announcement that as a
    mobile security precaution, all of the user information
    from the LifeLock Wallet would be deleted, and the
    app would be taken down from Google Play, Amazon
    Apps, and other application stores.
