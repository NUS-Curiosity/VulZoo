Subject: [FD] Full disk encryption for OS X alternative to TrueCrypt

 

Greetings. 

I'm a happy long-time user of TrueCrypt, and was as
dismayed as anyone else to see the news. I'm considering starting a full
disk image encryption alternative to TrueCrypt that will target OS X
(maybe others too, but right now OS X is my priority). 

Asking here for
interest in such an endeavor. My system still uses TrueCrypt 7.1a and I
managed to rescue the binaries, but I suspect they may break Real Soon
Now and, with nobody to maintain the code... well, OS X needs an
alternative. And no, Apple's partition encryption isn't an option since
it's suspect of having back doors. 

My intention is to release the code
under an open source license (GPLv2 or Apache). Please let me know your
thoughts. Working now on understanding how Fuse might play in this
setup, or whether to write a low-level driver altogether and mount it
via the kernel w/o Fuse. 

Cheers!
