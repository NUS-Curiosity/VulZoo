Subject: Re: [FD] TrueCrypt?

Krebson covered it pretty well here:
http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/05/true-goodbye-using-truecrypt-is-not-secure/

And a few more speculations here:
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/29/truecrypt_analysis/

For the most part the general consensus is they're no longer wanting
to continue development - perhaps through pressure, or this release
would spark a lot of sensitive people to momentarily make their data
vulnerable whilst switching to an alternative. This comes at a time
where full auditing was about to go underway (they had only audited
the bootloader in the past), which in itself adds to the speculation.

Really an open-source variant needs to be made readily-available to
the average consumer. I know of plenty of non-IT-savvy people who
would love an opportunity to secure their local data (photos, email,
work) but don't know how - given their current options there's a clear
gap in the market for this; the paranoid consumer. (Rightly so is
objective.)
