Subject: [FD] [SECURITY] CVE-2014-0119 Apache Tomcat information disclosure

CVE-2014-0119 Information Disclosure

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.5
- Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.53
- Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.39

Description:
In limited circumstances it was possible for a malicious web application
to replace the XML parsers used by Tomcat to process XSLTs for the
default servlet, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs) and tag
plugin configuration files. The injected XMl parser(s) could then bypass
the limits imposed on XML external entities and/or have visibility of
the XML files processed for other web applications deployed on the same
Tomcat instance.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.0.8 or later
  (8.0.6 and 8.0.7 contain the fix but were not released)
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.54 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 6.0.41 or later
  (6.0.40 contains the fix but was not released)

Credit:
This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team.
