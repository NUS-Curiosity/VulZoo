Subject: [FD] CS and XSS vulnerabilities in DZS Video Gallery for WordPress

Hello list!

There are Content Spoofing and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in
plugin DZS Video Gallery for WordPress. After I announced multiple
vulnerabilities in DZS Video Gallery at 08.05.2014 and informed developers,
they ignored it, so the second advisory is going directly to full disclosure
(and details of the first advisory will be disclosed next month).

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are all versions of DZS Video Gallery for WordPress.

-------------------------
Affected vendors:
-------------------------

Digital Zoom Studio
http://digitalzoomstudio.net

----------
Details:
----------

There are 4 flash-files, which are vulnerable to CS and XSS. So all
flash-files have 12 vulnerabilities in total.

http://site/wp-content/plugins/dzs-videogallery/deploy/preview_skin_rouge.swf
http://site/wp-content/plugins/dzs-videogallery/deploy/preview_allchars.swf
http://site/wp-content/plugins/dzs-videogallery/deploy/preview_skin_overlay.swf

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

Swf-file accepts arbitrary addresses in parameters video and thumb, which
allows to spoof content of flash - i.e. by setting addresses of video and/or
image files from other site.

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

Swf-file accepts arbitrary addresses in parameters logo and logoLink, which
allows to inject logo and link to external site.

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):
