Subject: [FD] F5 BIG-IQ authed arbitrary user password change

Hi,

Detailed at this blog post (with pics!) is a vulnerability within F5 BIG-IQ
4.1.0.2013.0.

http://volatile-minds.blogspot.com/2014/05/f5-big-iq-v41020130-authenticated.html

A module for this will be uploaded to ExploitHub this evening that will
change the root users password and log in over SSH.

Tune in next week for even more F5 fun!
