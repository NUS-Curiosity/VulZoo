Thanks.
It's but a shame that such silly beginners errors are still present in
current software.

I didn't bother to look specifically for it since my "customers" and I
used german versions of Windows NT5.x until now, where %ProgramFiles%
is C:\Programme, without a space.

I also installed mal^Wsoftware like Microsoft Office or Mozilla Firefox
not into their default locations %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office or
%ProgramFiles%\Mozilla Firefox, but used C:\Programme\Microsoft\Office
resp. C:\Programme\Mozilla\Firefox instead to mitigate such errors.

Yes. But I mentioned that:

Of course an administrator has many more ways to run a program under
another user account. But this one is for dummies.

Correct (but FAT cant be used any more for the boot partition of Windows
Vista and later).

These silly beginners errors but show that neither the developers nor
their QA are doing their jobs well.-(
And if they did not spot such simple errors, what about the "real" bugs?

Unfortunately Apple is not the only culprit.

Some WHQL-signed drivers run C:\Program.exe under "LocalSystem" account
during their installation ($VENDOR, you know who you are, I reported this
bug some years ago, and you did not react at all), quite some application
packages of major companies install services running under "LocalSystem"
account with ImagePath=C:\Program Files\... or COM-out-of-process servers
with LocalServer32=C:\Program Files\..., and installer creators like NSIS
MSI or InstallShield dont help their users to avoid this silly beginners
error (see <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/May/14> and
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/May/37> for just the tip of the
iceberg).
