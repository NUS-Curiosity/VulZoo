Can someone reference something more than a report on Windows Vista?

UAC combined with standard user privilege combines the integrity system applied via UAC and standard reduced security permissions.

UAC when the user has an Administrator token is a different beast and there are some known bypasses. However, requiring admin approval mode for all applications and all users, including local administrators, will go far.

Integrity levels are applied via icacls just as security permissions.
