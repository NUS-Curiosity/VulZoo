Subject: Re: [FD] [KIS-2014-06] Dotclear <= 2.6.2 (Media Manager)
 Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability

Hi Brandon,

to exploit the vulnerability you need an account with the ability to access
to the dashboard (which can be granted e.g. with the "publish entries and
comments" or even with the "manage their own entries and comments"
permission), plus the ability to manage media items, that means you must
have the "manage their own media items" or "manage all media items"
permissions.
