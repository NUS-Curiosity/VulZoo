So the priority would have been different had a "paying" customer
reported this as against someone reporting it for free? :-)

We recently had a "paying" customer do a independent security audit,
and reported this issue for our product. Of course, it was scored high
on CVSS, as always is the case. We were able to explain why the
exploit requires speciality conditions, but eventually had to address
it - closing all the reported issues on the report was far more
important for the customer than listening to reason. We did a
class-fix across the entire product line. It did not take a lot of
time, frankly - which is where my argument came from. Where perception
plays an important role, I find it much easy to fix something if it is
trivially fixable, than argue with someone.
