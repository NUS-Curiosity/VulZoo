I'd argue feature, although one that can potentially be exploited if you 
observe someone copy/paste a password. I've inadvertently captured a 
user's password with local clipboard monitoring software after 
TeamViewer, so I can certainly understand the potential risk of 
information leakage.

On the flip side, this is a *very* useful feature. Ideally it would have 
a "Share clipboard with remote side? (Yes, no, for this session, 
always)" dialog the first time someone modifies the clipboard while 
TeamViewer is being used to give users some level of control.
