Subject: [FD] pervasive vulnerabilities in offensive mindset - haughty hubris

hacking is addictive!
 ... and leads to poor judgement at all scales.

the first step is admitting you have problem.

"hi, my name is [REDACTED] and i want to HACK EVERYTHING!"

summarized as:
"""
Many computer hackers in the relatively short history of hacking have
exhibited behavior more reminiscent of drug addicts than regular
criminals. The controlled, logical, and no-bigger-than-necessary
compromise of systems appears to be the exception to the rule - more
commonly, we seem to see an escalating spiral of computer compromise
for the sake of computer compromise.

Recent revelations seem to imply that the same dynamic not only
applies to individuals, but to large organisations as well - the lure
of 'hack more so you can hack more' appears to apply here, as well.

This talk discusses why the structure of the modern internet (strongly
connected trust graph with small number of super-connected nodes)
makes hacking so fundamentally addictive for both individuals and
organisations, and why this poses concrete risks for oversight
mechanisms and legal frameworks.
