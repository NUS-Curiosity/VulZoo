Subject: [FD] [CVE-2014-1603] XSS in GetSimple CMS 3.3.1

Hi,

Found some persistent and reflected cross site scripting in the Admin
console of GetSimple CMS 3.3.1 and below.
Waited 6 months for a fix but the developer stopped answering my
emails, so decided to release this anyway.

Details attached if you care - also available at
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrib/PoC/master/getsimplecms-3.3.1.txt.

Regards,
Pedro Ribeiro
