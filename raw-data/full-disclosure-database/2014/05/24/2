Second Call for Papers for SAC'2014

The conference Selected Areas in Cryptography 2014 (SAC' 2014) will be
held at Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on August
14-15, 2014.

Authors are encouraged to submit original papers related to the
following themes for the SAC 2014 conference. Note that the first
three are traditional SAC areas and the fourth topic is intended to be
the special focus for this year's conference.

1. Design and analysis of symmetric key primitives and cryptosystems,
including block and stream ciphers, hash function, MAC algorithms,
cryptographic permutations, and Authenticated Encryption Schemes.
2. Efficient implementations of symmetric and public key algorithms.
3. Mathematical and algorithmic aspects of applied cryptology.
4. Algorithms for cryptography, cryptanalysis and their complexity analysis.


Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the
authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to a
journal or any other conference/workshop that has proceedings. IACR
reserves the right to share information about submissions with other
program committees to detect parallel submissions and the IACR policy
on irregular submissions will be strictly enforced. For further
details, see http://www.iacr.org/docs/irregular.html.


Important Dates:
- Paper submission deadline: May 28 2014, 23:59 EST
- Notification of decision: July 7, 2014
- Preproceedings version deadline: July 28, 2014
- Conference: August 14-15, 2014
