 rogue binary C:\Program.exe

If the fix is trivial, I'd rather fix it, regardless of the conclusion
of "security-or-not" pissing match.

I partially agree with Travis in the ACL argument, but also would like
to note that half of humanity logs in a Windows machine as
Administrator, as well as clicks on hyperlinks that purport to have
photos of a nekkid celebrity. And it definitely does not look good on
part of hp to dismiss the issue because they don't consider it worthy
enough of a fix. Let me guess - the logistics is a nightmare, hp
probably has a n x m matrix that they'd have to issue fix for, which
quickly explodes into upper two or even three digit numbers.
