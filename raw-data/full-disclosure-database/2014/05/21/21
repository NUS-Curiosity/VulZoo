and *that* attitude is the root cause for all the software crap around

* anobody knows that unverified input is bad
* anybody knows that unescaped input is bad

so why the fuck discuss in the way "show me the attack vector"
instead a) learn from the existing bad code to write better and
just accept that *it is* a security relevant bug

90 out of 100 security flaws in the past years where from the
category "hy should i bother about this and that, it is unlikely"
