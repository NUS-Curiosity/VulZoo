Subject: Re: [FD] Beginners error: Hewlett-Packards driver software executes
 rogue binary C:\Program.exe

C:\Program.exe is rarely an issue but other drives tend to have full ACL for Authenticated Users, so non-administrators can write to D:\Program.exe. If it is installed to that drive instead (e.g. primary drive is full/organisation has decided to organize file system that way) then the vulnerability becomes exploitable.
 
Not 100% sure if this applies in this instance, as it is using CreateProcess() and not sure how its generating the path, but I have seen this for services installed on the D:\.
