It sounds like a bug, but why is this a security issue? I can only imagine
two possible scenarios

1. You've somehow made the root parition FAT32, in which case you're using a
non-securable filesystem; Therefore not a security issue.
2. You've set a bad ACL on the root directory, therefore user error.

If you believe otherwise, please post details, as that would be an
interesting discovery.

Tavis.
