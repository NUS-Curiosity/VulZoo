Sounds like a good goal. The installer probably also shouldn't play
obscene messages via PC speaker. If it did, it would be undesirable
and probably considered a bug.

Now, in practical terms... in absence of a plausible risk / attack
vector, it doesn't sound like much of a security issue (unless you
adopt the approach advocated on the predecessor of this list by Mr.
Lemonias).
