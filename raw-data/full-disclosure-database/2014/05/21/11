Subject: Re: [FD] Beginners error: Hewlett-Packards driver software executes
 rogue binary C:\Program.exe

It's very limited use.  But it is a vulnerability. . If an Unprivileged
user can write to the root of c: but NOT to any sensitive subdirectory they
can't do much harm.  This allows them a route to escalate their priveleges.

Admittedly. ..  for a user to be able to write to c but not write to
Windows/program files anyway (and overwrite whatever they want) is a bit of
an edge case but it might crop up in a pen test!
