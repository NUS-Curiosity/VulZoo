It's simple, if your exploit requires Administrator access, then it's
probably not a security issue. Filesystem ACLs are a supported
security boundary, being able to defeat them would be a legitimate and
important vulnerability. Inventing attacks that require them to fail
as a pre-requisite is like saying "If you can modify /etc/passwd,
then...".

Hopefully you agree that using your Administrator access to replace or
modify system files or settings is not a security issue.

The bug would be being able to defeat filesystem ACLs; if you have a
way of doing that without Administrator access, you have a security
bug. That doesn't need to be combined with anything else, it's a
serious vulnerability.

Uh, Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
