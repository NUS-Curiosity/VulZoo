It's a DoS too.
But in the first hand its just AWFUL BAD coding and SLOPPY QA: "long"
filenames with embedded spaces exist for more than 20 years in Windows,
but some paid dimwits in companies like HP, Microsoft, McAfee, Synaptics,
... still dont get their code right.

3. You think Windows' "user account control" is a security boundary.

UAC is but NOT a security boundary:

| Elevations and Security Boundaries
...

<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2526083>

Every user account created during Windows setup is an administrator account,
so every user can create C:\Program.exe

Microsoft tries to sell "defense in depth" to their customers since they
started their "trustworthy computing" about 13 years ago. But they still
create administrator accounts during Windows setup, CreateProcess() still
has the idiosyncrazy to execute C:\Program.exe, and the WHQL certification
still let drivers pass which execute C:\Program.exe during installation and
operation.

This bad practice then yields software like the HP drivers.
