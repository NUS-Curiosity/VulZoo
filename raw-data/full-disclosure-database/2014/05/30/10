Mike, 

Well aware of the Intel PRNG issues and others
(http://twitter.com/ciurana -- I covered them when they happened and
continue to address them). 

Ditto on the encryption: I know it well
enough to come up with an initial implementation, and be conscious of
the limitations of my coding. Part of this plan consists on establishing
an auditing process from the get go, not unlike OpenBSD's, where
security is built into the process, not only into the code and reviewed
as an after thought. 

I want to have more than one block encryption
algorithm built into it, different digests, and so on. 

Libraries,
features selection, etc. are still in a preliminary stage. First I want
to gauge level of interest. 

Would you like to help? :) 

Cheers!
