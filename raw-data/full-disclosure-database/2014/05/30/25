Subject: Re: [FD] TrueCrypt?

So a good friend of mine explained...

*"...to suspect a "National Security Letter" from the FBI is just stupid.
An NSL is issued to an organization that actually has some involvement with
someone/group of "interest". The source code for Truecrypt is publicly
available. So how would such a letter be of any use? There is a current
very public audit of the Truecrypt code underway. So if the NSA/FBI/CIA/TLA
"requested" the Truecrypt authors to insert some sort of backdoor now, then
it would be identified almost immediately.*

*But this article is peddling baseless conspiracy, conflating Lavabit
(running a service), Apple's "warrant canary" (also runs a service) versus
Truecrypt's supply of source code (ie, not a service).*
