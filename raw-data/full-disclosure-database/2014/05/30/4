The general consensus in some quarters (e.g.
encryption and topical IRC channels across various networks) is that the
developer(s) were identified and served with a National Security Letter
(NSL). Since its existence can't be divulged, and since the suggestion
to use BitLocker is ridiculous to anyone with a clue, the demise of the
TrueCrypt site and its circumstances is viewed as a canary-in-the-mine.
A way of alerting users. 

Think of Lavabit a year ago and how they were
coerced to open up their encryption. They went out of business rather
than surrender the keys and create a false sense of security among their
users. 

Cheers,
