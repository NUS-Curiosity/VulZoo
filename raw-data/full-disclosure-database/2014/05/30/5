HD Moore, creator of the ethical hacking tool Metasploit and chief research
officer of security consultancy Rapid7, told the Guardian he had been
warned by US law enforcement last year over a scanning project called
Critical.IO, which he started in 2012. The initiative sought to find
widespread vulnerabilities using automated computer programs to uncover the
weaknesses across the entire internet.
