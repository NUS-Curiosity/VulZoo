Subject: [FD] TrueCrypt 7.1 repos on GitHub - forking starting point

 

Hi again! 

There are at least two forks on GitHub of what appear to
be complete, legit versions of TrueCrypt 7.1 -- there are others
scattered throughout the web. 

 	* https://github.com/syglug/truecrypt

	* https://github.com/FauxFaux/truecrypt

Cloning and building on OS X,
figuring out if the files are OKi (in contact with the TrueCrypt Audit
folks soon). Any C/C+ coders out there willing to give a hand? This is
for OS X and Linux only. 

Cheers! 

pr3d
