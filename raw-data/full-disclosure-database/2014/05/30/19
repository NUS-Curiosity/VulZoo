We wait. This is still fresh news.

Yes. And I will continue to use 7.1a (although warily) pending any public
security disclosures, not FUD.

The Open Crypto Audit Project (OCAP) is the non-profit organization that's
currently performing cryptanalysis and public auditing of the TrueCrypt
source-code. They've completed Phase I and found no *glaring* security
issues. They plan to carry forward with Phase II and even adopt/forking
TrueCrypt's source code depending how events unfold (and licensing
restrictions).

You never know when it's closed source. I wonder how long Heartbleed would
kick around (privately, that is) if OpenSSL was closed-source they found
out about it.

Depends on the project, how fun it is, does it have an active community,
etc.. It's still better than nothing

OCAP plans to extend their work to OpenSSL and other critical
infrastructure, although this is in its infancy. Don't hold your breath.
