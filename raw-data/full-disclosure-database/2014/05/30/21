When you don't trust FileVault, because Apple may have put a backdoor in, then
you shouldn't trust the whole platform, as Apple may have put another backdoor
that allows remote access to your machine. 

There is Back to My Mac, that allows you to connect to your machine from
everywhere. What's the guarantee that some three letter agencies won't use it,
or something else we're not aware of, to access your machine behind you back?

If they can access your machine, then no encryption whatsoever will solve the
problem, as GPG, OTR and disk encryption keys are stored unencrypted in memory
when you use them.

Cheers!
