Subject: Re: [FD] TrueCrypt 7.1 repos on GitHub - forking starting point

Two issues with this:

1) TrueCrypt wasn't free as in freedom, it was free as in beer. These forks
break the license afaik.

2) Do you trust these users to understand the codebase thoroughly enough
and understand cryptography enough to not introduce stupid crypto bugs?
That is a huge caveat.

Just my 2c.
