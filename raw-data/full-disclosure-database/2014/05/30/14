Thanks Jeff! 

I was
thinking along those lines, except that I want to dispense with C++ and
keep the code in C altogether. Better portability than with C++, and
fewer headaches for the developers who'll audit/contribute to the code.


The only reason I was considering GPLv2 was for its toxicity... it may
deter third-parties from hijacking the code into other applications. In
the normal course of business all my open source stuff is done under BSD
or Apache. I think I'll continue with either of those (thinking that BSD
might be the best). 

Layering it as a library + drivers was also my
general idea (hence looking into how Fuse works). Thanks very much for
the advise; you've confirmed some 5,000' level assumptions I'd made, and
showed me a better path when it comes to licensing. 

Cheers!
