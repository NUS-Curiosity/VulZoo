Subject: Re: [FD] TrueCrypt 7.1 repos on GitHub - forking starting point

If you want legit versions of TrueCrypt, look at DrWhax's repo where you
can independently verify the builds with the official TrueCrypt PGP keys:
https://github.com/DrWhax/truecrypt-archive

I think, given the nature of crypto, you should wait to pair/contribute
with Open Crypto Audit Project (OCAP) before forking. Just to be play it
safe for potential users.
