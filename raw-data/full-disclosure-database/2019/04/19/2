Subject: [FD] Obtaining location using Google maps & JavaScript

HTML5's geolocation feature asks for permissions to obtain users current location & the current IP to location also fails to pinpoint exact location of the user.However, one can use google maps to obtain the location of the user (being said that he is currently logged in with his google account).
Using the URL: https://www.google.com/maps/search/current+location/ in an I-frame content and making the visitor access the site would allow you to get the exact location.If the user is using a common account on laptop/desktop and his mobile phone, it is possible to get exact GPS co-ordinates using this technique.
All that is required is that site should be able to capture the lat-longs generated by the map APIs using JavaScript.
Has anyone worked on something similar before?
Regards
