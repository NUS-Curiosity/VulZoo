[*] About Sao Paulo (taken from fiquemaisumdia.com.br)

The city is the largest in Brazil and first in South America by
population. Quite often Sao Paulo intimidates people because of its
size, its constant pedestrian
and vehicle traffic, ethnic and cultural multiplicity. Sao Paulo will
surprise you whether you come here on business or for an expo, a
congress or a convention,
stay for at least one more day. Let yourself be seduced by the cultural
diversity of this many-faceted city which vibrates, dictates fashion, is
always anticipating
trends, and welcomes Brazilians and foreigners from all over. And oh, do
not forget to have fun in South America's wildest night life.
