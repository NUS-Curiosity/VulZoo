Subject: [FD] [SYSS-2018-035]: ABUS Secvest Remote Control - Missing
 Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311)

Advisory ID: SYSS-2018-035
Product: ABUS Secvest Remote Control (FUBE50014, FUBE50015)
Manufacturer: ABUS
Affected Version(s): n/a
Tested Version(s): n/a
Vulnerability Type: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311)
Risk Level: High
Solution Status: Open
Manufacturer Notification: 2018-11-21
Solution Date: -
Public Disclosure: 2019-03-25
CVE Reference: CVE-2019-9862
Authors of Advisory: Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH), Thomas Detert

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

ABUS Secvest FUBE50014 and FUBE50015 are wireless remote controls for
the ABUS Secvest wireless alarm system.

Some of the device features as described by the manufacturer are
(see [1]):

"
* User-friendly remote control with easily identifiable symbols
* Features ‘arm’, ‘disarm’ and ‘status query’ keys
* 8 LEDs provide an overview and display current system status
* Button for custom configuration available (Secvest wireless alarm
  system only)
* Optional manual panic alarm available (Secvest wireless alarm system
  only)
* Encrypted signal transmission
* Rolling Code
  Thanks to the rolling code process this product is protected against
  so-called replay attacks. All controlling signals between this product
  and the Secvest alarm panel are in individualised and thus, are not
  able to be reproduced by third parties. This process is protected
  from third party tampering, and exceeds the requirements of the
  DIN EN 50131-1 level 2 security standard.
"

Due to the missing "Encrypted signal transmission", an attacker is able
to eavesdrop sensitive data as cleartext, for instance the current
rolling code state.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

Thomas Detert found out that the claimed "Encrypted signal transmission"
of the Secvest wireless remote control FUBE50014 is not present at all.

Thus, an attacker observing radio signals of an ABUS FUBE50014
wireless remote control is able to see all sensitive data of
transmitted packets as cleartext and can analyze the used packet format
and the communication protocol.

For instance, this security issue could successfully be exploited to
observe the current rolling code state of the wireless remote control
and deduce the cryptographically weak used rolling code algorithm
(see SySS security advisory SYSS-2018-034 [2]).

SySS found out that the new ABUS Secvest remote control FUBE50015 is
also affected by this security vulnerability.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

Thomas Detert developed a Teensy-based PoC tool using a CC1101 sub-1GHz
transceiver that allows disarming the alarm system in an unauthorized
way. He provided his tool including documentation and source to SySS
GmbH for responsible disclosure purposes.

SySS GmbH could successfully perform a disarming attack against an ABUS
Secvest wireless alarm system by exploiting the unencrypted signal
transmission of the ABUS Secvest wireless remote controls FUBE50014 and
FUBE50015 and the predictable rolling code implementation using either
Mr. Detert's PoC tool, a developed Python tool for the RFCat-based radio
dongle YARD Stick One (see [3]), or a eZ430-Chronos (see [4]) with a
specially developed firmware.

Successful disarming attacks against an ABUS Secvest wireless alarm
system are shown in our SySS proof-of-concept video "ABUS Secvest
Rolling Code PoC Attack" [7].
