Subject: [FD] [SYSS-2018-036]: ABUS Secvest Remote Control - Denial of
 Service - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)

Advisory ID: SYSS-2018-036
Product: ABUS Secvest Remote Control (FUBE50014, FUBE50015)
Manufacturer: ABUS
Affected Version(s): n/a
Tested Version(s): n/a
Vulnerability Type: Denial of Service - Uncontrolled Resource
Consumption (CWE-400)
Risk Level: Low
Solution Status: Open
Manufacturer Notification: 2018-11-21
Solution Date: -
Public Disclosure: 2019-03-25
CVE Reference: CVE-2019-9860
Authors of Advisory: Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH), Thomas Detert

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

ABUS Secvest FUBE50014 and FUBE50015 are wireless remote controls for
the ABUS Secvest wireless alarm system.

Some of the device features as described by the manufacturer are
(see [1]):

"
* User-friendly remote control with easily identifiable symbols
* Features ‘arm’, ‘disarm’ and ‘status query’ keys
* 8 LEDs provide an overview and display current system status
* Button for custom configuration available (Secvest wireless alarm
  system only)
* Optional manual panic alarm available (Secvest wireless alarm system
  only)
* Encrypted signal transmission
* Rolling Code
  Thanks to the rolling code process this product is protected against
  so-called replay attacks. All controlling signals between this product
  and the Secvest alarm panel are in individualised and thus, are not
  able to be reproduced by third parties. This process is protected
  from third party tampering, and exceeds the requirements of the
  DIN EN 50131-1 level 2 security standard.
"

Due to unencrypted signal communication and predictability of rolling
codes, an attacker can "desynchronize" an ABUS Secvest wireless remote
control regarding its controlled Secvest wireless alarm system, so that
sent commands by the remote control are not accepted anymore.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

Thomas Detert found out that the claimed "Encrypted signal transmission"
of the Secvest wireless remote control FUBE50014 is not present (see
SySS security advisory SYSS-2018-035 [2]) and that the implemented
rolling codes are predictable (see SySS security advisory SYSS-2018-034
[3]).

By exploiting these two security issues, an attacker can simply
desynchronize a wireless remote control by observing the current rolling
code state, generating many valid rolling codes, and use them before the
original wireless remote control.

The Secvest wireless alarm system will ignore sent commands by the
wireless remote control until the generated rolling code happens to
match the window of valid rolling code values again. Depending on the
number of used rolling codes by the attacker, a resynchronization
without actually reconfiguring the wireless remote control could take
quite a lot of time and effectless button presses.

SySS found out that the new ABUS Secvest remote control FUBE50015 is
also affected by this security vulnerability.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

Thomas Detert developed a Teensy-based PoC tool using a CC1101 sub-1GHz
transceiver that allows disarming the alarm system in an unauthorized
way. He provided his tool including documentation and source to SySS
GmbH for responsible disclosure purposes.

Based on Mr. Detert's PoC tool, SySS GmbH developed a Python tool for
the RFCat-based radio dongle YARD Stick One (see [4]) for demonstrating
this simple denial-of-service (DoS) attack against the ABUS Secvest
wireless remote controls FUBE50014 and FUBE50015. This tool simply
generates many valid rolling codes based on the current observed state
and uses them resulting in desynchronizing the original wireless remote
control.

Solution:

SySS GmbH is not aware of a solution for this reported security
vulnerability.
