=============================================

2FA & macOS Disk Encryption Bypass in Abine Blur 7.24*

=============================================

 

Topic:          Abine Blur Password Manager Insecure Permissions

 

* Announced:    2019-03-18

* Credits:           RS Tyler Schroder

* Affects:           7.8.242*

* Corrected:      2018-03-18

* Corrected V:   8.0.2478

* CVE Name:    CVE-2019-6481

 

I.   Background

 

Abine Blur is a privacy-focused suite of products focused on protecting your
privacy online. They accomplish this via multiple means including: 

*	Credit card masking (disposable credit card #s)
*	Email masking (disposable emails)
*	Cell phone masking (sms/voice capable)
*	Password management

 

This suite is delivered via a web application (https://dnt.abine.com) and a
pair of browser extensions / mobile apps (iOS, Android).

 

II.  Problem Description

 

The Password Manager Extension in Abine Blur 7.8.243* allows attackers to
bypass the Multi-Factor Authentication and macOS disk-encryption protection
mechanisms, and consequently exfiltrate secured data, because the
right-click context menu is not secured. NOTE: this vulnerability exists
because of a CVE-2018-7213 regression.

 


 

Abine Blur 7.8.242* failed to secure the right-click context menu, allowing
an attacker with either physical access or remote-desktop access to disclose
passwords, emails, and usernames of the victim *without* triggering a
second-factor request.

III. Impact

 

Access to secured data can lead to secure information exfiltration, a 2FA
bypass, and a further undisclosed MacOS(x) disk encryption console bypass
(to access secured Abine Blur data).

 

IV.   Solution

 

Update your browser plug-in per your browser vendor's instructions. Firefox
6x and Chrome 63.x may automatically update to the latest version. The
Vendor has corrected the issue in version 8.0.2478 of the plugin.
