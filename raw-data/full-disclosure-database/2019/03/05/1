VI. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) allows clients to inject scripts into a request and
have the server return the script to the client in the response. This occurs
because the application is taking untrusted data and reusing it
without performing any validation or sanitisation.
A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks.

Affected Component:
Path(inurl): /ctcprotocol/Protocol
Parameter: wsdlLib

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Update SAP to lastest version.
