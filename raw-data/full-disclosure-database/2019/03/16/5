Subject: [FD] SQL injection in joshcam/mysqli-database-class library

https://packagist.org/packages/joshcam/mysqli-database-class aka
https://github.com/ThingEngineer/PHP-MySQLi-Database-Class v2.9.2 is
vulnerable to SQL injection in functon Where() because of special
"forkaround" at line 971
<https://github.com/ThingEngineer/PHP-MySQLi-Database-Class/blob/eaf1f6cc387c8464ea6a9221fb308669beed3a63/MysqliDb.php#L971>

If $whereValue happens to be an array, key value is used as $operator to
build query.
However typical usage of the class looks like:

$db->where('ID', $_POST['id']);
$name = $db->getValue('USERS', 'name');

The $whereValue is usually untrusted and if there are no additional checks
like is_numeric($_POST['id']) an attacker may inject his statements. For
example: id[= ? or 1=1 --]=0(Url encoded version for HTTP
POST: id%5B%3D%20%3F%20or%201%3D1%20--%5D=0)
