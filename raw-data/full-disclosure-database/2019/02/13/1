Subject: Re: [FD] [SRP-2018-02] Security of NC+ SAT TV platform and ST
	chipsets


Hello All,

Due to no interest in our SAT TV security research, the remaining
bits of SRP-2018-02 material including the following:
- technical details of a new ST chipset vulnerability,
- Proof of Concept code for the above vulnerability,
- Proof of Concept codes for set-top-box and ST chipset access,
- SLIMCore assembler and compiler stubs generator tools,
- responses (or their lack of) to our inquiries from 20+ companies
   (content providers, STB vendors and CAS vendors)

are scheduled to be released to the public next week.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Adam Gowdiak
