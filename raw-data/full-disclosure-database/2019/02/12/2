Description: 
============
An issue was discovered on Systrome ISG-600C,ISG-600H, and ISG-800W 1.1-R2.1_TRUNK-20180914.bin devices. There is CSRF via /ui/?g=obj_keywords_add and/ui/?g=obj_keywords_addsave
with resultant XSS because of a lack of csrf token validation.

Additional Information
======================
The web interface of the ISG-Firewalls does not validate the csrftoken,and the ?g=obj_keywords_add page does not properly sanitize the
user input which leads to xss, By combining this two attack we can form the XSRF request which leads to complete account takeover using XSRF.
