[Vulnerability Type]
XML External Entity Injection 0Day


[CVE Reference]
N/A


[Security Issue]
Visual Studio 2008 IDE suffers from XML External Entity injection.
Attackers can leverage many file types, some being MASM related files like
.asm or .lst.
By opening any one of the following file types listed below, it can allow
remote attackers to steal files from the victims computer, sending them to
the
remote attackers server.

Double click any of the following extensions and it will trigger the XXE
vulnerability. Note, upon installation of the IDE the following file types
get
associated with Visual Studio 2008 and are ALL vulnerable and will trigger
the XXE exploit.

[Vuln XXE file types]
.snippet
.i
.s
.asm
.disco
.lst
.inc
.srf
.wsdl
.rgs
.xml

This IDE is pretty old, I know, but its still available for download as of
this writing, therefore I release the advisory.
