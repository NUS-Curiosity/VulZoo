---------------------------------------------------------
SugarCRM <= 9.0.1 Multiple Path Traversal Vulnerabilities
---------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

https://www.sugarcrm.com


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 9.0.1 and prior versions, 8.0.3 and prior versions.


[-] Vulnerabilities Description:

1) User input passed to the "/Mail/attachment" REST API endpoint is not 
properly
sanitized before being used to delete a file from the system. This can 
be exploited
by malicious users to delete arbitrary files via Path Traversal attacks. 
Please
note this vulnerability could be exploited to delete the 'config.php' 
file and
re-install the application, potentially leading to a full server 
compromise.

2) User input passed through the "temp_id" parameter to the 
"/[module]/temp/file"
REST API endpoint is not properly sanitized before being used to 
download/delete a
file from the system. This can be exploited by malicious users to 
download and/or
delete arbitrary files via Path Traversal attacks. Please note this 
vulnerability
could be exploited to download and delete the 'config.php' file and 
re-install
the application, potentially leading to a full server compromise.

3) User input passed through the "dropdown_lang" parameter when handling 
the "wizard"
action within the "Studio" module is not properly sanitized before being 
used in a
call to the include() PHP function. This can be exploited by malicious 
users to upload
and execute arbitrary PHP code via Path Traversal attacks. Successful 
exploitation
of this vulnerability requires an user account with Developer access to 
any module.

4) User input passed through the "filename" parameter when handling the 
"deleteFont"
action within the "Configurator" module is not properly sanitized before 
being used
to delete a file from the system. This can be exploited by malicious 
users to delete
arbitrary files. Please note this vulnerability could be exploited to 
delete the
'config.php' file and re-install the application, potentially leading to 
a full
server compromise. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability 
requires a
System Administrator account.
