 Vulnerabilities

----------------------------------------------------------------
SugarCRM <= 9.0.1 Multiple Broken Access Control Vulnerabilities
----------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 9.0.1 and prior versions, 8.0.3 and prior versions.


[-] Vulnerabilities Description:

1) There is a Broken Access Control vulnerability with regards to the 
"InboundEmail" module.
When handling the "Save" action the application fails to properly check 
whether the user has
Admin access to the module, thus allowing any user to create a new 
"InboundEmail" bean
regardless of their roles/permissions.

2) There is a Broken Access Control vulnerability with regards to the 
"Trackers" module.
When handling the "trackersettings" action the application fails to 
properly check whether
the user has Admin access to the module, thus allowing any user to 
change Trackers'
settings regardless of their roles/permissions

3) There is a Broken Access Control vulnerability with regards to the 
"Campaigns" module.
When handling the "WizardEmailSetupSave" action the application fails to 
properly check
whether the user has Admin access to the module, thus allowing any user 
to change Email
Setup for Campaigns regardless of their roles/permissions.

4) There is a Broken Access Control vulnerability with regards to the 
"ModuleBuilder" module.
When the "view_module" parameter is set to an empty string, the 
application fails to properly
check whether the user has permissions to access the module, thus 
allowing any user to access
certain ModuleBuilder actions regardless of their roles.

5) There is a Broken Access Control vulnerability with regards to the 
"Administration"
module. When handling the "SaveMerge" action within the "MergeRecords" 
module the application
fails to properly check whether the user is a System Administrator, thus 
allowing unauthorized
users to inject arbitrary "Administration" beans (which means arbitrary 
values into the
"config" database table). Successful exploitation of this vulnerability 
requires an user
account with Developer access to any module.

6) There is a Broken Access Control vulnerability with regards to the 
"Administration" module.
When handling the "Save" action within the "EmailMan" module the 
application allows unauthorized
users to modify administration settings by invoking the 
"Administration::saveConfig()" method.
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an user account 
with Developer access
to the Emails or Campaigns modules.

7) There is a Broken Access Control vulnerability with regards to the 
"Administration" module.
When handling the "WizardEmailSetupSave" action within the "Campaigns" 
module the application
allows unauthorized users to modify administration settings by invoking 
the
"Administration::saveConfig()" method.

8) There is a Local File Inclusion vulnerability within the 
"add_to_prospect_list" function.
User input passed through the "parent_module" and "parent_type" 
parameters is not properly
sanitized before being used in a call to the include() function. This 
can be exploited to
include arbitrary .php files within the webroot and potentially bypass 
authorization mechanisms
(for instance, by setting the "parent_module" parameter to 
"Administration" and the "parent_type"
parameter to "expandDatabase" or any other action which does not 
implement ACL checks).
