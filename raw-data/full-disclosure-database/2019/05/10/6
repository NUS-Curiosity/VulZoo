Subject: Re: [FD] dotCMS v5.1.1 HTML Injection & XSS Vulnerability

Read full vulnerability report @ 
https://secureli.com/dotcms-v5-1-1-open-redirect-vulnerability/

dotCMS v5.1.1 suffers from an Open Redirect Vulnerability, in addition 
to many other vulnerabilities that I am still verifying.

The following URL is a proof-of-concept that requires a user to be 
logged in. Simply login to the demo before visiting the supplied POC.

Logging into the demo requires you to go to 
https://demo.dotcms.com/dotAdmin <https://demo.dotcms.com/dotAdmin/> and 
log in with the demo credentials (username: admin@...cms.com password: 
admin).

POC link: 
https://demo.dotcms.com/html/portlet/ext/common/page_preview_popup.jsp?hostname=google.com/test.html
