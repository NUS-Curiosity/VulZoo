CA20190523-01: Security Notice for CA Risk Authentication and CA
Strong Authentication

Issued: May 23, 2019
Last Updated: May 23, 2019

The Support team for CA Technologies, A Broadcom Company, is alerting
customers to multiple potential risks with CA Risk Authentication and
CA Strong Authentication. Multiple vulnerabilities exist that can
allow a remote attacker to gain additional access in certain
configurations or possibly gain sensitive information. CA published
solutions to address the vulnerabilities and recommends that all
affected customers implement these solutions immediately.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2019-7394, occurs due to insufficient
verification of custom privileges. A malicious actor, who has access
to an account with customized and limited privileges may, in some
cases, access resources and act outside of assigned privileges. This
exposure does not affect installations where accounts do not have
custom privileges.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2019-7393, may enable a malicious actor
to conduct UI redress attacks to gain sensitive information in some
cases.
