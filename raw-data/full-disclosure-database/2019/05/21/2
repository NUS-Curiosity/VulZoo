Subject: [FD] Epic Web Honeypot 2.0a - Fingerprinting Vulnerability


The Epic Web Honeypot Project aims to lure attackers using various types of web vulnerability scanners by tricking them into believing that they have found a vulnerability on a host.

Version 2.0a fails to avoid fingerprinting by including predictable data and size within index.html(the main file). Giving attackers the ability to detect and avoid this system.
