Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends Zyxel customers to upgrade the firmware to the latest
version available. A thorough security review should be performed by security
professionals to identify further potential security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hardcoded FTP Credentials
An FTP service runs on the Zyxel wireless access point that contains the
configuration file for the WiFi network. This FTP server can be accessed with
hardcoded credentials that are embedded in the firmware of the AP.
When the WiFi network is bound to another VLAN, an attacker can cross the
network by fetching the credentials from the FTP server.

The credentials were found by doing an automated scan with IoT Inspector.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hardcoded FTP Credentials
The username "devicehaecived" and the password "1234" can be used to access the
FTP server of the AP on port 21.

The content of the FTP server looks like the following listing:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ls
cert  conf  debug  idp  packet_trace  script  tmp  wtp_image
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The directory "conf" contains all configuration files which store the WiFi
SSIDs and passphrases.
