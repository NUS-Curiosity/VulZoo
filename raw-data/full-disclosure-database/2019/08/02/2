=====[
Overview]==============================================================

* System affected : Avira Free Security Suite 2019 - Software Updater[3].
* Software Version : 2.0.6.13175 (other versions may also be affected).
* Impact : An unprivileged user could obtain SYSTEM privileges.

=====[ Detailed
description]==================================================

The permissive access rights on the SoftwareUpdater folder (files /
folders)
are incompatible with the privileged file manipulation performed by the
product.
Files can be created that can be used by an unprivileged user to obtain
SYSTEM privileges.
Arbitrary file creation can be achieved by abusing the SwuConfig.json
file creation.
An unprivileged user can replace these files by symbolic links to
arbitrary files.
When an update occurs, a privileged service creates a file and sets its
access rights,
offering write access to the Everyone group in any directory.
