Deadline

The CFP deadline for submissions is *September 15, 2019 23:59:59 WEST*
What to Submit

We are looking for topics in the technical area of cyb^Winformation
security. Doesn't matter if it's reverse engineering, web apps, or netsec.
If it's infosec we are in for it!

We do however have a few *rules*:

   - The talk and slides must be in *English* – Even though it's Lisbon we
   always have lots of foreign friends visiting our beautiful country and even
   presenting!
   - We will record all presentations for publication on our Youtube
   channel. If publishing your presentation poses an issue for you then please
   select the "Don't record this talk" checkbox in the submission form.
   - You must give your talk with passion! :)

Submissions will be reviewed by our "Call for Papers" review board
<https://bsideslisbon.org/team>.

The board will review all the talks and give them a rating, speakers will
get at least a 2 month warning on either their talk has been accepted or
not.

*Your talk won’t be picked IF*:

   - It’s a *sale pitch* (vendor based talk / product talk)
   - Talks that don’t have the *minimum information* when submitted
   (including*correct* contact information)

We thank you in advance for your interest and support in bSidesLisbon 2019,
and all your submissions are greatly appreciated.
Tips from the review board:

   - *Be as detailed as possible:* Don't give us just a title and a
   paragraph. (we don't need a full paper, but give us enough detail :);
   - *Be clear!* Help us understand what is it you want to speak about, why
   it matters, and what attendees will get out of it;
   - *Submit early:* We will be approving talks, and filling slots,
   throughout the review process. The later you submit, the less chance you
   have of being picked;
   - *Make sure your contact information is accurate!!!* Every year there's
   some wrong email address that we are unable to get in touch with. We have
   some OSINT skills, but we have other priorities :) If you don't receive an
   automated email confirming your submission, something was wrong, let us
   know ASAP.
