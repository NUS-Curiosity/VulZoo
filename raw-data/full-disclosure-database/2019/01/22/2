Hello everyone,

la Nuit du Hack last year.

This year again will be at your disposal : a 3 level mezzanine, a 900 seats amphitheater, 2000m2 area decated to exposure, the loft : a 1000m2 area devoted to challenges, plus extra spaces to host workshops and surprises !

Even tho we have a bunch of surprises for you, this leHACK edition will still be the place to be for conferences, workshops and a lot of challenges !

Upcoming dates : 
- CFP Deadline : April 8 2019
- Conferences announcement : May 1 2019

LeHACK is a new and old event at the same time, 
some kind of Schrödinger's event we may say.

LeHACK is new because it's its first edition but the people behind it
being the same that organized the 'Nuit du Hack' event during more than
fifteen years.

The name changes, our values stay the same !

LeHACK 2019 is a yearly rendezvous where hackers and afficionados are 
meeting around with both technical and non-technical talks and workshops 
about hacking.
It is a great place to discover, to learn, to teach and be taught in the 
magical city of Paris.

LeHACK 2019 will be held in La Cite des Sciences, Paris (France) on the  
6th and 7th of July 2019.
