 (Denial of Service PoC)

Hi list,

Maybe you find this interesting. In July 2019 Android fixed several
critical bugs, including this one. I think "Hevcfright" (in reference to
Stagefright) is quite possible, with lot of effort, I guess. This video
will crash stock VideoPlayer in Android 7-9 without July 2019 Patch (
https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2019-07-01). More here:

Thanks,
Marcin
