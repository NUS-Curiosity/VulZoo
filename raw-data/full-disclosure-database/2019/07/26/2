Subject: [FD] Whonix Anonymous OS 15 Released

Whonix is a desktop operating system designed for advanced security and
privacy. Whonix mitigates the threat of common attack vectors while
maintaining usability. Online anonymity is realized via fail-safe,
automatic, and desktop-wide use of the Tor network. A heavily
reconfigured Debian base is run inside multiple virtual machines,
providing a substantial layer of protection from malware and IP address
leaks. Commonly used applications are pre-installed and safely
pre-configured for immediate use. The user is not jeopardized by
installing additional applications or personalizing the desktop. Whonix
is under active development and is the only operating system designed to
be run inside a VM and paired with Tor.

After approximately one year of development, the Whonix Project is proud
to announce the release of Whonix 15.

Whonix 15 is based on the Debian buster (Debian 10) distribution. This
means users have access to many new software packages in concert with
existing packages, such as a modern branch of GNuPG, and more.
