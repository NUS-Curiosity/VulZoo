-=] About RootedCON

RootedCON is a technology congress that will be developed in Madrid
(Spain) from 5 - 7 of march 2020.

With an estimated seating from 2.500 to 3.000 people, is the most
relevant specialized congress that is held in the country, and one of
the most relevant in Europe, with attendee profiles ranging from
students, Law Enforcenment Agencies to professionals in the technology
and information security market and, even, just passionate people.

This is our XI edition, *after one tenth anniversary!*. And as in every
edition, we want it to make it special :)


-=] Talk types

We will mostly accept two kind of talks:

- Fast talks:           20 minutes.

the possibility of working with the schedule to extend a talk beyond the
20 minutes limit, or to reduce a 50 minutes one.

concepts technological or Information Security).

audio and video will be published, no matter the format and mechanism in
RootedCON's content management systems or others.

*Please*, make sure you understand your duties as a speaker before
submitting a proposal.


-=] Sponsors and partners

RootedCON is always looking for new quality sponsors. If you have a
propposal or feel your organization may be interested, please do contact
us in:

sponsors-AT-rootedcon.com

IMPORTANT: due to the mostly technical essence of the congress and the
prefences shown by our attendeess in multiple polls, we recommend to the
potential sponsors to work in a talk aligned with the expectation of our
public.

Any help, comment, idea, proposal or collaboration will be evaluated in
deep: it is very important for our Congress to receive this kind of new
ideas, as we depend on you to do our best in building the Event.


-=] Critical things to consider

1. Time management and talk duration are critical for the Congress. It
is better to ask for a longer slot, that to try to maximum twenty
minutes, not having time for interesting questions from the public.

2. We will evaluate with more interest those talks considered EXCLUSIVE,
not being shown in any other forum, blog, web, event or congress.

3. We believe in the responsible Full-disclosure so, if your idea is to
show a 0day, we need the confirmation that you have contacted the
vendor/victim. If this contact was not made, we can support you with
this.

4. We can cancel the relationship with the speaker if materials are not
provided in time. The delays may have an impact in travelling and
accommodation and other benefits.

5. PLEASE, it is quite important to *BE CLEAR* in the details of your
travelling and accommodation needs when you submit your talk; if you did
not confirmed your needs, RootedCON keeps the right of not covering new
requirement not submitted initially.
