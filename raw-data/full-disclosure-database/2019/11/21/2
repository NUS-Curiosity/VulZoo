         CVE Name       CVE-2019-18610                                        

      Description     A remote authenticated Asterisk Manager Interface       
                      (AMI) user without ���system��� authorization could use a   
                      specially crafted ���Originate��� AMI request to execute    
                      arbitrary system commands.                              
    Modules Affected  manager.c                                               

    Resolution  The specific parameters of the Originate AMI request that     
                allowed the remote code execution are now blocked if the      
                user does not have the ���system��� authorization.
