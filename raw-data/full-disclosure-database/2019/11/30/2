~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Inateck BCST-60 is a barcode scanner that can be either used wirelessly
using 2.4 GHz radio communication or wired via USB.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows [1]:

"With a 2.4G wireless connection, avoid the troubles of Bluetooth
pairing. Inateck BCST-60 is a leading product among scanners in the
field of large transmission ranges and battery endurance. What's more,
it can read barcodes at extreme angles. Whether you need barcode
scanning at your retail POS, at a hospital patient's bedside, on the
manufacturing production line or your warehouse, the Inateck BCST-60
will be a great fit for your specific needs."

Due to an insecure implementation of the data communication, the
wireless barcode scanner Inateck BCST-60 is vulnerable to keystroke
injection attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that the wireless barcode scanner Inateck BCST-60 is
vulnerable to keystroke injection attacks.

An attacker can analyze the unencrypted and unauthenticated data packets
of the 2.4 GHz radio communication sent by the wireless barcode scanner
to the receiver (USB dongle) in order to learn the used protocol. By
knowing the used data protocol, it is possible to send packets to the
USB dongle (receiver) of a target system, containing attacker-controlled
keystrokes or keystroke sequences.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS GmbH could successfully perform keystroke injection attacks against
the wireless barcode scanner Inateck BCST-60 using a developed
proof-of-concept software tool in combination with the USB radio dongle
Crazyradio PA and the nrf-research-firmware by Marc Newlin [2, 3].

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

SySS GmbH is not aware of a solution for this reported security
vulnerability.
