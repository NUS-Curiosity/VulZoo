Subject: Re: [FD] Anhui Huami Mi Fit Android Application - Unencrypted
	Update Check

What's the issue here exactly? An attacker can just prevent an the in app
update check from realizing it needs to nag the user?

The actual update logic and update-ability is controlled through the Play
Store, no?
