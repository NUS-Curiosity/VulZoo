Centraleyezer: Stored XSS using HTML Entities — [CVE-2019–12299]

Sandline Centraleyezer (On Premises) allows Stored XSS using HTML entities in the name field of the Category section.

I could bypass the restrictions using HTML Entities &gt &lt, the Stored XSS only triggers when editing the category.
