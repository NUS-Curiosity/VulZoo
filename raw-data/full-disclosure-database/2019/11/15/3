Subject: [FD] Getting the server ip from a hosted XenForo CMS

The reason why use this trick is to determine the ip for the server of
a XenForo CMS and bypass cloudflare or any DDOS protection. The user
uses a ip logger in combination with the Preview Thread feature of
XenForo to log the ip. This ip is the direct ip to the server without
protection.

Keep in mind that this feature can be used to determine the location
for a server even if the admin has strict rules to hide it's true
location (May work with TOR/Onion addresses, but i don't have any at
hand to test).
