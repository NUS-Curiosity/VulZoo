Hi list,

Read about potential UAF in PHP and Ruby via regex library "oniguruma" (for
example here:
https://thehackernews.com/2019/09/php-programming-language.html)

However, I didn't find default PHP and Ruby vulnerable:

https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/153

My investigation showed the onig_new_deluxe() is not used by default.
However, modified PHP to use it and fuzzed it and was able to reproduce UAF
in 7 mins :)

Write me if I am wrong. Would like to investigate this great bug.

Thanks,
Marcin
