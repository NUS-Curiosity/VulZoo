Subject: [FD] Insecure tmpdir() use in dbtoepub.rb in docbook /
	xslt10-stylesheets

See:

https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets/pull/144

«
See https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/tmpdir/rdoc/Dir.html -
tmpdir returns the same value everytime and as a result the tmpdirs can
be identical or existing.

SECURITY!

Thanks to phaul from #ruby .

There is a patch that seems to work well in the mageia linux package, but
no PoC exploit.
