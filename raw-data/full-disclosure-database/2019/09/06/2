> the permitted directory. Also if the page contains template directive, 
> then the directive will be server side processed, so if a user can

> The exploit will work only with .html extension.

> 1) go to http://localhost:8000/admin/pages/
> 2) click on create button
> 3) enable burp proxy forwarding
