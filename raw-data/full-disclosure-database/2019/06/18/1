Subject: [FD] BlogEngine.NET Directory traversal + RCE

BlogEngine.NET, versions 3.3.7 and earlier, is vulnerable to two separate
Directory Traversal issues that can lead to Remote Code Execution.

CVE-2019-10719 exploits a directory traversal in /api/upload, allowing
users to write files to any location within the web root.  This bypasses
the protection added in version 3.3.7 to prevent CVE-2019-6714.  A user,
with the ability to add images or files to posts, can upload a malicious
PostView.ascx file to the Themes folder.  The code could then be triggered
by setting the theme parameter to the newly create folder.

CVE-2019-10720 exploits a directory traversal in the theme cookie to
trigger a remote code execution.  A user, with the ability to add images or
files to posts, can upload a malicious PostView.ascx file, then trigger the
RCE by setting the theme cookie to ../../App_Data/files.
