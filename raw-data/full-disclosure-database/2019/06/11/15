Subject: [FD] New Version of Hyperion (PE runtime encrypter) released.

ï»¿

Hi,

We've just released version 2.0 of our PE crypter, hyperion.

[ CHANGELOG ]

- Support for 64bit was added

- C++ has been replaced by a more clean C implementation

- More modular concept allows extensions with custom payloads

[ DESCR ]

Hyperion is a runtime encrypter for 32- and 64-bit portable executables. It is
a reference implementation and bases on the paper "Hyperion:
Implementation of a PE-Crypter"
