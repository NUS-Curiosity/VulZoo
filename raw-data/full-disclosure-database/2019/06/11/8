Subject: [FD] [ Tool ] Linux kernel module generator for custom rules with
 Netfilter hooking.

 HiddenWall is a Linux kernel module generator for custom rules with
netfilter. (block ports, Hidden mode, rootkit functions etc). The
motivation: on bad situation, attacker can put your iptables/ufw to fall...
but if you have HiddenWall, the attacker will not find the hidden kernel
module that block external access, because have a hook to netfilter on
kernel land(think like a second layer for firewall).
