Subject: [FD] [Project] Open frame to the main.

Despite of anakata's motives one thing is certain, thanks to him some
people got hooked and started to talk about the security of mainframes.
Since then, few individuals, and before that even fewer, did their best
sharing their knowledge in the field and contributing to the infosec and
mainframe communities. This however was still not enough to close the gap
between mainframes and the rest of the world.

I'm sharing the bits and pieces (braindump) gathered over the years and
kicking-off an open/libre project where everyone can
contribute. Currently, the project is available on Github
https://github.com/hacksomeheavymetal/zOS/tree/master but who knows,
perhaps with time it will migrate
to https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects/supported-projects,
if only that would mean more people will contribute.

There's a possibility that at some point it will become a go to place for
everyone who would like to have fun and learn about mainframe security,
exactly the same way OWASP became such place for web apps. Or not.
