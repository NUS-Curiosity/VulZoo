Subject: [FD] [SE-2019-01] Java Card vulnerabilities (post shutdown release)

Hello All,

Original reports that were submitted to Oracle and Gemalto have been
posted to Security Explorations website:

http://www.security-explorations.com/javacard_details.html

This should help all interested parties to proceed with an independent
evaluation of the issues, but also judge Oracle and Gemalto stance with
respect to them.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
adam gowdiak
