Subject: [FD] Webex meetings are vulnerable to mitm

https://pankajupadhyay.in/2019/06/24/webex-meetings-are-vulnerable-to-mitm/

"In my free time, I was looking at some Android applications and noticed
that I was able to intercept SSL traffic for Webex Meetings app. When
explored it further, I found that Webex Meetings mobile app accepts
self-signed certificates. Also there is no certificate pinning enabled.

This makes Webex meet app vulnerable to Man in the middle attack.

Users of this app, if connected to a public Wi-Fi spot, can be targeted by
any person in the same network. If connected to a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot,
Wi-Fi provider may have access to the data passed from the app to the
server. Malwares on the device can also exploit this vulnerability to
intercept any sensitive data while itâ€™s traveling across the wire."
