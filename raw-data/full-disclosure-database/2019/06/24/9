Vulnerability summary
---------------------
The affected ABB components implement hidden administrative accounts used during the provisioning phase of the HMI interface. These credentials allow the provisioning tool "Panel Builder 600" to flash a new interface and Tags (MODBUS coils) mapping to the HMI.

These identified credentials are:

IdalMaster : idal123
exor : exor
The credentials are sent over both HTTP(S) and FTP. There is no option to disable or change these undocumented credentials.


Technical details
-----------------
An attacker can use these credentials to login to any ABB HMI type CP635 to read/write HMI configuration files and reset the device. Combining these actions can push malicious configuration and HMI code to the device.
