Subject: Egurra: A dumb file format fuzzer

Hello FD,

As a personal exercise I wrote a Python based "dumb" file format fuzzer.
It's mechanics are simple and robust and it's modular design allows you
to fuzz any app that gets input files as a parameter.
You can get a copy of it and a more elaborated explanation at

Cheers,
