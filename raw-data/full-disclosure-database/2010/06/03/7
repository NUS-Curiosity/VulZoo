Subject: Re: DoS vulnerability in Internet Explorer

Hello Laurent!

You was left almost on two years.

In October 2008 I released exploits for blocking DoS with alertbox which
affect many browsers ;-). As you can found it in my post DoS in Firefox,
Internet Explorer and Google Chrome (http://websecurity.com.ua/2575/).

I showed three variants of this attack, to show possibilities of bypassing
browsers protection. If you Laurent, who trying to show himself as security
professional, didn't know, so I'll tell you, that already in 2008 there were
browsers which can block such attacks. So your statement "in every browser
finaly" is incorrect already for two years. And in my post I published three
exploits for such DoS attack and the third one bypassed Google Chrome's
protection (versions 0.2.149.30 and 0.3.154.9 at that time). But Opera 9.52
was not affected at all. So Opera was most secure browser for this
particular attack :-).

During 2008-2010 I released a lot of different exploits of blocking DoS and
other types of DoS for different browsers. And I posted about these holes to
SecurityVulns (http://securityvulns.com/source15611.html).

And note that in this particular letter, on which you replied, I talked
about IE and about DoS without using any loops, just only one small string
with expression in style.

You didn't understand, Laurent. The best and only way to communicate with me 
it's cultural communication. If you can't speak with me in cultural manner, 
then better don't write me at all. Because I don't have to teach you good 
manners and if you'll continue to write me in such not serious tone, then 
I'll just banned you. So if you want to be put into my blacklist, you only 
need to write me about it or write me one more not serious letter. And I 
quickly fix this issue.

Best wishes & regards,
