Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Smarty template engine might allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code.

Background
==========

Smarty is a template engine for PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-php/smarty      < 2.6.23                            >= 2.6.23

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Smarty:

* The vendor reported that the modifier.regex_replace.php plug-in
  contains an input sanitation flaw related to the ASCII NUL character
  (CVE-2008-1066).

* The vendor reported that the _expand_quoted_text() function in
  libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php contains an input sanitation flaw via
  multiple vectors (CVE-2008-4810, CVE-2008-4811).

* Nine:Situations:Group::bookoo reported that the
  smarty_function_math() function in libs/plugins/function.math.php
  contains input sanitation flaw (CVE-2009-1669).

Impact
======

These issues might allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP
code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Smarty users should upgrade to an unaffected version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/smarty-2.6.23"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since June 2, 2009. It is likely that your system is already
no longer affected by this issue.
