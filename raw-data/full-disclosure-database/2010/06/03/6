Usually, a DoS is a vulnerability that crashes the program in a way that 
might be exploitable. Just making sure the user cannot use the browser 
anymore? There is a thosand ways to do it. Probably with some of them 
overloading the system in a way it will be faster to hard-reset it than 
to try and wait for Task Manager starting trough the load.
