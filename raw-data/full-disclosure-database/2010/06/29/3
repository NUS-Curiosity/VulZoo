	Application Cache attack

Mike,

That interpretation is accurate.

Dan,

It is not possible to create caches for HTTPS resources over HTTP.
However by caching root pages of the site's HTTP equivalent we can attack
the user before redirecting to HTTPS.
Similar to SSLstrip.

I probably didnt explain this well in the mail, sorry about that.

Cheers,
Lava
