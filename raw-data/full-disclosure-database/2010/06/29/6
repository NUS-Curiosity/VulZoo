I've been meaning to reply to this for a while.

I'm not picking on you in particular. I'm picking on the industry trend to
escalate severities to "high" and even "critical" for issues of no
particular concern.

Losing focus on the bugs that are _actually_ of "high" or "critical"
severity is a very bad thing.

In this instance, it would appear that the victim has to follow a list of
instructions -- including pasting a suspicious piece of script into a text
field -- in order for them to be exploited. It is of lesser severity than a
persisted XSS (0 suspicious link clicks to exploit) and also of lesser
severity than even a reflected XSS (1 suspicious link clicks to exploit).
In fact, if we assume a model where we can simply persuade the victim to
operate under this level of the attacker's instruction, we might as well ask
the victim to paste a javascript URI into the URL bar. Or simply ask the
victim to enter text such as attacker@...l.com in a UI control for a
forwarding address.

The vulnerability described in "steps to reproduce" cannot realistically be
considered to be of "high" severity.
