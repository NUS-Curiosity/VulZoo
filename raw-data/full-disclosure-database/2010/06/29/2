My understanding is that this refers to the ability to poison
http://www.mybank.com - which may be the default destination for a
good percentage of users - even if the only function of this page is
to redirect directly to https://www.mybank.com.

There should be no ability to use cache manifests delivered over http
to inject content into the https origin, or at least I hope so.
