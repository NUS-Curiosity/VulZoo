                            EC2ND 2010
         6th European Conference on Computer Network Defense 
                28-29 October 2010, Berlin, Germany

Final Call for Papers

  The sixth European Conference on Computer Network Defense (EC2ND)
  will be held at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer
  Science at Berlin Institute of Technology (TU Berlin). The
  conference brings together researchers from academia and industry
  within Europe and beyond to present and discuss current topics in
  applied network and systems security.

  EC2ND 2010 invites submissions presenting novel ideas in the areas
  of network defense, intrusion detection and systems security. Topics
  for submission include but are not limited to:

      * Intrusion Detection
      * Malicious Software
      * Web Security
      * Machine Learning for Security
      * Peer-to-Peer and Grid Security
      * Wireless and Mobile Security 
      * Network Forensics
      * Network Discovery and Mapping
      * Incident Response and Management
      * Privacy Protection
      * Cryptography
      * Legal and Ethical Issues 

  EC2ND 2010 specifically encourages submissions presenting work at an
  early stage with the intention to act as a discussion forum for
  innovative security research. While our goal is to solicit ideas
  that are not completely worked out, and might have challenging and
  interesting open questions, we expect submissions to be supported by
  some evidence of feasibility or preliminary quantitative results.

Important Dates

  Paper submission deadline:            July 9, 2010 (Extended)
  Paper acceptance or rejection:        August 6, 2010
