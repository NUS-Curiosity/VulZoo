Subject: Whitepaper: JBoss AS - Deploying WARs with the
 DeploymentFileRepository MBean

RedTeam Pentesting released a new JBoss security whitepaper with the title
"JBoss Application Server - Deploying WARs with the DeploymentFileRepository
MBean". It explains how to deploy WAR files with the DeploymentFileRepository
MBean and how this is even possible with Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The
paper is available at

http://www.redteam-pentesting.de/publications/jboss

This new informational page also contains the now publicly released scripts used
in the older paper "Bridging the Gap between the Enterprise and You - or - Who's
the JBoss now?".

Abstract
--------
The JBoss Application Server (JBoss AS) is a widely used, open source Java
application server. It is part of the JBoss Enterprise Middleware Suite (JEMS)
and often used in large enterprise installations. Because of the high modularity
and versatility of this software solution, which leads to a high complexity, the
JBoss AS is a rewarding target for attackers in enterprise networks. This paper
adds to the whitepaper "Bridging the Gap between the Enterprise and You - or -
Who's the JBoss now?" released by RedTeam Pentesting.  It shows how to use the
DeploymentFileRepository MBean to deploy a Web ARchive (WAR) without the need of
outbound connections being allowed for the JBoss AS. It also describes how this
can be used in conjunction with CSRF to attack a JBoss AS with a protected JMX
Console.
