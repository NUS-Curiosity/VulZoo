First of all you should keep in mind, that base64 raises the size of
your data by 33%.

posting big files especially on mailing lists might offend the other
users of the list. specially if you see the headline of lsi's answer.
there your message is marked as spam. Also assuming to have a lot of
people behaving like this would result in moderated lists.
BTW why not storing your data on rented space?

The next issue is that you can not trust private keys which are
published on the internet with respect to signatures. These keys could
have been cracked.
Using such a key only for yourself to have data on the internet seems
also not to make sense. It could be better placed on a private machine
where you have controled access to for example with VPN or ssh.

The next point is if you would like to use the key in an internet cafe
at a restaurant, you will not be able to trust the machine. most likely
there is a trojan on it or a key grabber.

there are other possibilities than PGP for example GPG ect. I would
rather trust such a software, since I am somehow sure, that enough
people tried to find bugs in it. Also a lot of scientists and hackers
tried to find a bug in the implementation.

If for example your software uses a weak Pseudo random number generator
this could result in weak key room.
