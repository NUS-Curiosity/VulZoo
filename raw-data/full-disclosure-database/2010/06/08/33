Subject: [TOOL]TMAC for Linux-beta

Hi list,

TMAC for Linux, is a bash program written for the purpose of changing the
MAC address of network interface cards in Linux OS, provided it has Bash
shell environment.
Please check the details and some sort of, funny description about it.

This has been successfully tested with Ubuntu system.
Suggestions are welcome.
