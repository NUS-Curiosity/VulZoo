-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apples Webkit. User interaction is required
in that the user must coerced into visiting a website or opening a
malicious document.

The specific flaw exists within how the library removes a particular
container element containing another element holding the contentEditable
attribute. Upon removal of the container during a particular event, the
library will traverse the tree and access the contentEditable element
that was freed. This can lead to code execution under the context of the
application.
