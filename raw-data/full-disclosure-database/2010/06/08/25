-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a
malicious document.

The specific flaw exists in the parsing of SXVIEW records in an Excel
spreadsheet. Due to the lack of checking when parsing structure items
for the record it is possible to write arbitrary data to a user
controlled address. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code
execution under the credentials of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
