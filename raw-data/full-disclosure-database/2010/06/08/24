-- Vulnerability Details:
This particular vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Excel. User
interaction is required in that a target must visit a malicious page or
open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists in the parsing of DBQueryExt records in an
Excel spreadsheet. Due to the lack of checking when parsing particular
fields within the structure, it is possible to get a user-controlled
pointer to be called. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code
execution under the credentials of the currently logged in user.

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
