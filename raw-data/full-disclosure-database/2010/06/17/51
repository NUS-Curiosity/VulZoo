Introduction:

Andrew, better known as weev, is a delusional young man who think he is
greater than he actually is. He hibernates on IRC,
babbles when smoked up on moon rocks, makes insane claims without any
evidence nor anyone calling him out about it, and
encourages others to join in his self-destructive behavior. His family hates
him and have not had contact with him for
over 2 years. Pictures of Andrew, which are widely available, show his
decline from his NY Times days (clean shaved),
to some of his pictures with long hair, and all the way up to his drug
arrest on 06/15/2010 where he looks like some flavor
of street bum begging you for the change you hear in your pocket but you
tell the bum it's your car keys just so you can
make a quick getaway.

Andrew, you should spend time in jail, which will detox your body of moon
rocks and your other drugs of preference. I'm
sure after a year or two of detox, avoiding prison rape, and begging for
protection from skinhead prison gangs - you'll
realize that your delusional life on IRC is not worth it so you will come
out of jail and live a normal, productive,
drug-free life.

Email #1 (Assume gobbles dropped weev's dox on his mom)

-------- Original Message --------
From: Alyse Auernheimer <designadventures@...il.com>

Subject: RE: So Weev...
Date: Sat, 3 Oct 2009 02:28:54 -0400

Mr. Lyon, Paul

There is a thread on your website referencing my son Andrew Auernheimer. I
am totally sympathetic with those posting as my son is guilty of horrible
behavior. We are ashamed of him and wish we could find him ourselves. Sadly,
your contributors felt the need to "Out" our family, Andrew's parents and
siblings. There are links to our younger children, one of whom is only 14,
our address  and phone numbers are available, photos of the children and one
reference by one poster as to a desire to rape me. The truth is everyone we
know already knows we have a mentally ill child. We have made no secret of
Andrew.

We too are victims of Andrew. The hardest part for all of us is that he used
to be normal. He loved us and was sweet and kind to his siblings. Several
years ago he developed a relationship with a girl with a serious drug
problem. He began by using xtc regularly and eventually graduated to LSD and
heroin. About three years ago he had a mental breakdown and began hearing
voices and talking to himself. He vanished from our lives. My children would
log into AIM to see if he was still alive; if he was logged on too long  or
not recently they would worry something had happened to him. There are
references to his lavish lifestyle on this thread but the sad truth is he is
paranoid schizophrenic and has been homeless a number of times. I am not
excusing his pathetic behavior. My husband and I contacted law enforcement
in Southern California almost a year ago as we wanted to try to "catch him"
and have him forcibly committed; he needs help. Unfortunately we were told
that the likely outcome would be 72 hours in a mental facility and they
would let him go and since we are in no financial position to pay for mental
health care for him we should just pray and forget it. I cried every night
for a year but I am done crying. I can only worry about things that I can
change and I really have NO information about Andrew. He never once gave us
a phone number or address where we could reach him. When he left here he did
not have a car or a license. I don't even know what state he might be in and
frankly, I don't know if I want to anymore.

I don't know if any of you have ever had a mentally ill family member. It is
torture. For it to be your child is indescribably painful.  I sometimes
wonder if  because our lives as a family have been dedicated to diversity
and inclusion, that he may have chosen his weapons to purposely hurt us. We
are tough though and committed to each other and making the most positive
contributions to our world as we are able.

I hope you all can find it in your hearts to please take down our personal
information. If your goal is to hurt US then you have succeeded. Other than
that I am not sure what the purpose of all this was. I don't cry over Andrew
anymore but I found this thread when I googled my daughter looking for a
school picture for her dorm room and I sobbed. She has never said an unkind
word to anyone and I knew she would be devastated. We are not responsible
for Andrew's totally screwed up life, he is. I was contacted erroneously on
my Facebook page by someone named Anton Garcia posing as a Dreamworks
Animation Employee trying to find Andrew because he was hacking Dreamworks.
I suspected it was fake but I answered anyway, truthfully. I too want him to
own up to his stupid behavior and take the consequences like a man. I'm sure
I will be disappointed. The worst part about this is you ONLY hurt us.
Andrew probably thought it was hilarious. He doesn't care what you say or do
to us, he only cares about himself. He, in the past, has even made up a
variety of ugly lies about us, but he is always found out.

Many of the postings referred to our family as nice. This is accurate. Our
other children are everything Andrew rejected, kind, smart, hard-working,
dedicated to making a difference through public service, and we have left
Andrew behind. There is so much need in this world and so little time that
spending it on tears and regret is a colossal waste. Don't get me wrong we
will always love Andrew and our hearts will forever be broken where he is
concerned but what else can we do but move on. It's like the Andrew we knew
died long ago. Hope does spring eternal and sometimes I dream the real
Andrew is home and we are all together, but my hopes are waning.  Who knows,
the future is never certain. I have been referred to an FBI agent who is
involved with the cyber crimes division. I will forward this email to her
tomorrow.

Again, please don't make my younger children suffer any more. Do what you
will with Andrew, he's earned it, but please let our family try to move on.
We have been dealing with this for years.

Sincerely,
Alyse Auernheimer

Email #2 (after dox dropped on F-D):

Mr. Learner,

You really are hilarious. I can infer one thing from your posts: you aren't
a hacker, and you find this really awkward and aren't sure how this whole
ruin thing works.

You have no access to data that I have not made public. Once again, the only
thing you found out was my name, which I put on my livejournal. Big deal.
The rest was google-able. You really don't have anything. You also don't
understand how to make this whole doxdrop deal effective and dramatic. You
save up everything you can until you find a piece of data which is
psychologically damaging to the target. You have to essentially find them
guilty of wrongdoing, like using a nonprofit to defraud people, or sucking
dicks for money. This whole thing where you post somebody's parents address,
big deal. Everybody's got parents unless they're orphaned. Those parents
inevitably live somewhere. If I were a basement dwelling loser, this tactic
might be effective. Unfortunately I live on 60 acres in the sticks and have
hungry dogs and guns. Not much you can do to me.

Since you are so fucking inept that you can't even find my birthday:
September 1st, 1985
My former school: James Madison University

Protip: Nobody in the FBI takes internet submitted tips seriously. If you
want to go submit leads to the FBI, you can do it directly to the FBI agent
out to get me.

Earlier you called for my "methods of alluding law enforcement." (sic; You
make so many errors in your English that it becomes hilariously obvious that
all your sockpuppets are the same person.) I've got some funny logs to give
you when you've exhausted your effort. You're going to LOL.
