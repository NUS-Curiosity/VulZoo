My response to the "Full disclosure is cyber terrorism" thread, which
was unpublished to the list, was:

"I think the ultimate goal is to dissuade people from getting into
hacking at all.  Black hat, white hat, it doesn't matter what you call
yourself if what you're doing is illegal regardless of intent and you
hear a continuous stream of people going to prison in the news.  It's
all fun and games on the internets until you decide to "hack" Sarah
Palin's email and end up in prison with your life irrevocably
destroyed."

"It seems clear that the goal of most legislation regarding "cyber
crime" is to prevent anyone from independently developing the
capability to discover
and disclose secrets through fear of severe penalties while
simultaneously preventing citizens from having the ability to keep
secrets of their own (bans on encryption technology in various
countries).  This does not bode well for a certain kind of personality
type that doesn't like to take "no" for
an answer and has the curiosity and intelligence to dig deeper than
accepting "access denied" as the final answer."

The proof is in the pudding.  The current state of "cyber crime"
legislation amounts to, "do something involving computers that a
powerful interest doesn't like and you will go down -- hard."

Better learn to start taking "no" for an answer.
