But, most of us immediately understand the issues from the IRCD 
backdoor, whereas at least the discussion worth reading in the 
"Congratulations Andrew" thread has actually been on-topic, clarifying 
common (at least among the ignorati that style themselves "hackers" 
these days) misunderstandings about what constitutes authorized access 
_and_ is also (loosley) on-topic for the actual thread as this issue 
seems likely to be at the heart of any case involving the iPad/AT&T 
data "leak", in which the person who is the actual subject of the 
"Congratulations Andrew" thread also seems likely to be involved...

So your stats are rather misleading.
