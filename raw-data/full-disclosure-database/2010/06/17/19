Subject: Re: targetted SSH bruteforce attacks

Hi Gary,

SSH daemons using password auth exposed to the Internet _do_ get
bruteforce attempts. I would not recommend moving it to a different port
than 22 as that would be of very, _very_ little help - rather switch to
public key auth (plus SPA if you're paranoid), et voila.
I don't think there's someone out there craving for _your_ box - but
scripts running from compromised hosts, scanning for password-protected
SSH daemons (as well as a bunch of known exploitable webapps and
services), trying to reach out for 'fresh meat', and as such expand the
zombie net? Definitely ;)

Cheers.
