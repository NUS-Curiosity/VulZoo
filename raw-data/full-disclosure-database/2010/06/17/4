There's nothing surprising about software that has a bug - all software
is shit and shot through with holes. We expect that (please forgive the
arrogance of me using 'we' as if I speak for a group).

Like I should care that much about some shite IRC daemon? The fact that
it got any responses at all is interesting. Holy cow, water's wet? I
better respond! :)

Whereas the issue with andrew/weev/soon-to-be-assgaped is a bit of a
surprise and hilarious. I dunno what you mean by 'random' but sadly, at
the risk of feeding his ego, he has some history around these parts.
