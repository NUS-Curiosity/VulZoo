Since almost every angle of securing SSHD publicly have already been listed I will not
delve into that, so take my advice with a grain of salt.

In my environment, in order to access any of what I call trusted resources (such as ssh) I
require myself to have VPN connectivity. This eliminates the need of having SSHD listen
publicly, and as expected, eliminated all unknown hosts accessing my box via SSHD. It also
made my auth log much shorter and manageable as well :), but it is also more boring.

I'm guessing this wont work for your situation (seeing that you don't want to change the
public port either).

Otherwise, as said before:
Changing the port will absolutely reduce the number of hits, and concurrent attack attempts.

Use of port-knocking techniques will also achieve the above, and the use of PKA will
almost (almost, nothing is certain, hehe Debian) eliminate the chance of the opposition
recreating your private key.
