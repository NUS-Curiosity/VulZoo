Paul, it's more secure in that brute force attacks are mitigated because the private key is required by the client and the public key must appear in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.  Disabling password authentication means a weak password on an account cannot be compromised by brute force or other discovery efforts.  A password on the private key provides even greater defense-in-depth security.

Disable password authentication and enforce key-pair authentication and targeted brute-force attacking becomes moot very quickly.  Moving SSHd from TCP 22 also keeps the script-kiddies and automated scanners away.

After doing these two basic things then it's time to focus on fail2ban, denyhosts, and the other firewall integrating solutions.
