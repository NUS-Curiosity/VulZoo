Um, yeah... that's exactly what I recommend in the article, which I'm
sure you read. ;o)

The original suggestion was "If you want SSH on a different port, do
this with firewall rules".

Way too much work, IMO.

Or just change the entry in ./etc/sshd_config

# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
Port 22

>>From man(5)sshd_config :

Port: Specifies the port number that sshd(8) listens on. The default
is 22. Multiple options of this type are permitted. See also
ListenAddress.
