Subject: Re: targetted SSH bruteforce attacks

Looks like what I'm seeing, most source IPs don't repeat, and they are
sharing a dictionary. I have Denyhosts running and since last night
20:38 have only denied about 60 addresses. My denyhost config bans a
host that misses twice!

The attacks are from all around the world, I've seen reverse lookups
from .fr .tw .jp .com .net everything ..

I've attached an excerpt from my /var/log/messages and you can see
that the attacks are not that fast and there is a surprisingly short
list of denied hosts at the end of the file. I could change my
denyhosts to deny IPs after only one fail, but then I risk locking
myself out by accident.
