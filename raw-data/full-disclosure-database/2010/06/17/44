Subject: Re: targetted SSH bruteforce attacks

On FreeBSD you can probably just use the following pf.conf line to
block most of such attacks:

block in quick proto tcp from any os "Linux" to any port ssh

(Note that with this you may lose the ability to login from any Linux
based box including from an Android phone, etc)

Of course it's wise to disable password authentication and just use
public key authentication.

Cheers,
