One of two things springs to mind:

1) when they scanned your address space looking for SSH hosts to try to
whack, your one host didn't report as a target for some random reason.

2) they're handling their list of targets in a pseudo-random order.  We've
seen attacking IPs pound on 2 or 3 hosts in our /16 for a few days, then go
away, and 2-3 weeks later return to pound on other targets.

Bottom line: Either they didn't notice your other box, or they'll get around
to poking it in a few weeks...
