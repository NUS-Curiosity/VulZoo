Subject: Re: targetted SSH bruteforce attacks

Answering the question of the topic: Yes.

If you plug-in a completely a new box to the internet, and watch the logs
you shall see there is an attack going on. The net is full of automated BOTS
running and they just keep hitting you (randomly or something).

BTW, a good solution to these problems is a Port-Knocking system, which
makes your service completely unexposed. See Tariq or any other PK system:
