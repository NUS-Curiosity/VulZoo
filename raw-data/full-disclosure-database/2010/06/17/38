After being regularly nailed on my port 22, I *did* move it.  I've had
only *one* attack since then, down by a factor of 20 or so.

Yes, it's worth it to not be on port 22, as long as you're one of the
few. :)  Remember, these bots are going for low-hanging fruit... it's
not worth it for them to hit all 65k ports.

Now, if we *all* move away from 22, your advice is more appropriate.
