that is yet to be decided in the judiciary and/or a jury of peers.
AT&T's data spill due to their own negligence seems obvious, the rest
of the culpability is yet to be assigned....

for a similar argument see Google's wifi snarfing mea culpa while
still proclaiming adherence to 18 U.S.C. §2511(2)(g)(1), 18 U.S.C.
§2510(16), etc.; and considering public good intent of the obfuscated
release, rather than fraud per 18 U.S.C. §1029(a)(8) for example, the
cause is weak.

however, the realities for wee vs particular situation, across the
federal, state, municipal and/or city jurisdictions is pretty poor.
they're going to screw you on almost anything for almost any time
period costing you almost any exorbitant defense if you've
sufficiently pissed off the right resources. James Atkinson is
currently getting screwed for over the counter proton pump inhibitors
in unlabeled bottles among other trumped up state charges* ultimately
driven by blow back for his whistle blowing and coast guard
incompetence exposure before congress.

* details too numerous to list here, but this is the abridged digest
summary of the situation.
