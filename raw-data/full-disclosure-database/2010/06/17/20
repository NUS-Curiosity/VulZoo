Subject: Re: targetted SSH bruteforce attacks

Thanks Emmanuel,

    I have to access that box sometimes from other machines than my
own, so I would have to have my key and install it on all kinds of
Windows boxen .. I have extremely good passwords that I change every
30 days, or every time I use a machine that I'm not 100% sure of.
