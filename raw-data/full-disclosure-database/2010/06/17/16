Subject: Re: targetted SSH bruteforce attacks

I just knew that people would say that, and that's why I specified
that I WANT to keep SSH on 22 .. it's fun to see the attacks, and it's
interesting to see new types of attacks. The question here is whether
anyone else is seeing such a targeted attack.
