Point taken.  However, my ulterior motive was in promoting
obfuscated-openssh, which, IMHO, is an excellent and under-appreciated
enhancement to openssh.

Note that with iptables you can leave ssh on port 22 but have it answer
on other ports.  See http://proxyobsession.net/?p=869

Why anyone would want to do that is beyond me.

 I just knew that people would say that, and that's why I specified
 that I WANT to keep SSH on 22 .. it's fun to see the attacks, and it's
 interesting to see new types of attacks. The question here is whether
 anyone else is seeing such a targeted attack.
