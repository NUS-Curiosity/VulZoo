Subject: Re: targetted SSH bruteforce attacks

I had an attacker go after one of my FreeBSD machines for almost two
months straight. I wrote my own denyhost (like) script and banned his
IP's constantly, but it didn't stop until he ran out of proxies I guess.
Either that or it was busy season for my ip block.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] targetted SSH bruteforce attacks

Hello list,

    I have a strange situation and would like information from the
list members. I have three Linux boxes exposed to the Internet. Two of
them are on cable modems, and both have two services that are publicly
available. In both cases, I have SSH and named running and available
to the public. Before you folks say it, yes I run SSH on TCP/22 and no
I don't want to move it to another port, and no I don't want to
restrict it to certain source IPs.

    Both of these systems are within one /21 and get attacked
regularly. I run Denyhosts on them, and update the central server once
an hour with attacking IPs, and obviously also download the public
hosts.deny list.

    These machines get hit regularly, so often that I don't really
care, it's fun to make the script kiddies waste their time! But in
this instance, only my home box is being attacked... someone is
burning a lot of cycles and hosts to do a distributed dictionary
attack on my one box! The named daemon is non recursive, properly
configured, up to date and not being attacked.

    Is anyone else seeing this type of attack? Or is someone really
targeting MY box?

Thanks
