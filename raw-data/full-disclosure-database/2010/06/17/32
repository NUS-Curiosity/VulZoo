Subject: Re: targetted SSH bruteforce attacks

On this system, there is only one user allowed, and that's me. On one

bash script every night to grep the successful and unsuccessful logins
every night that is mailed to me, that's how I spot these things
quick. Also Denyhosts emails me for every Deny.
