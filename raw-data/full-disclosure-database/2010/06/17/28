I've seen an interesting SSH attack in the last couple of days on our /22
network.  Instead of probing port 22 on many machines in the shortest
possible time period as usual, this attack seems to be trying to be
stealthy.  It never attacks more than 4 machines in an hour and never twice
from the same IP address.  As all attacking addresses are subsequently
blocked, I wonder how long is it going to take for the guy(s) to run out of
available addresses at this rate :-)

Cheers
Frank
