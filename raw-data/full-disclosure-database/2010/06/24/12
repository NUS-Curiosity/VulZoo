The mathematical relationship between this "total cost of ownership" 
and malware mutation rates will be particularly interesting.  I 
suspect that TCO is proportional to malware numbers, and as malware 
is mutating at 243% per year, +/- error, that would imply that TCO is 
rising by the proportionate amount, purely due to malware mutation.

This in addition to the numerous other aspects of certain desktop 
platforms, also known to inflate TCO.

The solution?  Dump the platform.  That, or hitch your budget to an 
exponential curve.....
