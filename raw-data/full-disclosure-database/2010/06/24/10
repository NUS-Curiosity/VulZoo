Of course any way of measuring it will be fundamentally flawed in
certain ways. There is always that pesky 80/20 or 90/10 rule. And you
can of course figure out a way of correcting for corner cases, but
that will only create additional corner cases. That's what makes
lawyering on product liability a craft at best and usually some form
of black magic.

And yes, there may very well be unintended consequences. Nonetheless,
I feel the era of complete exoneration from product liability is
coming to an end for packaged software. Especially in the security
industry. It is just a matter of an 'unsafe at any speed' moment
occurring and there will be legislation, however braindead such
legislation may be from an engineering viewpoint.

Call me a pessimist, but we've been putting way too much critical
stuff on internet connected systems while at the same neglecting basic
hygiene at every level not to have some disaster to happen. It isn't
so much a question of if but when that will happen.

Regards,

 Walter
