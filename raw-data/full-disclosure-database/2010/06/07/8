Subject: Hacxx Anti Malware for Windows XP

Hi,

I have been developing a tool in batch to block general malware for
some time now  and recently i found an exploit that can add the
registry keys from a web browser.

Hacxx Anti Malware for Windows XP blocks virus and worms using known filenames.

To install it simply visit http:///antimalware.x10.bz and click in Run
Hacxx Anti Malware.
You must accept the ActiveX and the source is available in the site.
