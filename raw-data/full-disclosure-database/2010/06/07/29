All anti-malware programs slow your computer. With the "good" ones, you
expect to get some protection from the bad guys out there.
Unfortunately, the bad ones are really malware disguised as
anti-malware programs. There are more of these fake, anti-malware
programs than the legitimate anti-malware programs.

You installed a fake anti-malware program. The only question left is
how bad is the program? You might want to read this link and get
educated:

If you want to spend money on anti-malware, consider Bitdefender. If
you want to go the free route, consider ClamAV.
