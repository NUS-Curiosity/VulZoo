Subject: Vulnerability in the Future

Hello Full-Disclosure,

I'd like to tell you about a vulnerability in the future soon to come, but
very
often uncommunicated and unequal not serious to be conclusive. I already
wisely wrote with no prejudice for this vulnerability. In fact I find this
to be found in 1979 before Smashing Pumpkins (and after my announce in
1980) so that time were sites with them and with not them.

Also note that from my side, I'd never disclosed vulnerability on time
but often after years as I am a sage. It's my main criterion for all kind
of future disclosure. Not now but in the future like Michael J Fox.

But because all other posts are all too lame and the list demonstrated
not serious behavior, I have full puppy power disclosure now. So don't
waste your time writing me anymore. I hack now will the world.

I hope this will help you all to use your time for good purposes. If you
don't like any of my advisories to Full-Disclosure mailing list, then
just ignore it. My advisories are designed for those who is interested
in them. For those who be serious about security and disclosure.

List, I want to speak now about vulnerability but choose to wait until
two years from now.
