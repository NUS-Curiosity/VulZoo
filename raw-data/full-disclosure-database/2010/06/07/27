Boy, I sure hope you are joking.

Just in case any newbies get ideas:

Never install anything offered on this list. Be very careful about
opening attachments offered on this list. 

If you must install something, you typically do it on a recently
snapshotted version of Windows running in a virtual machine. When you
are done playing, you revert to your last snapshot.
