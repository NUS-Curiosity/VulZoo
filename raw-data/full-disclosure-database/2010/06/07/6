Subject: Google Apps CSRF vector, email disruption

Hello Google et al,

I have devised a proof-of-concept via Cross-Site Request Forgery that
allows arbitrary unvalidated attackers to disrupt Google Apps email on
any domain.  For my time and research into this issue, I am offering
to sell the vulnerability to you at a fair price compensation, within
the next week.  If I do not receive an offer to purchase prior to June
14, I will presume that you are not interested in patching this
vulnerability or acquiring my intellectual property.  At that time, I
will sell it on the open market.  Please let me know how you would
like to proceed.

Regards,
-- 
Kristian Erik Hermansen
