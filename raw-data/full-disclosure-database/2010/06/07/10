*Hacxx Anti Malware for Windows XP blocks virus and worms using known
filenames.

To install it simply visit http:///antimalware.x10.bz and click in Run
Hacxx Anti Malware.
You must accept the ActiveX and the source is available in the site.*

I'll stick to my antivirus program :D

You really think that someone will fall to that HERE?
