So far so good.
You've been able to go from t biehn -> Travis Biehn -> Bomber Article
(parent's names, city, state, country) -> whitepages.com (Address and Phone
number) -> (not clear on your jump here, did you google their name or for
the address?) Real estate listings.
Now to pull the SS and CC #'s you're going to have to go the extra mile. I'd
enjoy seeing you pull our SS numbers, being that we're all Canadians.
