As I said: Travis indicated in his original post he believes the exploit 
*was already being used in the wild*. So NOT releasing it wouldn't 
protect users. It would just keep it "secret" from everyone except 
Microsoft *and the black hats who were already using it*. While 
maintaining a false air of intact security for everyone else.

That is better, how?
