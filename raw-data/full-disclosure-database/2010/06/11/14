 Malformed Escape Sequences Incorrectly

Hello list,

The included POC seems to work fine with IE7 or IE8 installed, however I am not able to run any javascript code on a clean XP SP2 with IE6.

Does that mean that you require a newer browser to use the defer trick?, is machines with IE6 for a change unaffected?

I see that Tavis says "assuming a recent IE" but later down he says "Machines running version of IE less than 8 are, as usual, in even more trouble."

Does anyone care to clarify?

Regards, Giorgio Sardo
