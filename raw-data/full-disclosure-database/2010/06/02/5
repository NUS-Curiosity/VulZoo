Subject: TEHTRI-Security: Many 0days soon released at
	SyScan Singapore 2010

Dear IT Security colleagues,

Mid-June 2010, TEHTRI-Security will be at SyScan Singapore for an
outstanding conference.

There, we will release more than 13 remote pre-auth zero-days against
many different products (yes: 13 0days...).

We will also propose multiple generic technical solutions that might
help white hats when they want to counter-strike most exploits packs
systems and web attackers.

And before we conclude, we will also offer a complete web based botnet
tracking and destruction from a real life example...

It's time to get rid of those threats, and to show that there are other
non-standard solutions when you are under attack. Stay tuned...

We would like to thank the big and small companies who trusted our
services and who asked for assistance by also sharing some logs and some
blackhat tools that they caught when they were under attack. If you have
such web security issues, do not hesitate to contact us, so that we can
help and assist you with our innovative technologies or our trainings.
