Hmm a company that can predict 13 new infections roughly two weeks in
advance - or are they simply hanging onto stuff they have found for
weeks (perhaps months) in advance of a show? Why?

IMHO Its sad when marketing goons can override the wishes of the techies
in a security company. Also not very confidence inspiring that a company
would hang onto a exploits for weeks (or months) just for a show instead
of notifying thier customers...

Seriously bad marketing strategy methinks.
