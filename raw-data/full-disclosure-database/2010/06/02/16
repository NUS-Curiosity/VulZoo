Synopsis
========

Several cache poisoning vulnerabilities have been found in BIND.

Background
==========

ISC BIND is the Internet Systems Consortium implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/bind     < 9.4.3_p5                           >= 9.4.3_p5

Description
===========

Multiple cache poisoning vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND. For
further information please consult the CVE entries and the ISC Security
Bulletin referenced below.

Note: CVE-2010-0290 and CVE-2010-0382 exist because of an incomplete
fix and a regression for CVE-2009-4022.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this weakness to poison the cache of a
recursive resolver and thus spoof DNS traffic, which could e.g. lead to
the redirection of web or mail traffic to malicious sites.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All BIND users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.4.3_p5"
