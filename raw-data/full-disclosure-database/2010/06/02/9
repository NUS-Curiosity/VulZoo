Subject: Re: Full-disclosure] Why the IPS product designers

It always depends on decisions and always follows an 1:1 basis.

Whether someone tries to sell you a single solution, it means:
1. He/She doesn't have a complete understanding of your problem;
2. He/She doesn't care what kind of threat you have or will have in a  
future;
3. He/She only has one single solution to ptotect you.

But, IMHO, this a "blind" discussion: trying to figure out the reason  
someone drives you a single or multiple solution... And... You know  
what? Whatever the reason is, it doesn't matter at all!!! What really  
matters is the misunderstood peolpe have about how to protect  
themselves!!!

I don't think that's the point here. The point here is understand the  
approaches to protect a real world envinronment, and I keep saying:  
you MUST deploy something in your host when you deploy something in  
your network. And here is the reason:
- If you protect your network with CLIENT-SIDE threats in mind you  
MUST deploy a CLIENT-SIDE protection layer, otherwise you will fail.  
That's logical decision. Because, as I said before, it is not 1990  
anymore, and there are no borders either... So if you think you are  
protecting you users by adopting a network solution only, what is  
gonna happen when they travel out of you "Borders"?

For those who believe Host vs. Network is all about budget... Well, It  
shouldn't be, because threats don't care about this, because they want  
to get you!

That's is my personal feeling, and, BTW, it is based on my experience...

Anyone that says you COULD deploy a host solution with a network  
solution doesn't really know the problems you have... Or he/she just  
ignore the actual threats.

I'm not selling anything here, except for the educational discussion.  
And I should warn people that there is no miracle solution for all the  
problems... So, IMHO, you MUST deploy host and network together (I  
love to say this 8)...
