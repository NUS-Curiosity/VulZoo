Yes it has. Not necessarily "better" features, but certainly different ones.

To start, it doesn't take a single input file and then mutate it. You
can build a pool of files that provide better code coverage in the
fuzzed binary than what a single file could achieve. Second, it doesn't
allow you to choose how much bytes and where and with what values to
mutate. Boldy, it mutates random amount bytes (adjusted to a certain
percent of the filesize, a.k.a fuzzfactor) with random values at random
places in the sample file that is randomly chosen from the sample pool.
Although less effective in short term, in the long term you can
potentially test all mutable posibilities. In this sense, the amount of
fuzzed code in the target increases alongside the computation time provided.

Most of this (and more) was explained in the post though.
