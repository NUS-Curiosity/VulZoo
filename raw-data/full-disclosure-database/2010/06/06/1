Subject: Re: DoS vulnerability in Internet Explorer

Hello Christian!

I'm glad for your attention to my letter about DoS vulnerability in Internet
Explorer. But your answer (as Jeff's) is completely unequal and is
completely off-topic. So I'll draw your attention to the next.

As I already wrote in February to another reader of Full-disclosure, who
resent me Jeff's letter, that no need to do it. From February Jeff is in my
blacklist (as I informed him and the list), so no need to resend me his
letters. If you'll be doing so (to bypass my blacklist filters for his
letters), then I'll be counting you as not serious one (like Jeff) and will
use for you the same approach. I don't have to teach you (or Jeff) good
manners. And my blacklist will quickly fix this issue.

About his level of creativity, then it's very low. As it's clear from his
letter. And note, that he is in my blacklist from February, but he continue
to write me letters even in June. Looks like he fond of conversation with my
blacklist filters. I recommend both of you to use your time more wiser.

Best wishes & regards,
