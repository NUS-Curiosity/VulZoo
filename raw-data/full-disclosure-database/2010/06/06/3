Subject: Re: Blackberry pwd hack or reset

Older versions of the BB windows desktop sync application do not respect the
password prompt and will allow you to pull info from the phone, or to pull
info from phone backups.

For phone connections, these versions understand serial ports only.

Which versions and getting a serial to usb connection working are left as
exercises for the reader (I don't feel like doing the googling for you).
