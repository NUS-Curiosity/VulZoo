Subject: Re: Congratulations Andrew

So you're telling us we should all be getting our cupboards filled with
drugs so the next time we deface Whitehouse we get away with *just* drug
trafficking?

I'm not arguing that they were right or not, I'm just saying that a felony
is to be tried, regardless of conditions (it's how democracy should work
anyway).

That said, I also agree, no one should be stupid enough to mess up with
corporate servers and drugs at the same time, especially if s/he knows
they're after him.
