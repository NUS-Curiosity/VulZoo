I stand corrected-that key was indeed 1024, not 2048.  LSI still has some hope in cracking my key and getting that scan of my passport since I used "ancient encryption" after all!  FWIW, v1.1.07 actually uses 4096 bit keys, which I will update shortly.  Not sure if I'm going to make that configurable or not.  I'm thinking no, because there's no real value in using a smaller key in this application.
