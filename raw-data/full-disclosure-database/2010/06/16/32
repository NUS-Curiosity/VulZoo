By the same logic, then yes you would.  Which is why the statement “if a system has no password, then you have a legal right to whatever data is on it” is complete horse hockey.  
 
Don’t take technical advice from your lawyer, and don’t take legal advice from people on security lists.

By that same standard.. if you leave your house unlocked.... does that give someone the right to enter it?

The FBI was investigating the AT&T incident, presumably the AT&T incident was what the fed were serving against.
What possible valid search warrant could be executed? There was no hack, breach, illegal access of data, or anything else for that matter.

If you leave a system online with no password which allows you to scrape content you have a legal right to scrape that content.

Do you have any actual basis for saying that?  Sure, the warrant might be
bullshit, it might be solid - the article doesn't give us enough info either
way to tell.

"Auernheimer was also arrested in March for giving a false name to law
enforcement officers responding to a parking complaint."

Sad.  The dude may have the intelligence to pull the hack, but not have the
wisdom to not dig a hole deeper. Just man up and take the frikking parking
ticket. ;)
