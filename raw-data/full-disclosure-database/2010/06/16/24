Furthermore if I access an online resource and I notice that the information
ends and the URL has a &page=1 on the end and no link exists on that page to
say... &page=2 is that illegal?
On the same note, if I notice something that looks like a SELECT statement
in a URL (due to excellent coding) is it illegal for me to modify that
SELECT statement to return other information?
Is the legality of access to the resource something that must be explicitly
granted to me or is it some abstract property depending on the content I've
accessed? Is it legal to randomly fuzz web service arguments without knowing
the data that it will return?

Usually systems of this nature will have an EXPLICIT notice that you cannot
access data on it unless you're authorized OR will require (as it does now)
authentication.

Did the ICCID count as authentication if it is not explicitly labeled by
AT&T as such? A field like:
&password would clearly be illegal to brute force.

An analogy to a case with CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY defined law regarding
private property doesn't really seem to fit.
