On all those points, I agree.  But that's the problem - there is no explicit granting of rights unless, well, they are explicit.  That's why *I* get to say what is legal or not as the owner.

If you telnet to 80 on my box, and type HEAD / HTTP/1.0 then that's fine.  But if you type HEAD / HTTP/SIRHACKALOT then I can say you were trying to hack into my system.  And I could probably get some DA somewhere who's looking for press to buy into it.

That's the real problem here.  It's like Apple having the cops break down the door of the journalist who wrote about the phone.  That's Stormtrooper stuff if you asked me, but yet, he's got to defend himself against the charges.  And that costs money.

Anyway, I agree with you in theory on everything you've said, but the unfortunate truth is that there your implicit rights to data do not translate into explicit.

Lets just call a spade a spade here:
AT&T got butthurt at the media ruin and forced the man to come down hard on someone.
A perfect someone to restore public faith in the order of the world was Weev.

So AT&Ts lawyers drafted some bum legal pretense under which to raid weev looking for some related incriminating content and handed it off to the cops. Of course they were going to find something illegal on his premises, have you seen half the shit he writes online?

This is another instance of Corporate Policy leading to unjustified Policing action; it is the second such occurrence in the past few months. Maybe AT&T schooled Apple in mobile networking and in turn Apple schooled AT&T in corporate control of public police forces.

Furthermore if I access an online resource and I notice that the information ends and the URL has a &page=1 on the end and no link exists on that page to say... &page=2 is that illegal?
On the same note, if I notice something that looks like a SELECT statement in a URL (due to excellent coding) is it illegal for me to modify that SELECT statement to return other information?
Is the legality of access to the resource something that must be explicitly granted to me or is it some abstract property depending on the content I've accessed? Is it legal to randomly fuzz web service arguments without knowing the data that it will return?

Usually systems of this nature will have an EXPLICIT notice that you cannot access data on it unless you're authorized OR will require (as it does now) authentication.

Did the ICCID count as authentication if it is not explicitly labeled by AT&T as such? A field like:
&password would clearly be illegal to brute force.

An analogy to a case with CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY defined law regarding private property doesn't really seem to fit.

So what grants you legal access to aol.com<http://aol.com> (HTTP port 80 get / )?
I'm confused? Does search engine indexing grant legal access to online resources?

By the same logic, then yes you would.  Which is why the statement "if a system has no password, then you have a legal right to whatever data is on it" is complete horse hockey.

Don't take technical advice from your lawyer, and don't take legal advice from people on security lists.

By that same standard.. if you leave your house unlocked.... does that give someone the right to enter it?

The FBI was investigating the AT&T incident, presumably the AT&T incident was what the fed were serving against.
What possible valid search warrant could be executed? There was no hack, breach, illegal access of data, or anything else for that matter.

If you leave a system online with no password which allows you to scrape content you have a legal right to scrape that content.

Do you have any actual basis for saying that?  Sure, the warrant might be
bullshit, it might be solid - the article doesn't give us enough info either
way to tell.

"Auernheimer was also arrested in March for giving a false name to law
enforcement officers responding to a parking complaint."

Sad.  The dude may have the intelligence to pull the hack, but not have the
wisdom to not dig a hole deeper. Just man up and take the frikking parking
ticket. ;)
