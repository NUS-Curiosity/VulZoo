Subject: Re: yahoomail dom based xss vulnerability

Thanks Brother,

                      See, how this occurred, Basically in most of the cases Developers  Simply design a APIs and when the client request for any page this APIs gets Stored in the Client side. its main task is to takes the user input and shows the result immediately  to the client without sending request to the server. so when this type of APIs is vulnerable to XSS this is called the DOM based XSS. 

Now in this case, when we click on [New Folder] for creating any new folder and provide any javascript, it directly took by the API stored in the client side when the inbox page is load in the client side in yahoomail, and get reflected. 

that's all the story Bro, hope you understand what i really want to say.

Thanks,
Pratul Agrawal

Its working Bro.  I think u had done some mistakes so u try it again with check that javascript execution feature is enable in your browser. and bro for execution of script it is must to use proper syntax that contain special characters. just put "><script>alert(123)<script>  in the New Folder field comes in the Move button and you will saw a pop up message with 123 reflected.

Have a nice time bro,
