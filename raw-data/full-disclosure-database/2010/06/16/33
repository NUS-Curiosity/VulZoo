Brute forcing AES256 will never be feasible.  Factoring your RSA key
will be -- soon too.

You're using a 1024 bit key here which seems a bit gutsy ;-)  

Without better attacks, you basically have:

Brute force AES 256 -> O(2^256)
Bruce force your 20 char password -> roughly O(2^(20*7)) == O(2^140)
Factor your 1024 bit public modulus -> roughly O(2^80)

Since a 768 bit RSA key has already been factored I'd say you only have
a few years before a moderately sized cluster could factor your public
key.

Of course, as I write this I realize I'm about to sign this message
with a 1024 bit DSA key...
