Yes, he is surely on crack, or some other white substance. I'm going to stick my neck out here and say that there are likely many people on the list who work in various government, be it national or federal, state, regional or local agencies, who wouldn't be associated with FD if it was a cyber terror list. Admittedly, FD is a mere shadow of what it was between 04 and 06, but it's still completely useful and relevant. Except, of course, for the Andrews of this world ======D
