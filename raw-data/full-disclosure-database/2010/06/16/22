Typically I just lurk and watch the much more opinionated of the list
discuss. However,


I'm gunna disagree here, If you put something up on a publically facing
webpage, and it's supposed to be confidential information. It sure as hell
better have a non-default password, let alone a password period! It would be
like the military putting up confidential battle plans online w/o a barrier
and expecting the enemy not to use them. It's simply idiotic, and ridiculous
to try and prosecute someone for your idiocy.

Now that I've said my two cents, Im going to sink back into the depths.
