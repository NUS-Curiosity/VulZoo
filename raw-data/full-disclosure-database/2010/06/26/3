Subject: New IETF Internet-Drafts on TCP timestamps

Folks,

We (Andre Oppermann and me) have co-authored a new IETF Internet-Draft
about TCP timestamps generation, entitled "On the generation of TCP
timestamps". The I-D is available at:
http://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-gont-timestamps-generation-00.pdf

I have also authored a related I-D, entitled "Reducing the TIME-WAIT
state using TCP timestamps" which has already been accepted as a wg
item of the TCPM working group of the IETF. This one is available at:
http://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-ietf-tcpm-tcp-timestamps-00.pdf

Any comments will be more than welcome (in particular, about the
timestamps generation one).

P.S.: Related technical reports, presentations and stuff available at:
http://www.gont.com.ar

Thanks!

Kind regards,
Fernando Gont
