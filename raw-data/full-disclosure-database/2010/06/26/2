 FWIW, CPNI (http://www-cpni.gov.uk) published a very thorough technical
report on TCP security:
http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/tn-03-09-security-assessment-TCP.pdf

An the IETF is currently workin on a RFC version of it:
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-tcpm-tcp-security-01.txt . This one is
the original IETF individual submission, which contains those sections that
have not yet been commited to the IETF-adopted one:
http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-gont-tcp-security-00.txt

Thanks,
Fernando Gont
