Subject: Re: Congratulations Andrew

I can see both points but what I understood is that the hacking  
community of the days in which people hacked hardware and wrote  
software which made it work better was what Ladnah referred to?

e.g.
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7707585592627775409#

And I also agree with Christian in that I don't want my identity  
stolen for any ones sake, or learning purposes..

However we do need to take a step back and realize that as human  
beings are relying way to much on technology which we know is far from  
perfect.

To add to Ladnah's point I think we should hold the Software companies  
responsible for if a weakness in their software allows an intruder to  
steal my identity which ultimately leads to emotional distress. I  
think adequate compensation would be justified.
