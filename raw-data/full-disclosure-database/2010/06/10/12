Subject: Re: RDP, can it be done safely?

To be specific, it actually doesn't require a "client" cert in the strictest sense.  You can configure certificate parameters on the server in such a way that certificate trust chains must be honored (close enough) but if you want true client authentication based on a certificate, you would have to publish the RDP over RPC/HTTP(s) via something like ISA where you can specifically configure a listener to require client authentication certificates to be "presented" to the publisher, but that's not really the same thing.
