If you connect through a VPN it should be as secure as anything else youâ€™re
going to consider.

Hi Dan,



Where are the users located (local LAN or from an untrusted network such as
the Internet)?



If I recall correctly, RDP encryption is "turned on" from a GPO setting that
applies to the host/server, and not just RDP [or was it strong encryption?]
(corrections, please). So you can get a secure RDP connection at the cost of
possibly breaking other functionality.

You might find it easier to use another remote access solution.

 We have a boneheaded group of software developers who even in this day and

client.  Rather than have my accounting department log in directly to the
physical box, I would like to have them use some flavor of terminal services
on my Windows server. My question therefore is, can I turn on RDP safely,
without exposing my Windows server to risk of exploitation?

Thanks for any help you can give.
