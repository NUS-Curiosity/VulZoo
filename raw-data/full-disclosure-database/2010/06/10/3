[Full-Disclosure] Mailing List Charter
John Cartwright <johnc@...k.org.uk>
 

- Introduction & Purpose -

This document serves as a charter for the [Full-Disclosure] mailing 
list hosted at lists.grok.org.uk.

The list was created on 9th July 2002 by Len Rose, and is primarily 
concerned with security issues and their discussion.  The list is 
administered by John Cartwright.

The Full-Disclosure list is hosted and sponsored by Secunia.


- Subscription Information -

Subscription/unsubscription may be performed via the HTTP interface 
located at http://lists.grok.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/full-disclosure.

Alternatively, commands may be emailed to 
full-disclosure-request@...ts.grok.org.uk, send the word 'help' in 
either the message subject or body for details.

 
- Moderation & Management -

The [Full-Disclosure] list is unmoderated. Typically posting will be
restricted to members only, however the administrators may choose to 
accept submissions from non-members based on individual merit and 
relevance.

It is expected that the list will be largely self-policing, however in
special circumstances (eg spamming, misappropriation) then offending 
members may be removed from the list by the management.

An archive of postings is available at 
http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/.
 

- Acceptable Content -

Any information pertaining to vulnerabilities is acceptable, for 
instance announcement and discussion thereof, exploit techniques and 
code, related tools and papers, and other useful information.

Gratuitous advertisement, product placement, or self-promotion is 
forbidden.  Disagreements, flames, arguments, and off-topic discussion 
should be taken off-list wherever possible.

Humour is acceptable in moderation, providing it is inoffensive. 
Politics should be avoided at all costs.

Members are reminded that due to the open nature of the list, they 
should use discretion in executing any tools or code distributed via
this list.
 

- Posting Guidelines -

The primary language of this list is English. Members are expected to 
maintain a reasonable standard of netiquette when posting to the list. 

Quoting should not exceed that which is necessary to convey context, 
this is especially relevant to members subscribed to the digested 
version of the list.

The use of HTML is discouraged, but not forbidden. Signatures will 
preferably be short and to the point, and those containing 
'disclaimers' should be avoided where possible.

Attachments may be included if relevant or necessary (e.g. PGP or 
S/MIME signatures, proof-of-concept code, etc) but must not be active 
(in the case of a worm, for example) or malicious to the recipient.

Vacation messages should be carefully configured to avoid replying to 
list postings. Offenders will be excluded from the mailing list until 
the problem is corrected.

Members may post to the list by emailing 
full-disclosure@...ts.grok.org.uk. Do not send subscription/
unsubscription mails to this address, use the -request address 
mentioned above.


- Charter Additions/Changes -

The list charter will be published at 
http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html.

In addition, the charter will be posted monthly to the list by the 
management.

Alterations will be made after consultation with list members and a 
concensus has been reached.
