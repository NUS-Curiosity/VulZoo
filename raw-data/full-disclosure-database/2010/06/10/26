ZDI-10-107: Multiple Sourcefire Products Static Web SSL Keys Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-107
June 10, 2010

-- Affected Vendors:
Sourcefire

-- Affected Products:
Sourcefire 3D Sensor 1000
Sourcefire 3D Sensor 2000
Sourcefire 3D Sensor 9900
Sourcefire Defense Center 1000

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to decrypt secure socket
layer (SSL) communications directed to multiple Sourcefire products.

The specific flaw exists within the reuse of private SSL keys for
multiple devices and installations. The keypair is stored in
/etc/ssl/server.crt and /etc/ssl/server.key. Disclosure of the private
key allows an attacker to decrypt and monitor SSL communications with
the target. 

-- Vendor Response:
Sourcefire states:
Mitigation of this problem can be accomplished by replacing the static
keys with custom keys. These instructions can be found in the
installation guide for your product (available on the Sourcefire support
site).
