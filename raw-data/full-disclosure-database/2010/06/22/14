Subject: Re: No anti-virus software? No internet connection

I don't run anti-anything on my systems and haven't in over 7 years..I 
have never gotten anything on my systems.  it's pretty easy to do..it's 
mostly behavior driven to keep yourself form getting malware.  Also I 
can't find it now but there was a research paper that showed the a/v 
software could be used to instlal malware w/o the a/v software's 
knowledge..no thanks.
