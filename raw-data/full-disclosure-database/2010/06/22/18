Subject: Re: No anti-virus software? No internet connection

If the ISP's are being expected to do the policing (which a less than
thorough read of the paper indicates), who's shelling out for all the
NAC kit? The ISP? On top of all the kit required to log all users
Internet activities for an as yet undetermined period of time? On top
of the kit to implement the great firewall of .au?

Welcome to China, we hope you enjoy rice. Although, at least in China
the govt's policy and intention is fairly clear.
