I agree in principal, security does start with the user.

However, computers and connected computing devices with the advent of
locked down systems and cartoon like user interfaces, have become consumer devices.

These devices no longer require any knowledge of how they work nor skill beyond
basic reading and rudimentary hand eye co-ordination to operate. They are being
used by six year olds and grandmothers, IT security guru's and those with learning
difficulties.

This is true of the Internet also, it is a consumer playground.

Hardware, software and system developers have done a great job in making all this power
and connectivity available to those who can't or don't want to think. But a features first,
security second approach seems all too prevalent. It's only the stuff on show that sells!

Should the security of complex consumer devices be the responsibility of a potentially incompetent user,
or the developers of such systems who are fully aware of the failings in their target audience?

regards
