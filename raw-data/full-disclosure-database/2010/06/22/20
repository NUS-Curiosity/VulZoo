I don't have a problem with cutting off connections for infected machines.  In 
fact I think that's an excellent idea.  However, the suggestion to require 
antivirus and firewall software to access the internet is naive and dangerous. 
Neither of those technologies will guarantee you an infection-free system, and 
promoting the idea that they will promotes a false sense of security.

Yes, you should use antivirus software if you're running windows, and yes, it's 
a good idea to use a firewall.  Neither is a panacea, however, and neither will 
keep you from getting a trojan from the latest attack methodologies.
