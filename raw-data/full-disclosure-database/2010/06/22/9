What would you advise a typical home user do to stay virus/trojan/other 
shit free ? Working on the assumption that they can't tell the 
difference (and really, shouldn't have to) between dangerous and safe 
files.
AV software is pretty lacking, and the best advice I can think to give 
users is that "everyone on the Internet is out to get you"
