Subject: Using of the sites for attacks on other sites

Hello participants of Full-Disclosure!

For last two months I didn't post my articles to this list due to some not
serious moaning in April on some of my articles (you always can find my
articles at my site and in WASC Mailing List). But at the end of June I
decided to remind you about my last articles.

Recently I wrote new article Using of the sites for attacks on other sites
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4322/). This is brief English version of it.

Last year in article DoS attacks via Abuse of Functionality vulnerabilities
(it was mentioned at
http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2010/01/top-ten-web-hacking-techniques-of-2009.html)
I told about possibility of conducting of DoS attacks via Abuse of
Functionality vulnerabilities at other sites. Particularly I showed examples
of such vulnerabilities at web sites regex.info and www.slideshare.net.
These attacks can be as unidirectional DoS, as bidirectional DoS, depending
on capacities of both servers.

And now I'll tell you about possibility of conducting of CSRF attacks on
other sites via Abuse of Functionality vulnerabilities. Researching of such
attacks I begun already at 2007 when found such vulnerability at regex.info.

Using of Abuse of Functionality for attacks on other sites.

Sites, which allow to make requests to other web sites (to arbitrary web
pages), have Abuse of Functionality vulnerability and can be used for
conducting of CSRF attacks on other sites. Including DoS attacks via Abuse
of Functionality, as it was mentioned above. CSRF attacks can be made only
to those pages, which don't require authorization.

For these attacks it's possible to use as Abuse of Functionality
vulnerabilities (similar to mentioned in this article), as Remote File
Include vulnerabilities (like in PHP applications) - it's Abuse of
Functionality via RFI.

This attack method can be of use when it's needed to conduct invisible CSRF
attack on other site (to not show yourself), for conducting of DoS and DDoS
attacks and for conducting of other attacks, particularly for making
different actions which need to be made from different IP. For example, at
online voting, for turning of hits of counters and hits of advertising at
the site, and also for turning of clicks (click fraud).

Abuse of Functionality:

Attack is going at request of one site (http://site) to another
(http://another_site) at using of appropriate function of the site
(http://site/script).

http://site/script?url=http://another_site

Advantages of this attack method.

In this part of the article I wrote a list of advantages of this attack
method. And I mentioned another two important paragraphs:

Note, that this DoS attack is possible to use for attacks on redirectors,
which I wrote about in my articles Redirectorâ€™s hell and Hellfire for
redirectors.

Also at conducting of DoS attacks it's possible to use several such servers
at once and so to conduct DDoS attack. In such case these servers will be
appearing as zombie-computers. I.e. botnet will be made from not home
computers, but from web servers (which can have larger capacities and faster
connections). So these vulnerabilities can lead to appearing of new class of
botnets (with zombie-servers).

Examples of vulnerable web sites and web services.

In this part of the article I showed examples of different web sites and web
services which could be used for conducting of attacks on other sites.
Including regex.info, www.slideshare.net, anonymouse.org, www.google.com,
translate.google.com, babelfish.altavista.com, babelfish.yahoo.com,
keepvid.com, web application Firebook, W3C validators and iGoogle.
