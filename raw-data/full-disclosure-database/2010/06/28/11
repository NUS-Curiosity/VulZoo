Actually, I see this as a legitimate gap.  HTTP links don't cache-mix with
HTTPS links, and cookies can have server-side integrity checking to prevent
HTTP pollution (lets not talk about the secure tag for cookies), but if it
is indeed the case that there is no way to have a HTTPS-exclusive
Application Cache, then that is a feature killing bug that's been
legitimately called out.
