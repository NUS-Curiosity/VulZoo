Subject: Chrome and Safari users open to stealth HTML5
	Application Cache attack

Google Chrome and Safari support HTML5 Application Cache.
But unlike Firefox and Opera they do not ask for user permission before
allowing a site to create an Application Cache.

On unsecured networks, attackers could stealthily
create malicious Application Caches in the browser of victims for even HTTPS
sites.
It has always been possible to poison the browser cache and compromise the
victim's account for HTTP based sites.
With HTML5 Application Cache, it is possible to poison the cache of even
HTTPS sites.

I have also released a POC using which both Facebook and Gmail can be
compromised.
