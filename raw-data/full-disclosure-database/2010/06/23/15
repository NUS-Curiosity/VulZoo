Cor ,

Sometimes you need anarchy to spread awareness! Which is primary
priority... Rest are secondary issues.

What next? Government should keep an updated statistic of antivrus
software that can survive the "wild" (well most of the time) and those
softwares that fail to do so at largest occasions. A public, unbiased
statistics should be published about it for the welfare of the
"consumers". Freedom of information act?

The product that fail miserably, throughout the year(s?) should be
declared "unfit for purpose" .......like an expired food which is
harmful for health.

If its a "technological problem" overall, maybe they should move to
application white-listing or something better.......

thanks,
-bipin
