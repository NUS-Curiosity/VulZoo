Nope. For regular users clicking every link and using firefox and office
and nothing else, maybe. But for somewhat experienced people with a
large toolset on the machine: NO! Approximately once a month I had to
persuade the AV vendor that they REALLY need to check if some tool is a
false positive. It always was. The most annoying part was when the MS
malware removal tool had a false-positive and deleted without asking.

It would be interesting to compare the damage actually avoided by virus
scanners to the damages and costs they cause (including false-positives
wiping out system files, the hassle with updates/deployment and the cost
of the products).
