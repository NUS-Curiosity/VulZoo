I programmed such a little toolchain written in KSH already and tested
it. Back then no pdKSH was needed and it worked with almost all generic
shells if I remember correctly.

Shamelessly stolen from my own README:
The toolchain allows you to:
 - choose and set a random MAC
 - choose and set a random MAC of a specific vendor
 - search for a vendor-specific MAC address-space
 - search for a vendor if you do know the MAC
 - using it in other scripts to do automated tasks if needed

Tested on: Darwin/DragonFly/FreeBSD/Linux/OpenBSD
Feedback is welcome because I think work should not get done twice...

Kind regards,
