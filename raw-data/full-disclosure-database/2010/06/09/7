CA20100608-01: Security Notice for CA PSFormX and WebScan ActiveX
Controls

Issued: June 8, 2010

CA Technologies support is alerting users to multiple security risks
with the PSFormX and WebScan ActiveX controls previously available
from the CA Global Security Advisor site. Multiple vulnerabilities
exist that can potentially allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code.  The vulnerabilities, CVE-2010-2193, are due to
insufficient verification of input parameters. CA has issued a
single replacement ActiveX control for both affected controls in
May of 2009. These controls are not included in any CA product.

Risk Rating

High

Platform

Windows

Affected Products

PSFormX ActiveX control with CLSID 
{56393399-041A-4650-94C7-13DFCB1F4665}

WebScan ActiveX control with CLSID 
{7B297BFD-85E4-4092-B2AF-16A91B2EA103}

How to determine if the installation is affected

1. Using a registry editor, check for either of the following keys:

PSFormX ActiveX control
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\
ActiveX Compatibility\{56393399-041A-4650-94C7-13DFCB1F4665}]

WebScan ActiveX control
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\
ActiveX Compatibility\{7B297BFD-85E4-4092-B2AF-16A91B2EA103}]

2. For each key present, determine if the kill bit is set as
described in the solution section. If the kill bit is not set, the
installation may be vulnerable.

Solution

The PSFormX and WebScan ActiveX controls were retired from the CA
Global Security Advisor site in May of 2009.

To disable the PSFormX and WebScan controls from running, set the
kill bit for the controls in the registry. Note: review Microsoft
KB article 240797 prior updating the registry.

PSFormX ActiveX control

Create a DWORD with the name of "Compatibility Flags" containing the
value 0x00000400 in the following registry key. If the key does not
exist, create it under the following location:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\
ActiveX Compatibility\{56393399-041A-4650-94C7-13DFCB1F4665}]

WebScan ActiveX control

Create a DWORD with the name of "Compatibility Flags" containing the
value 0x00000400 in the following registry key. If the key does not
exist, create it under the following location:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\
ActiveX Compatibility\{7B297BFD-85E4-4092-B2AF-16A91B2EA103}]
