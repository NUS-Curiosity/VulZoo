So, I think this is a dumb idea... :)

You might think your crypto is secure right now, but in 5 years there 
might be a big hole in it.  If copies of your passport are floating 
about on the net, you can't even delete them, and certainly cannot 
prevent anyone using the new crack against your old crypto.

If, of course you think I'm speaking tripe, go ahead and post it...

Now, take back what you said about my mother.... ;)
