Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in UnrealIRCd might allow remote attackers to
compromise the "unrealircd" account, or cause a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

UnrealIRCd is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) daemon.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-irc/unrealircd     < 3.2.8.1-r1                 >= 3.2.8.1-r1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in UnrealIRCd:

* The vendor reported a buffer overflow in the user authorization
  code.

* The vendor reported that the distributed source code of UnrealIRCd
  was compromised and altered to include a system() call that could be
  called with arbitrary user input.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause the
execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running
UnrealIRCd, or a Denial of Service condition. NOTE: By default
UnrealIRCd on Gentoo is run with the privileges of the "unrealircd"
user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All UnrealIRCd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/unrealircd-3.2.8.1-r1"
