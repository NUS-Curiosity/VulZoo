Subject: Re: Introducing TGP...

Why send it to a public form/blog/email list, etc. When you could email it
to yourself, mitigating some of Stu's concerns, yet still making it
available to yourself...

Additionally, you're adding less traffic (a tiny bit less, true, but
less...)

Send it to multiple email accounts if you're worried about an outage....
(gmail. yahoo. hushmail. etc)

Why replicate it in all these different archives.  It's an interesting idea,
but I'm not convinced it's the ideal implementation.
