The USG put a lot more into DES, but that didn't save it.

As the data is archived, an attacker can come back anytime, once they 
have finished with the interesting stuff... ;)

It doesn't differ from SSL, which also could be captured and 
eventually cracked.

I'm saying security is an onion, and by posting your ciphertext you 
are irreversibly removing several layers of it.  Surely it's better 
to keep the ciphertext inaccessible, this way an attacker has to get 
access to it, in addition to cracking it.
