Yep.  I'm fine with that.  One can always zip the data.

Of course - all that goes without saying (well, I guess not ;)  - I was just using that as an example.  Mailing list, facebook, blog, whatever.  Of course there will be some places where that won't be appropriate, but that much should be obvious.  We could use Google cache for that matter...  The point was the portability options one has in a public environment; let's not get bogged down into things like "spam" - that takes the focus off the real point.

Well, that's the whole point.  In TGP, I use AES256 bit encryption based on what should be a strong passphrase in combination with a salt to protect the private key.  To crack that private key, you would have to brute force the entire keyspace, which is currently not technically feasible, or have a custom-made rainbow table with also is not technically feasible for my 20 character passphrase and salt.   If you are going to "trust" encryption, then the key's integrity should be acceptable.  But, if you don't want to publish it, then don't.  Problem solved.  Please don't misunderstand my statements - I'm not saying one has to do that.  I'm saying that one *could* do that if you wanted to.  I could post 20 different private keys around the world in different places if I wanted to, but only use the one *I* know is used.  There are a million ways of doing it.  However, I think you are missing the logic that if your private key could really be cracked, and thus I could get the key 
 required to asymmetrically decrypt the key used to symmetrically decrypt the CryptoBlob, then I would not bother with the key at all and just crack the crypto blob.   Further, if one could just "crack" the key, then one would just "crack" the VPN encryption or SSL encryption and get your private key that you had controlled access to.  If I have to pick a locked cased to get to a key that opens another case, I'd just pick the lock on the other case.  Why looking at encrypted data as something that has to be further protected -- just make sure the encryption is sound in the first place.

I wouldn't say "most likely" but that's a great point.  However, it doesn't matter if the machine is owned - I'm just copying the data off of it. Hell, I could print out my key if I wanted to and type it back into my own system.  Even better, if I'm using other people's public keys to encrypt data, it won't matter if the machine has a key logger.  I don't type passwords for people's public keys.   But like I already said - if you don't want to post it, don't.   Easy.  I actually speak to that in the part of my post direct below that you quoted...

Thanks for the comments!
