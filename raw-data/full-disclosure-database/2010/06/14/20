DES is the first example I can think of.  Folks did believe in that. 
Pity it's crackable.  Pity even more those who believed in it, then 
posted their passport encrypted with it, to a security list...

So you mean that some of them aren't going strong, then?  Did they 
get cracked, by any chance?  Did I mention DES yet?

Good people will find flaws.  However they cannot stop brute-forcing, 
which is viable in some circumstances, and as time passes this 
viability increases.  This increase is not the same as Moore's Law, 
if you have a parallel platform you are not limited by linear growth 
in CPU power, you just add more CPUs.  As it happens parallel 
platforms are great for brute-forcing, did I mention DES, which was 
cracked by a machine with 1856 processors?

I was joking (but only half-joking).

I'm not saying that, I'm saying that in 5 years, the currently 
infeasible will be feasible.  No, I don't think that's a surprise 
either, but I don't think Tim has considered it.
