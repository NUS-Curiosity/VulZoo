You don't think I considered it?  Really?  You think that I would go  
through the trouble of designing and implenting a standards based  
encrytion application without considering that it could be cracked?

You are incorrect. I certainly considered it. I just know that when  
brute forcing AES256 becomes feasible, a scan of mynpssport will be  
the last thing on anyone mind.

How does this differ from SSL, and why do you think I would have to be  
"live on the wire" to crack it?

If your entire argument is "it can be cracked at some point" then you  
argue against *any* type of encrytion.

Postulative statements in the obvious are a waste of people's time.
