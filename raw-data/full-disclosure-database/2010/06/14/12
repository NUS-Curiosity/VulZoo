The basic flaw, to me, seems to be your erroneous assumption that the 
enemy has symmetric compute capability to yourself.  Once you give 
the enemy a copy of your data, even if it is encrypted, you are 
opening the door to them using some hyper-core, quantum-cooled super-
fandango against your crypto, and you give them all the time in the 
world to do it.

Also, you will only have available, in the cloud-solution you offer, 
archival copies of the data.  The latest versions will only be on 
your machine.

While SSH datastreams might be captured and eventually decrypted, the 
attacker must have access to your wire.  If you post your datastream 
all over the net, they don't need that.  SSH also provides access to 
live data and is already available on many platforms....
