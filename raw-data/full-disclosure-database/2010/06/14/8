 3.2.8.1	backdoored on official ftp and site


It seems as if our backdoor was found so we figured we cant sell this in the ac1db1tch3z 
CANVAS pack (PhosphoricAc1d Exploit pack).

P.S. Since it took months and months for the community to find the system() exploit,
we still have a more complicated zerday unrealircd hack module. Please inquire
when our website is finished.

Brought to you by Ac1dB1tch3z: still using system() like it was 1992AD, 
and still owning everyone with it. Thanks.
