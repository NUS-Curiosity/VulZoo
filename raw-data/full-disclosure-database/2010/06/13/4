Indian Hacker

Service: Webmail

Vendor: Yahoo mail, and possibly others

Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting / Cookie-Theft / Relogin attacks

Yahoo mail filter fails to detect script attributes in combination with
the style attribute as a tag, leaving everyone using yahoo mail service
with MSIE vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting including Cookie Theft and

attacker wont have to make the victim click on any link, all he/she has
to do is to send the javascript code as an html email to the target and
once the victim open the email the malicious code will be executed in
his/her browser.

Steps of Exploit code:

1. Login the yahoomail with valid credentials.
 
2. Click on inbox.
 
3. Now click on Move to < create New Folder.
