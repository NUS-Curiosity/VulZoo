Since I saw you mentioned
http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2010/mfsa2010-23.html I think
it would be important for you to know the difference between that
vulnerability and yours.

The reason that was fixed, was because it's generally considered safe
to embed images pointing off site, and is acceptable to consider it's
generally safe (with a few exceptions like referrer leaking, and basic
auth prompts), and a lot of websites, and online applications, like
gmail, or facebook to mention a few do it. So that attack could allow
an attacker to annoy millions of people with iframes when they receive
an email/visit facebook.

That was considered risky enough to make a fix, but still was
considered low risk.

All of your attacks with URI schemes are not exploitable this way, and
are completely useless for that matter, I would recommend you to think
"could this attack be exploited in mass? would it make people loss
money/time?" before making more of those advisories.

Greetings
