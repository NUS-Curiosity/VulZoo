Subject: New ISA Sets Available

Greetings list:

Well, it's that time of the month.  Well, not THAT time, but the time where I've posted fully updated country-by-country XML lists for the planet.  This update also includes a small /30 address set used by the space ship hiding behind Hale Bopp before all those people killed themselves after reading a paper on predicting hacks with an Australian sundial.  Apparently SANS was not involved.

These sets are available on the standard www.hammerofgod.com<http://www.hammerofgod.com> site, as well on my new test pilot site at http://www.owa.hammerofgod.com .  I was going to post other stuff to the main HoG site, except our Bermuda operations man Steve "Raging Haggis" Moffat took off for the weekend and is holed up in a Canadian motel with a couple of Ottawa hookers and 16 year old scotch.  Maybe it was rum and 16 year old hookers.  I can't remember.

Anyway, feel free to grab them for your ISA deployments so you can continue to block all those evil people from places you don't want hacking your stuffies.
