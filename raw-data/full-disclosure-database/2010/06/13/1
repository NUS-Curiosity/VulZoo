Subject: Reg: Gmail Account Deleted

Hi,

     My friends Gmail got deleted very recently; I dono if there is some
problem with Google or any other vulnerabilities in it which got exploited?

Let me know if there is an solution for it to recover all the data.Please
this seems to be serious one.

I tried to reset the password, as it was not logging into the account. But
then it said there is no account existing. Also ORKUT, etc... are not there.

Also, would like to know the Reason for it.

Regards,
Srinivas Naik
