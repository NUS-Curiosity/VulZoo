http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenere_cipher

"This cipher is well known because while it is easy to understand and 
implement, it often appears to beginners to be unbreakable; this 
earned it the description le chiffre indéchiffrable (French for 'the 
unbreakable cipher'). Consequently, many people have tried to 
implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers, 
only to have them broken[1]."
