Well, I usually avoid the term "more secure" since it really depends
on the real usage and scenario.

The benefits of using public key authentication are:
 - A typical 2048 bit key pair offered much more entropy than password
average people can comfortably remember, making it practically
impossible to brute force crack.
 - It does not transfer any credential information that can be used if
being cracked.  i.e. the authentication process is some kind of
zero-knowledge proof, say, "I have the key but you won't see it"
rather than "I have the password and here it is" (*).  Password
authentications are usually just plain text over an encrypted channel.

Downsides are mostly at the human side, e.g.:
 - Survey says that many people won't encrypt their private key and
protect it properly, nor treat forward agents in a secure manner;
 - It's not quite convenient if one don't have immediate access to
their private key, i.e. a system administrator traveling without his
laptop but arguably, this case should never happen since using
passwords on untrusted system is much more dangerous.


(*) This can of course be improved, though but I am not aware of any
alternative that does not impose more restrictions.
