Do you say distributed? We are experiencing a distributed attack right
now. An IP connects to a certain fixed set of SSH servers in our network,
makes a handful of login attempts against every indivial server, and
disconnects to never be seen again. The whole scenario repeats with a new
IP every minute or so. The set of servers is quite small, only cca 15 out 
of many tens available in our whole network.
