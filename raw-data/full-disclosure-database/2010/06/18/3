Working for whoever pays most makes us gay?

I'll take gay and rich over poor and stupid any day.   And by the way, just so that you know, there are well established psychological profiles outlining a man's propensity to go out of his way to challenge other men as being "gay."  I'm just sayin'.

P.S.  FX is a great guy.   You are of course welcome to your opinion, but actually posting like you did is seriously immature.
