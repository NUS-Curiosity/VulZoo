You've got to be fucking kidding me....

You spam reddit with your retarded, provoking OMFG THE INTERNET IS
GOING TO IMPLODE posts, and now full disclosure?

You've deleted my comments off of your blog posts before, and you
seriously need to stop posting about the same crap over and over
again...

If anyone's a perfect example of scaring people into buying a security
product/consultation, it's you and your posts.

http://blog.sucuri.net/2010/04/hostek-is-putting-their-customers-at-risk.html
for example, talk about stating the obvious.

Seriously, fuck off, it's incredibly boring now.
