That's so 1990! NIPS and/or Firewall just protect you if you're inside  
the "borders"... But, come on. Who doesn't have a laptop nowadays? So,  
multiple protection layers is better than none, anyways.

You have choices when adopting a security posture or, if you prefer,  
risk posture. I believe that it's quite difficult and almost  
impossible you stay updated with all the threads, due to exponential  
growth of them.

Woowoo.. I cannot agree with you, because AV has nothing to do  
protecting end-point against network attacks. AV will alert and  
protect only when the thread already reached your end-point. Besides,  
there are other layers, such as: buffer overflow protection inside  
HIPS. Look that I am not talking abous IDS. 8)

It always is a risk decision, and I not basing MHO on any "standard",  
that's based on my background... And, AFAIK, nodoby can expect that  
users and/or server systems will be able to apply all or any update in  
a huge environment.
