Subject: What are the basic vulnerabilities of a software?

Hi List,

For Top 25 Software Vulnerabilities, please have a look at
http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2010/2010_cwe_sans_top25.pdf. I feel this
categorization will help professionals as a check list for finding the
vulnerabilities of a software.


Thanks
Rajendra
