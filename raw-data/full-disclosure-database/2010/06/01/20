All of that is total wanking.  The *real* reason why IPS product designers
concentrate on servers is because hopefully the server end is run by some
experienced people with a clue, and maybe even hardened to last more than
35 seconds when a hacker attacks.  Meanwhile, if anybody designed an IPS for
the client end, it would just get installed on an end-user PC running Windows,
where it will have all the issues and work just as well as any other
anti-malware software on an end-user PC.

Oh - and there's also the little detail that a site is more likely to buy
*one* software license to run on their web server (or whatever), rather than
the hassle of buying and administering 10,000 end-user licenses.  Especially
when an IPS on the client end doesn't actually tell you much about attacks
against the valuable target (the server) from machines you haven't installed
the end-user IPS on (like the entire rest of the Internet).
