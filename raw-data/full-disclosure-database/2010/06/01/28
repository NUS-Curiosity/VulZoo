Nelson,

I put my comments inline as well

Even one layer is better than none :-). Multiple layers are even better, especially when they are different types of protection. But applying security without thinking is bad. Even if you have enough money and hardware to spent, you should at least think about the balance between the amount security you get and the amount of risk you run when installing another piece of software. Then you can decide if it is worth the money or hardware you need to spend.

You have a point here. That's why it is better not to base security on defenses to known and existing threats alone, but use defense mechanisms that protect you both against known and existing threats and against unknown and future threats as well. I can't help to mention the OSSTMM again, because this is pretty much what it is about.

Sure you're right about that. There is a lot of other threats AV doesn't protect you to. Just like an IPS doesn't protect you against all threats. But that doesn't mean it is a wise decision to install each and every part of security software you can get, because software comes with costs and risks too. This is true for IPS's too.

Of course you don't have to agree, but I think it is better to be critical about the software you install. And if you don't agree and rather spend your money on things that were useful for someone else at another time and under different circumstances, then just do that. But I wish you wouldn't write that others must (you wrote it even in capitals) deploy an IPS.

Cor
