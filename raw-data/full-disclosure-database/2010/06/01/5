D'oh! This Must*Die* thing really messed you up ;)

I thought the irony was obvious enough in my answer to the OP - seems like I was wrong !
Yet I think you're right Jan, fork bombs might be an interesting field.
Maybe my favourite sec expert could look further into it and share some even more interesting discovers, letting XSS and CSRF apart for some time.
My dear MustLive, let's start with an exercise, pretending your brain is a Turing machine, have it running :
---
i = 0;
while (true) {
	i++;
}
---

Should keep him busy for some time. Plus we might be witnesses of the first human brain overflow in history of Mankind - how _cool_ is that ?
