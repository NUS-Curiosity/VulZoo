Why yes, I do...

Cheating on a homework assignment?

Arguably only one of the above is a basic vulnerability (and even that 
is probably debatable) -- the other three are just examples of one or 
other basic types (and two of them are probably examples of the same 
basic type).  Try to get hold of the RISOS Project report(s) or sources 
that summarize that work.  Any good, basic CompSec textbook should 
cover this stuff, BUT there is more than one widely referenced 
comprehensive categorization of basic security errors, so you should 
probably check around a bit...
