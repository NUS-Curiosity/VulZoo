Subject: Re: Why the IPS product designers concentrate on
	server side protection? why they are missing client protection

You're missing one point: Host IPS MUST be deployed with any Network  
Security (Firewalls os NIPSs).

No security solution/technology is the miracle protection alone, so  
that's the reason everybody is talking about defense in depth.

Cheers.
