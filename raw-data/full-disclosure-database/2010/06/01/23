Nelson,

Please be aware this is a risk decision and not a fact. I don't use an host IPS and no anti Virus either. Still I'm sure my laptop is perfectly safe. This is because I do critical thinking about security measures and don't copy behavior of others (who often don't think for themselves and just copies other peoples behavior). Please note I'm not saying you're not thinking. If you did some critical thinking and an host IPS is a good solution for you, then that's OK> It just doesn't mean it is a good solution for everybody else and everybody MUST deploy an host IPS.

> No security solution/technology is the miracle protection alone, 
That's true.

> so that's the reason everybody is talking about defense in depth.
Defense in depth is often used for another line of a similar defense mechanism as the previous already was. Different layers of defense works best if the defense mechanism differ. So if you're using anti virus software (which gives you an authentication control and an alarm control according to the OSSTMM), then an host IDS is not the best additional security measure (because this also gives you an authentication and an alarm control).
This would also be a risk decision, but based on facts and the rules defined in the OSSTMM and not based on some marketing material. You should give it a try.
