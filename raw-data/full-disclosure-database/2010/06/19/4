Momma needs a new crackpipe and some drugs, the feds took them all :-(

Police reportedly seized less than half a gram of cocaine, one suspected 
Ecstasy pill, one oxycodone pill and 19 tabs of
suspected LSD from Auernheimerâ€™s upstairs bedroom. Auernheimer admitted 
to possessing the drugs and helped police identify them.

"There are references to his lavish lifestyle on this thread but the sad 
truth is he is paranoid schizophrenic and has been homeless a number of 
times." -Mrs. Auernheimer
