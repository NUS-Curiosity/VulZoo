  Hello Full Disclosure for I like to warn you about assumption: In
logic, an assumption is a proposition that may be used to prove
further propositions, in the expectation that the assumption will be
discharged in due course by proving it via a separate argument. In
Benny Hill once ago upon a time, Benny performed clarity for those who
assume: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hrLj8QEAgI

  MusntLive is not associated with n3td3v, the British (even though I
guardedly under caution refer to Benny Hill cautiously), British
Petroleum or the Sex Pistols. MusntLive IS associated with releasing
disclosure in the future and English garammatical works of genius arts
of work.
