Subject: Re: New Source Code Vulnerability Scanner (Free
 30 Day Trial)

Dropping a 0day for y'all.

So I found a vulnerability in the license management code in this
software. It's off the top of my head, and is presented in an untested
state. It seems, however, that if you continue using the software
*after* the free 30-day trial it will actually continue working! This
is due to a very week license management implementation, relying on
the user agreeing to remove the software after having used it for a
total of thirty days.

This flaw affects all known builds of the source code posted, and
stands currently with no workaround or hotfix. The vendor has yet to
be contacted, but is expected to push a patch for this vuln any day
now.
