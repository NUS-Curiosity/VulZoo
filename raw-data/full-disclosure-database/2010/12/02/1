Esteemed members of the Full Disclosure mailing list,

In the wake of the recent compromise of the ProFTPd distribution
server and the subsequent root-level backdoor that was placed into
the source[0], we are proud to announce a cutting edge source code
scanner that will help you detect backdoors in your code. This code
is free to use for 30 days, after which time you must pay for it.
