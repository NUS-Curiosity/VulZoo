Summary
=======

A "binary planting" [1] vulnerability in Windows Address Book and Windows 
Contacts allows local or remote (even Internet-based) attackers to deploy 
and execute malicious code on Windows machines in the context of logged-on 
users.


Product Coverage
================

- Windows Server 2003
- Windows XP
- Windows Vista
- Windows 7
- Windows Server 2008
- Windows Server 2008 R2


Analysis 
========

As a result of an incorrect dynamic link library loading in Windows 
Address Book and Windows Contacts (wab.exe), an attacker can cause her 
malicious DLL to be loaded and executed from local drives, remote Windows 
shares, and even shares located on Internet. 

All a remote attacker has to do is plant a malicious DLL with a specific 
name (wab32res.dll) on a network share and get the user to open any .WAB, 
.VCF or .CONTACT file from this network location - which should require 
minimal social engineering. Once the user opens the file, wab.exe makes an 
unsafe call to LoadLibrary("wab32res.dll"). As this DLL is not present on 
the system, its malicious version gets loaded from the current working 
directory.

Windows systems by default have the Web Client service running - which 
makes remote network shares accessible via WebDAV -, thus the malicious 
DLL can also be deployed from an Internet-based network share as long as 
the intermediate firewalls allow outbound HTTP traffic to the Internet. 

A systematic attack could deploy malicious code to a large number of 
Windows workstations in a short period of time, possibly as an Internet 
worm.

planting vulnerabilities and attacks.


Mitigating Factors 
==================

- A firewall blocking outbound WebDAV traffic (in addition to blocking all 
  Windows Networking protocols) could stop an Internet-based attack.

- Microsoft's CWDIllegalInDllSearch hotfix [2] can stop a network-based 
  exploitation of this vulnerability.


Solution 
========

Microsoft has issued a security bulletin [3] and published an update for
Windows Address Book and Windows Contacts that fixes this issue.


Workaround 
==========

- Stopping the Web Client service could stop Internet-based attacks as 
  long as the network firewall stops outbound Microsoft Networking 
  protocols. This would not, however, stop remote LAN-based attacks where 
  the attacker is able to place a malicious DLL on a network share inside 
  the target (e.g., corporate) network.

Background
==========

ACROS Security has performed an extensive Binary Planting research 
project, focused on various types of vulnerabilities where an attacker 
with low privileges can place (i.e., "plant") a malicious executable file 
(i.e., "binary") to some possibly remote location and get it launched by 
some vulnerable application running on user's computer. 

The research found that binary planting vulnerabilities are affecting a 
large percentage of Windows applications and often allowing for trivial 
exploitation: it identified ~520 remotely exploitable bugs in ~200 widely-
used Windows applications. A large majority of these vulnerabilties 
remain unfixed and publicly unknown at the time of this writing.
