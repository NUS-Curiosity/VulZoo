NIST chooses algorithms which are not patented or if patented,
publicly available and royalty free. So the algorithm might not be the
best per se - but a selection will not [usually] be encumbered.

An example of "patented, but publicly available" is the Digital
Signature Algorithm (DSA) which is one of three algorithms specified
in the Digital Signature Standard. Kravitz holds a patent on DSA, but
Schnorr claims he holds an earlier patent and Kravitz's patent is
invalid.

As an example of "side stepping a patent", NIST approved two
authenticated encryption modes: CCM and GCM. The modes are two pass,
meaning one pass for the encryption, and one pass for the
authentication. Single pass algorithms are available, but they are
patented. So NIST choose two pass algorithms.
