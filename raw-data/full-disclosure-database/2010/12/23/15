I am also aware that processors can have hidden "features" that make them
execute a sightly different program that the one you expect to be executed.
So, can we trust processors unless you make your own processor?

For example think about the new Intel processors that are shipped with the
AES-NI [1] instruction set. How difficult would be to governments and
powerful people/companies to hide a trojan horse in this processors? And
would you ever notice the existence of this hidden "feature"?
