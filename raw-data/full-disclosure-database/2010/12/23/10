Hello Full Disclosure!!!

Musntlive has warned you all about
OpenB(ackdoored)S(oftwared)D(istrobution) for is some time and is all
say musntlive is crazy. However is now when Theo discloses bug, is
people like Paul "I is like to smell scrotum" Schmehl in silence. In
"trusting trust" you is now see how OpenBSD via two developers allows
for backdoor in IPSEC since is Theo and no one else audit those two
clownskis.

We now is have proof

1) OpenBSD is not as audited as they say
2) Is Fox Mulder say "Is Trust No One"
3) Paul Schmehl is not longer jumping on Theo scrotum bandwagon
4) Is now OpenBSD need new slogan: `No remote exploits in years - only
backdoors`
