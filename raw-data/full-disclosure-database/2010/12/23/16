Subject: Re: Making Security Suck Less

So the world needs more people to just accept the problems? I 
disagree. We're trying to fix a broken model by presenting new steps, 
new methods, and new directions. By helping seek improvements is I 
sleep soundly at night. To each his own, I suppose.

Your doubts are welcomed. Please submit your corrections and ideas for 
improvement.

Sincerely,
-pete.
