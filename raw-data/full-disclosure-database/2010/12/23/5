        Microsoft WMITOOLS remote code execution vulnerability, if not installed by default, so not very serious. is something older, estimates that Microsoft have dropped these things. do not know when we see there are not immediately think of a more serious similar Vulnerability? wins a hole. Comparison of low-level programming flaw, remote direct transfer pointer.

        Vulnerability see: http://www.wooyun.org/bug.php?action=view&id=1006

 

        Technical challenges:

        Can write the true use of common procedures, common variety of the various versions of windows, etc. ie, a word common, not this version of that version of the argument. Do not waste any injection technique, you will tell others to attack .
