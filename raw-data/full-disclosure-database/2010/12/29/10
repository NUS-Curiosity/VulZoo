Subject: Re: some considerations on Ettercap code
	repository breach

Hi,

One of the claims made in the zine was that they compromised the
popular ARP-Spoofing toolkit â€“ Ettercap, and implied that the code had
been altered several years ago. The implication was that a backdoor
was placed in the code. However, there is no evidence...

We wrote a post about that @ SpiderLabs blog.

Best regards
