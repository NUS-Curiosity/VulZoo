Subject: Re: some considerations on Ettercap code
	repository breach

Hi Wendel,

My post is not about the possibility that the Ettercap code was been
backdoored or not. I have only try to explain (with very few details) how is
possible find breaches in well known web sites (like sourceforge) starting
from the analaysis of source ode of a p(php/perl/python)bot.
Nothing else. If I have more time to spent for this, I will post an
explanation of my "mind map" that I used months ago for start to study this
kind of bot.

Regards.
