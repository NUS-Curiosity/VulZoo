Rofl!!! Do you seriously think that something that cool would be so crappy? Ive 
heard of several attack vectors against windows 7 and vista, they are just 'new' 
and the whitehat scene hasn't caught up quite yet. As for the inconsistent 
storage size with installation, there is this nifty little thing called 
compression, and most operating systems I know of have to dynamically create 
certain files needed for post-installation, but that doesn't mean that it's 100% 
dynamic code. Just some of it is necessary dynamic data. Afterall any c program 
can get 'fat' during runtime by calling malloc one too many times :P Not to 
mention the documentation on PE would totally screw with the whole constant 
self-modification, you risk the chance of fucking with the binary portability 
windows loves to bed with so much. And it has to be updated so often cause of 
two reason 1.) It sucks and needs fixin or 2.) Operating systems simply go 
through lots of change. Didn't linux used to be called the 'kernel-of-the-month 
operating system'?

End point: you fail, commit seppuku.

Sincerely,
Some Kid....
