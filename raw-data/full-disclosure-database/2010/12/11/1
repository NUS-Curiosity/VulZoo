Subject: Re: Flaw in Microsoft Domain Account Caching
 Allows Local Workstation Admins to Temporarily Escalate Privileges and
 Login as Cached Domain Admin Accounts (2010-M$-002)

In whose universe?   Did you even read the post?  Local admins become LOCAL ADMINS by using a cached domain account who is a LOCAL ADMIN. You have to do it with the network cable unplugged.   There is no privilege escalation here. 

StenoPlasma's intent was to educate people on how things worked, and while there isn't a security issue here, he was completely correct in that you guys really need to learn what you are talking about.
