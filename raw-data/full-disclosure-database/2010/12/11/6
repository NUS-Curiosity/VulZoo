Subject: iis4\iis5 cgi bug and WEB Service CGI Interface
 Vulnerability Analysis (continued)


Too many bad things in the belly of the fast. 2000 of iis, unicode \ decode \ cgi \ webdav \ etc vulnerability, reaching a peak, and later transferred to rpc study. Now there is a 01 or so found a serious flaw, iis4, 5 set error loading cgi vulnerability, execute arbitrary commands or view arbitrary files. Spent nearly a decade, this vulnerability have been quickly eaten away. Because iis5.1 core code into the kernel start iis, this exploit code has been dropped, so will not need a later version.
   There are loopholes in some time ago to write an article. Did not intend to put out, and feel that soon decayed, it released together.
