My understanding is that after the target user has logged off, the 
hashes which remain are only sufficient to validate a correct password. 
I.e., they're like the classic /etc/passwd hashes but with decent salts. 
They could be used for dictionary attacks, but not with precomputed 
rainbow tables.

My understanding is that PTH is a technique allowing you to easily use a 
different kind of hash. The password-equivalent kind that would be 
copied from the credentials of a live logged-in session. In that sense, 
PTH on its own may not meet the formal definition of an 'attack', since 
you still need a way to capture the password-equivalent.

If you're a local admin, you can replace explorer.exe and access 
resources with the credentials of the logged-in user.

If you're a local admin, you can install a keylogger and trivially 
capture anyone's freaking plaintext password (local console or RDP 
sessions).

So don't type your Domain Admin password into an untrusted system. Duh!

Note that any system to which an untrusted party has unsupervised 
physical access is untrusted.
