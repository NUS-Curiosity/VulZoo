Subject: Re: Windows is 100%
	self-modifying	assemblycode?(Interesting security theory)

Yeah, must have been tongue in cheek, can't imagine anyone able to understand what this list is about making such a Rube Goldberg claim as stuff like a Windows self assembling kernel and libraries etc....  Window is compiled, like practically every other desktop OS. Last assembled OS I saw the source code to multi-tasked running self service gasoline pumps at self serve gas stations. It was a token passing OS I think. LOL! Self assembling kernel! Imagine writing the macros for that puppy...

>>From Andrew Auernheimer's Diary / irc memories:

Windows is written in pure, self-modifying assembly code. Notice how you can install 15 gigs of data from a single Windows install DVD, which can only hold 5 gigs? This is because the code is dynamically generated to minimize attack vectors. Any attempt to observe the static files on the disk will change how it looks in runtime. This is also why Windows needs to be updated so often, so the running code never looks like it did before.

Does this sound true to you guys? Windows does seem to have updates that take forever and speed wise it always felt there was something going on. Whenever I leave my laptop alone, even when it's offline, indexing off, the computer is always working on stuff and you new know what it is.

Maybe all applications with Windows compile on runtime for dynamic binaries, yet through .net's open, user-friendly API are still compatible?

Balmer said he wanted to make Vista and 7 an OS that would not slow down after usage, but instead speed up. Windows is constantly reprogramming itself to suit the behavior of it's users and performing security and performance auditing.

This is likely true - Think about it:

All viruses are just malicious scripts. It's like saying *nix is insecure because script kiddies compile binaries and bash scripts that rm /.

No one ever has ever had an attack vector against Windows 7 or Vista. Please confirm.
