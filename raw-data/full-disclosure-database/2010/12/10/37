-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the application's implementation of the
Advanced Audio Coding compression format. When decoding a conditional
component of a data block within an AAC frame the application will
decompress lossy audio sample data outside the bounds of a buffer. This
memory corruption can lead to code execution under the context of the
application.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
