-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application decodes data for a
particular mime type within a RealMedia file. When decoding the data
used for rendering, the application will use the length of a string in
an addition used to calculate the size of a buffer. The application will
zero-extend it and then allocate. Due to the addition, the result of the
calculation can be greater than 16-bits, and when the typecast occurs
the result will be smaller than expected. When initializing this buffer,
a buffer overflow will occur which can allow for code execution under
the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
