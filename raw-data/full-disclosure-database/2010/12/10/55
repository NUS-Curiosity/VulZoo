TPTI-10-18: RealNetworks RealPlayer MDPR Chunk Size Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-10-18

December 10, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-4390

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
RealNetworks

-- Affected Products:
RealNetworks RealPlayer

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within RealPlayer's handling of Internet Video
Recording (.ivr) files. While parsing the MLTI chunk the process trusts
the field responsible for denoting the size of an embedded MDPR chunk.
By modifying this value in an IVR file an attacker can force a
misallocation on the heap. The process can then be made to write past
the bounds of the buffer, corrupting memory. This can be leveraged to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the user invoking
RealPlayer.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
