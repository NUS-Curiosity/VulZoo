So you are saying that the use can perform action on the domain?
Things like create/delete user accounts. Your initial statement does
not say anything about taking action on any network resources. I find
it hard to believe that would be the case because user would not have
a valid kerberos ticket because they did not log into the domain.

You are completely missing the point..
Local admins become Domain Admins.
