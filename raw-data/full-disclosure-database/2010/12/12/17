Subject: Re: Security Incident Response Testing To Meet
	Audit

Just to satisfy my curiosity, but, when was the last AV update performed?
One could assume some anti-virus would be up-to-date even if the last update
was performed a month or so ago.
On the other hand, an anti-virus update usually is done sometimes even
several times er day (well, mine does).

Have you tried the binaries virustotal.com (or equivalent)?

Cheers,
Chris.
