If you are using a PBE (password based encryption), its no stronger
than the password. Though stated regarding Microsoft's BitLocker, the
same applies to all PBE systems: "BitLocker, at its core, is a
password technology, we simply have to get the password...",
Exploration of Windows 7, Advanced Forensics Topic (page 70).

If your file system key is on a USB thumb drive, the security is
probably only as strong as the physical security on the thumb drive.
