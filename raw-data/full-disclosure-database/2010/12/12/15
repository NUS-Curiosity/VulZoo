And in abnormal sense?

Group Policies need an AD. Cached credentials are only used locally,
for domain accounts, when the computer can't connect to the AD.

Local administrators don't authenticate against an AD, they authenticate
against the local SAM. No GPOs there!
And: a local administrator can override ANY policy, even exempt the
computer completely from processing Group Policies.

Again: this is NO VULNERABILITY.
An administrator is an administrator is an administrator.
