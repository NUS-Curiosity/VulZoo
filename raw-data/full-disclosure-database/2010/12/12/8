 really	are?

stormrider, Jeffrey, Thor... and all others,

You gave me quite a bit of thinking, reading and reconsidering to do. 
I'm going to have to redesign the whole issue from scratch - not that 
it's a bad thing. Better investing some more time and effort now, than 
sweat maybe later. Thank you so much for taking the time to answer me.
