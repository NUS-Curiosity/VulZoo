That is incorrect. Alephone started bugtraq independently. He then was
"acquired" (for lack of a better term, he wasn't a business) by
securityocus.com, of which Alfred Huger was a founder. I remember this
well because at the time we (securityportal.com) were also making
nosies about acquiring bugtraq (which at the time was the hot sh*t in
security lists).
