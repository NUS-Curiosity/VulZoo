Subject: Re: Just how secure encrypted linux partitions
 really are?

Another thing : you have to make sure the swap is encrypted or there
will be chances that the passphrase is just sitting there in clear...

> > Hey Jeff - not sure if you read the LE deck or just referenced Wikipedia, but regarding Bitlocker, there is a good bit more to it.  Saying to "simply" get the password (not sure who would have written that) isn't "simple."  It's not like the password (passphrase) is stored anywhere...  And yes, there should be some physical security around the USB key, where the actual KEY is, but with Bitlocker anyway, you can leverage TPM, etc to make things far more difficult.

That's one of the benefits of Bitlocker - even if you have the PIN, you can't mount the drive in another machine.   If CentOS acts in a similar manner, then just getting the password won't help.

TPM-based encryption is pretty easy, so if CentOS supports that, it very well be far more difficult (or statistically impossible) to decrypt.    In Bitlocker's case, if a recovery key infrastructure is in place, then those could be leveraged as well.
