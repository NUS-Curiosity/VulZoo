Immunet (http://www.immunet.com/) would probably very useful in this
situation. Think of it a 'distributed antivirus definitions'. If one
$VENDOR catches it, your machine will most likely catch it since its
part of the cloud (forgive the cliché).

The company was started by a fellow named Al Huger. I believe he also
started Bugtraq. When Bugtraq was commercialized by Symantec, Huger
moved on to Immunet.
