> Hey Jeff - not sure if you read the LE deck or just referenced Wikipedia, but regarding Bitlocker, there is a good bit more to it.  Saying to "simply" get the password (not sure who would have written that) isn't "simple."  It's not like the password (passphrase) is stored anywhere...  And yes, there should be some physical security around the USB key, where the actual KEY is, but with Bitlocker anyway, you can leverage TPM, etc to make things far more difficult.

Agreed if the TPM is present.
