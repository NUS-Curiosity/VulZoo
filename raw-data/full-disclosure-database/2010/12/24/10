Note that much of that is backed up by CVS history. I'd seen some of 
those strange loops and bulk reformatting while reviewing the code 
commits last week.

For example, as he mentions in P2 the entropy pool extraction functions 
are implemented in such a way as to require 156 times more invocations 
of the MD5 block compression function than are necessary. This remains 
in the code today.

I even pointed some of this out the other day on this thread:

Perhaps the reaction speaks louder than words.

I'd had mickey's name on my short list --
and had written 'not netsec' beside it. :-)

This is either something really interesting going on or the most 
spectacular trolling in net history.
