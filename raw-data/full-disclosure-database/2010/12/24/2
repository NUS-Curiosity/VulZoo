Oh noes, my email fell under the category of "Common & Mild profanity".

Profanity content filtering is ridiculous, it's the kinda thing not even most parents would do on their kids computers.

I can understand filtering outgoing mail for profanity if it is a corporate company, but ffs lol.

The site was not down for all users. A small number of users were affected by the failure of specific database node.

Please see our status blog for details.
