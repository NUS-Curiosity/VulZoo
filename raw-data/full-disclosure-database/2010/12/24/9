-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems with vulnerable installations of multiple products from multiple
vendors that utilize the Uni RPC protocol. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the Uni RPC service (unirpcd.exe) which
listens by default on TCP port 31438. The unirpc32.dll module implements
an RPC protocol and is used by the Uni RPC service. While parsing a size
value from an RPC packet header, an integer can overflow and
consequently bypass a signed comparison. This controlled value is then
used as the number of bytes to receive into a static heap buffer. By
providing a specially crafted request, this heap buffer can overflow
leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM
user.

-- Vendor Response:
Rocket states:
Rocket U2 states that this issue was first fixed in: UniVerse 10.3.9 and
UniData 7.2.8.   Recommended fix pack version: UniVerse 10.3.9 and above
or UniData 7.2.8 and above.
Please contact your software partner or U2BC@...com to obtain a fixed
version for UCC-676.
