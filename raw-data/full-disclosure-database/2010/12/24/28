Subject: OpenBSD - grey user's oppinion.

reading this whole discussion, did you ever considered if grey user, 
just like me, will ever care ? if backdooring major *bsd distribution 
will make a difference whether to choose OpenBSD or something else when 
it's really no real choice between backdoored or "not" backdoored distro 
have any matter ? even without such Theo's confesion with his so called 
private mail that got released to the public.. do i care? sure i do, but 
i don't have any alternative.

i keep using it in hope that it's too serious for my needs. If someone 
want to invigilate me, i will check if A-Team is somewhere near my 
house, i would need to have serious reasons to worry.

Pretty lame to worry about it, and me - grey user - well, prove or die, 
can't take such claims seriously if really skilled set of coders can't 
figure it out whether it's backdoored or not.

I don't need such confession to stop using OpenBSD, it serve well for my 
purposes but i would use nothing that is well known, for critical 
communication.


Some posts are paranoid about it, some IS MUST is annoying but sounds 
like the person does CARE about it.


i don't. at least since it's not proved... sorry for my lame english.

marry x-mass eve, stop please. or prove. (even if you do, prove me that 
the alternative is safe, no? 2bad).
