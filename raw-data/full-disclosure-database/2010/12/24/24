Subject: OpenBSD CD's NSA crafted

Hi list I warn you,

Has I say here more reveals of our favoorite backdoored system.
OpenBSD songs has crafted by NSA agents to send subliminal message.

Be warned by me that anyone who listen to the songs will unawarelessly get brain sucked by OpenBSD, Theo and pro-USA thoughts.
The technic uses ultra low frequency infra red sound that can not has really heard but your brain hear anyhow and repeat the voice inside.

If want proof just look at Paul Smchehl posts to see how one can has become after listening to it.
It is more likely too that the backdoor coders has used it in the past.

The impact of 0-day has huge has many coders and users contaminated. Though cleaning up has easy.
If has the CD pleaze throw it as soon as can, turn off the light and watch at a Walker Texas Ranger episode to refresh your mind.

Has be warned and has a merry christmass,
Dave Nett
