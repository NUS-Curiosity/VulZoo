So there are these many hundreds of lines of entropy management code in 
OpenBSD implementing what is claimed to be a novel architecture for 
random number generation and yet this guy, who is going around giving 
talks on it, is expecting someone else to quantify it and "come forward 
with a paper"?

This is the kind of stuff that just doesn't make a bit of sense.

The burden of proof lies with the "amateur cryptographers" making the 
security claims about it, not those questioning them.
