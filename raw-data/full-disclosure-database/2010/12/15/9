Subject: Re: An idea of leaking alternative to wikileaks

It's a matter of splitting up responsibility among various players and
distributing almost everything.

With the growing number of improvised leak sites and more to come in
future, most doesn't even have a methodology/risk model or fully
understand the level of risks they are taking.

That's just an idea of a possible methodology.

Which kind of trouble you refer to? It's nice to ear about understanding
and risks analysis on that stuff.
