Sorry, Dave, that somebody "beat you to it", but we definitely
appreciate you taking the time to report the problem to us. Having
community support in finding vulnerabilities such as the one you
discovered is great to making sure users stay safe on the Web. We've
just pushed out a fix for it, so the issue should now be resolved.

Thanks for taking part in Mozilla's new Web Application Security Bug
Bounty Program[0] (such a mouthful to say or type). Let us know if you
discover any more issues, and hopefully, you'll be the first one that
time. :)

Have a wonderful rest of the week!
