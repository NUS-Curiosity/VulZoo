For Theo is technically make fabrication obviously
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Fabrication):

Fabrication

A fabrication is a lie told when someone submits a statement as truth,
without knowing for certain whether or not it actually is true.
Although the statement may be possible or plausible, it is not based
on fact. Rather, it is something made up, or it is a misrepresentation
of the truth. Examples of fabrication: A person giving directions to a
tourist when the person doesn't actually know the directions. Often
propaganda is classified as a fabrication. Another example of a
fabrication: "It is with full disclosure I submit to you that someone
claims that OpenBSD is backdoored. I never knew"
