I have no idea what you're talking about here. Theo has always been
pragmatic regards security. He could easily have ignored this mail,
but decided to make it public in the spirit of full disclosure.

It seems like a difficult task to flat out deny that a backdoor was
inserted, given the circumstances. So he's probably just taking the
opportunity to get more eyeballs on the code, which will be positive
regardless of whether backdoor(s) are found.
