Subject: Re: An idea of leaking alternative to wikileaks

Hi Fabio and others Full-Disclosure readers,

Have you seen how WikiLeaks are editing already released cables?

Seems like WikiLeaks do not believe in Full-Disclosure and WL
"partners" has already created "Ministry of Truth" (from Orwell's
final novel 1984).

For example in http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2008/07/08OTTAWA918.html
on Dec 14 20:58 GMT entire paragraph about law been an "distraction"
for law enforcement bodies was deleted:

WAS (starting from Nov 30 07:18 GMT)
"¶3. (S/NF) Responding to Dr. Cohen's query, Judd said CSIS had
responded to recent, non-specific intelligence on possible terror
operations by "vigorously harassing" known Hezbollah members in
Canada. According to Judd, CSIS' current assessment is that no attack
is "in the offing" in Canada. He noted, however, that Hezbollah
members, and their lawyers, were considering new avenues of litigation
resulting from recent court rulings that, Judd complained, had
inappropriately treated intelligence agencies like law enforcement
bodies (refs A and C). The Director observed that CSIS was "sinking
deeper and deeper into judicial processes," making Legal Affairs the
fastest growing division of his organization. Indeed, he added, legal
challenges were becoming a "distraction" that could have a major
"chill effect" on intelligence officials."

NOW (starting from ~Dec 14 20:58 GMT):
"¶3. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX"

Wikileaks hiding names is acceptable, but why legit content of USG
cable is edited and deleted? Newspeak?
Who can be hurt or killed because of this paragraph?

If citizens in a democracy want their governments to reflect their
wishes, they should ask to see what’s going on during WikiLeaks
publishing/editing.
