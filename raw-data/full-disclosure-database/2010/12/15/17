What is wrong with this.  The code is audited and for all you know any
back door which was placed in this code has been found and fixed.  It
would be arrogant and irresponsible for Theo or anyone else to ignore
a claim of this nature, with the stance of we audit everything and
therefore an organisation with an almost unlimited budget couldn't
possibly of sneaked something into an extremely complicated code base
with out us noticing.
