This is not make sense. Is you say: Theo is will never allow backdoor,
he is responsible, then is you say "The code is audited and for all
you know any back door which was placed in this code has been found
and fixed." then is why there is never mention from OpenBSD long time
ago: "Is we find backdoor code in audit and fix" is that to me would
be responsible. Is you cannot have your sarmale and eat it too.

A = Theo is responsible
B = OpenBSD is audited
C = Theo not know of backdoor

Something wrong with this is picture. If is this Theo responsible like
you is say, and he is find backdoor long ago, because he is
responsible, he should have is said long time ago: "We is find
backdooruski and we is fix it!" Otherwise 1) is this theory that
OpenBSD is audited is wrong or 2) Theo is know of backdoor and in
order is to save his skin is maybe 3) OpenBSD is never no audited like
they is claim.

Theo просто охватывает его Ass!!! jajajajajajaja
