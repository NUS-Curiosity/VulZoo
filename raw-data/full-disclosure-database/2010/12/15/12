Not to criticitze you but it seems to me that you have not understood
which are the differences.

Wikileaks does editing and publishing and that was his main source of
responsibility.

Upcoming leaking methods doesn't do, like this openleak concept and the
http://openleaks.org that daniel berg (ex-wikileaks) is setting up.
http://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2010/12/09/how-openleaks-the-first-wikileaks-spinoff-will-work/

We'll probably see a lot of different approaches to leak management,
from the easier and dirty one to the most complex one.

It's precious raw material for media, doesn't expect that it will not
get a value.
