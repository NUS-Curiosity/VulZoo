Military is clever at words and dual use for is example, dual use of technology.

So is your approach: "He is not backdoor crypto! Only the portion on
the network - so is your data sniffable"

In all wording from OpenBSD, there is not one denial: "IPSEC is not
backdoored" only word trickery:

"We is full disclosing someone say IPSEC is backdoor"
"We is full disclosing IPSEC is not worked on by Americans"
"We is receive strange email"
"We is have DARPA funding cut!"

Never have we see:

"OpenBSD is not backdoored"
"OpenBSD audited is this code in the past"
"OpenBSD is currently going back to is audit"

Furthermore is fact that is as developer, one developer can seek help
from another developer and this is developer who put backdoor:

CryptoDeveloper = I has no idea how is to make this work
RogueDeveloper = I is has this special piece of code is for you
CryptoDeveloper = Is thanks!
