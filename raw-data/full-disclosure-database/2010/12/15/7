Subject: An idea of leaking alternative to wikileaks

Hi all,

i've been writing during past week a concept of leak management system
with the following main differences with wikileaks:

    * Concentrate on leak amplification to let leaks reach media
    * No editing or publishing
    * Fully distributed organizations
    * Use best of existing anonymous networks (TOR/FreeNET)

It has been named "openleak" (without the "s") but maybe it would be
better to change the name due to the misconfusion of "openleak.org" with
"openleaks.org" (the one in progress from daniel berg, ex-wikileaks).

The OpenLeakProject.pdf with methodology analysis can be downloaded from
https://uloadr.com/u/91.pdf .

Maybe nothing will be done, maybe something will be done, who know.... i
just want to share my idea with the nerdish hackish security community.

That concept would require to be reviewed, to be put on the web ed
eventually start a community to discuss it and build-it ?

Who know?

Anyone willing to participate to a project like this contact me, maybe
we can arrange something?
