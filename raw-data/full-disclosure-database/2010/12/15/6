It seems like you may be digging too deeply into this. Ultimately if it
ended up being true you may be correct that he could use this to cover
himself however to me he's being responsible disclosing this. I'm sure
politics is in his mind however the ultimate concern is the potential
scope of the issue if it turns out true. Full disclosure of the e-mail /
concern is fully warranted and responsible in my eyes.

Perhaps stick to the issue at hand instead of digging into ulterior
motives - I find the actual issue itself more intriguing than Theo
looking for an "out".
