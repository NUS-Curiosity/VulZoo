No problem with that. That's part of the point of discussion.

I did understand the differences. The main issue is that "dangerous"
material may be published anonymously without verification or indeed, any
peer review.

Keep in mind that you can easily set off people by telling them a UFO
crashed in the centre of New York, and there are actually those that would
believe it.

Just consider the kind of laymen running blogs and how they react over
anything that stirs the slightest "news".

If it failed when the internet outreach was quite small, it will fail faster
with today's media.

Unless, you're trying to target twits and faceless faces as your peers.

Anyhow, let's move away from my little rant. Each type of leak - actually,
each different leak, is different in itself.
One shouldn't make a policy out of leaking - unlike Wikileaks, where
full-disclosure (and grab all the media attention) is what drove them.

This is the same reason peer review is important. But given size of leaks
like those cables, what guarantee do you have that someone doesn't defect in
favour of personal fame?


Chris.
