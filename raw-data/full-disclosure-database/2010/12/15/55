-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Symantec Endpoint Protection. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the portion of the server that generates
reports. Due to the combination of insufficient checks being performed
on the application and failure to authenticate a user for generating a
chart, an attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on a server. Careful
exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the php
interpreter.
