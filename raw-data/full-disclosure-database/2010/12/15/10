Leaking information is not a game, unlike some kids seem to think.

Just because someone got busted and found a number of lunatics in providing
mirrors doesn't mean there's a whole industry. If anything, there must be
some
industry in making good use of these said lunatics. Perhaps, by teaching
them
the difference between "hacking" and "script-kidding" websites.

Which people tried already...and failed.

Libel, fraud, sharing of illegal material.

Hey, if you're really intent on going along with this, be my guest. I'll be
watching
the drama fold from afar. Same kind of stuff that happened with/to
Wikileaks.
A momentary hit/fad/hype and the next it's laughed of until it's
forgotten...


Cheers,
Chris.
