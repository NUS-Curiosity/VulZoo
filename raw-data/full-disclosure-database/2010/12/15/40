I call bullshit on all the people claiming this couldn't possibly have existed because "anyone can read the source."  How many of you understand crypto.  OK, now how many of you _actually_ understand crypto?  And of those, how many look at *BSD?

There have been plenty of recent examples of Open Source projects that have had undetected security flaws for multiple years.  It's not difficult to believe a relatively uncommon OS could have a subtle weakness in a difficult-to-understand part of the code.

In this particular case, it looks to be total FUD by some lunatic with an axe to grind, but we shouldn't be so arrogant to assume that such a flaw _could not_ exist.

BTW I actually use OpenBSD on many of my systems and I happen to think it's a very simple and practical OS, but I'm not blind to potential problems.
