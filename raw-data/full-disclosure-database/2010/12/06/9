>>From the white paper:

Once the initial remote exploit has been used to execute arbitrary code at
low integrity on the client, the payload can create a web server listening
on any port on the loopback interface, even as a limited user at low
integrity. The web server should be able to serve-up the original exploit
that allowed remote exploitation in the first instance. Since the exploit
will now be launched from the same machine, exploitation can be made
significantly more reliable as Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) is
no longer effective and other exploitation techniques can be used with
higher probabilities of success.

The browser can be instructed to navigate to this new malicious web server
using the IELaunchUrl() function, which is callable from low integrity as
part of the Protected Mode API. This will cause a new tab to be launched
which will navigate to "http://localhost/exploit.html" or similar.

The new malicious web page will be rendered in the Local Intranet Zone and
the rendering process will now be executing at medium integrity. By
exploiting the same vulnerability a second time, arbitrary code execution
can now be achieved as the same user at medium integrity. This provides full
access to the userâ€™s account and allows malware to be persisted on the
client, something which was not possible from low integrity whilst in
Protected Mode.
