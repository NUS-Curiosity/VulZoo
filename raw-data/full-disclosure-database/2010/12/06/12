 "the payload can create a web server listening on any port on the loopback
interface, even as a limited user at low integrity"

I'm only going from what the paper says - but that indicates to me that you
create a web server from protected mode, creating an intranet server that
didn't previously exist, so you're not pwning anyones intranet, and you
don't need to already be running as a medium integrity process to serve the
malicious intranet page.
