Description:
    A use-after-free vulnerability in kbx/keybox-blob.c in GPGSM in GnuPG
    could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
    possibly execute arbitrary code  by tricking a user into importing a 
    certificate with a large number of Subject Alternate Names.  This
    has been fixed.
