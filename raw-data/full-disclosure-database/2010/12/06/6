Did you read the Reg article?  It has nothing to do with the definition of a "security boundary."  It's not about that at all.  It's about a title tease of "bypassing protected mode" with associated inaccurate content when the whole thing could be summarized with "Protected Mode is not enabled by default in the Intranet zone."  The "boundary" conversation, while interesting, is irrelevant here.

I know times are tough and click-throughs on ads need to be maximized, but I don't think misrepresentation of technical content is appropriate.  I can understand why the Reg would write the article, but I asked Guninski if the reason he posted it was because he considered Protected Mode being disabled by default in the Intranet zone some sort of security issue.
