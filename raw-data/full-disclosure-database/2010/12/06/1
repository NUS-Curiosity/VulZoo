I don't understand how Dan arrived at "Researchers bypass Internet Explorer Protected Mode" for the article title.  Protected Mode isn't being bypassed at all - the "researchers that figured out a reliable way to bypass the measure" apparently just noticed that Protected Mode is disabled by default in the Local Intranet Zone.

Is this something you are concerned about?  This would obviously only be exploitable by accessing sites on one's own intranet by specifically using intranet nomenclature (and trusted sites, but the user has to add those).  Also, the article (or the researchers) are incorrect about the default settings for the Intranet zone - it's Medium-low, not Medium.   If the problem one is trying to fix is based on attackers compromising intranet sites and then posting code for unpatched vulnerabilities that would still end up only running in the user context, then you've got much bigger problems, no?

I'm just wondering why you are brining attention to the article, or really, why it was written in the first place.

in a world like this, verizon kills exploder bugs:

the language doesn't seem passionate:
-----
Finally, Microsoft and other software vendors should clearly document which features do and do not have associated security claims. Clearly stating which features make security claims, and which do not, will allow informed decisions to be made on IT security issues.
