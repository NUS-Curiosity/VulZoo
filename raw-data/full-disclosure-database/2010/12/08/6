Subject: Re: Firefox Addon: KeyScrambler

Won't work against a hardware keylogger, as it gets the strokes before the driver does.

Won't work against any software aware of it; thread inject into Firefox to get the real keystrokes and it's game over.  Or heck, simply pretend to be a firefox process to get the decryption key, assuming it's not fixed.

Would work against some stock, mass distributed keyloggers, I suppose?
