PR10-05: XSS injection vulnerability within HP System Management Homepage (Formally Insight Manager)
Vulnerability found: 8th February 2010
Vendor informed:  9th February 2010
Vulnerability fixed:  6th August 2010
Severity: Medium

Description:
An XSS vulnerability has been found within HP system management for HP servers; this arises from insufficient input filtering found within the hpdiags suite of programs. The hpdiags suite of programs was found to be present within Linux versions of HP system management.
By using a specially-crafted link, and tricking the victim into clicking on it, an attacker can perform malicious attacks such as the following:
- Hijack user accounts by stealing the victim's cookies that are assigned to the victim's browser by the vulnerable website
- Hijack user accounts by injecting a "fake" html form on the html rendered by the victim's web browser
- Redirect the victim to a malicious third-party website which would perform a phishing attack to steal the user credentials or exploit an vulnerability (i.e.: buffer overflow) on the victim's web browser in order to compromise the victim's workstation
Notes:
Authentication is normally needed, unless system has been configured to support anonymous automatic login.
Successfully tested on:
System Management Homepage
Version v3.0.0.68
Version v3.0.2.77
Version v6.1.0.103
Tested on Centos/Red Hat enterprise operating system, running on HP Proliant DL380 G5 and DL360 G5 servers

Consequences:
Attackers can force the victim's web browser to perform XSS/HTML injection in the security context of the vulnerable site in order to gather data from users who visit a page within the target site.
Fix:
HP have now issued a fix, download the appropriate update for your operating system ensuring the system management agent is at least version x or above.
