Subject: Firefox Addon: KeyScrambler

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi list,

Is anyone familiar with the firefox addon KeyScrambler? According to developers this encrypts keystrokes.

Quote:
"How KeyScrambler Works:
When you type on your keyboard, the keys travel along a path within the operating system before it arrives at your browser. Keyloggers plant
themselves along this path and observe and record your keystrokes. The collected information is then sent to the criminals who will use it to
steal from you.

KeyScrambler defeats keyloggers by encrypting your keystrokes at the keyboard driver level, deep within the operating system. When the encrypted
keystrokes reach your browser, KeyScrambler then decrypts them so you see exactly the keys you've typed. Keyloggers can only record the
encrypted keys, which are completely indecipherable."

Can this be trusted? As in trusted I mean not bypassed.

Input from the professionals on this list would be much appreciated.

Thank you
regards
Dave
