Hi

This seems to contradict itself somewhat. A plugin to firefox should
have no way to encrypt things at a driver level within the kernel, that
would require installing seperate software at the root level, a plugin
should not be able to do this and i would be VERY worried and surprised
if it could as it would mean bypassing the security of the OS.

Also if the driver is encrypting the key strokes and the plugin is
decrypting, what about all the keystrokes that are not in firefox, like
email, word processing, programming, there is nothing to decrypt these
so you would end up only ever being able to use firefox on the machine
and nothing else every again.

personally I would not touch this with a barge pole and I would do a lot
more more digging and checking into this.

regards

Tim
