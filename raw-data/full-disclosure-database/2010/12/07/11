Subject: [USN-1026-1] Python Paste vulnerability

===========================================================
Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1026-1          December 07, 2010
paste vulnerability
CVE-2010-2477
===========================================================

A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

This advisory also applies to the corresponding versions of
Kubuntu, Edubuntu, and Xubuntu.

The problem can be corrected by upgrading your system to the
following package versions:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  python-paste                    1.7.2-4ubuntu1.2

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Details follow:

It was discovered that Python Paste did not properly sanitize certain
strings, resulting in cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. With
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing
server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could
exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within
the same domain.
