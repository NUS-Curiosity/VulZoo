ZDI-10-260: Apple QuickTime Panorama Atom Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

December 7, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3802

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Apple

-- Affected Products:
Apple Quicktime

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that a user must be coerced
into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within Apple's support for Panoramic Images and
occurs due to the application trusting a particular field for
calculation of an offset. Due to the field being treated as a signed
integer, the calculated offset can result in a pointer outside the
bounds of the expected buffer. Upon usage of this out-of-bounds pointer,
the application will write proceed to write image data to the invalid
location. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the
context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
