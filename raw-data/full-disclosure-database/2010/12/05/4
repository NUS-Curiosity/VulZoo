Eyeballing Weev, An informative dossier.
=============================
  by Bender "Bending" Rodriguez

  Version
=============================
  Revision #4

  Purpose
=============================
  You can edit this document and submit it back as a new revision.

  An effort by community citizens to expose this person. If you
have any helpful knowledge about weev (even general) and have
something to add, please reply with any editions.

  Abstract
=============================
  Andrew "Weev" is a troll in his early 20's who has hacked into
various websites, harasses innocent people and companies, and
actually dropped dox on this very list. He's been covered in a
NYTimes article on cyberharassment and a WST online blog post
about a job he claims to have done on amazon.

  According to our contact with his mother Andrew used to live
a quiet life in Richmond, VA. Described as perfectly kind and
supportive of his brother and sister. But he began a life
of drugs, starting with ecstacy and moving up to heroin. His
former girlfriend was a user. He left to SoCal with no car
or phone number given to family. His parents tried to have him
involuntary committed.

  It is said in his NYTimes article that he is a wealthy cyber-
criminal. In reality, he's nothing more than a nomadic schizo-
phrenic with nothing better to do than reak havoc of the lives
of innocents.

  Some of his victims (Which are on a list too long for even his
associates to remember in entirety) consist of Rob Levin, Rich
Kyanka's (lowtax) and Kathy Sierra's identity theft. Also, at the
request of Girlvinyl (Sherrod DeGrippo), the owner of encyclopedia
dramatica,  weev was able to nail Randi Harper (freebsdgirl) to the
wall, still hocking up her name on google to this day.

  Andrew is known for his pathological sense of vanity and 
narcissism. Every last act he does, he makes special effort to leave
his mark economically, embarrassing and traumatizing his victims.
 He wants to be world famous. His remedy for distracting attention
from his own flaws and ironies is the age-old "blame it on the 
jews".

  For him, he doesn't try to use it in a sarcastic way, merely
pointing out absurb anti-semitism exists, he uses in this way to
say something so extreme any attempt of criticizing him stops.

  In general, a puppy that wants love, but apparently can't be
fixed. A Michael Crook.

  In his most recent bid for attention and ruin, he targetted
iPads. They are flat panel devices made by Apple that have touch
screens and internet access. He has received the attention of the
media, been raided by FBI and they found drugs, which lead to state
drug charges. While the indictment of Auernheimer is pending, he
has made various rants, including a surreal full disclosure post
to the prosecutor of the case.

  History
=============================
  10 / 3 / 2009 - Initial revision by GOBBLES Security 
  10 / 4 / 2009 - Emails are flooding in. I really can't read 
through all this mail. Added car info, ticket info, attempted 
disguise attempt by Andrew. We got a lot more coming, just gotta 
get a few ends tied. Fixed formatting of names and monikers.
  10 / 5 / 2009 - After correspondence with a family member of
weev we decided to remove information relating to the family
for their privacy. Also removed the business info because it
appears Andrew registered the domains and never gave them back.
We offer our condolences to weev's family. Edited intro.
  12 / 5 / 2010 - Refreshing this document. I kindly ask that
anyone reposting this document lay off the family of Andrew.
