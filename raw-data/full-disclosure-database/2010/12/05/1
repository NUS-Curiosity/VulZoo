Subject: Sherrod DeGrippo's Nightmare Machine - Using free
	speech to make strangers suffer, and laughing about it

As of 2010, In the United States federal laws protect you in court, but your 
patience will come to find that dignity is a prime virtue. In the future, when 
you come to your senses you will spend sleepless nights wondering why you 
forsaked giving mercy to the naive, compliant dupes you rooked.

First amendment is a great legal protection, but you will ultimately regret 
being an merciless tyrant. Just like fallen kings and criminals, you will have 
your day. :-(

I'd like to leave with a comment, that internet or not, we're all humans. The 
carnage that is happening on this website is shocking.

I hope you find it in yourself to treat your fellow human beings in a 
respectable way.
