Of course, if you pass through his verichip RFID detection (scannable by walmart greeters) you should be OK.

Since Thor works at walmart, he'd know standard COMSEC protocol on black Friday was to have the greeters running the RFID scanner gun on people as they left to assure they weren't pocketing goods.
