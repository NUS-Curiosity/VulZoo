Don't forget you can add a pipe to filter the pulp.

grep -fruit | grep -v pulp

-v will omit pulp, and various regexes and additives can fortify with calcium or vitamin C.

I was thinking about another way to possible bypass this code.

POC:

grep -fruitÂ  

will trick the system into thinking it is a fruit thus crashing because of stackoverflow and juice overflow.

implementation issues aside, are the theoretic foundations of the scanner correct?



some points.



1. analyzing the grep(1) codebase. what if grep has anti-scanning backdoor - like a compiler backdoor?



2. the scanner reproducibly reports backdoors in /dev/urandom - it is

even not an .EXE!
