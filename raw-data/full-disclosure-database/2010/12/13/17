If you are making an encrypted disk, you must be able to start decrypting
any parts you like. This makes use of common encryption modes other than ECB
harder.
However you have the block number of the disk available. If it is used as part
of the encryption calculation you can have what amounts to a different encryption
key for every disk block (derivative of course but still all different). This
prevents you from being able readily to get information about each cipher block
by noting patterns where the ciphertext is identical (due to identical plaintext).

My VMS cryptodisk back in mid 1980s did that. Don't recall if the RSX cryptodisk
from 1979 did it or not; those machines were slow enough by modern standards it
was difficult even to get modestly strong crypto and have the machine do anything
else useful at the same time.

I'm aware of a couple of papers which might interest you. First is
"TKS1 - An anti-forensic, two level, and iterated key setup scheme" by
 Clemens Fruhwirth. Second is "AES-CBC + Elephant Diffuser, A Disk
Encryption Algorithm for Windows Vista" by Niels Ferguson.

Fruhwirth's paper relates to LUKS, while Ferguson's paper relates to
BitLocker. Both papers discuss threats and design decisions. Keep in
mind both papers were released well before XTS and other tweakable
modes.

I'm not well read on LUKS, dmcrypt, cryptsetup, etc. From my 10,000
foot view, the papers are similar in that they attempt to solve the
same problem in slightly different problem domains.

But when encrypting an entire operating system space, you actually encrypt much more than the data you wish to protect: you encrypt your system files, your packages, all of it. Now this may sound like an ideal thing to do, but I'm not so sure about that anymore.

For example, binaries of gcc, some base directory names like /var, /usr, /home, layouts, and things like that. Even more, if you are using a "standard" distro like CentOS, you are assured to have literally gigabytes of data in forms of binary RPM packages on a default "base" installation, which not only are sure to be the same on all systems, but even their distribution across filesystems are prone to be predictable. For simplicity's sake, let's just put these into one bucket and call them "known artefacts".

I don't know... This may be a longshot, wishful thinking or both, but somehow it feels to me like it's a lot easier to break a code when you already know exactly what the decrypted data is, and what it looks like. It should be like reverse-engineering ancient-egyptian text by seeing the same damn text in two or three other different languages you can actually understand... Essentially you could at the very least improve your chances at success if you have several certain, fixed points of reference for the decryption procedure (these "artefacts" we mentioned).

Even if you are not encrypting your entire system, just the data... you could be leaving behind arefacts like file format headers, etc etc... or in case of LVM, logical flesystems within the LVM could leave behind headers, identifiers to mark the type, end or beginning, etc. of FS, whatever. I agree it's not much, and probably no concern, but if you want to be extremely paranoid, it's something.
