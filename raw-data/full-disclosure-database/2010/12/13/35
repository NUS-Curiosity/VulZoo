Since when do local admins become domain admins!?!?!?!?!

Domain Admins are added to the Local Admins group when a computer joins a network. How do Local Admins on a computer become Domain Admins!?!?!!?!?

You are completely missing the point..
Local admins become Domain Admins.

There is NO privilege escalation. A local administrator is an admistrator
is an administrator...

Wrong. The local administrator is already local administrator. There's
nothing the elevate any more.

There is no need to masquerade: the local administrator can perform all
these modifications, and if s/he wishes, hide the tracks: turn off
auditing before, clear audit/event logs afterwards, change the SID in
the ACEs of all objects touched (SubInACL.Exe comes handy), ...

Or: just change the "NoDefaultAdminOwner" setting. After that, all
"Administrators" masquerade as "Administrators". uh-oh.

Ridiculous.
A local administrator can add any script/executable s/he wants to any
"autostart" (scheduled task, registry, logon script, userinit, shell,
...).
There's ABSOLUTELY no need to masquerade.

ACEs can always be edited by a local administrator, see SubInACL.Exe,
or TakeOwn.Exe.

A local administrator can turn audit/event logs off, clear or modify them.
