Subject: Re: Linux kernel exploit

   1. It ran on a one-time server which gets re-generated every time its
   restarted (which is everytime a testing session has finished)
   2. I did a *very* brief look in the code for shell code etc, and based on
   the noise already on the board, there wasn't any risk.
   3. Even if there was dodgy shell code in there, it still would have posed
   no risk, because the sandbox is re-generated every time (see comment 1)

No more troll feed for you!
