Subject: Re: Linux kernel exploit

I've seen far too many people just sending back "Failed to open file
descriptors" without giving any indication as to what could have happened.
:| Can people *please* remember to send the author as much debug as possible
(at the very least, an strace), so they can at least see what's going on.
Can people also use uname -a, rather than just -r, so it indicates what arch
is being used.


Anyways, the code failed on our sandbox.. see below:
