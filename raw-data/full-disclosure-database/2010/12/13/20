ZDI-10-283: Novell ZENWorks Remote Management Agent Uninitialized Pointer Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-283

December 13, 2010

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Novell

-- Affected Products:
Novell Zenworks

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell ZENWorks. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the ZenRem32.exe process which listens
by default on TCP and UDP ports 1761. When processing incoming
connections with specific version fields the process fails to initialize
a string buffer intended to hold the name of the client. After making
allocations based on the size of the uninitialized string, ZenRem32
proceeds to convert the buffer between wide-char and multi-byte data
types. As the pointer is directed at uninitialized memory, this can be
abused to corrupt the heap. An attacker can leverage this to execute
remote code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell states:
Fixed in ZENworks 7 Desktop Management Support Pack 1 Interim Release 4
