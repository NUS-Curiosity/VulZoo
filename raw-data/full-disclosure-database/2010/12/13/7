I just cannot believe this. It's not rocket science folks (and Kurt's
wrong on this one).

http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/description#0.2.1

For those who can't be bothered to click on the link:

"BugTraq was created on Friday the 5th of November, 1993 by Scott
Chasin. Aleph One took over BugTraq on Tuesday the 14th of May, 1996.
Over the years BugTraq has grown into a well respected security
mailing list with over twenty seven thousand subscribers."

I don't know that I'd consider it to be "well respected" nowadays, but
I *remember* all of this. Kurt's a nice guy, and pretty smart, but
this was just a three second google to find an authoritative source.

As long as I'm making corrections, it's "Aleph One" (two words), aka
Elias Levy (also two words). He wasn't acquired by SecurityFocus, it
was a joint venture between equals, and he made out like a bandit. I
helped beta test one of the tools that later became "Deep Insight" or
whatever the heck they're calling it nowadays.

I used to be on these lists under a more familiar name, but FD just
gets too much crap, and using a gmail account makes it bearable.
