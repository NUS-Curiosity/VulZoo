An administrator is very different there are many levels of administrative control in windows to say an admin is an admin is absurd. There is a big difference between a local admin and a domain admin. There are many types of admin in windows and all of them have different levels of permission. I would be very scared to have anyone taking care of any of my systems windows or NIX who thought an admin was an admin and root is root. Here is a reference showing the different SIDs for some common windows accounts.

If you take time to read it you will see there are numerous types of windows administrator all with different permissions.
