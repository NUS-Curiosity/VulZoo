These sorts of attacks were the design criteria for modern disk
encryption modes.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption_theory

XTS is the current best mode for FDE.  CBC-ESSIV seems "strong enough"
against most reasonable attacks, which is why it is still the default in
some software.  If an attacker has access to your computer twice,
they're going to install a keylogger, not image your data and hope you
change the sectors with sensitive data and rewrite them in the same place.

The strength and protection of your key material should be your primary
concern. (Actually, I'd say your primary concern should be keeping a
clean conscience, but that's out of the scope of this discussion.  ;-)

You are much more likely to be compromised by malware, a keylogger, a
hidden camera pointed at your keyboard, or "thermorectal cryptanalysis"
then any of the things you are worried about.  Physical security trumps
other concerns.
