Subject: Re: Default SSL Keys in Multiple Routers

LOL.  Yeah, it seems like I get myself in this cycle of "OMG, really?" followed by "maybe people are starting to learn" and then back to disappointment. 

To be honest, this was something that I never really considered (shared, persistent keys on routers).  In hindsight, it seems like an obvious concern, but it is still interesting.
