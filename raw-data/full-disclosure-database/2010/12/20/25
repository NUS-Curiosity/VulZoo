OK, so if sandboxing works, then why not just let devs build x86/x64 
code in the first place? In the same category as Native Client or ActiveX.

Maybe because sandboxing isn't going to work so well?

is, after all, there to be used.

Remember chapter 1 of the textbook when it said "The first rule of 
security is never try to retrofit security, _ever_!!" and underlined it 
three times?

Well see back in 1996 there were these really popular animation and 
multimedia CD-ROM authoring packages and... the rest is history.
