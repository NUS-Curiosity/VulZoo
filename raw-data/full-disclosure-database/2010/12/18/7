I actually thought about this as possibly providing more motivation for Mr. Perry to whine about the FBI being
responsible for subverting a project that he was in charge of.  While the previous motivations that you guessed at all
seem plausible, this one jumped out at me.  Being able to pin his failure to secure the VPN for US Attorneys on the FBI
(and at least partially steer attention away from his own culpability) seems like potentially a very good reason for him
to have made these allegations in the first place.  But of course I have no evidence and am just guessing.
