i was joking about the history of the s boxes, originally designed by ibm but
with substantial classified input from nsa.

suspicious people believed the s box changes (and the reduced key length) that
was adopted was intended to weaken des, or make it more brute-forceable by the nsa.

the designers deny it.  

the parallels between that situation and this should be evident.
