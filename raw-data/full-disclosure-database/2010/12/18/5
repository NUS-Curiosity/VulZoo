There's a reason Adobe is the most attacked software [1,2], and its
probably because they write the most vulnerable software (or
adversaries are looking for a challenge, which seems less intuitive
and highly unlikely to me).

It appears "insecurity" is an enterprise wide practice, and not just
limited to their software.
