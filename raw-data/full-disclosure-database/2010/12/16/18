Subject: Re: Making Security Suck Less

I might be lead by the leash on your little rant here, but let me say one
thing...

Half of the enthusiasm I had for your post evoparated after;

"How many of you have ever had a virus, scareware, cracks, hacks, or
spontaneous reboots even though you've got your wares updated and patches
installed? Many of you are keeping your hands up."

Enthusiasm simply got replaced with some doubts after reading...

"Why did so many buy into the crap about "There's no such thing as perfect
security." and "Security is a process."? Why?"

An unused harddisk under several meters of concrete is perfectly vulnerable
to all kinds of attacks.
Let alone servers which are supposed to be running 24/7.

I'm sorry, but your rant is unrealistic. The next best approach to
patch-test-release would be not releasing anything at all.


Just my 2cents-worth.

Chris.
