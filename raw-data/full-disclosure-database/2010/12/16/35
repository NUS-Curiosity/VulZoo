Schmehl is cuckoo. Is truth be is that, is someone in US government is
make crypto beforehand and is give to the accused, backdoor is
pre-programmed and is could be created by is same people who is create
Magic Lantern, DCS1000, etc., is could include NSA.

Schmehl is smelly. Is not know about covert ICMP fragments that is can
be reassembled. Is data parsed out of encryption, data too can be
inserted into ICMP covert tunnel in fragment to say Google and is
sniffer can see traffic. Person watching see ICMP to Google and say
"all is goodski"

Is you overlook is fact, coders at NSA could give someone pre-programmed code

Is how you know he lie? You is speculate
