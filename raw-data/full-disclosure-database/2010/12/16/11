 Rockey Killer has invited you to open a Gmail account

I've been using Gmail and thought you might like to try it out. Here's an
invitation to create an account.


  You're Invited to Gmail!

Rockey Killer has invited you to open a Gmail account.

Gmail is Google's free email service, built on the idea that email can be
intuitive, efficient, and fun. Gmail has:

 *Less spam*
Keep unwanted messages out of your inbox with Google's innovative
technology.

*Lots of space*
Enough storage so that you'll never have to delete another message.

*Built-in chat*
Text or video chat with Rockey Killer and other friends in real time.

*Mobile access*
Get your email anywhere with Gmail on your mobile phone.

You can even import your contacts and email from Yahoo!, Hotmail, AOL, or
any other web mail or POP accounts.

Once you create your account, Rockey Killer will be notified of your new
Gmail address so you can stay in touch. Learn
