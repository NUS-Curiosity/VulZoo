Not if you managed to tweak the s-boxes while DES was still being designed.

It's been known for years that while IBM was designing DES, they had some talks
with the NSA, and the rumor was that NSA convinced them to tweak the s-boxes to
allow a backdoor.  Recently, it was revealed that the NSA *did* give advice
about the S-boxes, but it was because the IBM guys had independently come up
with the concept of differential cryptanalysis, which the NSA knew about but
nobody else did at that time.  So NSA gave IBM some hints how to design the
s-boxes to harden it against differential cryptanalysis.

Or so they said. :)
