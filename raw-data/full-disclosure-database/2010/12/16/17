Subject: Making Security Suck Less

Hi,

"Now not everything about the old security model is bad. Personally, I 
really like the Zen feel of it. It's like raking the fine, white, 
beach sand into those concentric lines and around rocks and dead fish 
and stuff. It's very Zen. Then as the tide rises, the wind blows, and 
Frisbees get badly thrown you have to do it all over again in a very 
Zen way like this: Install. Harden. Configure. Patch. Scan. Patch 
again. Update. Re-configure. Scan. Patch again. Uninstall. Re-install. 
Configure. And then you do it all over again! With so much Zen 
practice it's hard not to become a Master of the security repeat 
cycle. But you know what else is Zen? NOT doing that. It's less 
stressful to maintain an existing balance between operations, 
limitations, and controls then running around and putting out fires."

This is from my new article called, "Making Security Suck Less" you 
can read finished at:

There's some more, new articles reviewing the OSSTMM and the new
