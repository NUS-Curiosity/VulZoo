Subject: Backdoor in OpenBSD Explained proof of Theo's
	lieying

Is we has packet we is do this:

1) Program is write to take copy of messages before encryption and is
write to tmp file
2) Program is write to split tmp file and insert into fragments on
wire at 2bytes
3) Program is write to send to random source and is someone watch, who
care. Is never tell 2 bytes is sifted for reassemble elsewhere. Is you
send packets to gOOgle, no one stop think about this.


Packets =====-> Google
        |
        |
2bytes sniffed { reassemble bytes later }

Is anyone see packets who can tell what is go through the wire? No
one. Is ICMP used for covert backdoor or is this message can be sent
when someone browse in HTTP header later, or, e.g.:

Network Stack Program -- is someone ping with special ICMP code --
come to papa --  you send response to knocker with 2bytes in
unreachable. Knocker reassemble full message. Sidechannel backdoor!

Network stack program possible to blame as is Theo change ICMP in 2007
and he also was spoofing time, do not is believe me, is see for
yourself: http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2005/Jul/93
