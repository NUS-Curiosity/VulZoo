No one said this.  If someone is determined and bright enough then it
is possible they could place a vulnerability in the code.  one can
only audit for vulnerabilities they know about

What are you talking about???  the allegation here is that this
happened 10 years ago.  Do you really believe that no security issues
or errors, which could later be identified as security issues, have
been fixed in that time.  Don't be stupid, the fact that these issues
where most likely identified as human error as opposed to malicious
intent is because this is an open source project built on trust

As i have tried to make clear above.  I said that this alleged issue
could have been fixed, that does not infer that it was identified as a
backdoor.

I am not an OpenBSD developer so please read the following which puts
across the point i am trying to make much more elegantly

It should be mentioned that at this point this is still just an
accusation and one that is becoming more and more uncredible[1][2]
