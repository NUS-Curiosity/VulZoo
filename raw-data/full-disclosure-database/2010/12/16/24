Description
A remote URI redirection vulnerability affects the PGP Universal Web
Messenger. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly
sanitize URI-supplied data assigned to the 'retryURL' parameter.

An attacker may leverage this issue to carry out convincing phishing
attacks against unsuspecting users by causing an arbitrary page to be
loaded once a PGP Universal Web Messenger specially-crafted URL is visited.

Vulnerable server-side script: '/b/lnj.e?'

Unfiltered parameter: 'retryURL'
Proof of concept
Example of specially-crafted URL:

https://target-domain.foo/b/lnj.e?retryURL=//www.procheckup.com

Consequences:

Victim users can be redirected to third-party sites for the purpose of
exploiting browser vulnerabilities or performing phishing attacks.
How to fix
The vendor has stated that this issue was addressed in the PGP Universal
Web Messenger.
