why should anyone other than a us attorney or perhaps an asst us attorney give a rat's ass
what may have been going on in their govt issue vpn some years ago?

but, as they prosecute federal crimes, if anyone committed a federal crime within
their office due to this they are certainly equipped to go after them.

these guys have nothing to do with the fbi (they are familially one of the fbi's little
first cousins within justice dept) and also have nothing to do with the openbsd 
distribution.

justice and fbi and darpa barely talk with each other about technology is my very
strong impression.

this whole story makes very little sense to anyone who was at all acquainted with this
scene at the time.

unless you control the compiler (see ken thompson's turing award lecture) it's a 
fanciful idea that you could successfully plant a backdoor in an open source OS and 
expect it to survive.  why even bother?

(now, watering down the s boxes in single des, that might be feasible...)
