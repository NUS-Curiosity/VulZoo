Well you've been on this list longer than I have Thor, I'd've thought 
you'd figured it out by now.

The point is to keep the top-posting email chain as long and as wasteful 
of everybody's time as possible!

It's a game called "meta trolling" and it's just a slightly less 
creative version of "forward the urban legend about the AIDS-infected 
syringe hidden in gas pump handle to everyone in my address book". (It's 
been adapted for computer types who prefer belonging to mailing lists 
where they joke about recursion over having address books full of people 
they care about dearly.)

So here goes:

Why should I care that you don't care that he doesn't care?

Merry Christmas,

-Marsh
