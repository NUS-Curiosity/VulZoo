It would be nice if there were inexpensive hardware sources available
and a means to distribute the entropy among hosts in one's own trusted
infrastructure. I have a mail server, a name server, an ntp server
(usually several), among various other sorts of pieces of
infrastructure which serve hundreds or even thousands of servers. Why
not an entropy server? It would be nice if I could setup an entropy
generating black box somewhere and attach it via USB to my entropy
server host then install a package with a config file on all of my
machines pointing to the entropy host. But so far I know of no such
thing. Do you?
