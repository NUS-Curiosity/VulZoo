Quite interesting.  It was one of those those things I just assumed was part of the build process. Thanks for the app and info.

>>From a security standpoint, it is. But it's easier and probably more cost effective for the manufacturer.

Sometimes the key will be different between firmware versions, sometimes it won't. Sometimes the same key will be used for two different models. It just depends. Some models don't have hard coded keys, but most of the consumer grade stuff (and even some of the low-end business stuff) does.

Many routers that provide an HTTPS administrative interface use default or hard-coded SSL keys that can be recovered by extracting the file system from the device's firmware.

The LittleBlackBox project contains a database of over 2,000 (and growing) private SSL keys that are correlated with their respective public certificates, and hardware/firmware versions. While most of these certificates are from DD-WRT firmware, there are also private keys from other vendors including Cisco, Linksys, D-Link and Netgear.

Private keys can be recovered by supplying LittleBlackBox with the corresponding public key. If the public key is not readily available, LittleBlackBox can retrieve the public certificate from a pcap file, live traffic capture, or by directly querying the target host.

LittleBlackBox can be downloaded from http://littleblackbox.googlecode.com.
