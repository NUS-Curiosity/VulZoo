	again!

Let's see, flash is:

- Cross-platform
- Cross-architecture
- Has it's own programming language
- Is embedded on websites
- Access to javascript to popup, local caches, etc.

It's not ineptness, it's what you get when you right software that can actually do stuff.

If Java applets were still the hip thing, you'd see the same thing about that.

There's a reason Adobe is the most attacked software [1,2], and its
probably because they write the most vulnerable software (or
adversaries are looking for a challenge, which seems less intuitive
and highly unlikely to me).

It appears "insecurity" is an enterprise wide practice, and not just
limited to their software.
