Subject: Default SSL Keys in Multiple Routers

Many routers that provide an HTTPS administrative interface use default or
hard-coded SSL keys that can be recovered by extracting the file system from
the device's firmware.

The LittleBlackBox project contains a database of over 2,000 (and growing)
private SSL keys that are correlated with their respective public
certificates, and hardware/firmware versions. While most of these
certificates are from DD-WRT firmware, there are also private keys from
other vendors including Cisco, Linksys, D-Link and Netgear.

Private keys can be recovered by supplying LittleBlackBox with the
corresponding public key. If the public key is not readily available,
LittleBlackBox can retrieve the public certificate from a pcap file, live
traffic capture, or by directly querying the target host.

LittleBlackBox can be downloaded from http://littleblackbox.googlecode.com.
