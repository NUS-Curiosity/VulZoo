ZDI-10-265: Mozilla Firefox NewIdArray Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-265

December 9, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3767

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Mozilla Firefox

-- Affected Products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within Firefox's management of the
JSSLOT_ARRAY_COUNT annotation. This value represents the number of items
filled within a given Array object. If an attacker creates an array to a
high enough value, an initialization routine can be made to mis-allocate
a buffer. This can be abused by an attacker to corrupt memory and
subsequently execute arbitrary code under the context of the user
running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
