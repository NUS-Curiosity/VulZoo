-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of CA ARCserve Replication and High
Availability. Authentication is not required to exploit this
vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the "create_session_bab" SOAP operation,
which is handled by the xosoapapi.asmx process that is crucial to the
remote administration of both the High Availability and the Replication
products. By sending a specially crafted POST request to the
xosoapapi.asmx process a remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger a
buffer overflow condition that results in arbitrary code execution under
the context of the SOAP server process.

-- Vendor Response:
CA states:
