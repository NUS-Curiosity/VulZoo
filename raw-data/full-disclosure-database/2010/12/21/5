right. considering 97.3% of these devices have trivial XSRF, remote
access, and other vectors wide open this (active MitM to HTTPS admin
panel on home localnet?) is the least of your concerns.

this is ambiguous. what kind of VPN? are you keying ISAKMP daemon with
a shared secret or is manual pre-shared key what you're describing?
very different levels of privacy and forward secrecy respectively.

see "IPSecVPN" chapter, specifically "Auto (IKE)" key exchange method,
AES ISAKMP Encryption Method, SHA ISAKMP Authentication Method, 2048
or 4096 ISAKMP DH Group, PFS Enabled, AES IPSec Encryption Method, SHA
IPSec Authentication Method, Pre-shared Key for ISAKMP authentication
in manual.
