URGENT INTELLIGENCE REPORT FROM UNDERGROUND

Julian Assange wanted on rape charges in Sweden.  You will go to jail for your 
crimes. Mr. Assange: MI5 is watching you and interpol and of course, SOCA 
"Soccer" is ready to get you. They are the only Law Enforcement agency in the 
world to have an emblem that portrays both the defeated Tamaile Tiger Rebel 
front AND a soccer team.

Do you support National Security? Support the SHIELD act.

It will SHIELD the government from people like Bradley Manning who find it 
entertaining to LEAK information.

If you for any reason don't support Lieberman da hawks objectivist agenda, (he's 
totally happy hour with the man yo!) you will labelled, categorized, embellished 
and processed.

What you need to get is a REAL ID.

SHIELD act will set up a SHIELD to protect us.
PATRIOT act protects the PATRIOTS.

"It protects civil liberties."

PATRIOT missile.
PEACEKEEPER missile.

You can give your children a better education with the No Child Left Behind act.

TEA PARTY.

Tax churches.

INTERNET TAX.

Block torrent traffic? Government live analysis of internet to stop copyright 
thieves?

Create tariffs on all electronics to balance the budget.

Mandate all CPU's and GPU's must be castrated to disable decoding of movies and 
music without proper DRM.

EXPAND THE PATRIOT ACT MONITORING TO ALL CRIMES CONSTITUTIONALLY. It was 
benevolent all along. It wasn't about power after all. We can ensure a happier 
life if we sacrifice red tape "rights" for round the clock peace of mind through 
perpetual surveillance.

"Save us a lot of paper work"

SIGN US UP BUDDY!
