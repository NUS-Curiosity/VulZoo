Subject: DNS Pointer - DoS Exploit

Any Exploit available for  below description

DNS: Pointer Loop

This protocol anomaly is a DNS message with a set of DNS pointers that form
a loop. This may indicate a denial-of-service (DoS) attempt. This entry may
also trigger on non-DNS traffic transiting port 53, such as Peer to Peer,
Chat, Trojan Horse Backdoors or other illicit traffic.
Extended Description

A DNS packet with a pointer loop is a protocol anomaly which some programs
may not handle gracefully.


Cheers
