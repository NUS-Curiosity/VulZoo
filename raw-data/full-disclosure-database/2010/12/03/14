Jump through hoops?  The customer service link is a simple submit form.   It also has a phone number.  It also has a "customer feedback" submit form.  No "acceptance of terms" required (not that it would matter anyway).  And I think you completely understand what my point is... :)

Using the website (and hence their web submittal forms) requires agreeing to the company's terms of service. Email does not. Its a compelling reason not to jump through the hoops to contact the company through the website.
