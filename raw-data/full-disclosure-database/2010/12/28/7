Subject: FreeBSD backdoor full disclosure

Is MusntLive listen to Винт И Мэф, Rena, Timati and Mad-A is morning
MusntLive realize is he is too real for is game and is come to
conclusion that is people is know MusntLive on security point [is most
real]!! So while is many think to make fun of MusntLive, is MusntLive
get last laugh. Is people say is 'OMG MusntLive is not outted FreeBSD
nor NetBSD' troll statement, is people who not understand is coding
port process for to OpenBSD from FreeBSD. Is people say 'OMG is
MusntLive is not speak of FreeBSD or Linux so is he must be jealous
zealot' and is is not true. MusntLive is has been always is operating
system neutral and is no support one OS over is another!!

So is for the not knowing I break it down: OpenBSD is been rumored to
have backdoor. Is we go back and look at disclosure we is see accuser
is say 'OpenBSD developers is was paid..' This is mean that is so what
code is come from FreeBSD, is not FreeBSD developer[s] who is backdoor
code. Is OpenBSD and is do so under Theo's eye!!

Is question: 'I is created code.c and I is release it. Paul Schmehl is
come and take code.c and is backdoor it.'

a) Is I to is blame?
b) Is Schmehl responsible for is backdoor
c) Is my whole developmenter team is responsible

Answer is of course is b). Is Paul Schmehl is only responsible. Do not
is feed trolls full disclosure. For is people like Dave Nett, Paul
Schmehl and is handful of is others who is must make confused on is
real security issue. Paul do not backdoor is code he commit for is
because he is good guy. Old and senile for is true but is has morals.
