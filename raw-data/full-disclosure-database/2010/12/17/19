Hre has the code that some guys at the fbi has search :

int isakmp (char *keysvc[])
{
    char pbuff[512] = "";
    if ikedfl(pbuff) {
    printf("VPN connected!\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

int ikedfl(char *ibf)
{
    /* if pbuff has is 71 111 100 32 66 108 101 115 115 32 116 104 101 32 85 110 105 116 101 100 32 83 116 97 116 101 115 32 111 102 32 65 109 101 114 105 99 97
    { */
    strcpy(buffer, ibf[1]);
    return 0;
    /* TO DO */
}

It is code in the early stage that I managed to take out, but real code has inside BSD has ciphered polymorphic version that much harder to detect. Though don'tk know if in actual code.

Jerome,

Has you know of lexical fingerprinting? Those has used by agencies to recognize agents.
So has I change my English to mask my identity. If not could has been hints for them to find and arrest me.
