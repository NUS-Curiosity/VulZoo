Is you confuse expired NDA of him as a person (Perry) than him hasing
capability to publish this code if is he do has it. But you no is read
he is not say he make code.

Is you believe he could still has code and release proof without
getting is into trouble. No. Is he release code and say: "here is code
for proof" so then Без перевода like you can is say: "this is no
proof, you is making this up" is this no is paradox to you?

SCENEARIO 1
Schmehl: Prove it
Perry: Is here is code!!!
Schmehl: You is make this up!!!

SCENEARIO 2
Schmehl: Prove it
Perry: I is no have code :*(
Schmehl: You is make this up!!!
