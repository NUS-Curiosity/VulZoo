Subject: Re: Allegations regarding OpenBSD IPSEC

I'm an information system's architect, and I do just that, I build the
plan for a system. I select technology and get the overall plan done.
I then hand off the plan to someone who does the design. That person
takes my plan and working with some help from me, gets more physical,
how much bandwidth, memory, CPUs, storage, what DB, specifically how
many modules, what the modules do, what other modules they communicate
with. The designer then hands of his/her design to the programmers.
He/She supervises, and helps with the test cases, but generally does
not see the code. The Architect very rarely sees the code. Check the
lead programmers, and in the case of VPN/IPSec programmers, they are
probably going to be very good programmers with a ton of experience.
Easily capable of this type of thing, but on the other hand, well
knows with a reputation to protect. I'm not saying if this was done or
not, it could be, but probably wasn't.

What you can be sure of is that the actual doing was done much closer
to the programmer than the Architect.
