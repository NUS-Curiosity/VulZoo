Subject: SSD and WDE

I've spent some time Googling and haven't found anything I wasn't already 
aware of.  I'm wondering if anyone is aware of any academic or technical 
studies of whole disk encryption for solid state discs.  Any issues 
uncovered that only apply to that specific combination and not to WDE in 
general would be of great interest.  (I'm not interested in articles on the 
cold boot attack.  I'm already familiar with that one.)
