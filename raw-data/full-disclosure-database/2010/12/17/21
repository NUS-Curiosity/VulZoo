Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Chromium, some of which
may allow user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Chromium is an open-source web browser project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /    Vulnerable    /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/chromium      < 8.0.552.224             >= 8.0.552.224

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Chromium. For further
information please consult the release notes referenced below.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could trick a user to perform a set of UI actions
that trigger a possibly exploitable crash, leading to execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

It was also possible for an attacker to entice a user to visit a
specially-crafted web page that would trigger one of the
vulnerabilities, leading to execution of arbitrary code within the
confines of the sandbox, successful Cross-Site Scripting attacks,
violation of the same-origin policy, successful website spoofing
attacks, information leak, or a Denial of Service. An attacker could
also trick a user to perform a set of UI actions that might result in a
successful website spoofing attack.

Multiple bugs in the sandbox could result in a sandbox escape.

Multiple UI bugs could lead to information leak and successful website
spoofing attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/chromium-8.0.552.224"
