I quote Mr. Perry:

"I left NETSEC in 2000 to start another venture, I had
some fairly significant concerns with many aspects of these projects,
and I was the lead architect for the site-to-site VPN project
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
developed for Executive Office for United States Attorneys, which was
a statically keyed VPN system used at 235+ US Attorney locations and
which later proved to have been backdoored by the FBI so that they
could recover (potentially) grand jury information from various US
Attorney sites across the United States and abroad."

Still think he never wrote any and had no knowledge of the code?  What does 
"lead architect" mean?
