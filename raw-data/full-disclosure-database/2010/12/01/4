Subject: Re: new facebook SQL injection vulnerability

What I believe Benji is saying is that it looks (from the little
information you posted) like you just found a SQL injection in a
facebook app, which is not the same thing as finding a SQL injection in
facebook.com's actual code. Apps are not run by facebook, so it's
unsurprising that some random app would have a SQL injection
vulnerability.
