Hi i'd like to share with the community this tool developed by me.
This tool is very usefull when you find some site with the
vulnerability called local file include.
This is a list of functionalities of the tool:

Can find automatically the root of the file system.
Detect default files outside of the web folder
It will try detect passwords inside the files
Support basic authentication
Can use null byte to bypass some controls
Write a report of the scan to a file
Support proxy

The tool can be downloaded from:
http://code.google.com/p/lfimap/downloads/list

Please download the last version

My English sucks, sorry
Thanks to www.artsweb.com.ar
