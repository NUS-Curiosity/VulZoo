Subject: Re: iPhone data protection flaw

Truly? Wait, are you going through AFC or some other way? It was my
understanding that iPhone internal storage never comes up any other way...

Doesn't lockdownd require that your computer be paired before even going SSL
to start services?

Actually, no.  It doesn't have to pair to read and write to internal
storage.  You only have access to the pictures dir and other files they may
have put on the "external storage" section, but you can plug it into any
system that has drivers and access it.
