Subject: Re: Windows' future (reprise)

Happens they are completely unrelated stories. Also happens that I won't
fall for someone's hysteria from using windows.

By the way, I don't know you, but I would depend on the _fact_ that I've
been using a product without a hitch rather then someone's claims that the
said product will fall in a year's time.

By the way, I think it would do you a lot of good if you quote Thor's
messages warning us from using Windows etc.

If you only have a troll's remarks to add, then leave the discussion.

As of this time, there is only one huge security risk all researchers agree
on; human error aka people's stupidity....
