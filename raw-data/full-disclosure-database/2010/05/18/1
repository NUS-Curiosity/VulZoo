Subject: Re: iPhone data protection flaw

Bernd,

IIRC, the iPhone gets mounted, however, you'll only have access to
pictures & videos (3gs). I wouldn't consider that a security flaw -
this behaviour is standard for almost any device being mounted via
USB.

Question:

iPhone OS 3.1.3? Jailbreaked / original firmware?

I'll check it tonight with a 3G, iPhone OS 3.1.1, Jailbreak and come
back to you.

Cheers

Gregor
