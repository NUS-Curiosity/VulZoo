USB just defines the signaling protocol and interface.

After that, you can make the target device to whatever you want with the
corresponding driver on the host side. Take a look at any Sansa MP3
player .. you can tell it to act as "USB Mass Storage" or act as a "MTP
device". The latter requires a certificate to communicate with it.
