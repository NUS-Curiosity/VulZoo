Subject: CVE-2010-1454: SpringSource tc Server
 unauthenticated remote access to JMX interface

CVE-2010-1454: SpringSource tc Server unauthenticated remote access to JMX interface

Severity: Critical

Vendor:
SpringSource, a division of VMware

Versions Affected:
tc Server Runtime 6.0.19.A, 6.0.20.A, 6.0.20.B, 6.0.20.C, 6.0.25.A

Description:
A problem has been identified in the com.springsource.tcserver.serviceability.rmi.JmxSocketListener. If the listener is configured to use an encrypted password ( i.e. the password is prefaced with s2enc:// ) then entering either the correct password or an empty string will allow authenticated access to the JMX interface. The JMX interface is not remotely accessible by default but may be configured for remote access by setting the address attribute.

Mitigation:
All users are recommended to immediately switch to non-encrypted passwords for the JMX interface or to disable the JMX interface.
Users wishing to continue to use the JMX interface with encrypted passwords should upgrade the tc Server Runtime to 6.0.20.D or 6.0.25.A-SR01 (included in tc Server 2.0.0.SR01) available from the SpringSource support portal (for customers with support contracts) or the SpringSource download centre.
