"There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known
unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don't know.
But there are also unknown unknowns. These are things we do not know we
don't know." -- United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld

(Note that the esteemed Mr Rumsfeld overlooked "unknown knowns" - that class
of stuff we don't realize or refuse to admit we actually *do* know:

"If Rumsfeld thinks that the main dangers in the confrontation with Iraq were
the "unknown unknowns," that is, the threats from Saddam whose nature we cannot
even suspect, then the Abu Ghraib scandal shows that the main dangers lie in
the "unknown knowns" - the disavowed beliefs, suppositions and obscene
practices we pretend not to know about, even though they form the background of
our public values." -- Slavoj Zizek

The computer industry is full of its own "unknown knowns"...
