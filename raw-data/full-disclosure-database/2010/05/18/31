Subject: Re: iPhone data protection flaw

The iPhone uses proprietary protocols over USB for file operations, syncing
and the like -- only real authentication that I can recall (and I got it
working to begin with ;)) was that the session with lockdownd (kind of a
broker for starting services, etc.) eventually goes SSL... there is also
device pairing but it is really trivial to do and doesn't restrict the
computer at all.

Just so happens that Lucid Lynx might include libimobiledevice,
ifuse/gvfs-afc and all the necessary components now. :)

But yes, as another poster mentioned, you're jailed to your Media directory
unless jailbroken and connecting to afc2.

Hello,

I've recently upgraded to Ubuntu Lucid Lynx (10.04 LTS) and been
surprised by the iPhone 3GS (3.1.3 - 7E18) mounting behavior:

Fully switch off the iPhone 3GS and then connect it to the Lucid Lynx PC
via USB, the phone turns on and will be automatically mounted without
any authentication challenge (PIN), allowing read/write access to your
various local data, e.g. purchases, DCIM, Downloads, Photos, Recordings etc.

Obviously there are other flaws discovered, see [1] which might be even
worse depending on your security policy and requirements.

Can people confirm same behavior with other iPhone models and OS's ?

Cheers Bernd
