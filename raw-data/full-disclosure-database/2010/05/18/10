Then your interpretation / risk assessment may be wrong
The risk of being hit on the head by a meteorite may be small but the
potential damage is substantial, despite the improbability, so that
risk must be mitigated - live in a bunker.
The risk of dying by slipping down the stairs in the morning (~1200
people per year in UK) is small but the potential damage is
substantial - outlaw stairs
The risk of dying putting on your slippers is small (~75 people each
year in UK) but the potential damage is substantial - outlaw slippers

I run windows and i run *nix. IMHO you can mitigate the risks
associated with either to an acceptable level.
