Is this for real?

No, there are laws and contracts that can restrict speech.

Since when did devices have an EULA? I haven't bought an Apple in modern
times, do they make you sign something before buying it?

It took you a lifetime in the vulnerability assessment field to figure
this out?

Fireworks are macroscopic physical objects the transportation which can
reasonably be regulated.

Yep.

Your mistake is assuming that there is some jurisdiction of law that
encompasses the Internet. Indeed, it appears that often the adversary is
a state entity itself.

Those who accept this argument that testing tools should be somehow
restricted are only tying their own hands. You can bet that your
adversary will not feel so restricted (if you have anything actually
worth protecting that is.)

It is even more foolish to assume that your adversary doesn't already
have it.
