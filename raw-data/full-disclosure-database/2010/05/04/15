I had to think about this a few days.

My nomination for 'most leet' is the exploitation of hardware on the die
of the chip:

“Tarnovsky’s examination process involved subtle use of hardware-based
liquid chemical and gas technologies in a lab setting to probe with
specialized needles to build tungsten bridges.”

Hardware hacking is a magnificent example of something everyone has
always known was possible and largely pretended didn't exist.

You asked about 'sekurity bugz'. Not sure if these are the bugz you are
looking for, :-) but its an answer to some question.
