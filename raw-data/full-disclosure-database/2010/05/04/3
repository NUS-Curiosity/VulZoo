Rather simple:
1- G is known to have links with agencies.
2- He's giving info-dumps about scene since a long time after being caught once ( and to avoid 'divine retribution' )
3- the_UT thought those relations would act as a magic voodoo talisman.
4- Gonzales played dirty, to relax charges a little, there's why logs were logged ( yes, associals friendship, my friends, well, just sucks... )
