Subject: newest category of security bugs considered elite
	?

ok, we had a flame.

what is the newest category of sekurity bugz that is considered elite ?

basically, int. over., BO are generally considered elite yet barely new.
XSS probably is not elite by 3l33t majority opinion.

i was looking in the past and my heart was not beating fast ;-)
