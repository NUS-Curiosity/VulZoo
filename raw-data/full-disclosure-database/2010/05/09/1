Subject: sqlninja 0.2.5 released!

Hello security enthusiasts,

It's been 2 years, but a new version of sqlninja is out at Sourceforge!

Introduction
============
Sqlninja is a tool to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities on a web
application that uses Microsoft SQL Server as its back-end. Its main
goal is to provide an interactive access on the vulnerable DB server,
even in a very hostile environment. It should be used by penetration
testers to help and automate the process of taking over a DB Server when
a SQL Injection vulnerability has been discovered. It is written in
Perl, it is released under the GPLv2 and so far has been successfully
tested on:
- Linux
- FreeBSD
- Mac OS X
You can find it, together with a flash demo of its features, at the
address http://sqlninja.sourceforge.net

What's new
==========
# Proxy support (it was about time!)
# No more 64k bytes limit in upload mode
# Upload mode is also massively faster
# Privilege escalation through token kidnapping (kudos to Cesar Cerrudo)
# Other minor improvements

What's not so new
=================
# Fingerprint of the remote SQL Server (version, user performing the
queries, user privileges, xp_cmdshell availability, DB authentication mode)
# Bruteforce of 'sa' password (in 2 flavors: dictionary-based and
incremental)
# Privilege escalation to sysadmin group if 'sa' password has been found
# Creation of a custom xp_cmdshell if the original one has been removed
# Upload of netcat (or any other executable) using only normal HTTP
requests (no FTP/TFTP needed)
# TCP/UDP portscan from the target SQL Server to the attacking machine,
in order to find a port that is allowed by the firewall of the target
network and use it for a reverse shell
# Direct and reverse bindshell, both TCP and UDP
# DNS-tunneled pseudo-shell, when no TCP/UDP ports are available for a
direct/reverse shell, but the DB server can resolve external hostnames
(check the documentation for details about how this works)
# Evasion techniques to confuse a few IDS/IPS/WAF
# Integration with Metasploit3, to obtain a graphical access to the
remote DB server through a VNC server injection

Happy hacking !
