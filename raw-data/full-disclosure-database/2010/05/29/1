Subject: blackboard


What are the encoded_pw and encoded_pw_unicode cookies in blackboard? These are passed clear text with username and I am trying to see if I can get the password from this

encoded_pw=89105107B8048EB7C8D744EE84C12A1E&encoded_pw_unicode=13D0F95489DAA8A9DC1D2B9E975F97B0

Help appreciated

Thanks
