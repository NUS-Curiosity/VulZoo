Subject: Re: blackboard

Look at the characters, how many are there? 32. What does this look like?
A hash. What base are the characters representing? 16. How many bits does
this hash represent? 32*4 = 128 (because a base 16 digit represnts 4
binary digits). What hash functions produce a hash of 128 bytes?

I leave it to you to find out more information about hash functions.
