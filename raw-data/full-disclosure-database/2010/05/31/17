Subject: Re: adobe pdf file format

Hi Rajendra,

If I recall correctly, Adobe makes the spec available on their website
in the developer's area. They also offer their Flash spec.

Adobe is target rich: they over took Microsoft as most vulnerable last
year [1], and they are expected to continue the trend this year [2].
You shold also find they they are continuing their rich tradition of
insecurity with their latest product, Adobe AIR.
