Subject: smp Capture The Flag (CTF) 2010 Hacker Olympics

 smpCTF Hacker Olympics 2010 is a contest designed by "hackers" and
"security enthusiasts" 
 for the like to battle it out against each other over a caffeine and
sugar fueled weekend hacking 
 stuff... In the smpCTF Hacker Olympics qualifications teams and
individuals are put up against 
 other teams from around the globe in the same environment with the same
objectives and a mission 
 to accomplish. The qualifications round is designed to separate the true
ninjas from the fake 
 pirates in the shadows! The finals will definitely be kiddie free ;D 
 
 The top 5 teams from the (1st) first qualifications round of smpCTF
Hacker Olympics will move on to 
 the smpCTF Hacker Olympic finals. 1st place team of the first round will
receive a HP mini netbook 
 with BackTrack4. 
 
 In the smpCTF Hacker Olympics finals, the qualifying teams will compete
against each other in a head 
 to head wargame/CTF competition against the other qualifying teams.
