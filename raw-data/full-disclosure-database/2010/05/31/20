Did you even _try_ Google?

   http://www.google.com/search?q=pdf+file+format

has the Wikepedia entry about the file format in first place (and 
includes links to the current version of Adobe's "official" 
documentation of the format and other useful resources), and has the 
"Adobe PDF Developer Center: PDF reference" page as the second result.

Given your inability do such basic Google searches that would find you 
exactly the answer you want, it seems a waste of effort to add links to 
other useful information, generator code that makes "interesting" PDFs, 
and the like, so I won't...
