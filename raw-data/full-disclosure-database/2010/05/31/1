Hi,
So, basically, this new vulnerability lies on spawning an infinite/huge amount of News Reader processes, right ?
Tested (both provided POC links) on Firefox 3.5.8, ended up with unlimited pop-ups from Firefox whining about having no news reader setup - no load generated, at all.
I hope the Firefox and Opera are taking action as this is a major security threat to any IT System.

By the way, I found a similar vunlerability in bash 4.5.1, but this must impact other shells as well !
Here you go:

======= NEW UNIVERSAL SHELL EXPLOIT =======
Discovered by MustDie <mustdie@...tdie.com> http://www.mustdie.com
See http://www.mustdie.com for more infos !

Proof of concept script :
-------[ BEGINNING OF FILE: 1337hax.sh ]---------
#!/bin/bash
#Hardcore vunl in bash, should impact other shells as well !
#By MustDie <mustdie@...tdie.com>
#Don't forget to check out http://www.mustdie.com
#Inspired by MustDie's "researches"
while :; do
	echo "SCALE=1000000000; 4*a(1)" | bc -l&
	echo "0wn3d by 1337 r3s34|2ch3|2"
done
#Check out http://www.mustdie.com
-------[ END OF FILE: 1337hax.sh ]---------

This should bring any system down to its knees !
This is definitely a critical vulnerability in Bash.
One cannot assume that telling bash to compute the first 1000000000 decimals of Pi in an infinite forking loop would result in such a thing - that's weird, unexpected behavior.
a CVE ID was requested for this issue.
