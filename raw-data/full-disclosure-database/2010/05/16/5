Sadly, a bad example: it was ported from Borland, an increasingly fragile and unsupported compiler.  It's also not a .net app, which IMNSHO makes a world of difference to the point being made, but never mind that, you've had your last word.

FTR: David did say some supportive things about RAD and .net.  It's all there in his blog, and I can't be bothered looking for it.  I also note that Pegasus wines reasonably well, so using the header to identify the platform of the sender may mislead you.  It is, alas, a well-rounded GUI mailer that Unix people such as myself rather like compared to the mint-flavoured-wire GUI alternatives.
