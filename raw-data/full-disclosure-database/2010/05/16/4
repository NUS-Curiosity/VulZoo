Subject: Re: Windows' future (reprise)

This just gets better all the time.  I have to admit, it was fun at first, but now's I grow weary, mostly because this is just sad.

For you to actually think that one can't find out how much free drive space in Windows would be funny it were not so ridiculous.  And it's been built into DIR forever.  Oh, and your .bas file is 60,000 some odd bytes, not 1951.  I think you are confusing the size with the last time you actually did research into what you are talking about.

The main point here is for people to see how easy it is for someone who admits that they know nothing about .NET, nor care to learn anything about .NET, to honestly and publically say that people must uninstall it as if it were the plague.  You actually get paid to tell people to uninstall it and use "a .NET connector to PHP" - whatever the hell that is.  Simply amazing to me.

And yet, it's fine for YOU to continue to use a "closed source" operating system to run your "dear Peg" closed source email program because you don't feel like practicing what you preach.   To think that you consider insight into moving a couple of computers over to *nix as the basis to make sweeping generalized statements of how migrating is a one-off cost staggers the imagination.  But, everyone is entitled to their opinion, so good luck with yours dude.   But what you are doing to the poor people who not only trust you but also pay you seems to be quite a disservice indeed.  But that's between you and whatever your ethic is.

So in a nutshell (and I'll drop off after this as I think this has played itself out) you hate closed source and .NET and get paid to tell other people to migrate to non-existent ".NET connector's to PHP" after switching from Windows to BSD, but compose the very email that you so vehemently condemn them on a closed source operating system with a closed source program because you don't have "time to figure out how to use your computer at the same time." (direct quote).  I think I got it.  Thanks for sharing.

Oh, one last thing - your "dear Pegasus" 4.51 Windows-based program that you hypocritically hold on to while demonizing Windows and .NET was...   wait for it....   wait for it....   written with Visual Studio 2008 C++  - a proud Microsoft .NET Framework development platform!

Ladies and Gentlemen, Goodnight!

Well spotted, I am a consultant... I get paid to behave that way!

It was your misquote I corrected, if you call that a backtrack, suit yourself!  I was giving you my working so you could reproduce my numbers... never mind.

Other than how to uninstall it, I have no desire to know anything about it.

Yeah, how crap, it's called df in unix, everyone hates it enormously!
A truly useless tool.  That must be why a df command appeared in Version 1 of AT&T UNIX.  Windows doesn't have something like that, so I made one myself.  You should see the new version, writes to STDOUT, supports multiple drives on one commandline, 1951 bytes of source, 154k uncompressed EXE, beat it if you can....

Amusing, however Pegasus is a perfect example of the difficulty users face when migrating.  As my dear Peg isn't open source, it's one of the reasons this machine still runs Windows (along with Quake, and the tools I have created over years to help me work, and their PowerBasic compiler).  I don't want to be on the phone to a customer and trying to figure out how to use my computer at the same time, so I decided to go slow for now.  I think this is a fair decision.  My servers run unix, it's just this desktop that is left.  I'm not in a big hurry, this machine is nicely optimised.  I'm not looking forward to the day that I have to rewrite all my tools.  I know it will be a total PITA, take ages, introduce bugs and generally cost me a packet.
Unfortunately, long-term, the alternative is even worse.  I am very familiar with the issues faced when migrating, as I have those issues.  Does this surprise you?

If you're claiming Windows is in fact inherently secure, I assume this means you don't use AV on any of your Windows machines, and advise everyone you know to uninstall it?

The very fact that migration is hard, lengthy, and expensive, means that the vulnerability is larger than ever.

This enabled me to predict that the number of new threats in this year's Symantec Threat Report would be 243% of last years; eg. I predicted 9 months ago the number of new threats in this year's Symantec Threat Report would be 243% * 1656227, or 3840485.87.

They will need to take this productivity hit, OR buy a new computer, which will also eventually surcumb to the same increasing slowness.  They will need to buy new machines more and more frequently.  Eventually, they will run out of money - or, for the especially deep-pocketed, they will find they cannot deploy the new machines fast enough, before they are already too slow to use.  The only alternative to this treadmill is to dump Windows.  The sooner it is dumped, the less money is wasted buying new hardware, simply to keep up with security- induced slowness.

People can spend the same time and money replacing Windows, and then they won't need to worry about the problem any more.  The difference is that sticking with Windows incurs ongoing and increasing costs, while a migration incurs a one- off cost.
