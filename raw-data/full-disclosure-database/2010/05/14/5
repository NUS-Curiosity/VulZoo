Dear Marsh,

Personal opinions (hoping not to start a flame war) on your questions:

I do not see the need for CVEs for such "trivial" (easily verifiable)
problems. I find them useful when problems or fixes are reported in
"obscure" software (e.g. in binary-only proprietary distributions), so
as to identify same-known-problem reports.

We each must protect our own cocoons. Saving the world is impossible.

Cheers, Paul
