I reported similar badness in some Intel tools for Linux. Their incident
response has been engaged, but I don't think either of us has requested
a CVE at this point.

Questions for the group:

A. Does anyone think there would be much gained by me requesting (or
insisting on) a CVE number?

B. Does anybody actually care about local escalations any more, or is
everyone just expected to have their very own personal virtual private
cloud for a security boundary?

Thanks,

- Marsh
