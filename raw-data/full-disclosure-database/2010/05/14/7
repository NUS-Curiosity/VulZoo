i am not sure you are eligible enough to get CVE® ID - last time i
checked they  were elitists that allowed only ``certified reporters'' to
contribute to their  (®) portfolio.

anyway why voluntarily contribute to "*®" ?

never saw a kidiot bragging about CVE® IDs.

btw, i am not entirely sure the list of CVE® sponsors is admired much...
