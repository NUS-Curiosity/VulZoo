Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Users can determine the version of the Mediator Framework running on
a device by logging into the device. After a successful login, the
device will display the version of Mediator Framework running on the
device.

The following example identifies a Cisco Network Building Mediator
that is running Mediator Framework version 3.1.1:

    Mediator Operating Environment 3.0.4
    Mediator Framework (tm) 3.1.1
    Copyright  ) 2010 Cisco Systems, Inc.

    Serial number 05-xxxxx

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco Network Building Mediator is a platform that transforms the
way buildings are designed, operated, and experienced.

Cisco Network Building Mediator collects data from sources that
include the building, IT, energy supply, and energy demand systems,
which use different protocols that are otherwise unable to
communicate with one another. The Cisco Network Building Mediator
normalizes the data into a common data representation. This ability
enables the Cisco Network Building Mediator to perform any-to-any
protocol translation and to provide information to the end user in a
uniform presentation.

This security advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities in
the legacy Richards-Zeta Mediator and the Cisco Network Building
Mediator. These vulnerabilities are independent of each other.

Default credentials
+------------------

Default credentials are assigned for several predefined user accounts
on the device including the administrative user account. Any user
with network access to the device can log in as an administrator and
take complete control over the vulnerable device.

  * CSCtb83495 ( registered customers only) has been assigned the CVE
    identifier CVE-2010-0595.

Privilege escalation
+-------------------

Vulnerabilities in this category enable unauthorized users to read
and modify device configuration. A malicious user must authenticate
as an existing user but does not need to have administrator
privileges or know administrator credentials to modify device
configuration. Both vulnerabilities can be exploited over either
transport protocol (HTTP or HTTPS).

Additionally, the vulnerability described by Cisco Bug ID CSCtb83618
( registered customers only) can be used to reload the vulnerable
device. Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a
prolonged denial of service (DoS) condition.

  * CSCtb83607 ( registered customers only) (registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2010-0596.
    This vulnerability could enable any user to read and modify
    device configuration.
  * CSCtb83618 ( registered customers only) has been assigned the CVE
    identifier CVE-2010-0597.
    This vulnerability could enable any user to read and modify
    device configuration using XML RPC protocol. Additionally, this
    vulnerability can be exploited to reload the affected device.

Unauthorized information interception
+------------------------------------

The following vulnerabilities reflect the fact that sessions between
an operator workstation and the Cisco Network Building Mediator are
not protected against unauthorized interception. A malicious user
able to intercept the sessions could learn any credentials used
during intercepted sessions (for administrators and
non-administrators alike) and could subsequently take full control of
the device.

  * CSCtb83631 ( registered customers only) has been assigned CVE
    identifier CVE-2010-0598.
    This vulnerability could allow a malicious user intercepting an
    HTTP session to access to Administrator credentials.
  * CSCtb83505 ( registered customers only) has been assigned CVE
    identifier CVE-2010-0599.
    This vulnerability could allow a malicious user intercepting an
    XML RPC session to access to Administrator credentials.

Unauthorized information access
+------------------------------

A malicious user could read one of the system configuration files.
This configuration file contains user accounts details, including
passwords. Authentication is not required to read this configuration
file and an attacker could perform this attack over either XML RPC or
XML RPC over HTTPS protocol.

  * CSCtb83512 ( registered customers only) has been assigned CVE
    identifier CVE-2010-0600.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of any of these vulnerabilities could result
in a malicious user taking complete control over an affected device.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the software table below names a Mediator Framework
software release. If a given software release is vulnerable, then the
earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the
anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed
in the "First Fixed Release" column of the table. Cisco recommends
upgrading to the latest available release where possible. All
vulnerabilities are fixed in Mediator Framework release 3.1.1 and
above. Mediator Framework release 3.1.1 is the recommended migration
path for all Mediator Framework releases.

Vulnerabilities do not affect Mediator Operating Environment.

+---------------------------------------+
|     Affected     |    First Fixed     |
|     Software     |      Release       |
|     Releases     |                    |
|------------------+--------------------|
| 1.5              | 1.5.1.build.14-eng |
|------------------+--------------------|
| 2.2              | 2.2.1.dev.1        |
|------------------+--------------------|
| 3.0              | 3.0.9.release.1    |
+---------------------------------------+

Fixed 3.1.1 and 3.0.9 Mediator Framework software can be downloaded
from the Software Center on http://www.cisco.com by visiting 
http://www.cisco.com/cisco/psn/web/download/index.html and navigating 
to Physical Security and Building Systems > Smart Connected 
Buildings > Cisco Network Building Mediator.

To obtain fixed 1.5.1 and 2.2 Mediator Framework software and
configTOOL version 3.1.0b1 contact Cisco TAC.

Workarounds
===========

Default credentials
+------------------

Administrator's credentials can be changed using the procedure as
described in Cisco Network Building Mediator User Guide at 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/physical_security/cnbm/User/guide/CNBM__UG.pdf
Details of the procedure are given in the section 2-10 Recovering
the Cisco Network Building Mediator Password.

Privilege escalation
+-------------------

There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities.

Unauthorized information interception
+------------------------------------

The following workaround is applicable only to the vulnerability
related to HTTP protocol. There is no workaround for the
vulnerability that affects XML RPC service.

The workaround for this vulnerability is to disable HTTP service and
use HTTPS instead. The HTTPS service is enabled and running by
default and no further actions are needed to enable it. The HTTP
service can be disabled with configTOOL. The configTOOL is the
software running on the operator workstation and is used to configure
the Multi-Protocol Exchange of the Cisco Network Building Mediator.

After applying this workaround to software releases 1.5.1 and 2.2,
configTOOL version 3.1.0b1 is required to continue configuring Cisco
Network Building Mediator via configTOOL.

To start configTOOL, double-click the Cisco Network Building Mediator
configTOOL shortcut icon on the desktop, or choose Start > All
Programs > Network Building Mediator configTOOL. Connect to a Cisco
Network Building Mediator using the procedure as described in Cisco
Network Building Mediator User Guide at 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/physical_security/cnbm/User/guide/CNBM__UG.pdf
section 3-2 Connecting to the Cisco Network Building Mediator Using
configTOOL. Inside the Node tree pane, expand theservices tab, and
then expand tab the network tab. Click the http_server tab, and then
click the Enabled to uncheck it.

Unauthorized information access
+------------------------------

There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

Mitigation
+---------

The following mitigation can reduce risk from unauthorized access to
the Cisco Network Building Mediator and minimize the risks associated
with the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. This mitigation
is not effective against unauthorized information interception
vulnerabilities as exploitation of these vulnerabilities do not
depend on accessing the device itself, but on intercepting session
between an operator console and the Cisco Network Building Mediator.

Administrators are advised to be selective when choosing the devices
that are allowed to establish connections to the Cisco Network
Building Mediator. The following rules will allow only legitimate
operator console(s) to establish sessions to the Cisco Network
Building Mediator. To execute following commands you must have
Administrator privileges on the Cisco Network Building Mediator. In
the following examples it is assumed that the operator console has IP
address 192.0.2.1. The 192.0.2.1 address must be changed to match the
IP address used by the designated operator console. The following
code must be entered on the console. Please refer to section 2.4 in
the user guide at 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/physical_security/cnbm/User/guide/CNBM__UG.pdf 
for information on how to connect to the serial port using 
hyper-terminal.

    # The following rule establishes a default policy for INPUT rule chain.
    # The default policy is to drop all packets unless they are explicitly
    # permitted by a rule in the INPUT chain
    iptables -P INPUT DROP

    # This rule will allow all traffic from operator console with
    # IP address of 192.0.2.1 to the Cisco NBM
    #
    # Change 192.0.2.1 to match IP address used by your operators console.
    iptables -I INPUT 1 --source 192.0.2.1 -j ACCEPT

    # Repeat the previous command if you have more than one operator console.
    # Increment the number after the "INPUT" keyword for each console you
    # are adding.
    #
    # This command will allow second operator console with IP address
    # of 192.0.2.2 to access the Cisco NBM
    iptables -I INPUT 2 --source 192.0.2.2 -j ACCEPT

When applying rules form the above example care must be taken to
allow access to ports or protocols that are used by sensors and other
devices deployed in the system that are monitored and controlled by
the Cisco Network Building Mediator. Failure to do so will break
connectivity to these sensors and devices.

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory: 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100526-mediator.shtml
