No, storing in Negative Disk, bad sector, stenography, slack space are
all bad places to store data!

In short, Flash memory may require multiple wipes before data is
securely deleted because many of them use uses wear-levelling
algorithm.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory
Because of the particular characteristics of flash memory, it is best
used with either a controller to perform wear-levelling and error
correction or specifically designed flash file systems, which spread
writes over the media and deal with the long erase times of NOR flash
blocks[citation needed]. The basic concept behind flash file systems
is: When the flash store is to be updated, the file system will write
a new copy of the changed data to a fresh block, remap the file
pointers, then erase the old block later when it has time.
