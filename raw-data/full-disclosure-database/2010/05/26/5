Subject: Bypassing Google Chrome 4 Javascript Filter

Bypassing Google Chrome 4 Javascript Filter
===========================================

Google Chrome 4 included a new Javascript Filter which allows users to disallow javascript in websites. This filter doesn´t allow to web sites to execute any Javascript code if the web site is accessed directly.
This protection, can be easily bypassed since it only is applied when the web site is accessed as the main page. This means, if the blocked domain site is used in an iframe object, then the Javascript filter doesn´t block any Javascript code.
