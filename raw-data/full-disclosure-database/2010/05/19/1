Nope, I just plug it into a USB port on a computer and it comes right up.   Did it on 2 Win7 boxes that I’ve never plugged the phone into before and a Win2008R2 box to double check.  The R2 box didn’t automatically install drivers, but it would have worked had I done so…

Truly? Wait, are you going through AFC or some other way? It was my understanding that iPhone internal storage never comes up any other way...

Doesn't lockdownd require that your computer be paired before even going SSL to start services?

Actually, no.  It doesn't have to pair to read and write to internal storage.  You only have access to the pictures dir and other files they may have put on the "external storage" section, but you can plug it into any system that has drivers and access it.
