Subject: Vulnerability in tagcloud for Kasseler CMS

Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about security vulnerability in plugin tagcloud for
Kasseler CMS.

-----------------------------
Advisory: Vulnerability in tagcloud for Kasseler CMS
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/4191/
-----------------------------
Affected product: all versions of tagcloud for Kasseler CMS.
-----------------------------
Timeline:

07.01.2010 - found vulnerability (during researches of vulnerabilities at
gov-sites).
02.05.2010 - found that vulnerable site was using CMS (when visited it).
12.05.2010 - disclosed at my site.
13.05.2010 - informed developers.
-----------------------------
Details:

This is Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

This XSS is similar to XSS vulnerability in WP-Cumulus and other web
applications which I already reported to security mailing lists, because
it's using tagcloud.swf made by author of WP-Cumulus. About millions of
flash files tagcloud.swf which are vulnerable to XSS attacks I mentioned in
my article XSS vulnerabilities in 34 millions flash files
(http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2010-01/msg00035.html).

XSS:

http://site/includes/javascript/tagcloud/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS.

Also it's possible to conduct (like in WP-Cumulus) HTML Injection attack,
including in those flash files which have protection (in flash files or via
WAF) against javascript and vbscript URI in parameter tagcloud.

HTML Injection:

http://site/includes/javascript/tagcloud/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='http://websecurity.com.ua'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E
