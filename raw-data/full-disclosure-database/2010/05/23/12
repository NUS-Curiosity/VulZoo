Subject: Re: denial-of-service vulnerability in the
	Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool

Just to followup on this, what worries me is that as time passes, 
more and more viruses will attack more and more files and/or registry 
keys, resulting in more and more destruction by MRT, and I will need 
to spend more and more time on it, finding solutions to increasingly 
obscure problems, for which there is no documentation anywhere, 
except that generated by forums such as this, fixing things that are 
clearly marked "no user serviceable parts inside" (if the permissions 
on the registry keys are to be a guide).

Something is clearly wrong when a BSOD is actually part of the repair 
process, indicating progress in this case, when I need to subvert WFP 
and other inbuilt security systems to effect the fix, and when a 
cleanup tool from the vendor, which is pushed onto all machines and 
run automatically, makes a problem worse.

The thing that annoys me, is that it's now up to me to either hand my 
customer a large bill, which will compensate me fairly for my time 
but is likely to exceed the cost of a new machine, OR I can take pity 
on him (it's not his fault his machine was infected or subsequently 
trashed by a repair tool) - and this means I need to discount my 
time, so I end up taking the hit.

But it's not my fault either, it's Microsoft's software that has the 
holes in it, and it's Microsoft's tool that trashed it after those 
holes were exploited.  But do you think I will get paid if I invoice 
Microsoft?

So basically someone needs to pay, and it ain't Bill, and if I want 
to keep my customer happy, it ain't my customer either.  That means I 
end up spending my life working for a pittance, cleaning up 
Microsoft's mess and at the same time, trying to explain to my 
customer that while the Windows packaging and advertising is all so 
slick, it's actually the biggest white elephant in the known 
universe, and they should consider migrating to unix, and I know you 
just spent a truckload on some lame-assed .NET dependency, I have 
some very bad news for you, and no, you can't fix it by getting a new 
IT guy, although you won't find that out until you try it, and I know 
it might be easier for you to buy some more sales pitch from the next 
IT guy, and drink the Microsoft Kool-Aid, than to believe me when I 
say that most the world's desktops are running a giant white 
elephant, so I am definitely going to discount my time, and take the 
hit, although I hope you won't mind if I post a couple of your logs 
onto the net, because this is wrong, that I am spending all my time 
for pittance, fixing things that should never have broken, while the 
megacorp responsible shoves the next load of tripe down my customer's 
throats and makes life even more difficult for me in the future.

Then I wonder, what is the long-term solution to this problem?  I 
already asked you this - I note you didn't reply....

Does this help explain things at all?
