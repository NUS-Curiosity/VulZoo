Subject: Testing of systems for searching of viruses at
	web sites

Hello participants of Full-Disclosure!

Some time ago I wrote to WASC mailing list a letter about Testing of systems
for searching of viruses at web sites
(http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2010-05/msg00053.html).

If this topic is interesting for you, feel free to read that my letter.

Best wishes & regards,
