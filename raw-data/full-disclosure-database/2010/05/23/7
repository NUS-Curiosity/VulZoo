Subject: Sample videos for ENG++

Hello, fellows.

Here is the very first sample video demonstranting the exploit  
development methodology I've been working for a while: Exploit Next  
Generation® (ENG++).

Briefly, ENG++ (@ExploitNG / Twitter) is a methodology to create  
dynamic and unexpected ways to do wrong things right! Becase FIVE  
bytes can make the difference!

No, there is no paper describing ENG++ yet... I'm still waiting to  
confirm if my submission will be approved by a security conference, so  
no paper until there.

Till there you can check the reliability of an exploit module ported  
to work with Metasploit Framework:

Here's a little description for this video:

Cheers.

Please, help me to develop the ENG® SQL Fingerprint™ downloading it  
from Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/mssqlfp/) or from  
Sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mssqlfp/).
