PacSec 2010 Conference

   The 8th annual PacSec conference will be held Nov 10/11 2010, at
   Aoyama Diamond Hall in Tokyo, Japan.

PacSec CALL FOR PAPERS

   TOKYO, Japan -- To address the increasing importance of information
   security in Japan, the best known figures in the international
   security industry will get together with leading Japanese researchers
   to share best practices and technology. The most significant new
   discoveries about computer network hack attacks will be presented at
   the eighth annual PacSec conference to be discussed.

   The PacSec meeting provides an opportunity for foreign specialists to
   be exposed to Japanese innovation and markets and collaborate on
   practical solutions to computer security issues. In an informal
   setting with a mixture of material bilingually translated in both
   English and Japanese the eminent technologists can socialize and
   attend training sessions.

   Announcing the opportunity to submit papers for the PacSec 2010
   network security training conference. The conference will be held
   November 10/11th in Tokyo. The conference focuses on emerging
   information security tutorials - it is a bridge between the
   international and Japanese information security technology
   communities..

   Please make your paper proposal submissions before July 30th, 2010.
   Slides for the papers must be submitted for translation by October 1,
   2010 (Which, oh so rarely, happens so we are going to start asking for
   them earlier :-P --dr).

   A some invited papers have been confirmed, but a limited number of
   speaking slots are still available. The conference is responsible for
   travel and accomodations for the speakers. If you have a proposal for
   a tutorial session then please email a synopsis of the material and
   your biography, papers and, speaking background to secwest10 [at]
   pacsec.jp . Tutorials are one hour in length, but with simultaneous
   translation should be approximately 45 minutes in English, or
   Japanese. Only slides will be needed for the October paper deadline,
   full text does not have to be submitted.

   The PacSec conference consists of tutorials on technical details about
   current issues, innovative techniques and best practices in the
   information security realm. The audiences are a multi-national mix of
   professionals involved on a daily basis with security work: security
   product vendors, programmers, security officers, and network
   administrators. We give preference to technical details and education
   for a technical audience.

   The conference itself is a single track series of presentations in a
   lecture theater environment. The presentations offer speakers the
   opportunity to showcase on-going research and collaborate with peers
   while educating and highlighting advancements in security products and
   techniques. The focus is on innovation, tutorials, and education
   instead of product pitches. Some commercial content is tolerated, but
   it needs to be backed up by a technical presenter - either giving a
   valuable tutorial and best practices instruction or detailing
   significant new technology in the products.

   Paper proposals should consist of the following information:

   1) Presenter, and geographical location (country of origin/passport)
   and contact info (e-mail, postal address, phone, fax).
   2) Employer and/or affiliations.
   3) Brief biography, list of publications and papers.
   4) Any significant presentation and educational experience/background.
   5) Topic synopsis, Proposed paper title, and a one paragraph
   description.
   6) Reason why this material is innovative or significant or an
   important tutorial.
   7. Optionally, any samples of prepared material or outlines ready.
   8. Will you have full text available or only slides?
   9. Language of preference for submission.
   10. Please list any other publications or conferences where this
   material has been or will be published/submitted.

   Please include the plain text version of this information in your

   considered for placement on the speaker roster.
