Pick up the pace!
Enemy, show me what you wanna be.
I can handle anything, even if I can't handle you.
Readily, either way it better be.
Don't you fucking pity me.
Get up, get off.
What the hell I'm saying i don't know about malevolent.
Sure as hell decadent.
I want someone to step up step off.
Walls, let me fall, fuck you all.
Get a grip, don't let me slip 'till i drop the ball.

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it.
You're going down this is a war.

FUCK IT!

Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind.
You're leaving me suspect.. I'm leaving you grotesque.
Feels like a burn from which you never learn.
Cause effect you jealous ass.
Press your face against the glass, SUFFER.

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it.
You're going down this is a war.

GO.

I’ve just begun.
It’s about that time, I've gotta get mine.
I’ve just begun.
It’s about that time, I've gotta get mine.
I’ve just begun.
It’s about that time, I've gotta get mine
I’ve just begun.
It’s about that time, I'VE GOTTA GET MINE!

You can't kill me, cause I'm already inside you.
You can't kill me, cause I'm already inside you.
You can't kill me, cause I'm already inside you.
You can't kill me, cause I'm already inside you.
SIC...SIC...SIC...SIC...
