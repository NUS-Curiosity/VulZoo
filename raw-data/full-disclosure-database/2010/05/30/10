Subject: Re: Websense Enterprise 6.3.3 Policy Bypass

The "no logging at all" bit is the clincher.   I don't see how they could go without fixing it in any "current" version of the software.

ISA logging will be turned on by default, but only to the local SQLE instance and only for 7 running days.  That's no mitigating factor at all...  People who purchase Websense are counting on the logging as you said.  That's a big "wow" for me.  From what I've heard we've got lots of .gov's using websense, and logging and reporting are critical, if not legal requirements in many cases. 

Very nice find - and thanks for letting us know.

>>>discovered by mrhinkydink
>>>
>>>PRODUCT: Websense Enterprise v6.3.3
>>>
>>>EXPOSURE: Trivial Web Policy Bypass
>>>
>>>
>>>SYNOPSIS
>>>========
>>>
>>>By adding a "Via:" header to an HTTP request it is possible for a user
>>>to completely bypass filtering and monitoring in a Websense Enterprise
>>>6.3.3/Microsoft ISA Server (2004 or 2006) proxy integration environment.
>>>
>>>
>>>PROOF OF CONCEPT
>>>================
>>>
>>>The following works in a Websense 6.3.3 Enterprise system using the
>>>ISA Server integration product and transparent authentication. It is
>>>assumed it will work with other proxy integration products, but this
>>>has not
>>been tested.
>>>
>>>I. Install Firefox >= 3.5
>>>
>>>II. Obtain and install the Modify Headers plug-in by Gareth Hunt
>>>
>>>III. Configure the plug-in to add a valid "Via:" header to every
>>>request
>>>
>>>Example: "Via: 1.1 VIAPROXY"
>>>
>>>IV. Browse to a filtered Web site
>>>
>>>V. All content is allowed without monitoring
>>>
>>>
>>>PoC VIDEO!
>>>==========
>>>
>>>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H520rQ8JOLY
>>>
>>>
>>>PoC RESTRICTIONS
>>>================
>>>
>>>The Modify Headers plug-in does not work with SSL. However, in
>>>practice a user could browse to a so-called (by Websense) "Proxy
>>>Avoidance" Web site and use the SSL capabilities of the remote proxy.
>>>
>>>
>>>OTHER USES
>>>==========
>>>
>>>Properly configured, a downstream SQUID proxy can send requests to the
>>>upstream ISA server and all requests will pass through without
>>>blocking or monitoring. No evidence of activity will be logged by
>>>Websense. This was in fact how this vulnerability was originally discovered.
>>>Considering the simplicity of the attack, the author suspects this
>>>bypass technique is already well-known in certain circles.
>>>
>>>Also, it is trivial to modify proxy-enabled Linux utilities to
>>>leverage this
>>bypass.
>>>The author has recompiled (that is, HACKED) OpenVPN, connect-proxy,
>>>PuTTY, stunnel, and others to take advantage of this policy bypass.
>>>
>>>Obviously, the risk of undetected (by Websense, at least) covert
>>>tunnels is high in a vulnerable installation of this product.
>>>
>>>Linux platforms using this method in this specific environment will
>>>also enjoy bypassing Websense's transparent authentication requirement.
>>>
>>>
>>>WORK-AROUNDS
>>>============
>>>
>>>For this specific installation scenario (Websense 6.3.3 + ISA 2004/6 +
>>>transparent authentication), none are known. The following may work:
>>>
>>>* Use Windows Integrated Authentication on the ISA Server
>>>
>>>* Upgrade to Websense 7.x
>>>
>>>* Do not use a proxy integration product
>>>
