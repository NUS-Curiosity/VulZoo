I have a feeling his employer will see to that for the foreseeable future.
At least in a professional context representing them as a company.

If he really meant it as everyone that read the original post seemed to take
it, then he should have the balls to stand by what he said or admit he meant
it at the time but was wrong and has since learned different. Either one of
those options would be a mature way of handling the situation. Trying to
spin it as "what I said isn't what I really meant. What I really meant is
something so benign that no one could have a strong opinion about it and it
was really pointless to even blog about." comes across as insincere.

What do I know though, Mr. Haber is the one with the lifetime in the
vulnerability assessment field.
