Subject: Re: 0days for sale

Hello,

Excuse the impersonal nature of this mail, I would like to go into the 
business dealings with you with regard to the "0days" of which you speak.
I am Prince Pe of Entester, and can, with your help, move this valuable 
shipment of sploit into the proper hands. All we need to move forward is 
a small downpayment of $1500 (ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS) to secure firewalls accesses and then I can arrange transfer of 
DNS-SEC and IPv6 to your account in USA.

Yours, in Christ

Prince Pe of Entester (entester.ng)
