Subject: AlienTechnology ALR-9900 default root password
	and backdoor

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Tested:
	www.alientechnology.com/readers/alr9900.php

Background:
	Alien Technology is a major rfid-reader designer and manufacturer.
 Alien's products are sold to many corporations and the military.
Alien's readers can be interfaced with in several ways including:
serial, IO Port and Ethernet port.  Alien has several daemons
running on their reader that accessible through Ethernet and
completely undocumented.  We called Alien several times to ask them
about these undocumented services and were first deferred to
technical support and then had our numbers blocked.  We then
emailed them about the security ramifications of these daemons and
received no reply.

The Undocumented:
	port 2323 - telnetd
	port 23 - telnetd
	port 22 - sshd

The Flaws:
	default root password = 'alien'
	alien account has same password across all readers
	port 2323 - provides a backdoor onto the readers for anyone who
knows the alien (or root) account password
	port 23  - ""
	port 22 - ""

Impact:
	Alien's readers are deployed in many secure facilities with
typically closed networks.  Although these networks are closed,
these undocumented services could allow employees to modify reader
settings and subvert checkout systems.  These checkout systems are
often used to track valuable items making such vulnerabilities a
serious matter. If these readers are deployed on an open or large
network they provide an easy way to tunnel into the network or
attack it from an unexpected location.  Lastly, if someone cracks
the alien account's password hash they get to use Alien's backdoor.
