> So Mr. Watt got 2 years simply because he was aware of the ongoing crimes and did not report them to the authorities?

No.  What he did was the same thing as someone supplying burglar tools
to someone, knowing that they're going to break into someone's house,
then partying with them afterwards with the stolen money.

> Even if he was aware the tool he wrote was being used for illegal activities, releasing it to the public would be a damn good step towards keeping him out of jail.

Where do you get that idea?  Under what legal theory do you postulate
that?  He still knew his software was going to be used by a known
individual, WHO TOLD HIM BEFOREHAND, that he was going to use the
software to rip people off.  That makes him liable, period.

It's not about the software or whether or not he released it to the
public, and no amount of twisting the facts is going to convince a
judge otherwise.
