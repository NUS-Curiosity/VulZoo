So Mr. Watt got 2 years simply because he was aware of the ongoing crimes
and did not report them to the authorities? According to Wikipedia (if I
read it on the Internets, it must be true) "misprision of a felony" requires
active concealment of a felony rather than merely failing to report it. Was
the prosecutor able to prove that The_UT actively concealed Gonzales crimes?


Even if he was aware the tool he wrote was being used for illegal
activities, releasing it to the public would be a damn good step towards
keeping him out of jail. Does Fyodor have to report everyone he's made aware
of that scans something with nmap without having the proper authorization
first?
