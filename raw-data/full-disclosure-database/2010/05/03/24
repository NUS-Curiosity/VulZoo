One has to begin wondering:

A) Why did Gonzales keep logs of incriminating evidence against himself and
his friends in the first place?
B) What motivation did Gonzales have for rolling over on Stephen like that?
Given Stephen's minor involvement in the case, it seems like Gonzales
wouldn't get much by way of a plea deal by turning him in.
C) Another Wired article states that Gonzales was an informer paid an annual
salary by the Secret Service. This revelation apparently was brought to
light by Stephen himself. Did The_UT know this was the case before his
arrest or only after? If he knew these circumstances prior to his arrest
then why would he be willing to create a custom tool for a person he knows
is informing on people?
