Also worth noting that, until yesterday, all SSL pages (including sensitive ones like /oauth/authorize) loaded Javascript from maps.google.com without using SSL.  Like the issue iSEC identified above, this has now been fixed.

Also yesterday, they (finally) disabled unsafe SSL renegotiation, thus blocking the credential-stealing attack identified by Anil Kurmus last November.[1]

So: progress.  Unfortunately, they still support SSLv2 and a variety of weak ciphers[2] — so there's still room for improvement.
