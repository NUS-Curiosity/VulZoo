Subject: Re: go public to avoid jail

I can see that you have no experience with the legal system other than
what you've seen on TV (which is, to say, none at all).  If you read
the IRC logs presented by the prosecution, it is pretty clear what the
motive was.  Your "release it to the public and you have no liability"
argument will land you in prison if you try it - go to any attorney
and ask.  Your emotional "prove Stephen is a saint" attempt at
twisting what happens in the legal system doesn't change the FACT that
the burden of proof was easily met by the prosecution and that the
defense's arguments, while designed to sway people more used to
emotional appeals than logic, did little to impress the court, with
very predictable results.
