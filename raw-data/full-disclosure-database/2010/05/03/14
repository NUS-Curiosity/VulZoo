If your knife is found in a dead body, you've going to have some
explaining to do.

If it turns out that you're a restaurant supply business that sells 3000
of that model knife a week, then you don't have a problem.

If your buddy comes to you and says "I'm going to go stab some people
and take their money will you construct for me a custom knife
particularly well-suited for that purpose" and you say "sure, here you
go, heh, no charge this time" and this conversation is recorded as
evidence then both of you are going to get prosecuted.

No one (seriously, no one) is going to be the least bit impressed by the
"factories sell knives all the time" argument. The point is that you
knew this specific knife was intended to be used in for this purpose and
you decided to go out of your way to help.

Hacking/pen-test tools can definitely push the gray area a bit, but the
custom-knife-in-dead-body example does not.
