In the United States the burden of proof is on the prosecution, not the
defense. Stephen was innocent until proven guilty.

I'm suggesting Stephen could have released his tool to the public so anyone
authorized to audit cardholder data environments could have used it.

If the tool was released publicly, and not just to Mr. Gonzales, would the
prosecution be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that this scenario
took place and not just that Mr. Gonzales used a publicly available tool his
friend happened to have created and distributed publicly, to commit his
crimes?

Common sense

Could the prosecution prove this is the case if the tool wasn't distributed
only to Gonzales? Releasing the tool publicly could help the defense argue
the point that he was told beforehand, that he knew it would be used to rip
people off, etc.

 The defense doesn't need to convince the judge that Stephen is a saint,
only needs to weaken the prosecutions argument enough.

Could they prove his buddy came to him and said "I'm going to commit crime X
will you provide me with tool Y to do it?" Since the tool was made and
distributed only to Gonzales it was probably pretty difficult to argue the
above scenario did  not occur. If the tool was released publicly and
Gonzales went and downloaded it from PacketStorm along with a thousand other
people that day, proving the above scenario occurred could be more
challenging.

The point is that you

If the tool was released publicly, how much more difficult would it have
been for the prosecution to prove that you knew the tool was intended to be
used for a particular illegal purpose in a specific case and you went out of
your way to help?
