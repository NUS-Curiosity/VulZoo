Subject: Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Mango

Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about security vulnerability in Mango.

-----------------------------
Advisory: Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Mango
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/3949/
-----------------------------
Affected product: Mango 1.4.1 and previous versions.
-----------------------------
Timeline:

05.07.2009 - found vulnerability.
02.02.2010 - developers released Mango 1.4.2 (as I found at 15.02.2010).
13.02.2010 - announced at my site.
15.02.2010 - informed developers. It's one example, when my approach to
announce and disclose vulnerabilities in chronological order leads to that
situation, when I announced vulnerability (which I found earlier) and found
that developers already fixed it. But it's still rare case.
30.04.2010 - disclosed at my site.
-----------------------------
Details:

This is Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
