ok, i know i am a writer not a reader (like a narcisist chukcha is ;) )

can you recommend reading about malware that belongs to a class of malware "the existence of which provably cannot be proved within <current technology> ... if one assumes <current technology> itself is consistent> [1]"

the disclosed idea of backdooring the compiler doesn't count, because currently people are *examining* compilers (well, assuming they can do it).

did someone {\TeX , .pdf } producer managed to represent in text some _abstract??_ backdooring that is undetectable with current plausible budgets (as in "god can backdoor all of your bases" or "it may be possible to screw the electric field in exploitable way in any circumstances" ) ?
