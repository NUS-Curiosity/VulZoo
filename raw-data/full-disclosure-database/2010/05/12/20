- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco PGW 2200 Softswitch
series of products. Each vulnerability described in this advisory is
independent from other. The vulnerabilities are related to processing
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or Media Gateway Control Protocol
(MGCP) messages.

Successful exploitation of all but one of these vulnerabilities can
crash the affected device. Exploitation of the remaining
vulnerability will not crash the affected device, but it can lead to
a denial-of-service (DoS) condition in which no new TCP-based
connections will be accepted or created.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that mitigate these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

SIP is a popular signaling protocol used to manage voice and video
calls across IP networks such as the Internet. SIP is responsible for
handling all aspects of call setup and termination. Voice and video
are the most popular types of sessions that SIP handles, but the
protocol is flexible to accommodate for other applications that
require call setup and termination. SIP call signaling can use UDP
(port 5060), TCP (port 5060), or Transport Layer Security (TLS; TCP
port 5061) as the underlying transport protocol.

MGCP is the protocol for controlling telephony gateways from external
call control elements known as media gateway controllers or call
agents. A telephony gateway is a network element that provides
conversion between the audio signals carried on telephone circuits
and data packets carried over the Internet or other packet networks.

Multiple DoS vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco PGW 2200 Softswitch
SIP implementation, and one vulnerability is in the MGCP
implementation.

The following vulnerabilities can cause affected devices to crash:

  * CSCsl39126 (registered customers only), CVE ID CVE-2010-0601
  * CSCsk32606 (registered customers only), CVE ID CVE-2010-0602
  * CSCsk40030 (registered customers only), CVE ID CVE-2010-0603
  * CSCsk38165 (registered customers only), CVE ID CVE-2010-0604
  * CSCsk44115 (registered customers only), CVE ID CVE-2010-1561
  * CSCsj98521 (registered customers only), CVE ID CVE-2010-1562
  * CSCsk04588 (registered customers only), CVE ID CVE-2010-1563
  * CSCsz13590 (registered customers only), CVE ID CVE-2010-1567

The following vulnerability may cause an affected device to be unable
to accept or create a new TCP connection. Existing calls will not be
terminated, but no new SIP connections will be established. If
exploited, this vulnerability will also prevent the device from
establishing any new HTTP, SSH or Telnet sessions.

  * CSCsk13561 (registered customers only), CVE ID CVE-2010-1565

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this security advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of all but one vulnerability in this advisory
can crash the affected device. The remaining vulnerability will not
crash the affected device, but it can lead to a DoS condition in
which no new TCP-based connections will be accepted or created.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

All vulnerabilities listed in this Security Advisory are addressed in
Cisco PGW 2200 Softswitch version 9.7(3)S11, version 9.8(1)S5, and
subsequent, software releases.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities in this advisory.

In the case of the vulnerability that corresponds to Cisco Bug ID
CSCsk13561, administrator must manually reboot the affected device to
restore the device's ability to accept new connections. Because
vulnerability prevents new TCP-based session to be created, this
reboot can be initiated only from the console. If a failover device
is configured, existing sessions will continue while the affected
device is reloading. Without a failover device, all active sessions
will be terminated while the affected device is reloading.

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory: 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100512-pgw.shtml
