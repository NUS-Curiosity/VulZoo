Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 05.11.10: Abobe
 Shockwave Player Heap Memory Indexing Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 05.11.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 11, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Shockwave Player is a popular Web browser plugin. It is available
for multiple Web browsers and platforms, including Windows, and MacOS.
Shockwave Player enables Web browsers to display rich multimedia
content in the form of Shockwave videos. For more information, see the
vendor's site found at the following link:<BR> <BR>
http://get.adobe.com/shockwave

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap memory indexing vulnerability in Adobe
Systems Inc.'s Shockwave Player could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. <BR> <BR> The
vulnerability takes place during the processing of a certain malformed
file. A function calculates an offset to be used within a memory mapped
file and returns the offset value. The return value is not checked. This
can lead to a condition where an attacker is able to overwrite memory
outside the bounds of the allocated memory map.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the Web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious file created
by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via social
engineering or injecting content into a compromised, trusted site. <BR>
<BR> Adobe Shockwave Player implements a custom memory management system
for object allocation. Due to the design of the memory allocator, an
attacker is able to predict the distance of objects within a memory
map. This condition can help facilitate reliable exploitation of this
vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the latest
version of Shockwave Player at the time of testing, version 11.5.6r606.
Shockwave Player 11.5.6.606 and earlier versions for Windows and
Macintosh are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

The killbit for the Shockwave Player ActiveX control can be set by
creating the following registry key:<BR> <BR>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX
Compatibility\{233C1507-6A77-46A4-9443-F871F945D258} Under this key
create a new DWORD value called "Compatibility Flags" and set its
hexadecimal value to 400. <BR> <BR> To re-enable Shockwave Player set
the "Compatibility Flags" value to 0.
