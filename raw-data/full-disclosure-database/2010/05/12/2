Ghostscript is an important part of most Linux systems out there. If
you remove Ghostscript, you remove the ability to print in most cases.

The advice to avoid opening unknown PS files is good. I wonder whether
a similar flaw exists in Ghostscript's handling of PDF files. If such
an attack is possible with a PDF, the flaw is potentially much more
serious.
