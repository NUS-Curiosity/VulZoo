Rest of article actually looks good at first glance, but this jumped out at me:

There is zero evidence that anybody is able to recover data after even a
single overwrite of /dev/zero on a disk drive made this century.  Even in
the MFM days, Gutmann's recovery technique was difficult - today's densities
render it essentially impossible.  Even if it's possible, if your threat model
includes the sort of organizations that could theoretically do it, maybe you
should be considering thermite rather than software wipes.  Especially if
they're pounding on your door. ;)

I'm more than open to hear of any *confirmed* cases of data recovered after
even a single overwrite anytime after 1995.  To date, I have not seen one.
Prove me wrong, guys. ;)
