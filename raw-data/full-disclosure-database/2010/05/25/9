I wrote a small tutorial on something related. This doesnt reflect

Web Browsers Leave 'Fingerprints' Behind as You Surf the Net
EFF Research Shows More Than 8 in 10 Browsers Have Unique, Trackable Signatures

San Francisco - New research by the Electronic Frontier Foundation
(EFF) has found that an overwhelming majority of web browsers have
unique signatures -- creating identifiable "fingerprints" that could
be used to track you as you surf the Internet.

The findings were the result of an experiment EFF conducted with
volunteers who visited http://panopticlick.eff.org/ . The website
anonymously logged the configuration and version information from each
participant's operating system, browser, and browser plug-ins --
information that websites routinely access each time you visit -- and
compared that information to a database of configurations collected
from almost a million other visitors. EFF found that 84% of the
configuration combinations were unique and identifiable, creating
unique and identifiable browser "fingerprints." Browsers with Adobe
Flash or Java plug-ins installed were 94% unique and trackable.

"We took measures to keep participants in our experiment anonymous,
but most sites don't do that," said EFF Senior Staff Technologist
Peter Eckersley. "In fact, several companies are already selling
products that claim to use browser fingerprinting to help websites
identify users and their online activities. This experiment is an
important reality check, showing just how powerful these tracking
mechanisms are."

EFF found that some browsers were less likely to contain unique
configurations, including those that block JavaScript, and some
browser plug-ins may be able to be configured to limit the information
your browser shares with the websites you visit. But overall, it is
very difficult to reconfigure your browser to make it less
identifiable. The best solution for web users may be to insist that
new privacy protections be built into the browsers themselves.

"Browser fingerprinting is a powerful technique, and fingerprints must
be considered alongside cookies and IP addresses when we discuss web
privacy and user trackability," said Eckersley. "We hope that browser
developers will work to reduce these privacy risks in future versions
of their code."

EFF's paper on Panopticlick will be formally presented at the Privacy
Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2010) in Berlin in July.

_____________________
In other news, DARPA looks for stealthier Internet access
http://gcn.com/articles/2010/05/21/darpa-safer-solicitation.aspx

In particular, DARPA is interested in technologies that “allow
anonymous Internet communications to bypass techniques that suppress,
localize and/or corrupt information.”

The technologies the Defense Department is interested in circumventing
include IP-address filtering or "blocking," which can deny user
access; Domain Naming Service hijacking, which redirects a user to a
different Web site or service from what the user intended; and content
filtering, which captures and analyzes the content of the user's
network traffic through deep packet inspection.

The Safer Warfighter Communications (SAFER) program (DARPA-BAA-10-69)
covers applications such as instant messaging, electronic mail, social
networking, streaming video, voice over IP and video conferencing.
DARPA’s particular technical areas of interest include measurement,
circumvention and testbed and evaluation support.

However, these same tools could also be used by “those determined to
get around measures designed to thwart copyright violators and
extreme-porn aficionados,” wrote Lewis Page in a story posted by U.K.
publication The Register.

 Some software in the OSS that are Rugged/Modular Designs.

Applications like Sumatra PDF Reader (
http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf ), multi messenger
clients like www.pidgin.im, www.miranda-im.org,
www.FreeDownloadManager.org as download manager, www.OpenOffice.org,
to handle office documents, should be run inside a VM whenever
possible. Questionable documents from third party should be opened as
google cache (If publically accessible web document, Syntax "cache:
http://example.com/example1.pdf ", or mailed to yourself in the gmail
and viewed as html or in google docs)

Documents from Multiple file formats can be converted and viewed
online from just browser. Like google on "Online PDF to HTML
Conversion". Even, Audio and video file from untrusted source can be
equally dangerous. You can normalize such attack by first uploading
such audio, video or document files on an intermediate service
providers for online file format conversion. They provide free
services to convert say flv encoded received information to .wmv
output and viewed as wmv instead. There are plenty of web services
that provide such facility. The output file wmv should be opened
instead of the original flv. Files received from third untrusted party
should only be opened after such normalization to migrate attack
vectors.


www.clamwin.com anti-virus (very buggy) as manual av scanner,
www.7-zip.org to handle archive are also nice tools.


IMPORTANT: When you are done with "experiments" and have settled on a
preference. Create a checklist of your knowledge and start a CLEAN
configured installations of your OS.

A free open source disk imager
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronis_True_Image
http://odin-win.sourceforge.net/

How many hours did you spend in setting up your Windows system?
Setting up the operating system, installing programs, customizing to
your personal needs. Do you want to be protected against hard disk
failures, viruses or other malware? Just restore your system within
minutes. Why spend money for a commercial solution? ODIN supports
snapshots can be run from command line or with a GUI and runs on
32-Bit and 46-Bit operating systems.

(Latter, when you restore the image run one time update on all
software and installation modules from previous backup to assure
latest protection via manual automatic updates. )

Geotagging invades Privacy (Flickr, Twitter, Facebook, Pisica all bad ):
www.aguntherphotography.com/geotagging-invades-privacy.html
The prices for GPS receivers have eroded. Even my iPhone has one
already built in. It takes photographs and automatically attaches GPS
data. Jobo and other accessory makers have developed GPS receivers
that record a location every time you press the shutter release button
on your camera, allowing you to combine them later on your PC. For
several years, I used to carry a small Garmin GPS, recording track
logs and using programs like JetPhoto Studio, Google gpicsync or
Microsoft Location Stamper to put the GPS data into my digital files.
Geotagging is now a mainstream technology and is more popular than
ever.

The tool also has basic support for some movie formats - AVI and
QuickTime/JPEG, as recorded by some older digital cameras. The tool

reDuh - TCP Redirection over HTTP
www.sensepost.com/labs/tools/pentest/reduh
reDuh is actually a tool that can be used to create a TCP circuit
through validly formed HTTP requests. Essentially this means that if
we can upload a JSP/PHP/ASP page on a server, we can connect to hosts
behind that server trivially.

...

In 1992 as a quick hack, I happened to demonstrate that you can send
TCP packets with bad checksums (subtract 1), which provides a
near-invisible "covert channel" that penetrates everywhere with very
low probability of detection or interception.  This channel is still
wide open, and a far better channel than stego-over-VoIP for the same
target devices.
