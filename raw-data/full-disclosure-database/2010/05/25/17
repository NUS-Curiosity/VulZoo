My point is that even if the drive *wasn't* encrypted, a single-pass overwrite
is sufficient to render it unrecoverable.

It's actually not that hard, as long as you actually know how many gauss
you *really* need to wipe a device (inside surface, near axis, of multi-platter
devices is a particular gotcha).

It's not worth worrying about wiping the remapped sectors on a disk - even an
older 40G drive has some 80 million sectors on it - so even if you have a few
hundred sectors that have remapped due to I/O errors, it's still literally
a one-in-a-million shot that anything incriminating is in the sector.  Plus
it's a *bad* sector, so reading and recovering the data is a bitch...
