Anyway, the webservices will be always exposed to the world, so anyone can 
find it's wsdl to see the exposed functionanilities and call them, willn't?

As JS is a scripting languaje, the client will always have the code, as far as 
I know. Ofuscating it will not solve the problem but mitigate it.
Maybe WS-Security will help you, google for it.
