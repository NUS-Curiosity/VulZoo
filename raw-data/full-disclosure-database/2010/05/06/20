Hash: SHA1

If his users are authenticated via say regular form login, he can
pass some sort of hash which identifies the user and session to the
service, with the authentication wrapper being server side, which
begs the question, do you trust your users...

How would such a firewall work/help anyway? It still has to make
some sort of authorization decision, and if the services in
question are not called by pages that are login protected, your
back to square one. How do you pass some sort of 'I know this is
the page calling me and not the attacker' without the client seeing
that too?
