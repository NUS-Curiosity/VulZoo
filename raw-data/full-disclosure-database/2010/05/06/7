If the details have to be in the JS (really?) then accept that they 
have to be exposed to all and sundry and design to that constraint 
(which may mean deciding that you really don't want to drink the web 
2.0 Kool-Aid after all...).

There are all manner of weaselly described/advertised code "encryptors" 
and such, which are really just obfuscators.  If the code has to run in 
the (JS interpreter of the) client browser, it is necessarily available 
to any marginally competent "attacker" (or even me).  Anyone motivated 
enough (and that will not have to be terribly motivated) will be able 
to untangle the results of such and then try to make sense of the 
remaining representation of your code.
