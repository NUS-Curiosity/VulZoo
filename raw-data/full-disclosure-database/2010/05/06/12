A perfect example of what doesn't work.

Setting up a secure site is too hard, what to do?! Last I heard,
millions of sites had succeeded in setting up SSL.

Ok, what good is it then?

Adversary simply modifies your page in transit to not use the
'jcryption', or to leak him a copy of the session key.

This kind of thing will only deter people who don't know any better or
people with little motivation to care about your data anyway. Using it
is only an admission that you are either incompetent or don't have
anything worth the slightest effort to steal.
