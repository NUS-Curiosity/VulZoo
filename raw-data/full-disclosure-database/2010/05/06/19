Subject: Re: JavaScript exploits via source code disclosure

A proxy or 'web-service firewall' prior to the 'protected' web service is
the correct answer.

Obfuscating the client code be it JavaScript, Interpreted (Java, CLR, etc)
or Native ignores the notion that the client controls hardware, OS, the
executing process and the network.

Signals can be intercepted at any layer.

Any other assertion is ridiculous and a waste of time and effort.
