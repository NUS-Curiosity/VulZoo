I thought Georgi asked for the newest class of elite vulns?

Does (at least) ten years old count as new?

   http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-072.mspx

And against Win9x count as elite?   8-)

FWIW, MS00-072 was fairly widely exploited in the wild by at least the 
Opaserv (aka Opasoft) family of worms, though not until a couple (?) of 
years after the bulletin's release.
