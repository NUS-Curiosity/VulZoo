Ooh, SMB's old Hollywood OS bug -- one character at a time attacks.  
Indeed, this is very old.  It's actually an annoying pattern, that  
things we think are attack multipliers ('you have to simultaneously  
attack MD5 and SHA1') turn out to just be adders (you can attack one  
at a time).

This bug class is different, and as far as I know unseen from the 80's  
and 90's. In this one, you tell the remote system, 'sure, I can match  
your stored hash -- but it's only one byte long.'. So you try an  
average of 128 passwords, and off you go.

It's basically a problem where the client is trusted to provide  
excessive metadata about server state. If you've got other examples in  
this family, it'd be cool to hear them.

(The TLS reneg bug was super cool but client/server confusion of  
identical protocol messages has precedent, I'm sure.)
