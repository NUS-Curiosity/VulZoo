Subject: Re: Drupal Context Module XSS

It's an interesting question.  Drupal has many different privileges that
include the word 'administer' but Drupal security considers a handful of
them to be so powerful that vulnerabilities requiring those privileges
are not considered vulnerabilities (zen moment: when is a vuln not a
vuln?) (Ref: http://drupal.org/node/475848).  I always conceived of
Drupal as a multi-user system that delegated privilege.  However, if
every privilege could lead to full system access then there really isn't
any point in subdividing privilege.  On a small site with only a couple
of admins (like a personal blog) this isn't really an issue.  When the
problem happens to be on an enterprise system then it is probably more
of an issue.  Although labeled as XSS, many of the vulnerabilities I
find in Drupal could probably be more accurately defined as "privilege
escalation via XSS" vulnerabilities.  If you're the only admin then it
doesn't matter, but if any of the 30 "editor" accounts can be used to
escalate to admin and write arbitrary PHP then you've got big problems.
