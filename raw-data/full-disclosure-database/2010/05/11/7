Subject: Re: Drupal Context Module XSS

No, there are various types of admin privileges, such as admin bloocks, admin views, andmin content types and admin users.  On large sites it is common to divide up these privileges to various user groups.  Some are more powerful than others.  Admin blocks is generally used for layout and is not considered as powerful as, say, admin users.  XSS is particularly dangerous in Drupal because it can be used to launch XSRF that bypasses Drupals XSRF defenses.  Using XSS you can silently reset the super user password (which has all privs including the ability to craft PHP).  So, you could use XSS to attack site users or site admins.
