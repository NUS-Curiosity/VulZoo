No, I'm not worried about being sued, I'm worried about my revenue 
streams disappearing.

Not at all - my customer is fully aware that I know nothing about 
their software.  They got sick of me giving them my disclaimer.  They 
are happy for me to work on it because otherwise, they need to pay a 
large amount in annual support fees, to the company who wrote the 
software.

Small print is always good.  Also, some systems need to be more 
secure than others.  For public servers, I outsource to another 
outsourcer.

I am pushing my customer to re-sign the service contract with the 
developers of the product.  They don't want to spend the money.  
There's politics too - the guy who made the purchasing decision 
doesn't want to admit it was a mistake, so he is pretending there are 
no problems with the software, and therefore there is no need to pay 
for the service contract (or so goes his logic).

It'd make an excellent case study for someone...

Thanks.  I don't have access to the source, however, so I doubt 
there's anything that can be done.  This app, even the error messages 
are encrypted!  (is that some .NET wheeze? lovely....)  So it can be 
quite touch and go. But it still costs them less than their annual 
support contract would.
