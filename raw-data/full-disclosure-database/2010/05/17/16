Indeed.

Although 243% of 5% will get quite large quite soon too.  I think it 
might be less than that right now - 2% maybe.  The problem is really 
that even 0.5% will turn into 42.36% after 5 years, at 243% growth.  
(I have triple checked that, I'm certain it's right, that's 
outrageous, it's because it's an exponential curve, gets steep 
quickly).

(It will be 243% of 5%, divided by the efficiency ratio you mentioned 
earlier.  That ratio is critical.  The smaller it is, the less it 
holds back the 243%.)

My interpretation of risk assessment tells me that if the chances of 
denial-of-service due to malware flooding is small, but the potential 
damage is substantial, despite the improbability, then that risk must 
be mitigated.

I do understand that additional "new threats" (as defined by 
Symantec) may, or may not, impact on CPU due to the efficiency ratio 
you explained earlier.

It's not possible to accurately quantify the risk until key numbers, 
such as the average CPU usage per detection rule, and the average 
efficiency ratio, are known.  What we can say right now is that there 
is a risk, of size unknown, that malware flooding will result in DOS 
conditions.

We cannot say how big the risk is yet.  But also, we cannot say that 
it does not exist.

As numbers such as average CPU usage per detection rule, and the 
average efficiency ratio, are likely to be commercial secrets, that 
will mean we will be forced to navigate blind.  This heightens the 
risk and thus the level of mitigation that is required.  That is why 
my advice remains to evacuate the platform.
