Subject: iPhone data protection flaw

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello,

I've recently upgraded to Ubuntu Lucid Lynx (10.04 LTS) and been
surprised by the iPhone 3GS (3.1.3 - 7E18) mounting behavior:

Fully switch off the iPhone 3GS and then connect it to the Lucid Lynx PC
via USB, the phone turns on and will be automatically mounted without
any authentication challenge (PIN), allowing read/write access to your
various local data, e.g. purchases, DCIM, Downloads, Photos, Recordings etc.

Obviously there are other flaws discovered, see [1] which might be even
worse depending on your security policy and requirements.

Can people confirm same behavior with other iPhone models and OS's ?

Cheers Bernd
