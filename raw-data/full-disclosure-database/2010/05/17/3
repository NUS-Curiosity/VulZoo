It is mutating at approx 243% per annum, a rate which is more than 
twice as fast as Moore's Law (200% every 24 months).  I do find this 
alarming, because I want my CPU back.  So does everyone else I know.

Did you ever try and use your computer when it was doing a virus 
scan?  That's much more than a droplet of CPU that you are missing.

Nice.  That would improve things I think (assuming the patch does in 
fact make the machine invulnerable to the malware that it can no 
longer detect).

I'm not analysing infections, I'm analysing "new threats" (as defined 
by Symantec).  

However if I was analysing infections, I'd call you an outlier 
(anomaly), and exclude you from my computation.  You would be one of 
the few.  Impressive though.
