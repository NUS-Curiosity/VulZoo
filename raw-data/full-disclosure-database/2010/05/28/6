If he thinks security is boring problem solved by installing the latest plug-in appliance, I see he has two options:

1. Publicly issue a "hack me" challenge listing the names of his employers/clients. Extend a big middle finger to some organized international groups. That might make his job more interesting for a while.

- or -

B. Step aside and let somebody with energy and imagination have a turn.
