There are far more educated eyes able to review the Linux source code
than the Windows source code. The uneducated people reviewing it don't
seem to be hurting anything while the educated people reviewing it are
helping a lot if all of the patches I see coming in every day are any
measure.

Well...has it ever? I've been running it on a day to day basis on my
desktop since 1994 and have never once gotten a virus. I have been
active in the community since then and I have never met anyone who got
one. So...
