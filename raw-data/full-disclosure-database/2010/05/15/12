Subject: Re: Windows' future (reprise)

And what of the pass the hash group of attacks, not to mention the  
insecure hashing to begin with? Combine that with token manipulation  
and process migration and you have a very deadly combination to almost  
any windows network that you don't see anywhere else. Exploiting  
windows networks in this way is trivial at best, and is built in to  
the operating system as a set of 'features'.

That's not to say the *nix platform doesn't have it's own security  
problems, but at least they're a.) dealt with in a more timely manner,  
and b.) easily analyzed by anyone. Even if 99/100 people that looks at  
it is 'uneducated' as you put it i'd rather have the one set of eyes  
on it going 'hey this needs to be fixed' and educating eveyone else on  
how to manage it, a la the Debian PRNG SSH bug a couple years ago.  
Imagine how that wouldve gone if Microsoft had dealt with a similar  
issue.

Having said that I have to say even though some people may not find  
Stuart's research interesting, he's simply trying to report his  
findings. He's doing this to help paint a picture of security in the  
state it's ACTUALLY in, and try to predict where it's progressing to.

Everything in nature can be modeled with mathematics, why not threat  
trends?
