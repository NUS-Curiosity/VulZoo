I agree that the post is a bit pompous...however:

But...it is true that nothing Microsoft (or anyone, perhaps) makes is
secure. And given that Microsoft has a decades long history of far
worse than industry average security I think it is pretty reasonable
to surmise that Windows will never be secure.

We migrated. With only a one off cost. Been a few years now. Business
is looking good.

> Obvious "predictions," ignorant assumptions, and a total lack of any true understanding of business computing.  Yep, "troll."

Trollish but not entirely wrong.
