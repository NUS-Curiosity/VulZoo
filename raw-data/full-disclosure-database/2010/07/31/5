*yawn* Yet another provider trying to monetize DNS service by directing typo'ed
and expired addresses to a webserver to serve up ads and so on.  Quite frankly,
this only scores about a 2.3 on the Richter Scale of Internet Outrage, because
it only affects OpenDNS customers.  You want *real* fun, go and look up what
happened back in 2003 when Verisign put in a wildcard for *.com. For
*everybody*.  No matter what DNS they pointed at.  Yee. Hah.
