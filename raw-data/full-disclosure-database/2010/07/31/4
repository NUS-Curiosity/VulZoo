Subject: Re: OpenDNS is acting improperly !!!

NXDOMAIN manipulation is an old concern. I believe it's being redirected for
a long time now, but they allow registered users to opt-out, afaik. And
there are many ISPs practicing this.

Additionally, if they're only manipulating A and AAAA records for NXDOMAIN
responses, there should be no problem for an application that relies on
existing domains. SERVFAIL must NOT be manipulated though.

Why are you using ping? Use nslookup and/or dig.

Here's a patch for BIND that allows you to BLACKLIST the IP addresses of the
fake servers - http://sam.zoy.org/writings/internet/verisign/

And here's a draft on this matter -
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-livingood-dns-redirect-00

Concluding, I'm not defending their approach - I don't like it too ;-)
