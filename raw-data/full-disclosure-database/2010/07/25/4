Subject: Is it too late for nominations for Pwnie awards?

Got a contender for "Most Epic FAIL" courtesy of n3td3v:

"I nominated Tavis Ormandy for "Most Epic FAIL" but it didn't get
shortlisted, probably because Pwnie awards is biased because all of
the judges carry out the same questionable activity as he does."
