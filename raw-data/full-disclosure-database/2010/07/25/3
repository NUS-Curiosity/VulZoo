So... no one is doing revocation checking and expiration is evil.
How are we supposed to get rid of invalid certificates?

Let me paraphrase one famous sentence: security should be made as
convenient as possible but not more convenient.

No. See RFC 3280 Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure, section
4.2.1.11 Name Constraints. Any PKIX-compliant application must recognize
this extension.

"We blew" it in the sense that X.509 is designed for a strictly
hierarchical bureaucratic environment, not for an open world where
commercial CAs are supposed to compete within a shared namespace.

Your model organization has to go through the following six steps to 
replace every individual expiring certificate:

yet it allows large-scale deployment of patches without any meetings,
planning, testing, and validation? You must be kidding.

You should decide whether you want to blame X.509 itself or a 
particular way it is used.

When you fail to pay your electric bill every month, they will cut
your power supply. All your computers will stop working. Is it a 
"genuinely unique operational hazard" too? ;)
