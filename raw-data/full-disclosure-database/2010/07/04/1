what is needed is preparedness and rapid repair. the science and
technicalities of critical infrastructure protection are clear. you
won't survive with top down prescriptive remedies.

resilience as emergent property of preparedness in process and
property is the only rational approach. this implies forethought and
competence, which is sorely lacking in any technical endeavor
involving the public gamut.

a million Sarah Palins with "cyberweapons" to protect the populace?
i'd like some of what you're smoking!

so pardoned.


P.S. it is left as an exercise for the reader to observe how the
fragile, high degree nodes and paths in our communications, energy,
transportation, and other critical infrastructure is an economic
trade-off of necessity. modest robustness against random, intermittent
(natural) failures are entirely incapable of defending against
intelligent, targeted attack. no matter how far you over engineer
redundancy and fail safe, a targeted attack can leverage the inherent
weaknesses in large scale systems to their advantage by orders of
magnitude. the math doesn't lie...

P.P.S. the "War in the fifth domain" article at least touches on these
realities, while the "Cyberwar" leader is utter trash. way to fail
with flair, Economist!
