If the DoS is volumetric in nature - i.e., causing lots of packets to be punted to the RP, thus overwhelming the processing of the device and causing it to drop control-plane traffic - that's not a vulnerability, in the classic sense (i.e., a code-based exploit of some kind), especially given that it can be mitigated via BCPs.  

Otherwise, you'd classify any and all DDoS as vulnerabilities, too - and while many of them are in fact *architectural* or *design* flaws, they're still not vulnerabilities in the sense that most of the people on this list use the term.

Having spent a great deal of time concentrating on the 'A' part of the C-I-A triad, I agree with you 100% that A is as important (more important, in my estimation) than the other legs of the triad; but running around claiming that there's some 'vulnerability' which must be patched, when a) we don't know that for a fact, b) it seems rather unlikely, given past experience and the symptoms reported, and c) exhibiting some bizarre antipathy towards implementing industry BCPs doesn't really help, very much.
