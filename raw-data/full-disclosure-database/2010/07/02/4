One question is whether or not the network in question *should* have full access to the management plane of the routers.

Sure, but also note that CoPP, HWRL, and the like can help, depending upon the platform.

Don't get me wrong; this should be investigated further, and PSIRT are on it.  My point is that folks don't need to go into panic mode, but should educate themselves as to how to defend their network infrastructure against attack and then deploy the relevant BCPs.
