	One environment that I've noticed this is 'acceptable',  in the
eyes of the network management,  is VoIP installations.   I've done
assessments in several large scale,  production level VoIP installations
and in many cases,  you'll run into the same potential DoS when using
tools like nmap.   I've noticed that even if the orginazation has a 
very capable security staff,  in many cases,  they don't get to touch
the VoIP network due to it's 'magical' properties (IMHO).   I won't
even go into the obvious lack of security practices (no IDS/IPS,  very
out of date systems, etc) in such networks due to the 'magic' of these
networks.  

	It sometimes seems that no matter how lightly you try to 
tread,  you'll find these things.   Be it due to the lack of security within
the network or a actual vendor problem.

	I've seen this across the board.  Cisco,  Avaya (Nortel)
installations down to out-of-date Asterisk based installations.  
	
	In one case,  we found a potential DoS condition with a vendors
product.  Getting the vendor to look into it was no problem.  Getting 
the _client_ to work with the vendor on addressing the issue was a 
complete pain!  The response from the client was,  'just don't run 
any scanners (nmap included) within the network'.   Yes,  put that 
in the /etc/motd so that attackers know not to do that :)

	Somehow,  I don't find that acceptable. 

	Again,  it's a environment that's 'magical' and not well
understood so once it's 'working',  don't touch anything!

	Couldn't agree with you more.  _When_ and _if_ they apply
control plane protection.  I don't know what the rest of the lists 
experience is with VoIP networks,  but in many cases they seem to
be stuck in the way-back-machine in reguards to network security. 
Not always,  but a heck of a lot.  Accidental 'DoS' conditions seem
to pop-up a lot in these environments,  IMHO.
