I was referring to single-packet (or single-request) crashers.
Reputable vendors still ship devices that have those bugs in 2010.

Chances are that Shang Tsung's nmap run triggered one of those.  As I
wrote, it happened before.  The nmap command line posted further
uptrhead does not actually cause a high pps flood.  Such level of SNMP
scanning is quite common in enterprise networks because some printer
drivers use it to locate printers, so your network devices are better
prepared to handle that.

And even if you applied control plane protection, you still need to
monitor those devices from your management network.  The brittleness
described in this thread makes this an extremely risky endeavor: one
typo in your Perl script, and your network is gone, even if the
monitoring station never had the credentials for enable access.
Those bugs might not be security-relevant, but they can be very
annyoing nevertheless.
