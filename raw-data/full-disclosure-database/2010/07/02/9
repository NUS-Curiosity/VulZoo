I agree, if it's bugs we're discussing - my guess is, we aren't dealing with a bug in this instance, given that the original poster seemed to indicate a variety of devices exhibiting this behavior, but simply causing enough packets to be punted to the RP to cause a DoS condition.  

Time will tell.
