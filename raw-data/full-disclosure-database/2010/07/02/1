Subject: Re: Should nmap cause a DoS on cisco routers?

Permanent DoS's are unacceptable even from intentionally malicious  
traffic, let alone a few nmap flags. They're unacceptable to us,  
they're unacceptable to Microsoft (see: MSRC bug bar), and even Cisco  
PSIRT has shown up on thread desiring to clean things up.

It's funny you bring up SNMP. Do you remember what happened when that  
protocol got fuzzed by the PROTOS guys in 2002?  Every network device  
on the planet pretty much exploded. I will grant you that network  
isolation is indeed best practice, but broken code is not something to  
apologize for or mitigate against.  It's something to apply real  
pressure against.  If we can't get pissed, how is that QA guy supposed  
to block shipment?

(That being said, you'll note 'it's code you just shouldn't run' is  
wrong. First thing's first, the network has to function. We route  
packets with the infrastructure we have, etc.  But products that can't  
survive nmap are likely going to have real problems with actual  
exploit tools, and RCE in routers is not something to risk, 'best  
practice mitigations' or no.)
