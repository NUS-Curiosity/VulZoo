Availability is the most important, yet least-understood element of the C-I-A triad, IMHO.  And not just on public-facing networks, but in private networks which often support mission-critical applications, as you describe.

I've found that talking about DoS strictly in terms of loss of availability, along with the business impact of a given system or systems suffering a total loss of availability, is sometimes effective in explaining the risks to non-technical decisionmakers and convincing them to allocate resources to improve their security postures.  In other words, 'phones not working', 'orders can't be processed', 'supply-chain requests can't be fulfilled', 'sales staff can't record sales', and so forth.
