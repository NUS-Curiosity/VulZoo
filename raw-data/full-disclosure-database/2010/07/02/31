I acknowledged this deeper in the thread - and also noted that since I've seen the same kind of reported behavior not above two or three hundred times in the past, that it sure looks like a classic RP DoS due to punted management-plane traffic.

I used to work for Cisco, and have the highest respect for the PSIRT team; I'm sure if there's an issue beyond simple BCPs, they'll resolve it.

In the meantime, everyone should ensure that their networks disallow control- and management-plane traffic from unauthorized nodes via iACLs, CoPP, et. al.; and also investigate rate-limiting management- and control-plane traffic in a situationally-appropriate manner via CoPP, HWRL, et. al.
