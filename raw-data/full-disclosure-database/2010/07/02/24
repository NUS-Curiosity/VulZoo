Subject: Re: WiFi sniffing need to be connected?

Login for email seems to be through normal http.  Messages will be
traveling over plaintext as well.
As long as the access point for wireless isn't encrypted, then
promiscuous will definitely work and be a much better angle.  Best
spots for that is hotspots or places that allow unencrypted wifi
access, but you have to pay to 'use' it.
You also have to be within the capture distance of whomever you're
trying to sniff.  So hidden extended antennae in backpack might be a
good idea.
