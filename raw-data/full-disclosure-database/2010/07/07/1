fair enough. if this aggregation is implicit (like a backscatter sink)
it is useful raw information.

placing technical tools, decisions, or even assumptions of
understanding upon the general populace is purely futile.

said another way, good idea: professional volunteer or skilled amateur
services applied to a clearly defined and maintained role in service
of the public good. Oregon ARES/RACES (W7OEM) [1] a good example.

not good: big effect tools in the hands of a clueless public,
counter-measures built on brute force rather than brains, constrictive
government regulation regarding the particular technicalities of
infrastructure security rather than the reasonable policy for
competent process.


i look forward to Winn's reply which you have facilitated.
