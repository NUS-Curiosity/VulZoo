Subject: Re: About the inotify Mechanism in LINUX

  from man inotify :
            IN_ACCESS         File was accessed (read) (*).
            IN_ATTRIB         Metadata changed, e.g., permissions,  
timestamps,
                              extended  attributes,  link  count  
(since  Linux
                              2.6.25), UID, GID, etc. (*).
            IN_CLOSE_WRITE    File opened for writing was closed (*).
            IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE  File not opened for writing was closed (*).
            IN_CREATE         File/directory created in watched 
directory (*).
            IN_DELETE         File/directory  deleted  from  watched  
directory
                              (*).
            IN_DELETE_SELF    Watched file/directory was itself deleted.
            IN_MODIFY         File was modified (*).
            IN_MOVE_SELF      Watched file/directory was itself moved.
            IN_MOVED_FROM     File moved out of watched directory (*).
            IN_MOVED_TO       File moved into watched directory (*).
            IN_OPEN           File was opened (*).

So you cant prevent a file to be changed, cause you will only be warned 
AFTER.

Maybe you should have a look to Dazuko :
