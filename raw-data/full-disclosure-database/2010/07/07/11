character of attacks i have observed using the "great unwashed" vuln. vector:
- inconsequential (in a war context) DDoS outages of various specific
targets or paths. if Twitter or eBay is down by DoS it's not a
national emergency nor decisive in conflict.
- unwashed technical incompetence. YouTube down by BGP FUBAR is not a
national emergency nor decisive in conflict. etc.,

i can, however, cite many examples from over 433 telecommunications
fiber sever / outage incidents since 2005 where a large swath of the
population / network is affected by spontaneous failure of presumably
redundant physical paths (right-of-way, path diversity) that weren't
separate or otherwise failed unexpectedly.  rework a well tuned model
for an intelligent, targeted attack and you see how cost effectiveness
at high degrees is absurdly lopsided...
(when you compare a YouTube outage annoyance to serious mass freak-out
over 911, debit/banking, visa, long distance, cross NPA local,
emergency service dispatch, and other critical services just "going
dead..." it's also clear how the practical implications differ greatly
at these scales as well.)


you seem to assume i am pulling claims out of airs; perhaps. perhaps
i've got a bit more analysis behind these assertions. ... if you want
to get technical ...
