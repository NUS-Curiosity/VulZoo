Subject: About the inotify Mechanism in LINUX

I am now thinking on monitor the filesystem in linux, for this reason
the inotify is a good way.But the problem is that what i want to do is
not only monitor but a handle.This situation is like that a file in
system has been changed unusually,now the inotity could tell me this
but i want to intercept the change before the file been changed.
So does anyone could give me a help on HOWTO?
