Subject: Mule Recruiting?

Good day,

My name is Lin Fu; I represent the company Good Goods Co. Ltd,
Ð¡hina, Hong Kong. Your resume posted on the job website has impressed
the human resources department of our company, and it is an honor for
us to offer you the position Sales Representative/Project Manager at
our company.

Our company is a wholesale exporter of consumer products. We export
products primarily to Europe and Asia. We are also a large wholesaler
in Chinas domestic market.

We are currently entering the market of North America, and primarily
it is the US market. Our strategic planning department has developed a
plan for entering the US market, which includes creating a horizontal
pool of online stores (no more than 15-20 online stores). The chain of
websites that we are planning to create will cover the entire
territory of the United States, and the sales volumes will be
increasing as the result of a large-scale advertising and promotion
campaign carried out separately for each online store.

Our offer is for you to join our team and work together to reach the
goal of occupying a niche in the e-commerce market in the USA.
Your job description will include operational management of some
processes in the work on the Internet store, constant contact with
your personal manager, market analysis, development of common
strategies, etc.

All that you will need to do to launch the project is to register an
LLC company so that you would be able to manage the business and also
a bit of free time, which you will plan to work out a convenient
working schedule together with your personal manager.

I would like to point out that no skills and experience in programming
and web design are required from you. Also, for the first six months,
you will be working on the part-time basis, and the working schedule
will be flexible.

Your salary for the work on the project will be 10% commission from
each sale; according to our estimates, it will amount to at least
2,000$ per month.

If you've got a burning desire to succeed and are interested in
maximizing your personal and professional growth, please kindly get
back to us via our email address.

Best Regards,
Lin Fu,
Good Goods Co. Ltd.
Hong Kong, China.
