Eric Paris's fanotify patches look likely to make an appearance in the 2.6.36
kernel:

config FANOTIFY
        bool "Filesystem wide access notification"
        select FSNOTIFY
        select ANON_INODES
        default y
        ---help---
           Say Y here to enable fanotify suport.  fanotify is a file access
           notification system which differs from inotify in that it sends
           and open file descriptor to the userspace listener along with
           the event.

           If unsure, say Y.

config FANOTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS
        bool "fanotify permissions checking"
        depends on FANOTIFY
        depends on SECURITY
        default n
        ---help---
           Say Y here is you want fanotify listeners to be able to make permissions
           decisions concerning filesystem events.  This is used by some fanotify
           listeners which need to scan files before allowing the system access to
           use those files.  This is used by some anti-malware vendors and by some
           hierarchical storage managent systems.

           If unsure, say N.

Is that what you're looking for?
