that method is only applicable to a small and less useful set of
measurements / modeling of critical infrastructure. there is rarely
need to consider the minutiae of so many small details. (though
NSA/DIA would argue otherwise ;)

for the majority of targeting you need only concern yourself with the
larger path / node aggregation points to discern the few points /
paths of interest. the few points referring to power and other law
distributions applicable to critical infrastructure network topology
across every industry.

i bet there's an archive / bibliography of the all details somewhere
in a walled garden. C.I research is not viewed favorably as a public
and available pursuit...
