Look at my old report from 03 on how an IOS bug can be exploited from just
one packet. It may provide some ideas for those wanting to test this Nmap
issue.

One question is whether or not the network in question *should* have full
access to the management plane of the routers.

Sure, but also note that CoPP, HWRL, and the like can help, depending upon
the platform.

Don't get me wrong; this should be investigated further, and PSIRT are on
it.  My point is that folks don't need to go into panic mode, but should
educate themselves as to how to defend their network infrastructure against
attack and then deploy the relevant BCPs.
