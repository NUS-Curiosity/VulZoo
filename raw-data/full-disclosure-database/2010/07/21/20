Subject: Re: "Jailpassing" technique for iphones

Yeah, i second that - more videos = more helpful to everyone.

What i found interesting about this one though is that it didn't stop at
bypassing the code-lock but also alludes to what you can do to the phone
from a non-forensic standpoint, e.g. load in "real-spy"ware (as in bugging
or some other surveillance tool).

The later part of the video showed the guy loading in a filesystem app
(afs-something it was called??) to access the phone's root partition from
his macbook.  If you're a gumshoe hired to keeps tabs on a suspected
cheating spouse and was presented with the suspect's iphone, that could then
be a prelude to loading in custom code or commercial bugging software to
turn the phone into a bugging tool and the evidence of the jailbreak removed
(as opposed to using the code-bypass to get into the phone to do forensics)

So instead of bypassing the code-lock to access the phone for forensics
purposes, you could instead load in surveillance/bugging software and then
remove obvious evidence of the jailbreak (e.g. uninstall Cydia) and restore
the passcode so that the user was none the wiser...
Now that i think about it, this could be used for corporate espionage too
(e.g. CEO getting his phone bugged...)
