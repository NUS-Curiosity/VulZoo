Subject: Re: "Jailpassing" technique for iphones

He didn't really say "they used spirit" -- he said, the same technique.
Which, I presume means, taking advantage of the same flaw.  Same
methodology.  Not necessarily same tools.

I personally don't consider the same tool, the same 'technique'.  It's what
the tool does.  But if you do, then it's semantics.

Regardless - I agree with Thor.  Good link, as I hadn't seen the book.
