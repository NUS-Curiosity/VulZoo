-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within handling of references to external font
resources. A value is used as a 16 bit integer in an array allocation
and later as 32 bit when iterating over and then populating these
fields. By creating enough references, a remote attacker can exploit
this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
browser.
