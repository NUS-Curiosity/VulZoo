ZDI-10-119: Oracle Secure Backup Administration $other Variable Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-119
July 13, 2010

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

-- Affected Products:
Oracle Secure Backup

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands
on vulnerable installations of Oracle Secure Backup. Authentication is
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the handling of variables to the
property_box.php script located on the Oracle Secure Backup
administration server. Due to the lack of filtering on special
characters it is possible to specify arbitrary commands to the command
line being executed by the administration server. Successful
exploitation of this can lead to remote compromise under the credentials
of the web server.

-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
