 Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

ZDI-10-123: Oracle Secure Backup Administration Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-123
July 13, 2010

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

-- Affected Products:
Oracle Secure Backup

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Secure Backup.

The specific flaw exists within the register globals emulation layer
which allows attackers to specify values for arbitrary program
variables. When specific parameters are specified via the URI it is
possible for an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and
reach functionality otherwise inaccessible without proper credentials.
This can be leveraged by remote attackers to trigger what were post-auth
vulnerabilities without valid credentials.

-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
