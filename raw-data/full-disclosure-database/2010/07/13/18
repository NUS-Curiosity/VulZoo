July 13, 2010

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
IBM

-- Affected Products:
IBM solidDB

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 9983.

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM solidDB. Authentication is not required
to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the solid.exe process which listens by
default on TCP port 1315. The code responsible for parsing the first
handshake packet does not properly validate the length of the username
field. By crafting an overly long value in the request an attacker can
exploit this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM
user.  

-- Vendor Response:
IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
