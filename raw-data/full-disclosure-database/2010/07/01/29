Sounds like a typical FSM type bug that can be exploited. 

I worked on one back in 03.

Not necessarily.  Fingerprinting is known to crash tons of devices.
And it's certainly a bug worth fixing.  Many shops write their own
scripts to gather statistics from networking devices, and it's really
annoying when those scripts bring down devices (be it due to brittle
protocol parsers, or memory leaks in the server code).
