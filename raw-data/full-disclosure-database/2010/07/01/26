Subject: Re: Should nmap cause a DoS on cisco routers?

All,

Robert lee (A good friend of late Jack Louis, the author of unicornscan)
explained to me that unicornscan does support a function like -iL does
in nmap. Just supply the name of the file with hosts as an argument:
unicornscan filename

It is as easy as that.

Thanks again for explaining, Robert.

Cor
