Subject: Directory Traversal on JTalk HTTP Server

Hello All,

Does anyone know of any Directory Traversal issue with Jtalk HTTP server?

I was testing one of my machine and found directory traversal on it.
http://192.168.10.120/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../boot.ini

Tried to enumerate the version but failed, attached below are the logs -
=============Header enumeration=============
[jt@...Box]$ telnet 192.168.10.120 80
Trying 192.168.10.120...
Connected to 192.168.10.120 (192.168.10.120).

Attached below are the logs for wget when I downloaded the boot.ini file

============end of logs=====================


So my question is does anyone know of any such issue? What could be the
remediation apart from disabling the service?

Thanks
Joshua
