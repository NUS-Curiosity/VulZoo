It sounds to me as if what happened was that he ended up driving the CPUs of the devices in question to 100%, and they stopped handling control-plane traffic and fell over.  There are infrastructure self-protection best current practices (BCPs) which can be deployed to defend against infrastructure-targeted DoS.

I've only seen this happen a few hundred times or so, so I could be wrong, of course.

The answer is, almost assuredly, "Yes."
