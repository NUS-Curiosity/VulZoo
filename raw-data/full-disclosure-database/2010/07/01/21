	(x-posting to full-disclosure as it looks like those guys over
there
are having a bit of a philosophical discussion over this ;))

	Hi there. My name is Dario Ciccarone and I work as an Incident
Manager on the Cisco PSIRT - Product Security Incident Response Team.

	Your post has certainly caught our attention - indeed, if
running an
nmap scan (no matter which specific command-line options were in use)
against a Cisco device makes it crash, we're certainly interested in
knowing more.

	In order to follow-up on this, we would greatly appreciate if
you
could send us:

	* a "show tech" from one or more of the affected devices -
specially
if those are different kind of devices (switches, routers, firewalls,
etc)

	* if you've been able to collect any crashinfo files - those
would
also come handy

	* if you have any console output/syslog messages/traceback
information coming from any of the affected devices

	* the specific nmap version you're using

	If you could send all of that to psirt@...co.com (if possible,
encrypted with the PSIRT GPG public key -
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_po
licy.html#roosfassv) we would look right into it.

	Much appreciated,
	Dario
