Adaptive uses Lantronics adapters embedded hardware. Test your code
against those, I bet it works the same.

Also .. lots of stuff that wants to do Ethernet->Serial (thermostats,
console servers, etc) use these gizmos. I'm guessing you should also
report your findings to Lantronix as they make the underlying
device/firmware.
