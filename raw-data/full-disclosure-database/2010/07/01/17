Subject: Re: Should nmap cause a DoS on cisco routers?

And this is why BreakingPoint matters:  Because, oh man, network people let
manufacturers get away with shipping some really fragile code.

If a Windows desktop fell over because you looked at it funny -- and lets be
honest, nmap -sV is quite literally, looking at something funny -- it'd be
an unambiguous remote DoS and we'd laugh at Microsoft if they said we should
deploy best practices to deal with it.  Now, if the networking equipment in
question was a $75 Linksys router, sure.  There's a million ways to knock
those things over, and you get what you pay for.

But genuinely expensive gear?  Some of that budget needs to start going into
resiliency.
