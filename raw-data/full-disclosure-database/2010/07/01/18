AIRRAID3 - Asia's Biggest IT-Security Tournament Comes To Singapore on 20
Oct 2010

ThinkSECURE Pte Ltd ("ThinkSECURE") and Singapore Polytechnic will jointly
organize AIRRAID3, Asia’s biggest IT-security tournament on 20 October 2010.

Organized by ThinkSECURE and Singapore Polytechnic for IT professionals
whose core function involves IT-security, AIRRAID3 (
http://airraid3.securitystartshere.org ) is a cutting-edge,
integrated-approach IT-security tournament that will provide participants
with a fun and legitimate environment in which to pit their wireless, wired
and application auditing and penetration-testing skills against each other
by engaging an enterprise infrastructure which is specially designed to
mirror an enterprise-class corporate wired / wireless network and
application server farm.

AIRRAID3 is the third instalment of ThinkSECURE Pte Ltd's AIRRAID(tm) line
of IT-security tournaments.  The original AIRRAID (
http://airraid.securitystartshere.org), Asia's first-ever wireless
IT-security tournament, was first held in Singapore in 2005.  AIRRAID2  (
http://airraid2.securitystartshere.org) which was Thailand's first ever
large-scale public IT-security tournament, was held in Bangkok in 2008.

"AIRRAID3 continues our tradition of giving back to the Asian IT-security
community.  Many IT-security professionals rarely get a chance to do some
real, full-bore, legally-sanctioned hands-on penetration-testing & system
auditing/hacking activities.  Our purpose-built tournament infrastructure
mirrors an extensive corporate wireless / wired / application network which
allows them to fully and legitimately employ all their skills to meet the
difficult and comprehensive storyline-based in-game challenges that we've
put in place," said Mr. Julian Ho, ThinkSECURE Pte Ltd's Head of Operations.

"Singapore Polytechnic is the first polytechnic to offer a full-time diploma
course in Infocomm Security Management.  Our experience in training students
in this field since 2006 well position us to jointly organise this
competition that is highly-regarded by all in the IT-Security business.  As
ThinkSECURE’s Educational Authorized Training Center since 2009, we are
excited to partner them in this event by providing the necessary
infrastructural support," says Ms Georgina Phua, Director, Singapore
Polytechnic's School of DMIT.

ThinkSECURE is the premier practical IT-security certification and training
body for technical IT-security professionals in Asia.  Singapore Polytechnic
is ThinkSECURE’s local Educational Authorised Training Center in Singapore.
Singapore Polytechnic also offers a full-time diploma course in Infocomm
Security Management at its School of Digital Media and Infocomm Technology
(DMIT)
