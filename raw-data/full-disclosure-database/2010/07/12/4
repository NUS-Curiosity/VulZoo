Hello Full Disclosure. I like to warn you about stupidity, whoreing
and security research.

Performing security research and disclosure of projects over 8 years
old is stupid not only for because you has nothing better to do, but
because you are perhaps too lame for to perform real research.

"Full Disclosure, I'd like to warn you about vulnerability in the
1970's" . . . It is reasonable to say no one cares.
