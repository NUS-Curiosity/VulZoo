Somehow you've gone from "you stole my idea and you need to give me
credit, and here's the download link" to "well, it's a bad idea and
nobody does it anymore." Your tool (which you now claim isn't a
tool) was just released 20 months ago -- six to eight years after
tools like Snot and IDSwakeup were released, and far less effective
than those tools. So what you're essentially saying here is your
own work was irrelevant. Well, at least you admit it.

Ah, I see. You're using reverse psychology. The tool doesn't make
any sense, so why not go ahead and throw a little credit your way,
right? Honestly, I couldn't care less what your "professional"
opinion is, and I still refuse to credit your work. I will,
however, continue to give full credit to tools like Snot and
snortspoof, regardless of their post-development discovery.

>There much more effectiveness ways to do it without "scream
>wolf", little boy.

Of course there are more effective techniques for IDS evasion, and
there's nothing stopping you from employing those techniques as
well, especially in tandem with Inundator. I guess that thought
never crossed your mind. If you decide to use that idea though, I
demand you give me full credit and prove a backlink to this post.

I'm not entirely sure how calling it 'incubator' is an insult, but
I suppose I'll pretend to be insulted.


> and let the real work for the pros.


And what sort of "real work" might you be doing? I'm curious to
know what sort of "pro work" one with "12 years of experience in
high-tek" does. Perhaps you're working on your "PATENT PENDING"
ENG++?

By the way, here's a shell script to replace NNG:

while [ 1 ]; do
    printf
"\x68\x2E\x64\x6C\x6C\x68\x65\x6C\x33\x32\x68\x6B\x65\x72\x6E\n" |
nc -v $1 1434
done

Again, if you're going to use that, you must give me full credit
and provide a backlink to this post. I'm super duper serious.
