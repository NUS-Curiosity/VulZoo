Dear Nelson Brito,
you are correct, everybody has the the right to be dumb and self-
destruct 
his "reputation" (if any) as you are clearly showing to the world.

{(!($^O=~/^[M]*$32/i)&&($0=~s!^.*/!!))||($0=~s!.*\\!!)}$0;

You call your opponent a kid but two lines after you contradict 
yourself
showing that your Perl line is bigger, unluckily it's the same of 
2008,
in your signature, meaning that perhaps you don't even understand 
it.

As exercise, to understand if you are a complete fail, you could 
exmplain
it publicly. And no, I won't do it for you :) Perhaps this could 
give you
back a very little amount of credibility showing that at last you 
speak
about things you know.

If you don't comply it will be evident that your abilities are 
completely
asinine.

"If you still believe in Santa Claus, please, stop reading right 
now, 
because this paper will show that bad things can get worse, and 
worse, 
and worse, if we are not paying attention on the signs. And 
according 
to some people: it is all old news, and the techniques were already 
presented by someone, somewhere. Ok, then!"

Nelson: bad things can get worse, and worse, and worse, if we are 
not paying attention on the signs.

Have a nice day,
an admirer.
