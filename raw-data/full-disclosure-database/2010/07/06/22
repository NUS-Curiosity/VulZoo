That would be part of my definition of " a cyberspace version of an
armed citizenry"

Agreed wholeheartedly. It was kind of my point.

Not sure I agree there. I think the real problem is resources. It's just
too plain complex and expensive for the average Joe/Jose/Jean etc. to
stay on top of things.

Nope, hundreds of millions of people protecting their own property, and
sharing information with each other, and thereby a network effect of
protecting their neighbors and the 'net at large.

It works very well where concealed carry is allowed as well, btw, as
even those who don't carry are protected by the disruption to criminals
plans caused by the lack of knowledge of who is and isn't armed.

So the solution is to take what is currently an NP-complete problem for
individual nodes: string matching and behavioral analysis; and turn it
into a bounded problem across all participating nodes: analysis of WHO
is bad (out of the 4B IPs, and order of magnitude smaller number of
connected networks), NOW, and share that information in an actionable
timeframe. It won't stop all attacks, but it will clamp them faster, and
limit the window of vulnerability. That's what ThreatSTOP was built to
do.

The article itself is a decent "survey" article, skipping like a stone
across the surface of the issue. The conclusion: it's time for "arms
control" on the Internet, is neither practical, nor even supported by
the article's text.
