That turns out to often be a harder decision than it looks.  Taking the
website down has its own costs - nobody can do any of the things the website
supports.  If you have good web logs and are fairly confident that you will
be able to detect and deal with any actual malicious activity, it may actually
make sense to keep the website up.  It's tradeoffs - which costs more, the
possible damage done by an attack, or the *known* damage caused by an outage?
