aww, this has been great since they first started shipping those
ActionTec pieces of crap .. ~_~;

note that it's not just FiOS but a predictable subset of all their
Verizon DSL, Verizon FiOS, Qwest DSL, Qwest FTTP, etc, etc, all using
the bottom dollar ActionTec with WiFi on by default, and WEP used by
default, with a predictable poorly seeded Key Derivation Function
based trivially on the MAC/BSSID/SSID of the router interface(s).

note that dproxy-nexgen used on same has its own set of issues and
vulns, particularly for you Tor users...

does someone have a droid app for this yet? (toggle "mooch-fios" widget??)
