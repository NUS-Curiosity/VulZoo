Apparently that is the case - that was just a copy and paste from an email I got.  Anywho....

OWA "helpfully" re-writes links so local users have the "security" of going through a redirector to IIS.

I don't think it's supposed to happen when you forward, but if you just copy & paste you'll keep the re-written link.

This is a good example of why OWA sucks.
