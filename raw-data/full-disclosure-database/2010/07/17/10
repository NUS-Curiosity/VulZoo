The best I can tell from Shreyas link (if it is applicable),
disclosing to the University does not relieve or indemnify you from
provisions of 43 (G). Perhaps there's a section which allows public
disclosure after private disclosure?

Its unfortunate that the University did not jump high enough when you
clapped your hands. I suppose a 12-hour is better than a 0-day. Even
Ormandy gave Microsoft about a man-week for the help center
vulnerability (debatable, but somewhere around the truth).

You forgot to mention the other options at your disposal.

Oh, I see - a political statement - you're grinding an axe. You really
should not claim altruisms ("I did it for the students"). Perhaps it
was also a bit of advertisement for iSolution Software Systems Pvt
Ltd, which is clearly not altruistic.
