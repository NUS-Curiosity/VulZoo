-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IPSwitch IMail. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within SMTPDLL.dll (called by queuemgr.exe).
When handling a message queued for remote delivery user supplied data
can be used to specify additional format specifiers to a vsprintf call.
This can be accomplished by providing a specially crafted -NOTIFY
argument to the SMTP "RCPT TO:" argument. Additionally, the destination
buffer supplied to vsprintf is a local stack buffer and can also be
overflowed with a large -NOTIFY argument. A remote attacker can exploit
this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
SYSTEM user.

Ipswitch states:
Update to the latest version 11.02
