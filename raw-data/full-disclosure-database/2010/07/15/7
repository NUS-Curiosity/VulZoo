Feel free to elucidate a *feasible* way to have deployed out-of-band signaling
on the installed copper-pair base back then. Also, compare the *actual* costs
and losses due to phreakers snagging free service due to in-band signaling to
the eventual cost of upgrading every single central office to something that
supported out-of-band.
