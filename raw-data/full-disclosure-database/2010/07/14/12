Subject: Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in SimpGB

Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in SimpGB.

Earlier I already wrote about other vulnerabilities in SimpGB -
SecurityVulns ID: 10412 (http://securityvulns.ru/news/CGI/2009.11.19.html).

-----------------------------
Advisory: Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in SimpGB
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/4252/
-----------------------------
Affected products: SimpGB V1.37.3 and previous versions. As I checked, in
SimpGB v1.49.01 there still is XSS via Flash.
-----------------------------
Timeline:

26.10.2009 - found vulnerabilities.
01.06.2010 - announced at my site.
02.06.2010 - informed developer.
14.07.2010 - disclosed at my site.
-----------------------------
Details:

These are Cross-Site Scripting (persistent XSS) vulnerabilities.

XSS:

There are persistent XSS in three functionalities of web application.

POST request at pages:

http://site/guestbook.php?lang=en&mode=new&layout=default
http://site/guestbook.php?lang=en&mode=new&layout=default&quote=1
http://site/admin/usered.php?lang=en&mode=comment&input_entrynr=1&entrylang=en

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
In field Name.

[swf width=1 height=1]http://site/flash.swf[/swf]
In field Text.

The attack is possible on old versions of flash player, where there was less
strict security policy and it was possible to execute JS-code from flash
files from external sites. In 9 and next versions of flash player the attack
will work only if swf-file will be at the same domain.

Best wishes & regards,
