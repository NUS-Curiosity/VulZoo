ToolTalk rpc.ttdbserverd database parser vulnerability
CVE-2010-0083
CPVDT-2010-0651



INTRODUCTION

There exists a vulnerability within a function of the ToolTalk database server
(rpc.ttdbserverd), which when properly exploited can lead to compromise of the
vulnerable system.
This vulnerability was confirmed in the following versions of operating systems,
other operating systems and versions may be also affected.  There are working
exploits to be shared with interested parts.

IBM AIX all versions up to today.
Sun Solaris all versions up to today. (Sparc and x86)
HP HP-UX all versions up to today.


Patches and workarounds are available for all the vendors.   Disable the service if unsure.

To determine whether the ToolTalk database server is running on a host, use the
"rpcinfo" command to print a list of the RPC services running on it, as:

$ rpcinfo -p hostname

The remote program number for the ToolTalk database server is 100083. If an
entry exists for this program, then the ToolTalk database server is running on
the system.

    100083    1   tcp  32768  ttdbserver

DETAILS

This vulnerability can be triggered by creating a fake database (.rec file) on
the system and calling remote procedure 7 of ToolTalk database server pointing
to this database, leading to a heap overflow.
Remote command execution can be achieved if you can place files on the host via
FTP or HTTP servers for example.
Four byte overwrite is possible as showed above (Solaris 9 Sparc).
