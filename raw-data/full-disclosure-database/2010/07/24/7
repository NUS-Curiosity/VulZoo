Subject: Re: Patent Absurdity - How software patents broke
	the system

Now here's a question that should bring this thread back on-topic.  How
patentable are security tools?  Lets say, for example, that I got a patent
on fuzzers - i.e. a patent on the process of generating random input for a
program.  Could it be that I could restrict the availability and use of
these tools?  That'd be pretty worrying from a security perspective, no?
