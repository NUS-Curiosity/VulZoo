And what do you think is doing revocation checking?

Hint:  Even fewer things than are doing chain validation.

Intermediate certs?  You mean those god-mode can-sign-anything certs that
are sold for a pile of money, a wink, and a smile?

Everyone loves blaming the business guys.  Nope.  When it comes to X.509, we
nerds blew it.If you have got 500 servers that need renewed certificates
then you have.

Or, you could just have a small handful of servers with keys and leave the
rest without.  Which is precisely what we see.

See, here's the problem:  You're all talking about what *could* be the
case.  I'm telling what *is* the case.  Expiration is one of a number of
serious and genuinely unique operational hazards in X.509.  We started this
conversation discussing the situation of a CA gov operator who hadn't rolled
their certs.  Some people were surprised.

The reality is, it's amazing there was a cert at all.
