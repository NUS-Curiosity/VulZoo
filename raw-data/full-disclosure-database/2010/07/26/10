Because the Accounting department is in charge of paying the power bill, 
not Network Operations or IT.

The departments are just managed differently. NetOps is about 
instantaneous uptime and periodic upgrades. Accounting is about past, 
current and future periods.

Also, organizations have hundreds of years experience in just how badly 
things go wrong when Accounting gets under-resourced and overly 
interrupt-driven. Even an imploding organization maintains that staff to 
the end.
