Ask me that in a few days ;)

This is a great formulation, actually.

So nobody will sell you a name constrained certificate.  It's almost
like there are serious implementation issues with the extension in the
field.

Absolutely correct.  Whatever world X.509 is great for, it sure ain't
this one.

Patch management involves the same thing being put on different hosts,
and there's really no choice -- you can't run an infrastructure without
maintaining it, on some timescale anyway.

Certificate management involves different things being put on different
hosts, and there's totally a choice -- you can simply not have a
certificate at all.

There's definitely some overlap.  But remember, in the field, the data
is not subtle:  Certificates are deployed through gritted teeth.

To paraphrase another quote, "X.509 never fails, only X.509 deployers."

The funny thing is, I've met a decent number of the actual authors of
X.509.  They're uniformly brilliant.  Maybe it's like that old Star Trek
pilot...super advanced aliens heal humans who've crash landed on their
planet, but they didn't exactly have a guide to what they were supposed
to do...

You know, it's strange.  I never hear stories about networks being taken
down for nonpayment of electric bills, but we have straight up UI
support for certificate errors.  Why do you think that is?
