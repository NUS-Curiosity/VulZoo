One of the more useful aspects I found in that paper are the
references to FDA databases.  There's a great deal of information in
the List of Recalls one the paper mentioned [1].  However, it's worth
checking out the listing of several other FDA databases relating to
medical devices are also useful, even if defunct/retired/no longer
updated (go figure...) [2].

Fwiw, I'm starting to work on a research guide of sorts for medical
device security, and if folks are interested, they might check out the
LinkedIn MedSec group as that's where I'll likely start offering a
draft for peer review RSN [3].

Cheers,
