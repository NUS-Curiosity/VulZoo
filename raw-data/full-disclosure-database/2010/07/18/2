you copied work; you did not learn and understand as suggested.

if you had learned and gained understanding, you would have awareness
of dentry cache and virtual file system interfaces, of device direct
i/o modes as just one path in many around your "protection" of write
by syscall intercept, of copy on write pages and memory mapped file
i/o, i could go on but learning is half the fun and i don't want to
spoil all the surprises!

suffice to say the correct solution is much more complicated than
you're currently prepared to implement... you've got more chops to
snuff up yet. be patient :)
