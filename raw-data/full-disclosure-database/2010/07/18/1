are you making fun of my ATM AAL5 VBR IPoATM bearer established via
AAL2 VBR SSCOP out-of-band-and-works-fine-thanks signaling channel?

 ... it's just a little misunderstood.

replay debugging with a virtual machine monitor is a great tool in
this regard. it is also indispensable when tracking down race
conditions or other intermittent failures.

just replay to desired pre-fail point and inspect execution from host,
easily extracting keys or other memory structures and altering state
with jump to "live"*.

best regards,


* with "live" being sort-of like a true resume at execution point.
network sockets, timers, and other aspects of runtime state cannot be
replicated in such a manner, but otherwise, this capability works
nicely.
