Subject: PoC for CVE-2010-1869 (ghostscript) and
	CVE-2010-1039 (rpc.pcnfsd)

Dear List,

I'm writing in behalf of the Check Point Vulnerability Discovery Team to provide the PoC for two vulnerabilities released in the past month:
	- CVE-2010-1869 (Ghostscript stack overflow):
		o http://www.kernelhacking.com/rodrigo/exploits/gs_bsd.pl.txt  -> Working exploit against PCBSD, exploiting the vulnerability thru CUPS
		o http://www.kernelhacking.com/rodrigo/exploits/gs_ps.pl.txt -> To create a .ps file just to trigger the vulnerability

	- CVE-2010-1039 (rpc.pcnfsd format string):
		o http://www.kernelhacking.com/rodrigo/exploits/pcnfsd.c -> RPC message to trigger the format string, already supporting RPC fragmentation

We are leading a big change in the way vendors report vulnerabilities, providing PoC code so customers and interested parties are able to test the fixes and
IPS systems.  We provide such PoC code to the public at least a month AFTER the release of the fix and immediately per request of interested parties.

Additionally, Check Point is committed to responsible disclosure procedures, allowing vendors ample time to respond, alert customers and time to apply the 
fixes before release.

 

Best Regards,
 
Rodrigo.
