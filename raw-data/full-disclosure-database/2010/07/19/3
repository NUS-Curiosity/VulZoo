Subject: PoC Malicious GKrellM2 System Monitor Plugin

On Ubuntu I had to uninstall openbsd's version of netcat and use traditional
netcat because openbsd's version (Ubuntu's by default I think) doesn't have
the -e switch.  It's probably like this in a lot of distros now for security
reasons.  Run make and put the .so in your plugins directory, then restart
GKrellM and then enable the plugin, once the plugin is enabled, click to go
configure it and GKrellM should crash, dropping a shell at port 6666.  If a
user was tricked by an attacker into using a malicious plugin of this type,
the system could be compromised.
