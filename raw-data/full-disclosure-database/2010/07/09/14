Subject: TGP v1.2 released

Greetings:

I've just released v1.2.1 of TGP.  It now directly supports appropriate x509 certificates loaded from the MSFT certificate store for RSA public and private key usage.   If you would rather use your existing PKI infrastructure or certificate store for your encryption/decryption keys, you may now do so with TGP.
