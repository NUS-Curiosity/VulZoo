Subject: Nostalgia and days gone by

I know this is offtopic but...

This is my official fuck you/middle finger to the modern world of computing:

Thinkpad 600E
363mhz Penitum II
192MB RAM
10GB HD
Cisco PCM340 PCMCIA card

I'm listening to house of the rising sun on ancient speakers, using 
xmms, under slackware 13.0, with lilo (not grub), using xfce as a 
desktop manager.

Just thought I 'd share for the old fogies and nostalgic people such as 
myself. Once in a while it feels nice to relive those days.

...I also own a function IBM AS/400 circa 1986.
