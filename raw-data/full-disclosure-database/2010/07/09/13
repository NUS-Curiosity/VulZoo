   Dear sir, could you elaborate on how exactly blackmailing and
threatening me by e-mail, then sending falsified copies of my answers to
my ISP's CTO and owner as well as to my employer's owner and director
"help make the Internet a better place"?

   You won. Your actions have truly demolished me beyond any possible
recovery and my only hope is that the moral responsibility of my
psychological breakdown and forthcoming self-inflicted scars will haunt
you for the rest of your life.

Regards,
