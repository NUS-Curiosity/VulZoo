Subject: Re: Expired certificate

So basically you advocate making unplanned changes whenever someone feels like it?

The only problem here is that they let the cert expire.  Being responsible about conducting maintenance, instead of having a knee-jerk reaction, isn't to be faulted.

If you think you can write better secure file transfer software, no one is stopping you.  You'll make a fortune.  Just remember it has to support more than half a dozen different protocols, support dozens of nodes talking to the same storage backends, synchronize data across datacenters, support triggered actions at multiple places in the transaction across multiple protocols, support multiple payload encryption protocols, allow single-sign-on authentication with third-party vendors, etc, etc, etc.  Oh yeah, it all has to pass independent code-review by external auditors.  At that rate, supporting instant application of new certs in a multi-tiered environment with bi-directional trust is a cake-walk in comparison.

Simple, right?

I'm done educating you.  I know the software and I know what I'm talking about; clearly you know neither.

Certificate authorities notify their customers well in advance of expiring certs, multiple times in fact, there's no excuse for that and then expecting your clients to violate best practice afterward.  As far as change control and system complexity, wise organizations keep things simple not overly complex.

When you're talking about a service that has guaranteed up-time, it can only be taken down for scheduled maintenance.  Changing production systems on a whim totally fails the 'A' in 'CIA' (and possibly the 'I' too).  Wise organizations implement change-control policies to keep their critical systems from being run-amok by ad-hoc changes.

There are several cross-certification trust relationships that need to be established for the software to continue working after replacing certs.

Even if you're using a CRL, you cannot have the CRL contain every cert that was revoked for all of eternity.  The CRL only contains certs from when they were revoked until when they expire.  That keeps CRLs slightly manageable (although OCSP is a much better solution).

What you want to be weary of is if the serial number and/or fingerprint change and the cert is still invalid (those will probably both change when the cert is re-issued, but then the cert chain and not-before/not-after dates should be legit).
