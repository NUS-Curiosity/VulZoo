Propaganda? really? How about stop whining? I don't understand why people
would dedicate this much time to making a video and TRYING to start a
movement instead of tackling the real problem. There is nothing to see here,
it's not important at all. There is nothing you can do. What, you gonna get
a bunch of signatures or something? Start a YouTube channel? lmao

Bend over and take it from the man like the rest of us.

Maybe I'm missing the point? Maybe you should try to explain it a bit more?
