That is definitely not the only reason.  The longer a certificate (or
actually, any 'secret key') is being used, the larger the probability
that it will be compromised, either by an opponent brute-forcing it, or
by good ole' human error.

Another reason is, of course, to guarantee steady income for the
certificate vendors... ;)
