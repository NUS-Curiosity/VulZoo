Subject: Patent Absurdity - How software patents broke the
	system

Hello.

Patent Absurdity explores the case of software patents and the history
of judicial activism that led to their rise, and the harm being done
to software developers and the wider economy. The film is based on a
series of interviews conducted during the Supreme Court's review of in
re Bilski â€” a case that could have profound implications for the
patenting of software.
