This is a good reminder that it's always a good idea to go through the relevant security advisories of the relevant vendors, ensuring that any vendor-supplied fixes have been applied, before reporting a possible vulnerability - especially in a public forum.

The assumption is generally that OPs have taken the opportunity to do so prior to posting; it's also a good reminder that this isn't necessarily the case, and that due diligence is something to which everyone can contribute.
