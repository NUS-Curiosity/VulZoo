It's not that it's risky, it's just that the techy people got all carried away with how it should work technically, and by the time they rolled it out to actual workers they realized that it was a usability disaster.  No one is going to deal with that big of a disruption to how they perform their work on a daily basis.  The biggest, grandest schemes always get torpedoed by the smallest human problems.

So far as I know, the only environment PKI is really widely adopted in is the military, because they get to say "you WILL use this smartcard, soldier!  YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?"  Private sector workers can just say "Hah, I'll call that head-hunter back."  Soldiers?  Not so much...

Consultants:  The people you call when you just can't admit the requirements were ridiculous, but are willing to burn a few million more dollars proving it conclusively.
