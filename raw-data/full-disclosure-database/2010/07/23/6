Subject: Re: there might be three people who missed it...

The cyberspace if being militarized. When that is fully visible, Full
Disclosure community will face a CULTURAL SHOCK.

People talk about "freedom of expression" and a thousand different BS
about privacy but increasingly (in military books, in loose terms) it
seems writing anything that "influences" someone significantly or
happen to somehow undermine military "advantage" on technology are
being taken as a "military issue",  including ur FD advisory or could
include a blog that just got slashdotted.

It is a world where "words" are seen as weapons. Rest is history...
