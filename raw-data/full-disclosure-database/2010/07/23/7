Yeah it's a pain in the butt that cuts down a little on the adoption, no 
doubt about it.

Still, something inside me doesn't feel completely unhappy that there's 
this tiny little barrier-to-entry for serving https that my browser trusts.

Security, by definition, can never be 100% effortless or transparent. 
After all, on some level, its purpose is to make it harder to access the 
protected resource. Credentials only have value to the extent it can be 
counted on that no one else can get them, so some constraints are 
unavoidable. Credential constraints on the time axis (on the order of 
years) aren't exactly the worst idea I've ever heard.

The worst idea I've ever heard is probably this:

I can imagine a PKI project failing.

But failing after $100M is spent can be only explained by business 
management problems. This is not a space program we're talking about 
after all, the PKI technology just isn't that risky.
