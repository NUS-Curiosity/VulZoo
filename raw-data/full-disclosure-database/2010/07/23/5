Yep.

But as Dr. Laura would say, "you knew that before you married her".

Nobody said you had to go into that business, or that you were entitled 
to make a profit on it.

I don't see that 8 hours every 2 days should quite come to $1/4M per 
year, and I suspect a competent organization could roll out routine cert 
changes in under 8 hours on average. But let's suppose it does.

What might be the unintended consequences be of having 500 "secure" 
sites hosted by folks that can't manage to spend one day every three 
freakin' years on maintenance?

I know, it probably doesn't add that way logically, but just sayin'.
