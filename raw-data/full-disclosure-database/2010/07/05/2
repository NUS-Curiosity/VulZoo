	HITBSecConf2010 - Amsterdam

Our first ever HITBSecConf in Europe is over! A big big thank you to all
our sponsors, speakers, crew, volunteers and of course attendees who
made it over to join us!!!

We're already planning for 2011 and the tentative timing for the HITB
Europe is mid May (stay tuned to our @hitbsecconf twitter stream for all
conference updates).

All conference materials from the event can be downloaded from
http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2010ams/materials and photos will
be released on http://photos.hackinthebox.org in about 2 weeks time.

==

In conjunction with HITBSecConf2010 - Amsterdam, we are proud to
announce the immediate availability of Issue 003 of the HITB Magazine,
featuring a brand new double-page design!

We now also have our very own sub site for the magazine and you'll find
all the past and current issues for download at http://magazine.hitb.org
or http://magazine.hackinthebox.org/

We hope you enjoy the issue and do stay tuned for Issue 004 which we'll
be releasing in October at HITBSecConf2010 - Malaysia. In addition to
the electronic version, we're hoping to have a very 'limited edition'
print issue exclusively for attendees of HITBSecConf2010 - Malaysia!

Enjoy the rest of the summer sun and see you in October!

- The HITB Team
