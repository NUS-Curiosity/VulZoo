After attempting to read your massive emailblog, it was quite clear that you are a group of people who DEEPLY care about IRC and blogging.  Therefore, I would like to invite you to #caretown on irc.hardchats.com - it's a channel for people who care about things.  We have a very active community who will write ten-page blogs in response to things such as chat logs, short political satire, media statements, various fast food, being virgins, and hating life and wanting to die.  I think it'd be a perfect match!  Hope to see you soon!
