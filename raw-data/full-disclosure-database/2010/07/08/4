Never seen this before.
But, it's very obvious, as you are 'changing directory'(cd
thisdoesntexist/) to a non existing folder and then getting out of
it(../).

But, there is difference with evaluation/calculation in windows and linux.
Here is how...

On Windows Box...

C:\>cd thisdoesntexist/
The system cannot find the path specified.

C:\>cd thisdoesntexist/../

C:\>cd thisdoesntexist/thisonetoo/../
The system cannot find the path specified.

C:\>cd thisdoesntexist/thisonetoo/../../

C:\>


On Linux box...

one@...ntubox:~$ cd thisdoesntexist/
-bash: cd: thisdoesntexist: No such file or directory
one@...ntubox:~$ cd thisdoesntexist/../
-bash: cd: thisdoesntexist/../: No such file or directory
one@...ntubox:~$
