Subject: Outlook web access 2007 CSRF

Hi,
I've just posted on my blog (
http://sites.google.com/site/tentacoloviola/pwning-corporate-webmails) a
detailed description about a CSRF vulnerability affecting OWA 2007 and
earlier versions.
The vulnerability allows, among other things, to set an automatic forward
rule for all incoming e-mails of a victim.
This issue has been notified to MSRC on September 2009; on November they
fixed the bug in Exchange 2010 release while, for Exchange 2007 they
released a patch some days ago (Service pack 3).
On my blog there is also a video PoC that shows a practical example of a
CSRF attack for a OWA user.

Regards,

Rosario Valotta
