Just for the record (since I had to go hunting to find out), Giorgio
Maone says NoScript will protect Firefox users (so long as you haven't

As a lot of folks are concluding, it's better to just uninstall Java

of us are stuck with workstations that need Java installed for one
reason or another.

Cheers
