My comments were, and still are, OS agnostic.

It matters not what the OS -- anyone authoritatively stating that 
antivirus software is a necessary component of a "reasonably secure" 
system is a fool.

Ditto my second comment...

Then, as I said, the PCI requirements are total nonsense...

So what system and application integrity requirements do they require 
for those OSes (presumably "instead of antivirus")?

Your response strengthens my belief that PCI is dangerous because it 
enshrines small-minded ignorance as "best practice" (or, at least, as 
"minimally acceptable practice") without recognizing the possibility 
that there may be better options that have not been so, ummm "over 
sold" as to become perceived as necessary.
