Did you consider that an anti-virus may actually be the worst security 
solution for certain threats because it allows companies not to think 
about security while providing insufficient protection? 

What's your choice:
Company A installs an anti-virus and updates it regularly (BTW regularly 
includes once a year).
Company B has a recovery concept, incident response team, vulnerability
monitoring, patch management, NIDS, security training but no anti-virus.

No, I don't think so.
