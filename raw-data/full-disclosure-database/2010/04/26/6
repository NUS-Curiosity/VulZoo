Nick,

Please if you don't know what the standards are, please don't post junk and foolish comments just to state your opinion:

Read:
https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/pci_dss.shtml

See Requirement  #5. Read that requirement carefully and its not bad to read it twice though in case you don't figure it out from the first glance !

Also, I said that using an AV is some basic thing to do in any company that wants to deal with CC, its a basic thing for even companies not dealing with CC too !!! Or do you state that people must use a BOX with no AV installed on it? If you believe in that fact? Then please request a change in the PCI DSS requirements and make them force the usage of a non Windows O.S, such as any *n?x system.

Finally, the topic here is not about "default allow vs default deny" and if I understand what that is or not! You can open a new discussion about that, and I shall join there and discuss it further with you, in case you need some clarification regarding it.

Regards,
Shaqe

Well, you see, _that_ is abject nonsense on its face.

Do you have any understanding of one of the most basic of security 
issues -- default allow vs. default deny?

There are many more secure ways to run systems _without_ antivirus 
software.

Anyone authoritatively stating that antivirus software is a necessary 
component of a "reasonably secure" system is a fool.

Anyone authoritatively stating that antivirus software is a necessary 
component of a "sufficiently secure" system is one (or more) of; a 
fool, a person with an unusually low standard of system security, or a 
shill for an antivirus producer.

So _if_, as you and another recent poster strongly imply, the PCI 
standards include a specific _requirement_ for antivirus software, then 
the standards themselves are total nonsense...



Regards,

Nick FitzGerald
