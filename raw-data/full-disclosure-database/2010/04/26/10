All - many of the following were inexplicably fixed in the latest
version (NovaBACKUP Network 13.0), but still, a 2.5 year run isn't too
bad...

http://digit-labs.org/files/exploits/novanet-own-lnx.c
- - linux remote root <= 12.0

http://digit-labs.org/files/exploits/novanet-read.c
- - arbitrary remote dword read <= 12.0

http://digit-labs.org/files/exploits/novanet-own.c
- - Windows (no-DEP/NX, NovaNet 11.0) remote SYSTEM <= 12.0
  (messy, there is a cleaner version)

They seemed to have missed the last one, so it still works on 13.0, but
sadly the most useless  :(

http://digit-labs.org/files/exploits/novanet-dos.c
- - null deref remote DoS <= 13.0
