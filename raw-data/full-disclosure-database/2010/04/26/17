Now you've missed both Nick's and Christian's points ;)

Nick's point was (at least, this is how I understood it ;) that AV is 
not necessarily the best approach to protect your systems against 
malware. If you have implemented a better way to protect your systems 
against malware, but the PCI standard and auditors force you to install 
AV software anyway, then the standard or the auditor's practices are flawed.

Please do remember that adding complexity in the form of AV software can 
have a negative impact on security. The recent McAfee 'svchost.exe' 
debacle is a perfect example.
