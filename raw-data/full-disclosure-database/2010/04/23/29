This right here screams "bullshitter". It isn't as if you get to
decide if you want to use PCI or not. If you process credit cards with
the major card brands you are going to do PCI either now or
eventually. There is no other security standard which you can choose.
You also show signs of being a victim of absolutism. Nobody has ever
claimed that PCI makes you secure. It is a minimal standard which
experience has shown most companies need spelled out for them. There
is much more than just the things spelled out by PCI that need to be
done. As usual in these situations, your real complaint isn't about
PCI but about the people who just don't get the point.
