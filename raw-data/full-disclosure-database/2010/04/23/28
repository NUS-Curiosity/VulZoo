OK - so, when you say "to use PCI" what do you mean?  I get the feeling that you are equating being "PCI certified" as something people just "get" to show other people they are "secure."  Hence your use of "marketing propaganda."

People don't go through an audit and get PCI certified so that they can claim they are secure.  It doesn't work like that.  PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliances is what people HAVE to do, as in FORCED to do whether they want to or not, in order to be able to process credit cards.  If you process less than 1 million xactions per year, you can "self audit."  Can you lie?  Sure.  But you'll get your ability to process payments yanked if they catch you.  More than that requires an auditor.  If that auditor finds you have horrible security controls in place, you will fail.  If they pass you anyway, they can lose their certification to audit.  If you fail, you have x time to get with the program and be audited again.

It's just a way for the CC industry to make sure the people handling card info follow best practices for security.  That's all it means - it is a certification FOR the industry BY the industry.  No one ever said it mean people had "real security."  It means companies illustrate a base of practices required to handle consumer credit card data.  That's it.

And I totally agree with Mike Hale's comments about "if you are really secure, as in 'already secure' then it's cake."  I don't know that I would say "cake" as it depends on the scope of audit, but he's right.  If you already have a drive to secure your infrastructure, then PCI should be easy.  My requirements for security are far more strict than PCI.  Yours may or may not be, so you'll have to adjust as necessary.

Regarding code, I do believe that in PCI audits for dev that you have to illustrate an SDL, in which case things like XSS and BOs and such would be part of.

That's the skinny on PCI :)

No problem with that.

1) No.
2) Planning to, but no.
3) Heavens no.
4) I've looked into whether it was into our best interest to use PCI. (it was decided that it wasn't worth the trouble)
At that time, I knew about PCI but not its details, at which point we got someone to explain in detail for us.
The end decision wasn't mine, though.
We do take security as a main concern, however, it is preferred to have a more realistic approach to security rather then restrict employees' access (by signing some oath..).

Christian Sciberras.

Marketing propaganda?  I have no idea what you are talking about.

Before commenting on PCI not helping at all and at the most being a false sense of security, let me ask:

1)      Does the company you work for perform PCI audits?

2)      Is the company you work for required to undergo PCI audits?

3)      Are you certified to be able to perform a PCI audit?

4)      Have you ever been directly involved with, as in contributing to, a PCI audit, and if so, in what capacity?

I would like to see some truthful expansion on the answers to those questions before continuing dialog about if PCI contributes to security or not.

If you strive for security, and weave that into your network,
complying with PCI should be cake.

Uhm.. No. NO. PCI is an unnecessary hassle. What makes signing a document any more secure then having server facing the wild of the net?

Truth is, PCI doesn't help in security at all. It at most a sense of false security (and at least serves as a recreational exercise for auditors).

Thor, I'm not arguing with the article, since I didn't read it, and I won't bother to. I just want to point out some hard facts about PCI/DSS which you call "no big deal".
I surely agree with that, but what is not a big deal for you doesn't mean it ain't for the rest of the world.
What stops an uninformed programmer from complying with PCI/DSS (or at least, think to) and leave  RFI/XSS/whatever holes everywhere?
That said, security flaws are just about everywhere so no need to get critical about it. For now at least.

The point isn't "who" should be using credit cards or not, it's a matter of security.

I find it strange that you're excusing marketing propaganda.

Sincere regards,
Christian Sciberras.

What's unreasonable about them?  Which portions are *NOT* part of
having a secure network?
