Subject: Re: Compliance Is Wasted Money, Study Finds

it is simply part of the cost of doing business in that market.
A.k.a. wasted money. Truth be told, I'm no fan of PCI.
Other companies get the same functionality (accept the storage of credit
cards) without worrying about PCI/DSS (e.g. through Payment Gateways).
In the end, as a service, what do I want, an inventory of credit cards, or a
stable payment system? The later I guess.
As to security, it totally depends on implementation; one can handle credit
cards without the need of standards compliance.

My two cents.
