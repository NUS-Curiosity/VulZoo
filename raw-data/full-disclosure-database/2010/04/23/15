So what's the problem? .. if you have done it according to (or
exceeding) the spec .. check the box, buy a box of donuts for the
auditor .. let them look it over, and be done with it.

If VISA (et.al.) could define "real security" and write it down, they
would. What is "real security" exactly? .. I'd argue the only "secure"
computer is one that's still sealed in the factory carton. Break the
seal, game over .. just like it says on a box of Band-Aids "Sterility
guaranteed until opened".

The thinking goes .. that if you implement the PCI standards and aim to
actually do as it suggests (meaning doing what the documents suggests
*correctly* .. not just having a blinkinlight in place so you can check
a box) .. you're already down the right path.

Even so .. the problem with securing networks/systems is there's
millions of "them" and only a few of "you". Also .. you have to be right
100% of the time, and "they" only have to get lucky once.
