Subject: Re: Compliance Is Wasted Money, Study Finds

Another thing that I think people fail to keep in mind is that when it comes to PCI, it is part of a contractual agreement between the entity and card facility they are working with.   If a business wants to accept credit cards as a means of payment (based on volume) then part of their agreement is that they must undergo compliance to a standard implemented by the industry.  I don't know why people get all emotional about it and throw up their hands with all the "this is wasted money" positioning - it's not wasted at all; it is simply part of the cost of doing business in that market.

The paper concludes that companies are underinvesting in--or improperly prioritizing--the protection of their secrets. Nowhere does it state that the money spent on compliance is money wasted.
