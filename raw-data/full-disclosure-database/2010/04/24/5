>>From the vendor website:
"ZipWrangler: The simple, quick and free way to extract and create your own zip and other archive files.
Use ZipWrangler's Viewer to take a look into these files before you decide whether or not to run or extract the contents.
You can also Run program from within the archive without extracting.

02 : Vulnerability details
A flaw in how the application handles a overly long zip filename which an attacker can utilize in a manner other
than the designer intended. Since the SE Handler can be overwritten an attacker can take full control over the application flow,
inject and execute arbitrary code on the machine. The attacker will be able to gain the same rights as the user running the application.
