Subject: How to disable Java Deployment Toolkit

Regarding the Java Deployment
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Apr/119> Toolkit vulnerability:
On Windows XP and later: open the Local Security Settings console and create
a prohibition  <ms-its:C:\WINDOWS\help\SAFERconcepts.chm::/SRP_path.htm>
rule for the path 
 %HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Web
Start\1.6.0_19\HOME%/JAVAWS.EXE
After you do that, the demo
<http://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/bb5eafbc6c6e67e11c4afc88b4e1dd22/testcase.html>
exploit should not work any more. 
HTH,
Chris
