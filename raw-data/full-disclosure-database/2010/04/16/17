Subject: Turning SMB client side bug to server side

Here's a small technic to compromise via a SMB client side bug the PDC/DMB
by abusing the Browser protocol,  with no user interaction at all.

Browser and NBNS abusing is well known since a long time, as theses
protocols wasn't developed with security in mind, this blog post is a simple
real case example.
