Quoting the list charter: "Gratuitous advertisement, product
placement, or self-promotion is forbidden."

And where's the point in reporting several projects that use a -say-
library which has a reported problem? (I mean, you've send quite the
same mail with a different software to bugtraq, today.)

The whole point of your "advisories" is self promotion and promotion
of your website.
