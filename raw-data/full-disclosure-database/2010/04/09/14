Amen to that.  Everything seems to be delivered for installation and even increasingly with *each* update, carrying various "hitch hiker" applications... toolbars, trial software, etc.

Sun Java updates installing toolbars, Adobe doing toolbars, even FoxIT installed some toolbars (even after I said no) with the last update.

If not a toolbar, then a $^@...# "download manager".  Adobe has one that insists on being installed (which had it's own set of exploits already).  Even Cisco's support site wants to install a 47-click java applet to get an IOS update these days.

I'd like to set the wayback machine for the non-web-2.0, straightforward command line days :-)

I think Universities should rethink their Software Development courses...

Valdis has got a very strong point. Here's my own. I got Safari to test
websites I develop.
Apple seems to think that during a recommended/critical Safari update, I
should be installing iTunes.
Oh, and surprise, with iTunes you get a couple of Apple Sync'ing services,
not to mention some hidden server.
It isn't *just* Apple, it's Linux, Microsoft and just about any other
company.
Microsoft forces you to get Desktop search (and turn on the indexing
service, which has its own set of exploits and slows the computer down *a
lot*).
