I think Universities should rethink their Software Development courses...

Valdis has got a very strong point. Here's my own. I got Safari to test
websites I develop.
Apple seems to think that during a recommended/critical Safari update, I
should be installing iTunes.
Oh, and surprise, with iTunes you get a couple of Apple Sync'ing services,
not to mention some hidden server.
It isn't *just* Apple, it's Linux, Microsoft and just about any other
company.
Microsoft forces you to get Desktop search (and turn on the indexing
service, which has its own set of exploits and slows the computer down *a
lot*).

Regards,
Chris.
