Subject: go public to avoid jail

An important lesson from childhood, sharing, could help keep you out of
jail.

According to the following (dated) Wired article,
http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/stephen-watt/ Stephen Watt got
screwed because he supplied his friend with a software tool he wrote and his
friend used it to commit a crime.

Had Stephen released his tool to the public (with as much or as little
fanfare as he liked) would he still have gone to jail?

He could make a good argument for legitimate uses of his tool as well. It
would be useful for anyone performing a PCI penetration test in compliance
with PCI DSS 11.3

Remember kids, sharing is caring (that you not spend the next 2 years in
federal prison)
