Hola,

The problem is not weather they are educated against other standards or policies or not, the problem is that without this compliance you can't work with CC !!! Its something that is enforced on you !

BTW: why don't people discuss what is the points missing in the PCI Compliance better than this argue ?

Regards,

OK.

"All those in favour of PCI raises their hands."

Kidding aside, of course it is a must, since the said companies doesn't have any notion of security before this happens.
However, how much is this actually helpful? Now let's be honest, how much would it stop a potential attacker from getting into a system "protected" by PCI?
Little, if at all.

On the other hand, a company should adopt real and complete security practices.

Again, my point is, these companies shouldn't be "educated" or limit their security to this standard. Because if they do (and I'm pretty sure they do) would make this standard pretty much useless.

Anyway, I won't get into this argument, since no one will give a sh*t about it anyway.

Cheers.
