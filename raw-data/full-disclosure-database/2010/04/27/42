To be fair - the claim has mutated a bit along the way.

What it *started* as was more like: "Once you've spent money actually securing
the enterprise, then the time and money spent on actually getting the audit done
is "wasted" from a security viewpoint, as that time/money isn't actually getting
spent on something that affects security."

Your site runs a relatively tight ship already. You read the PSI specs, and you
spend $10K and 2 man-months getting compliant because your ship isn't totally
tight, and there's a few things you should have done. That's not wasted
security-wise.

You then pay $10K and 4 man-weeks to actually get the audit done.

What actual *security* benefit do you get from that $10K and 4 man-weeks?
Pretty much zero, unless you stretch it to the risk-management side and
have to declare "risk of not getting PCI compliance impacting our revenue
stream" on an SEC filing.  But that's one heck of a stretch.
