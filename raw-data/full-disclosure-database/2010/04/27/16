Pieter,

I somehow agree with you that using an AV is not
always necessary if you have implemented a good protection for your
environment, but I mean in my previous comments that using an AV is a
requirement of PCI, it is forced on us. If you deal with CC then you
need to get compliant and that means you need to install an AV based on
the compliance requirements.

Its a shame, but thats a fact.

Regards,

Now you've missed both Nick's and Christian's points ;)

Nick's point was (at least, this is how I understood it ;) that AV is 
not necessarily the best approach to protect your systems against 
malware. If you have implemented a better way to protect your systems 
against malware, but the PCI standard and auditors force you to install 
AV software anyway, then the standard or the auditor's practices are flawed.

Please do remember that adding complexity in the form of AV software can 
have a negative impact on security. The recent McAfee 'svchost.exe' 
debacle is a perfect example.
