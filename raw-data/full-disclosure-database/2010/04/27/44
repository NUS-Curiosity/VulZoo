PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliances is what people HAVE to do, as in

 the problem is that without this compliance you can't work with CC !!!

Is PCI Compliance a giant bluff from VISA? Have any large companies ever
been forced to stop processing CCs because they failed to be PCI compliant?

According to the Verizon report 81% of attack victims were not PCI
compliant. Ok then how is that they were still processing the CCs that
became compromised?

Or does VISA come in after a large company has PCI data breached and then
claim "oh but they're not compliant because of X that wasn't correctly
identified during their last audit"? How many of those breached companies
were PCI certified at the time of the breach only to have it taken away post
mortem.
