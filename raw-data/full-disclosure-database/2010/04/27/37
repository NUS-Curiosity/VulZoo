This isn't a democracy .. it's a business.

You want to process credit cards in-house, you need to comply with the
PCI standards. It *doesn't matter* if you think you're smarter/better
than what's in the standard .. you play by their rules or you don't play.

Much like if your boss says you have to wear a tie, but you think ties
are stupid.

You've already stated in a prior email that you have no involvement with
PCI implementation on either side of the fence ("hell no", was your
answer, I believe) .. so I don't see where you're really qualified to
make a categorical statement that PCI compliance lends nothing to security.

PCI/DSS is an attempt to paint (as broadly as possible) a minimum set of
standards. You are allowed (in some cases) to state a mitigating
circumstances that renders a particular point moot. None of the things
in the PCI/DSS standard contradict basic "best practice" when it comes
to securing data and the networks and hosts on which it resides and
traverses.

Well .. "waste your money" on compliance .. or "waste your money" on the
surcharge you pay to another entity that *is* compliant. Take your pick.

PS: Just because you say your network is secure doesn't make it so.
Internal and external audit is routine course in the business world, and
you'll find that the less you try and make life difficult for them, the
easier things tend to go.
