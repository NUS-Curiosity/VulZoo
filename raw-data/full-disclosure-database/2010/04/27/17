Michel,

Sorry, I didn't understand your first question!

Regarding your 2nd question. You won't get compliant if you update your AV on a annually basis. You shall fail the quarter check done by an QSA(s). So first check is not available. For me if the companies staff is well educated and a we have a good IR team, plus the other goodies you mentioned, then for sure I shall go with selection #2 :)

I hate these rules, but really they are something enforced on us. And without them our business can't be done. Or does someone here suggest we close our shops/companies and go home just because we dislike/disagree/hate the PCI Compliance requirements? 

I think that its not a bad to implement these requirements to get compliant by these companies, and then do what we think is the best. I.e, develop a more security policy to work on top of the PCI or vise versa. Get compliant then go further.

BTW: I hope your able to understand my point, as my English seems to be bad :(

Regards,

Did you consider that an anti-virus may actually be the worst security 
solution for certain threats because it allows companies not to think 
about security while providing insufficient protection? 

What's your choice:
Company A installs an anti-virus and updates it regularly (BTW regularly 
includes once a year).
Company B has a recovery concept, incident response team, vulnerability
monitoring, patch management, NIDS, security training but no anti-virus.

No, I don't think so.
