Subject: Re: Compliance Is Wasted Money, Study Finds

Has everyone on this list read the PCI DSS requirements?
They are freely available, at www.pcisecuritystandards.org.

Were you even following the thread? There's been at least 4 times were
different people cited different parts of the standard.
But I would suppose that there's always the possibility of someone imagining
the standard, who knows!

AV is about 4 requirements out of over 230 requirements

Actually, it's the 5th out of 12...
https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/pci_dss.shtml

Many views in this thread sound like drowning people who reject a lifeboat
because it doesn't match their eye colour.

And I take it the lifeboat matched your eye-colour?
By your comparison, it doesn't match my eye colour and neither the amount of
holes in the lifeboat as I would deem "safe".
Sure, some people would evacuate on a handkerchief if it means less money
more compliance.

I don't think you grasped the point either, so I won't argue with the rest
of your message.
