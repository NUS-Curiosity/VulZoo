Verizon Business has gotten a good reputation for having good hard numbers.
I'd have to say their breach reports are probably close to the most accurate
numbers we're going to get in this industry.

> 81% of victims were not PCI compliant.

In and of itself, doesn't say much, but combined with these 3:

> 83% of attacks were not highly difficult. 
> 87% were considered avoidable through simple or intermediate controls.
> 99.9% of records were compromised from servers and applications (meaning, not clients).  

Sad, ain't it? Over 4 out of 5 times, the hack wasn't hard, and almost 9 out
of 10 times, basic hardening would have prevented it.

Unfortunately, there's not enough data there to say if the 81% had been compliant,
if that would have imposed enough hardening to stop the attacks dead in their
tracks.  Probably in most of the cases it would have, though.
