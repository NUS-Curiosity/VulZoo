Subject: Vulnerabilities in NovaBoard

Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in system NovaBoard.

In this advisory I'm continue to inform readers of mailing lists about
vulnerable web applications which are using CaptchaSecurityImages.php. If
you read Bugtraq you can saw the letter which was posted last week by one
developer of one such vulnerable web application (which I posted to the
list before). And from that letter it's clearly seen, that web developers
ignore advisory about holes in CaptchaSecurityImages.php itself, and only
draw attention on advisories about their specific web applications. So, as I
already wrote to the list, it's only way to draw attention of web developers
to these issues.

Advisory: Vulnerabilities in NovaBoard
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/4094/
-----------------------------
Affected products: NovaBoard 1.1.2 and previous versions.
-----------------------------
Timeline:
17.03.2010 - found vulnerabilities.
02.04.2010 - disclosed at my site.
03.04.2010 - informed developers.
-----------------------------
Details:

These are Insufficient Anti-automation and Denial of Service
vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities exist in captcha script CaptchaSecurityImages.php, which
is using in this system. I already reported about vulnerabilities in
CaptchaSecurityImages (http://websecurity.com.ua/4043/).

Insufficient Anti-automation:

http://site/scripts/php/captcha/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=150&height=100

Captcha bypass is possible via half-automated or automated (with using of
OCR) methods, which were mentioned before (http://websecurity.com.ua/4043/).
Value of characters is fixed.

DoS:

http://site/scripts/php/captcha/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=1000&height=9000

With setting of large values of width and height it's possible to create
large load at the server.

Best wishes & regards,
