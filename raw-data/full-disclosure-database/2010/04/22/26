Subject: Re: IE8 img tag HiJacking

Later in the blog I wrote it about the possibility of using the image size
for a similar purpose on all browsers.
I expect that the idea with SVG and fileSize justify themselves in
Internet Explorer 9. But now, in beta, it does not work.
Thank you for your comment
And separately I apologize for my English, which could prevent convey my
thoughts to you ...
