Monopolies in "cloud" (e.g. remote storage and computing services) may 
develop, but I don't think its quite foreordained that such monopolies 
will develop.  I think that there is a strong chance that we'll end up 
with an oligopoly (just like with gas stations, or airlines) where a few 
dominant providers (like Google, Amazon, Microsoft) control prices.  
While its not as good as a genuinely competitive market, I do not think 
oligopolies are as bad as monopolies, if only because each individual 
participant has an incentive to break with the cartel for increased 
short-term gains.
