As the amount of regulation over personal data storage and transmission 
grows, individual businesses are going to have a harder and harder time 
keeping up with all the security certifications and requirements that 
are necessary to hold that data.  At that point, there will be strong 
pressure to outsource this responsibility to a specialist.  The moment 
Microsoft, Amazon, Google, or someone else comes up with a remote 
storage and virtualization system that meets HIPPA, PCI, or some other 
auditing requirement, they will own the market.  Businesses do not want 
to be responsible for their customers' data.  The moment they are able 
to offload that responsibility onto a third party, they will do so.
