Subject: Is Digital Due Process legit?


 From facebook police, jack bauering on your facebook, to NSL's, to the general laughable state of privacy laws in the United States, there's no mistaking we need more safeguards against the guardian's of the status quo going to town on all of our private stuff with no proof.

www.digitaldueprocess.org

It's a partnership from public advocacy groups like EFF, ACLU, (notice I don't see epic in there), and surprisingly, Google, Microsoft, and basically these datamining businesses known for handing out your data like its a passing triviality.

Is this whole thing legit? Or are they going to end up giving us a bill that just privatizes and deregulates shit for Google to run amok and just wholesale all of their wares in a huge datamart-type app?

This shit reeks of a corporate lobbying front meant to screw our rights and let the private infobrokers get monopolozied and put in the front seat.
