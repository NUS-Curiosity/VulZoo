Well, you see, _that_ is abject nonsense on its face.

Do you have any understanding of one of the most basic of security 
issues -- default allow vs. default deny?

There are many more secure ways to run systems _without_ antivirus 
software.

Anyone authoritatively stating that antivirus software is a necessary 
component of a "reasonably secure" system is a fool.

Anyone authoritatively stating that antivirus software is a necessary 
component of a "sufficiently secure" system is one (or more) of; a 
fool, a person with an unusually low standard of system security, or a 
shill for an antivirus producer.

So _if_, as you and another recent poster strongly imply, the PCI 
standards include a specific _requirement_ for antivirus software, then 
the standards themselves are total nonsense...
