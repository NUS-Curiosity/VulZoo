Subject: Re: NT becoming pure microkernel

The Midori and Singularity proyects are just academical proyects to 
gain reputation on universities and promote the .net framework. 
What is really happenning is that Microsoft is planning to replace 
the win32 subsystem with a .net like subsystem.

The next step is to prepare the kernel for SIMD architectures and 
in this step they are planning to make a microkernel based on the 
current HAL and microkernel (the code currently responsible of 
managing the CPU).

The win32k is coming back to userland, directly to the .net like 
subsystem. 
Wanna know more about the security model they're planning or you 
prefer to read articles in wikipedia?
