Subject: NT becoming pure microkernel

Microsoft has leaked information once again about "NT becoming pure 
microkernel" in a new step to make "harder" exploitation (they 
believe). The Redmond based company has revealed it's future plans 
for the NT operating system family. As you know, Windows NT is a 
Hybrid operating system as opossed to linux, which is a monolitic 
OS with loadable modules (which makes it easier to exploit kernel 
level vulnerabilities, btw).

Once again, they believe that "copying" old (already bypassed) 
technologies they can solve the fiasco they have in their mad 
source code...

Microkernel != strong_security

More information on this subject in a short while...
