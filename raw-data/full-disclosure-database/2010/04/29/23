Subject: Interactive Linux Binary Analysis Tool

I'm sure I once read about a tool for linux which could execute a binary and prompt for each particular library or system call to be approved or whitelisted by various attributes, I have searched everywhere but I can find no trace of it, I think it was posted to FD, any ideas?

Andy
