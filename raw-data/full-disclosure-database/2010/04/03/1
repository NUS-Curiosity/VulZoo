This is documented behaviour. You can override insecure default cache root and
umask with options 'cache_root' and 'directory_umask':

use Cache::FileCache;
use File::Temp qw/ tempdir /;
my $cache = new Cache::FileCache( {
    'cache_root' => tempdir('CacheXXXXX'),
    'directory_umask' => 077,
} );
