Subject: Re: How to disable Java Deployment Toolkit

This Java Deployment Toolkit block obviously  depends on the release number.
This will be a problem only if next releases need blocking.  I hope the hole
will be patched though; it is not rocket science to get it right.  I would
patch it if I were a serious vendor. 
Cheers,
Chris

Hmm ... presumably that would that need repeating for every later (and
older) Java release until the functionality is believed safe ?

Cheers
