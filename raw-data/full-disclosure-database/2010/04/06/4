Subject: Compliance Is Wasted Money, Study Finds

For those who don't frequent slashdot.......

"Enterprises are spending huge amounts of money on compliance programs
related to PCI-DSS, HIPAA and other regulations, but those funds may
be misdirected in light of the priorities of most information security
programs, a new study has found. A paper by Forrester Research,
commissioned by Microsoft and RSA, the security division of EMC, found
that even though corporate intellectual property comprises 62 percent
of a given company's data assets, most of the focus of their security
programs is on compliance with various regulations. The study found
that enterprise security managers know what their companies' true data
assets are, but find that their security programs are driven mainly by
compliance, rather than protection (PDF)."
