Subject: Anthology of attacks via captchas

Hello Full-Disclosure!

Last month I wrote new article Anthology of attacks via captchas, for which
I made English version yesterday (http://websecurity.com.ua/4107/). It this
article I wrote about different variants of attacks via captchas.

Attacks via captchas:

* Captcha bypass.
* Redirector attacks.
* Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
* SQL Injection attacks.
* CSRF attacks.
* Information leakages.
* Denial of Service attacks.

You can read the article Anthology of attacks via captchas at my site:
