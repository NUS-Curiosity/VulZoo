Subject: Vulnerabilities in CMS SiteLogic

Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in CMS SiteLogic. It's
Ukrainian commercial CMS. In addition to previously reported vulnerabilities
(disclosed this year), I will report about vulnerabilities in this CMS,
which I disclosed in 2009.

-----------------------------
Advisory: Vulnerabilities in CMS SiteLogic
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/3272/
-----------------------------
Affected products: all versions of CMS SiteLogic.
-----------------------------
Timeline:
03.03.2008 - found vulnerabilities.
03.03.2008 - informed developers. First time I used private disclosure
approach, but they just ignored (as holes in their CMS, as holes at their
web site). So then I used responsible full disclosure approach.
08.02.2009 - informed admins of vulnerable web site where I found
vulnerabilities (they also ignored).
27.06.2009 - disclosed at my site.
28.06.2009 - additionally informed developers.

Details:

These are SQL Injection, Full path disclosure and Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities.

SQL Injection:

http://site/index.php?mid=-1%20union%20select%201,1,version(),1,1,1,1,1

Full path disclosure:
