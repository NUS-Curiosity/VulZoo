4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in multiple VMWare
products, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise 
a vulnerable system.

The vulnerabilities are caused by two integer truncation errors in 
vmnc.dll when processing HexTile encoded video chunks and can be 
exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code by 
tricking a user into opening a specially crafted AVI file.
