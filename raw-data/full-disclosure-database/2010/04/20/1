Subject: [Tool] ReFrameworker 1.1

Hi all,
I'm happy to announce about a new version of ReFrameworker V1.1 !

ReFrameworker is a general purpose Framework modifier, used to reconstruct
framework Runtimes by creating modified versions from the original
implementation that was provided by the framework vendor. ReFrameworker
performs the required steps of runtime manipulation by tampering with the
binaries containing the framework's classes, in order to produce modified
binaries that can replace the original ones.
It was developed to experiment with and demonstrate deployment of MCR
(Managed Code Rootkits) code into a given framework. MCR is a special type
of malicious code that is deployed inside an application level virtual
machine such as those employed in managed code environment frameworks –
Java, .NET, Dalvik, Python, etc.. 
Having the full control of the managed code VM allows the MCR to lie to the
upper level application running on top of it, and manipulate the application
behavior to perform tasks not indented originally by the software developer.
ReFrameworker was demonstrated (in his former incarnation as ".NET-Sploit")
at BlackHat, Defcon, RSA, OWASP and other places. The new version will be
demonstrated this week at SOURCE Boston conference, for the first time.
More information on ReFrameworker and MCR will be available with the soon to
be published book "Managed Code Rootkits", by Syngress publishing. 

Among its features:
- Performs all the required steps needed for modifying framework binaries
(disassemble, code injection, reassemble, precompiled images cleaning, etc.)
- Fast development and deployment of a modified behavior into a given
framework
- Auto generated deployers
- Modules: a separation between general purpose "building blocks" that can
be injected into any given binary, allowing the users to create small pieces
of code that can be later combined to form a specific injection task. 
- Can be easily adapted to support multiple frameworks by minimal
configuration (currently comes preconfigured for the .NET framework)
- Comes with many "preconfigured" proof-of-concept attacks (implemented as
modules) that demonstrate its usage that can be easily extended to perform
many other things. 

ReFrameworker, as a general purpose framework modification tool, can be used
in other contexts besides security such as customizing frameworks for
performance tuning, Runtime tweaking, virtual patching, hardening, and
probably other usages - It all depends on what it is instructed to do.
