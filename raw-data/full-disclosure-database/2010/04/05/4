CVE-2010-0094

-- Affected Vendors:
Sun Microsystems

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Sun Java Runtime Environment. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious website.

The specific flaw exists within the deserialization of RMIConnectionImpl
objects. Due to a lack of privilege checks during deserialization it is
possible to supply privileged code in the ClassLoader of a constructor
being deserialized. This allows for a remote attacker to call system
level Java functions without proper sandboxing. Exploitation of this can
lead to remote system compromise under the context of the currently
logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
