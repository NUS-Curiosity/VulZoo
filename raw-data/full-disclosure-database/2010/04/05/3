Subject: Vulnerabilities in GunCMS and PhoenixCMS PHP
	Edition

Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in GunCMS and PhoenixCMS
PHP Edition.

GunCMS includes HoloCMS 3.1 and accordingly its vulnerabilities. And
PhoenixCMS PHP Edition is based on HoloCMS. So I decided to put these
vulnerabilities in two CMS into one advisory.

-----------------------------
Advisory: Vulnerabilities in GunCMS and PhoenixCMS PHP Edition
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/4075/
-----------------------------
Timeline:
17.03.2010 - found vulnerabilities.
27.03.2010 - disclosed at my site (first about GunCMS and later about
PhoenixCMS PHP Edition).
29.03.2010 - informed developers of GunCMS.
02.04.2010 - informed developers of PhoenixCMS PHP Edition.
-----------------------------
Details:

These are Insufficient Anti-automation and Denial of Service
vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities exist in captcha script CaptchaSecurityImages.php, which
is using in this system. I already reported about vulnerabilities in
CaptchaSecurityImages (http://websecurity.com.ua/4043/).

Insufficient Anti-automation:

In GunCMS:

http://site/path/captcha/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=150&height=100&characters=2

In PhoenixCMS PHP Edition:

http://site/captcha/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=150&height=100&characters=2

Captcha bypass is possible via half-automated or automated (with using of
OCR) methods, which were mentioned before (http://websecurity.com.ua/4043/).

DoS:

In GunCMS:

http://site/path/captcha/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=1000&height=9000

In PhoenixCMS PHP Edition:

http://site/captcha/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=1000&height=9000

With setting of large values of width and height it's possible to create
large load at the server.

Vulnerable are all versions of GunCMS.

Vulnerable are PhoenixCMS PHP Edition 1.0.1 and previous versions.
