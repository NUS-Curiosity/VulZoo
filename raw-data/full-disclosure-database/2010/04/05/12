-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sun's Java Runtime Environment. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within a function responsible for creating a
JPEG image encoder. The function makes an invalid assignment based on
the value of the num_components element of a comp_info structure while
parsing a JPEG file. It then improperly uses the original value while
performing memory copy operations. By specifying certain values as the
num_components field this can be exploited to gain arbitrary code
execution by overflowing an undersized buffer on the heap.

-- Vendor Response:
Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
