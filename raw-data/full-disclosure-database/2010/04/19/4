01 : Vendor description of software

"Create and Extract Zips TweakFS Zip Utility for FSX was designed to be a useful tool for unpacking Zip files downloaded from FS file libraries without the need for an existing 3rd-party Zip application, but the big handy feature is that it has a tree display of the Zip folder structure giving you a clear view of how the files will unpack and into which location."

 

02 : Vulnerability details

A flaw in how the application handles a overly long filename inside a zip file which an attacker can
utilize in a manner other than the designer intended. This allows the attacker to run arbitrary-code execution on 
the victims machine when a specially crafted zip file has been open within the application.
