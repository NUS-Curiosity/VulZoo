Subject: [Full-disclosure] Best Wireless Sniffer for MAC OS X

Hello group

What are some of the best wireless sniffers on MAC OS X platform? I want to
be able to sniff the traffic and look for sensitive information. The company
has a small budget so both free and commercial are fine

Thanks 


Justin,

Compile kismet (works for me on SL 10.6.3) or use Kismac for a more gui
flavor.

James
