-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to deny services on vulnerable
installations of Sun Microsystems Directory Server. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within Sun Directory Server's DSML-over-HTTP
implementation and can be triggered via an HTTP POST request to the
webserver that the application has bound to. When the service processes
an XML request containing specific UTF-8 characters, an underlying
library will raise an exception that is uncaught by the application. Due
to the exception being uncaught, the application will then terminate
which will cause future requests made against the service to fail. This
will lead to a denial of service against the affected application.
