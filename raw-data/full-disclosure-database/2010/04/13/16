Subject: Re: Best Wireless Sniffer for MAC OS X

In Snow Leopard there is a built-in command called airportd. In previous versions of OSX you could use this to change wireless setting from the command line. In 10.6 you can se it to sniff on a single wireless channel.

David-Maynors-MacBook-Pro:~ dave$ /usr/libexec/airportd
Usage: airportd <interface> <verb> <options>
<cut for length>
Sniffing on channel 1:
	airportd en1 sniff 1
David-Maynors-MacBook-Pro:~ dave$

Running the command in the example will start collecting wireless packets in /tmp with the name airportSniffXXXXXX.cap. This is a standard pcap file readable by tcpdump or wireshark.

David-Maynors-MacBook-Pro:~ dave$ sudo /usr/libexec/airportd en1 sniff 1
Password:
Capturing 802.11 frames on en1.
^CSession saved to /tmp/airportSniffndDZXh.cap.
David-Maynors-MacBook-Pro:~ dave$

The downside is that while sniffing you wireless card cannot be used for normal operations. If this is common knowledge I apologize, I find it interesting Apple choose to include this ability by default.
