Reminds me of the adage "Locks keep honest people honest".

Dream up all the fancy security and countermeasures you want .. but it
still makes more sense to just take reasonable proactive steps to make
your house less attractive to burglars than the ones nextdoor .. and
have good insurance.

The geeky stuff is more fun to think up and implement, but trimming the
hedges and installing some exterior lights works better.
