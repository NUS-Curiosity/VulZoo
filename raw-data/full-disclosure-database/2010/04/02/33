FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

1 APRIL 2010

DEFCON CTF QUALIFIER ANNOUNCED

Defense Diutinus Technologies Corp (ddtek) is pleased to announce the
round of qualification for DEFON 18 CTF.

Stock up on Red Bull, put the pizza delivery on speed dial, polish up
your fancy shellcodes, and replenish the duct tape supply.  The
competition for these coveted spots
will be held over 55 non-stop hours 21-24 May.  When the dust clears
only the 10 best will be invited to join us this summer in sin city
for the annual DEFCON deathmatch.

In historical fashion VedaGodz will be automatically be permitted
contest entry. However, we wish to point out that real ninjas would
still attempt to qualify.

The qualification round will again be in the style of game board, but
answers need not be in the form of a question. Categories will require
teams to demonstrate the
superiority of hacking across a vast realm of security.  This isn't
CTF like your mama used to make. Level 1 questions make CISSPs turn
red, Level 2 make SANS Fellows
cry in frustration, Level 3 are typically only answerable by sheep of
above average barnyard intelligence, you get the idea.

Pause your atari emulator and hop over the ddtek.biz to register.
Only those that pre-register are permitted to play.

*CEH holders...well, we sorta feel a little bit sorry for those that
admit to holding this cert and abstain from mocking.
