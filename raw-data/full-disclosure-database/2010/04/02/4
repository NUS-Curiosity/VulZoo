Subject: The PDF-specific exploitation research

Hi,

When I was reading the report about Charlie Miller's fuzzing
experiment in PDF[1], I am quite eager to see all his crashes[2], to
confirm whether they are covered by my recent PDF-specific
exploitation research.

Feel free to have a general idea about the research in following blog
post. It also involves a PDF zero-day (working exploit), but it won't
be the key part right now.
