Agreed.

"This murky legal landscape does not serve the government, customers
or service providers well."
Notice that the 'customer' is not emphasized by listing first, even
though the battle is over the 'customer' data. I also like how
'customer' is used rather than 'individual, 'his', or 'her. I suppose
by minimizing the individual, it will be easier to frame for their
cause.

"Companies are uncertain of their responsibilities and unable to
assure their customers that subscriber data will be uniformly
protected."
These folks may not disclose, but its not due to uncertainty. A
perfect case in point is JC Penny and the TJ Max mess. From

(link posted to datalossdb mailing list): "Most organizations hit by
breaches that don't require public disclosure don't call in law
enforcement -- they consider it an exposure risk..."
