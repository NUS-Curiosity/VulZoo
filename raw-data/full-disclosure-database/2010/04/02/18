CVE-2010-0516

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists during the parsing of samples from a malformed
.mov file utilizing the RLE codec. While decoding RLE data, the
application will fail to validate the size when decompressing the data
into a heap chunk. If the length is larger than the size of the chunk
allocated, then a memory corruption will occur leading to code execution
under the context of the currently logged in user.
