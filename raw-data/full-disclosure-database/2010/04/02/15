-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists during the parsing of compressed mjpeg data
from a malformed .mov file. The application will utilize the width and
height fields in the file for calculating the size of a heap buffer.
When copying into this buffer, the application will use a different
field in the file to determine when to stop copying. If the first
calculated length is smaller than the one used for decompression, a
memory corruption will occur which can result in code execution under
the context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
