Subject: Vulnerabilities in Dunia Soccer

Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in system Dunia Soccer.

-----------------------------
Advisory: Vulnerabilities in Dunia Soccer
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/4083/
-----------------------------
Affected products: all versions of Dunia Soccer.
-----------------------------
Timeline:
17.03.2010 - found vulnerabilities.
30.03.2010 - disclosed at my site.
31.03.2010 - informed developers.
-----------------------------
Details:

These are Insufficient Anti-automation and Denial of Service
vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities exist in captcha script CaptchaSecurityImages.php, which
is using in this system. I already reported about vulnerabilities in
CaptchaSecurityImages (http://websecurity.com.ua/4043/).

Insufficient Anti-automation:

http://site/class/captcha/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=150&height=100&characters=2

Captcha bypass is possible as via half-automated or automated (with using of
OCR) methods, which were mentioned before (http://websecurity.com.ua/4043/),
as with using of session reusing with constant captcha bypass method
(http://websecurity.com.ua/1551/), which was described in project Month of
Bugs in Captchas.

DoS:

http://site/class/captcha/CaptchaSecurityImages.php?width=1000&height=9000

With setting of large values of width and height it's possible to create
large load at the server.

Best wishes & regards,
