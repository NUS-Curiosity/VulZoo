I think the issue is a bit deeper than that - the way most regulations are
drafted, they do *not* force entities to do what they should have done in
the first place.

What they *do* force is implementing a checkbox.

Whether said checkbox is actually the best solution *for the actual problem*
is the issue.  I've seen cases where checkbox auditors insisted that a
certain critical system "absolutely positively *HAD* to have a firewall".

Even though the the owners of the system were *more* paranoid, and had
done an even more thorough securing of the system by not even having a
network connection to the machine.

Now stop for a moment - what is the *reason* for logs being reviewed?

Is it acceptable to *not* review logs if there's a suitable "throw alert
on exception" mechanism in place?

Which is actually more long-term cost effective security for the organization?

That's the problem with most of the regulations - they enforce checkboxes,
not actually dealing with the overall security posture in a sane way.
