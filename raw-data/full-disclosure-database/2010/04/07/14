Subject: Re: Compliance Is Wasted Money, Study Finds

That's not entirely the case. Auditors aren't robots. It's their job to make
determinations about your organizations capabilities and how they map
against somewhat loosely defined compliance standards that have lots of
wiggle room and lots of gray areas. All the gray areas are extremely useful
to auditors so they can massage things around such that the organization can
pass and be happy and hire them again next year.

An auditor can very well see that your organization has a "throw alert on
exception" mechanism in place and determine that meets the "review logs"
requirement. box checked
