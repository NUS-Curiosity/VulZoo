Subject: Re: Compliance Is Wasted Money, Study Finds

That is not really surprising. Regulations are (fairly) clearly
defined 'tick box' exercises. They avoid three difficult requirements:
identifying what is important and should be protected; identifying
what is an acceptable response; and persuading the executive it is
worthwhile.

If you have a regulation (like PCI and HIPAA, for example) it defines
what should be protected and what is expected as a reasonable
response. The weight of the law, or a regulatory authority, that
defines fines and even makes CXOs personally responsible quickly gets
attention.

The best hope is that with a bit of innovative thinking infosec
professionals can implement a programme that covers various
regulations, finds synergy between them and properly protects valuable
assets. It should then be possible to cover other information assets
that are important to the organisation, but not covered by
regulations, at only incremental costs.

Personally I think the values created by Forrester are a bit suspect.
They don't give any information about the mix of industries and sizes
of the enterprises represented in the survey. My assumption is that
they are all Forrester customers. This means they are large and they
are extremely reliant on information and technology to run their
businesses.
