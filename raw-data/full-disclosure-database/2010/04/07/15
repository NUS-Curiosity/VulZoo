Unfortunately, that's far too often not true.  Internal audit departments
in particular seem to accumulate people with no real clue, because they
*don't* rely on passing the client in order to get the job again next year.
They stay around for the next fiscal year by showing a pretty list with "See
all the things we found wrong", not by "See all the creative solutions we
looked at and decided were in fact OK".
