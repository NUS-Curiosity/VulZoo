Fortinet Discovers Multiple Adobe Reader / Acrobat Vulnerabilities
(APSB10-09)

2010.April.13

 

Summary:

 

Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs has discovered two memory corruption
vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader / Acrobat, which allow a remote attacker to
compromise a system through a malicious document.

 

Impact:

 

Remote Code Execution.

 

Risk:

 

High.

 

Affected Software:

 

For a list of affected software, please refer to the Adobe Security Bulletin
reference below.

 

Additional Information:

 

Two memory corruption vulnerabilities were discovered in Adobe Reader /
Acrobat, each of which is highlighted below:

 

    * Memory corruption in "3difr.x3d". The vulnerable X3D component is a
plugin used to display 3D material, which when present in a PDF document,
can lead to exploitation (CVE-2010-0194).

    * Memory corruption through heap overflow in "CoolType.dll"
(CVE-2010-1241).

 

The vulnerabilities are triggered when opening and rendering a PDF document.
A remote attacker could craft a malicious document which exploits either one
of these vulnerabilities, allowing them to compromise a system.

 

Solutions:

 

    * Users should apply the solution provided by Adobe.

 

FortiGuard Labs released the following signatures to protect against these
vulnerabilities

 

    * "Adobe.Reader.DeviceRGB.Subtype.Stream.Memory.Corruption", previously
released as "FG-VD-10-003-Adobe" (CVE-2010-0194).

    * "Adobe.Reader.Acrobat.Pro.CFF.Encodings.Handling.Heap.Overflow",
previously released as "FG-VD-10-005-Adobe" (CVE-2010-1241).
