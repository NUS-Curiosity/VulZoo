-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems with vulnerable installations of Cisco Secure Desktop. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists in the Secure Desktop Web Install ActiveX
control (705EC6D4-B138-4079-A307-EF13E4889A82). The control fails to
properly verify the signature of the downloaded executable being
installed. By not verifying the executable a malicious attacker can
force the user to download and run any code of their choosing.
Successful exploitation leads to full system compromise under the
credentials of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Cisco has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
