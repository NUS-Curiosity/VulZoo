Subject: Silverstripe <= v2.3.4: two XSS vulnerabilities

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Silverstripe CMS, <http://silverstripe.org/>, version 2.3.4 and lower
(and its unreleased 2.4 branch), is vulnerable to two Cross Site
Scripting issues.

1. The comment posting mechanism of Silverstripe ('PostCommentForm')
fails to properly sanitize the 'CommenterURL' parameter. This allows for
persistent injection of HTML or javascript code within existing HTML tags.

2. The forum module is vulnerable to a reflective XSS issue caused by
the search script failing to properly sanitize input to the 'Search'
parameter. When invoking this URL:
SILVERSTRIPESITE/forums/search/?Search=%22%20onmouseover=%22javascript:alert%280%29;%22
trying to reorder the search results will trigger execution of the
injected javascript code.


According to its quickly responding developers, Silverstripe version
2.3.5 fixes both issues:
