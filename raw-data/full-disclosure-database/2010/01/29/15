Subject: Fingerprinting web applications (Joomla,
	Mediawiki and Wordpress)

Hi List,

I just posted a document on fingerprinting web applications where I show
some ideas to remotely detect the version of Joomla, Mediawiki and Wordpress
(easily extended to other apps).

There is also a live tool for you to test with any site:
