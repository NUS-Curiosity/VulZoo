Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in XAMPP (advisories #1
	and #2)

Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about multiple vulnerabilities in XAMPP. I disclosed at
my site multiple vulnerabilities in XAMPP in 2009 (in total 7 advisories).
And informed developers about them.

Also I published these vulnerabilities at securityvulns.ru
(securityvulns.com). And now I'm informing you about them. I will combine 7
advisories in 4 letters to mailing list.

-----------------------------
Advisory #1
-----------------------------
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in XAMPP
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/3220/
-----------------------------
Timeline:

09.12.2008 - found the vulnerability.
10.06.2009 - disclosed at my site.
11.06.2009 - informed developers.
-----------------------------
Details:

This is Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

XSS:

Vulnerability in xamppsecurity.php.

http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2009/XAMPP%20XSS.html

Vulnerable are XAMPP 1.6.8 and previous versions. And potentially next
versions (including last version XAMPP 1.7.1).

-----------------------------
Advisory #2
-----------------------------
Multiple vulnerabilities in XAMPP
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/3230/
-----------------------------
Timeline:

11.06.2009 - found the vulnerabilities.
13.06.2009 - announced at my site.
14.06.2009 - informed developers.
16.07.2009 - disclosed at my site.
-----------------------------
Details:

These are Predictable Resource Location, Information Leakage, Cross-Site
Scripting and Directory Traversal vulnerabilities.

Predictable Resource Location:

There are standard paths to resources in XAMPP, which can be used for
attack.

http://site/security/ - security service of XAMPP
http://site/xampp/ - admin panel of XAMPP
http://site/phpmyadmin/ - PhpMyAdmin
http://site/webalizer/ - Webalizer

Information Leakage:

http://site/webalizer/

Access to Webalizer is not restricted and taking into account that path to
the resource is known, anyone can gain access to statistic of the site,
which can lead to considerable information leakage, including about
different resources at the site.

Information Leakage:

http://site/security/

Security service of XAMPP (XAMPP SECURITY [Security Check 1.0]), if access
to it is opened, leads to information leakage.

It shows information about version of PHP and about status of components of
XAMPP, particularly PhpMyAdmin.

XSS:

http://site/xampp/showcode.php?TEXT[global-showcode]=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

Directory Traversal:

http://site/xampp/showcode.php?showcode=1&file=../index.php

Works with register globals on.

Vulnerable are XAMPP 1.6.8 and previous versions. And potentially next
versions (including last version XAMPP 1.7.1).
