Subject: [OOT] VPN Benchmark

Hi All,

I just want to know if there is a VPN Benchmark application that can be used
to do following tasks :

1. Emulate 4k users
2. Login to VPN over PPTP or L2TP
3. Emulate browsing activity

Maybe someone knows? My most important target is to know how many client can
be logged in on my current VPN server.

Thank you.

Fajar
