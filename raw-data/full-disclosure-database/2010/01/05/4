Subject: Re: [Tool] DeepToad 1.1.0

I looked into a fair amount of this sort of normalization back when I was
playing with dotplots.  The idea was to upgrade from simple Levenshtein
string comparison (with no knowledge of variable length x86 instructions,
pointers that shift from compile to compile, etc) to something with at least
some domain specific knowledge.  What I found, somewhat surprisingly, was
that dumb string comparison was more than enough.  In fact, when I compared
pre-patch and post-patch builds, it was easy to directly see when content
was added, removed, shifted in location, etc.  Joxean's going to have much
the same result -- as basic as his similarity metric is, he'll get the broad
strokes just fine.

Ultimately the best approach is to build a graph of how functions interact
and measure graph isomorphism, but of course Halvar figured that out years
ago :)
