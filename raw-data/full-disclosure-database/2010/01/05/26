Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in PHP, the worst of which leading
to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/php      < 5.2.12                              >= 5.2.12

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below and the associated PHP release notes
for details.

Impact
======

A context-dependent attacker could execute arbitrary code via a
specially crafted string containing an HTML entity when the mbstring
extension is enabled. Furthermore a remote attacker could execute
arbitrary code via a specially crafted GD graphics file.

A remote attacker could also cause a Denial of Service via a malformed
string passed to the json_decode() function, via a specially crafted
ZIP file passed to the php_zip_make_relative_path() function, via a
malformed JPEG image passed to the exif_read_data() function, or via
temporary file exhaustion. It is also possible for an attacker to spoof
certificates, bypass various safe_mode and open_basedir restrictions
when certain criteria are met, perform Cross-site scripting attacks,
more easily perform SQL injection attacks, manipulate settings of other
virtual hosts on the same server via a malicious .htaccess entry when
running on Apache, disclose memory portions, and write arbitrary files
via a specially crafted ZIP archive. Some vulnerabilities with unknown
impact and attack vectors have been reported as well.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version. As PHP is
statically linked against a vulnerable version of the c-client library
when the imap or kolab USE flag is enabled (GLSA 200911-03), users
should upgrade net-libs/c-client beforehand:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/c-client-2007e"
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-5.2.12"
