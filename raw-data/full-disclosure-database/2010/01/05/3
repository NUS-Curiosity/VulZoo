Subject: Re: [Tool] DeepToad 1.1.0

Hmm,
Wouldn't it be more useful to the sec community to have a algorithm
that abstracts at the -interpreted- content level? That is when
analyzing binaries I wouldn't think that this would classify two with
near identical functionality together, even though it is removing a
significant chunk of information during the hash pass.

I would largely assume that your algorithm, as is, works best on
uncompressed bitmaps. Is there something I'm missing?
