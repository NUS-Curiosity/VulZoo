Subject: Re: [Tool] DeepToad 1.1.0

Joxean's stuff is similar to Nilsimsa or (as he mentions) ssdeep, in that
it'll find mostly similar instances of the same underlying data, assuming
only small bit-level changes (such as from version shifts).  It's obviously
not a magic unpacker of any arbitrary virus, though.

His stuff, by its very nature, is a fuzzy similarity metric, meaning if you
run it on small chunks of a file sequentially you can get fuzzy diff.

Detecting multiple files of the same file type is actually a different
problem, and sort of an interesting one.  The best thing to do here is take
a large number of samples that *are* your file type, and then a large number
of samples that *are not* your file type (and are not the same other
not-the-right-type), and look for either strings or statistical patterns
that show up in the member set and not in the alternate.  These fingerprints
are then sought in other samples.

It's not terribly common that you actually need to do this though.  Browsers
need to do this a bit because MIME types are wonky.  They do this
optimization by hand though.
