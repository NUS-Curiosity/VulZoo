Like seriously omg, omfg! =O

You think you really got romeo figured out, exposed, owned and shit?

romeo did not use a proxy, almost everyone i know, knew that romeo 
is from Saudi Arabia, and yet none of you 'well-funded top notch 
security experts' (lmao) were able to ever get anywhere near the 
guy, like omg wtf dude...

oh wow you can has recovery of files, but did you ever figure out 
how you guys got pwnt in the first place? NO LOL.

tell us mr sec expert, tell us how did asta loose there server and 
dignity infront of everyone after they saw what kinda shit you guys 
do on there, better yet, tell us what happened to your OWN server 
like 10 times in a row, wiped once, wiped twice, wiped thrice, etc. 
lulz rawr much?

What else did your expert forensic investigation tell you?, other 
than using recovery tools and strings, do your really think you got 
any skills in there? doooo eeeet and tell us how the hackers got in 
-_-


"With the use of sleuthkit in our investication we validated the 
existance of the hax directory and the ll.tar 
file on /dev/sdb2"

OMG IT TAKES SO MUCH SKILLS TO VALIDATE THAT, RESPECT.. lol -_-

k, very cool story, bro.. very cool story, now i am talking from a 
completely viewer perspective here, do not count me in any sides or 
anything, but from what i can see, the kid got your shit owned last 
summer in his summer break being bored and shit, took you the bunch 
of well-funded, top notch, awesome security experts all year long 
to come up with this.. the audience requests more!, get romeo 
behind bars and let the world see it or atleast, ATLEAT figure out 
how the dude got into your servers, that should be a whole lot of 
help to the security industry right? should not be hard really, you 
got his intel figured out, you got a whole connection between 
'romeo' and 'Faisal Hourani', a good list of dynamic IP's from a 
Saudi Arabian ISP, do it already and take down anti-sec for lyfe!

eh, good luck and everything with the destruction etc etc, but let 
me remind you:

"The reason that we decided to start looking into this subject, was 
to see how and why my dedicated hosting
server was compromised despite the fact that it was secure enough 
to provide access to the outside world."

....10,000 lines later, a year and loads of experts behind your 
back and you still cant figure out the 'how' :]

Much Love,
