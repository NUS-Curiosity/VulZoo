Subject: Re: Antisec for lulz - exposed (anti-sec.com)

The exposure timestamps are showing that they had access since day 
one, how do u explain that?

ps: If I had the 'how' and as rumored being an 0day exploit I would 
keep it for myself

Either way it was a good New Year LULZ:)

Happy New Year kid.. Keep trying..
