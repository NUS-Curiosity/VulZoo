Synopsis
========

A Denial of Service condition in ntpd can cause excessive CPU or
bandwidth consumption.

Background
==========

NTP is a set of the Network Time Protocol programs.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /    Vulnerable    /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/ntp      < 4.2.4_p7-r1                    >= 4.2.4_p7-r1

Description
===========

Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov discovered that ntp_request.c in ntpd
does not handle MODE_PRIVATE packets correctly, causing a continuous
exchange of MODE_PRIVATE error responses between two NTP daemons or
causing high CPU load on a single host.

Impact
======

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted
MODE_PRIVATE packet, allowing for a Denial of Service condition (CPU
and bandwidth consumption).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All NTP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/ntp-4.2.4_p7-r1"

References
==========
