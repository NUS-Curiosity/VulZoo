Subject: Fake AV SPIM using Security Resercher's sigs,
	presumably culled from lists like this.

So, someone has been using my sig in FakeAV promoting SPIM on Skype. One
of the defrauded users called me, since they even included the phone
number.

If they're doing it impersonating me, they're probably using lots of
others too.
