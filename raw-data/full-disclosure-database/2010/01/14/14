Subject: Some SQL inj and including hints

Hi all,

1. On Win systems use short directories names like that:
Progra~1 == "Program Files"
Docume~1 == "Documents and Settings"
if you want to create file in space contained folder using INTO
OUTFILE/INTO DUMPFILE injection/
Example:
http://localhost/inj.php?id='/**/INTO/**/OUTFILE/**/%22C:/PROGRA~1/APACHE/VAR/WWW/index.php%22

In other cases your can't write file using MySQL if their absoute path have
a spaces.

2. Use .phtml extension instead of .php to fraud WebApplicationFirewalls
and filters.
Default apache2 configuration file like this:

<IfModule mod_php5.c>
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3
AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
</IfModule>

Sorry for my bests English.
