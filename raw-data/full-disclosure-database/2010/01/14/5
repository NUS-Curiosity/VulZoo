Subject: Re: All China, All The Time

Yikes.  More information.  The tag was supposed to say "If you can read this, don't reply because my servers won't get it" or similar.  However, as it turns out, it said something more like "if you can read this, don't reply because you are not welcome."  Thanks Google Translate - of course, it's my fault for trusting the thing and not realizing how badly something could come across. 

Anyway, like I said, I was trying to be witty (you know, like a "if you can read this" bumper sticker) but I should keep my comments to English.  I didn't mean to imply that I had something against the Chinese people, which I really don't - I just take issue with the networks, not the people.

Hope that clears that up.  So much for my trip to Hong Kong.
