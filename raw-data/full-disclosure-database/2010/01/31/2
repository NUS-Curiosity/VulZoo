Subject: [tool] efipw v0.2 (Apple Open Firmware / EFI
	Password Tool)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


efipw is a tool that can be used to decode and modify Apple EFI firmware
passwords via the command line.  It is designed after the non open
source OFPW utility and is designed to work on Intel machines running
Leopard or newer.  Useful for lab deployments (setting the firmware
password of machines as a post install item) and pen tests (recovering
the EFI firmware password).

New in version 0.2:
- - complete Python rewrite
- - a few more command line options
- - it works on Snow Leopard again
