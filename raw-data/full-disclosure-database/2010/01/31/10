Subject: Evidence of fake security research from SecurStar
	GmbH

Ok, now we have the evidence: The research was a fake security  
research arranged for a marketing campaign.

They was able cheat most journalists, bloggers and security magazines.

I don't remember in all my life a so irresponsible and dirty marketing  
trick in the security world, abusing of hackers reputations.

Read below, they leaked the IP of the anonymous author of http://infosecurityguard.com 
  and it's confirmed that it come from SecurStar GmbH office:

Evidence that infosecurityguard.com/notrax is SecurStar GmbH â€“ A fake  
independent research on voice crypto (by me)
Dishonest security: The SecurStart GmbH case (by me)
Debunking Infosecurityguard identity from Matteo Flora .

It's hilarious and unbelievable that a security company had done  
something like this.
