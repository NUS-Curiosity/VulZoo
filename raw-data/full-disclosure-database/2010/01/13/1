sunjester,

First of all, "security" is a myth. One can presume they're "secure"
(or secluded) from danger sitting behind a firewall, but to do so is
just foolish.

Second, how exactly does a firewall prevent
(google|msn|twitter|facebook|take-your-pick) from archiving vital
information, such as: search query history, financial information,
surfing habits, buying habits, relationships, hobbies, interests, etc?
With that amount of data, how can you (or anyone) believe the
integrity of your privacy is uncompromised just because you're,
"(behind a firewall)"?

Finally, uuh - no... My security is my security, and my privacy is my
privacy. I do not "give up" either of them when viewing anything
online. I do, however, put them at risk.

And who are you tell me I should give up my privacy/security when
surfing the Internet because I owe something to the "casual" user[s]?
Casual users are typically the ones ruining the experience for the
rest of us, and I don't owe anyone of them sh-t. You really believe
everyone using the Internet should forfeit their privacy and security
because they owe you something? That's "the price YOU" might pay, but
not everyone would agree, firewall or not.

Guy
