People in power love to say "if you have nothing to hide then nothing to
worry about" when it comes to tracking, keeping data, searching data etc
etc 1984 et al...but this is wrong. I'm not doing anything wrong in my
eyes, but that may mean topperling the over bearing government that
wants us all chipped, so my privacy is worth a lot. Once it's too late,
it will be very difficult to get privacy back.

Whether you believe this 1984 malarkey or not, you still should care
about privacy and your data. Hiding it is a good thing, if your doing
anything you shouldn't or not.
