Subject: Fwd:  All China, All The Time

Reading your article especially the following:
"What was special about China in regards to Slammer?
Was it true what others have said about China being a festering
cesspool of malicious network activity?
Were the boxes just all unpatched?
Was China just being used as a launching pad for attacks sourced elsewhere?"

That reminded me on China's Green Dam Project (GDYP), for those not
familiar with the name, it was an internet/network filtering software,
a very bad one at that.
Citing reliable sources, it merged irreparably with the guest OS, it
was so badly made that a file named with a restricted (blacklisted)
word/phrase caused the filter to blow up the shell.
Not only that, it had serious security flaws, 2 of which allowed
remote execution.
To top the cake, it was imposed by the government to be used on its
citizens' computers and manufacturers had to install it on their
systems to be sold.

A writeup on the matter can be found here:

> Here's an article I wrote about a 1.5 years ago on the subject if it has any relevance to you.
