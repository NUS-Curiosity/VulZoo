Only if obtained by correct process of law and you resist the temptation
to "explain yourself" to the police.

You're forgetting that you aren't required to explain yourself in court
(5th Ammendment). It's the job of the prosecution to connect the dots
and prove you're guilty. Smart defendants hire their own expert to
refute the testimony of of the prosecution's "expert".

As to Wikipedia, I think a random overwrite pattern would be way better
than them finding fragments of the following (just two examples) :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_design
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prostitution

Practically every illegal act has an article on Wikipedia .. why
deliberately "seed" your hard disk with them?
