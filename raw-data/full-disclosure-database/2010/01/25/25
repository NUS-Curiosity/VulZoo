Silent? .. it's right on the "news" section of the e107.org front page.
To wit :

        **SECURITY UPDATE** 0.7.17

We were recently informed of a very nasty exploit that, as far as we can
see, affects almost all e107 0.7 releases. Everyone running e107 needs
to get their sites updated as soon as possible. If you are a site owner
and you are unable to upgrade for some reason (too much hacked core
code), please contact me directly and I can help you with a quick-fix.

Please get the word out to all other e107ers. If you find an e107 site
out there, post on their site somewhere about this upgrade.
