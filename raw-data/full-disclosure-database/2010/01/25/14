How do you know what they'd search for, and if you did, why would you
want to fill your drive with a bunch of related information?

Modern forensic tools are good enough to find your "needle" in that
"haystack" in short order, regardless of how well you try to hide it in
plain sight among the contents of wikipedia, et.al.

If you truly desire to "hide in plain sight", consider Steganography [*1*].
If you want to create "plausible deniability", consider TrueCrypt's
hidden volumes [*2*].
