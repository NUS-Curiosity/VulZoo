Subject: Re: Disk wiping -- An alternate approach?

Ok, i extract wikipedia in my computer... then latter delete the
html... @hdd level the place is marked freespace. then i copy a few
videos, write a few emails and by then if most of the things gets
deleted and by bad luck if any such content is left unoverwritten
partially producing "questionable" and "surprising" patterns
UNKNOWINGLY of just a few phrases, then basically someone is screwed
just like that, even without GUILT ?!

So, copying dictionary, webpages, encyclopaedia, research paper etc in
your computer can really be harmful sometimes !!!?

Anything on the internet if its a webpage can land on anyones computer
while browsing, searching online, following links and with a lot of
coincidences etc AND NOT NECESSARILY whatever text chunks found in
your hdd is content OF YOUR OWN. YOU READ TO BLOGS OF PEOPLE, VISIT
FORUMS, joke around in FD etc....... (get the idea) and it can be
saved in disk cache and IF be leftover in disk as broken chunks of
texts you are screwed ? How does law see all that.............

So, if a "questionable" content is found it doesnt mean the laptop
owner is responsible for it. We even keep on skipping text while
reading in forums online and anyone can say anything online and it can
land in your hdd as TROJAN HORSE of OPINIONS to screw you latter in
life !!!?

Think about it?


Maybe then Alice/chatterbox run through the free/slack/etc... space of
your harddisk idea is better?

It would be intellectual uphill challenge for the EXAMINERS given that
someone may have to shift 1 terabyte of data (how many bytes?:) mostly
by HUMAN RESOURCE in hope for a ___ in the haystack..........

bty, how many BOOKS is that? :P
