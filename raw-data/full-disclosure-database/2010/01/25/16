Ok, thanks Michael !

I call off all the theories, except: As you told "Possession is
9/10ths of the law" BUT the texts they find can very likely come from
the internet while you browse the internet and not your own possession
and someone typed it from online and it lands on your disk while you
browse it?

DONT MISS THIS MAIN POINT! How does the law sees such a situation?
(and except the possibility of linguistic analysis to prove guilty)
