In particular, one must be *very* careful to not create unintended
consequences. For instance, in general the more regulated an industry is, the
more risk-adverse the companies get - both because regulation implies "don't
rock the boat" and the second-order effects of compliance paperwork and similar
issues.  Look at the mountains of paperwork needed to get the FAA to
type-certify a new airplane as airworthy - what if Microsoft had to do that
level of detail for Windows 8, the next release of Exchange, and the next
release of Office?

How do you make Microsoft "regulated" in any meaningful sense, and still allow
them the ability to ship an out-of-cycle patch?
