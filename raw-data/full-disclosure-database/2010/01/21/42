Given Microsoft's already poor reputation regarding security, I'm not sure
how it'd be possible for them to degrade their reputation any more.  Very
few people use Microsoft software because of its security reputation.  The
main reasons for using Microsoft are ease of use and compatibility with
other users.  Given that, I'm not sure that Microsoft's perception will be
affected very much in the user community.
