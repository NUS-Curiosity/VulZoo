Details.
TheGreenBow is an IPsec VPN client that sets up a secure channel
for data transport.

TheGreenBow VPN Client is vulnerable to a local stack based buffer
overflow which can lead to the compromise of a vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when processing
certain sections of tgb (policy) files. Passing an overly long
string to "OpenScriptAfterUp" will trigger the overflow.

Successful exploitation results in the execution of arbitrary code.

Solution.
A patch is available from the vendor (unverified) and will be
included in the next release.

Discovered by.
Brett Gervasoni from SOS Labs.
