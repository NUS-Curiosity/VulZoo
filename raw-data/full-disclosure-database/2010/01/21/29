ZDI-10-013: Microsoft Internet Explorer Table Layout Reuse Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-013
January 21, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-0245

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Internet Explorer 8
Microsoft Internet Explorer 7

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists when specific elements are used within a table
container. If one of these elements is removed the application will
unlink the element from the layout tree incorrectly. When this tree is
later traversed, the application will reuse the object that has been
freed which can lead to code execution under the context of the current
user.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
