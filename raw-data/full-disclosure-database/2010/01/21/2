That's a red herring. His point was the public perception of the
software company-- true or not-- would be hindered because Microsoft
is all-encompassing. Compared to the world of open-source, the risk is
distributed by the sheer virtue of software engineering being
distributed amongst thousands of entities. This means that the
vulnerabilities are spread across different parties, rather than
having all vulnerabilities encompassed by a single party-- in this
case, Microsoft.

His argument was irrelevant to corporations vs. open-source being more
vulnerable than one another-- it was simply a commentary on
distributed risk in software engineering.
