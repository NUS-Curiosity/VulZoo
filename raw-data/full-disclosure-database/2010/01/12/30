No I am not confusing the two. People want to separate them but fail to
notice they are both one in the same when you are "surfing the web". Being
secluded from danger (behind a firewall) or being hidden from the view
others (behind a firewall) sounds to similar for me to separate the two.

Your security is your privacy, and yes your privacy is your security. You
give them both up when viewing anything online, it's the price you should
have to pay to keep the the internet "safe" for casual users.
