Subject: BackTrack 4 Final Released

The BackTrack Dev Team is happy to announce the release of BT4 Final.

This is by far our best version yet, and signifies over a year of development work from the team and the community.
In the first 12 hours of the release, we've had over 10,000 downloads, 2 server crashes, and one of the largest publicly mentioned releases we have ever had.
The downloads are crammed now, torrent is definitely the faster way to go.

To support the new versions, we are proud to announce the creation of the backtrack-linux.org site.
On behalf of the entire team I would like to invite you to try it out.

Keep safe,

Muts and the BackTrack Dev Team
