ah, Google...

the only company in IT that can have an unpatched vulnerability
released to the world and get good publicity out of it.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not in the GoogleSucksAndIsEvil crowd... I
have friends that work for them, and I like to see a company like them
doing well.

Still, I can't help but suspect that one day in 50 years, Larry Page
is going to be lying on his deathbed when out of a puff of smoke
appears the Devil, who raises his trident and says "So, Mr Page, about
that soul you signed away..."
