Subject: Re: XSS vulnerabilities in 34 millions flash files

@Jeff
Of course they like XSS: the DB maintained by muts et al. is the
"prosecution" of milw0rm, since
str0ke gives up to mantain it.

I remember that str0ke didn't allowed to publish advisories ONLY
RELATED to xss (especially reflected ones, as they
are so common), but by the way I think is OK to publish there even the
most simple reflected XSS, especially if
is afflicting world used web-based products.

@MustLive
I see that people doesn't like your posts here on bugtraq: just try to
be more clear on your posts.
XSS vulnerabilities in FLASH files have been researched from many
years, and with a tool like
SWFintruder is so easy to find them: your post is not something new.
Is enough to take the Flash files you mentioned (used by joomal or
whatever), find the XSS, and then make a google search to see how many
sites are using
the vulnerable swf.

Interesting to know how many are vulnerable, but absolutely NOT SOMETHING NEW.

Cheers
