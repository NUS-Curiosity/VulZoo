Subject: Re: Antisec for lulz - exposed (anti-sec.com)

did you just come out as ProSec then, and not the reciever of information
like you previously claimed?


"We had good lulz watching u for months.. trust me.. Even yr post reply
shows
how much we broke your heart and how pissed off you are.. take it easy bro..
don't take it to the heart.."

"What you are about to read is the complete destruction of the "Anti-Sec"
group. An organization know as "ProSec" contacted us with reports containing
information about the entire group and how it was operating. We don't know
who they are, they appear to be well-funded and top notch security experts
and what they have done against the group is invaluable to us and others
that they have and or would have been targeted."

So, how are you funded? Tell us more about ProSec please.
