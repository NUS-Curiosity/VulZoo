Happy New Year!

As part of my New Year's
resolutions<http://skypher.com/index.php/2010/01/02/new-years-resolutions/>,
I am releasing some tools that I never got around to finish and/or publish.
First on the list is BETA3 <http://code.google.com/p/beta3/>, a multi-format
shellcode encoding tool that can convert raw binary shellcode into text that
can be used in exploit source-code. It can convert raw binary data to a
large number of encodings. It can also do the reverse: decode encoded data
into binary for the same types of encodings. This is the follow-up to
BETA2<http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/656>
.
