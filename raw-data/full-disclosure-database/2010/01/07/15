Subject: VMware server (2.0.2) insecure file creation

Have anyone noticed that the files created by the VMware server
installer all have the 777 permissions
to it?

I just installed it on two systems with the same problem....

These are the alerts coming from ossec (the whole /usr/lib/vmware is 777):

File '/usr/lib/vmware/hostd/docroot/print.css' is owned by root and
has written permissions to anyone.
File '/usr/lib/vmware/hostd/docroot/client/clients.xml' is owned by
root and has written permissions to anyone.
File '/usr/lib/vmware/hostd/docroot/sdk/vim.wsdl' is owned by root and
has written permissions to anyone.
.. more hundred files...
File '/usr/lib/vmware/hostd/docroot/sdk/vimServiceVersions.xml' is
owned by root and has written permissions to anyone.
File '/usr/lib/vmware/hostd/docroot/error-32x32.png' is owned by root
and has written permissions to anyone.
