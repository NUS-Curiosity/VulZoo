So let me see if I got this the right way. 

You guys are allowing an unknown company to scan for your webapps, 
being those apps business critical or not. On top of that, the 
unknown company is based on a country where government supports 
acts of electronic espionage against other nations, mainly those 
where you guys are based.

Is this correct? or am I missing something?
