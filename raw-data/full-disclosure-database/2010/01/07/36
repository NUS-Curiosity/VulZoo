I suspect it's a case of bad reporting and they confused MAC and IP addresses:

"For now, it works only on FiOS routers supplied by Verizon, and then only when
users are logged in to the device's administrative panel."

I'm guessing it works by poking the router, asking it what its upstream IP
address is, and then geolocating that.
