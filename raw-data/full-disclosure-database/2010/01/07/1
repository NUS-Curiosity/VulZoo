Thank you for your analysis. It really helps me.

And I also found the PDF report mail to us is in Chinese, in the website of
iiScan, however, to see the report of html or PDF format is English (of
course can change to Chinese).

Well, this scanner managed to find a couple of low level vulnerabilities on
my site which were missed by both Nikto and Nessus.

Two directories allowed a directory listing and a test.php file I created,
an information disclosure vulnerability, was also detected. My dumb
ass forgot to delete this "test.php" file after I finished testing the
server.

Possible sensitive directories were also listed, however browsing to these
directories returned 403 errors, blank pages or a wordpress logon
prompt, which is what I expected.

So all in all this scanner seems to do it's job well. At least for a LAMP
server running wordpress

Of course I have addressed the vulnerabilities reported.

My command of the Chinese language is limited to zero, so I cannot
understand the pdf report emailed to me nor the information within the web
based report. Hopefully the developers will address this language problem.

regards
mrx
