Subject: Web Issue phpinfo.php

Hello all,

I am testing the tool nikto 2.1.0 against a Linux Box running Tomcat and
I have a doubt.

The report saids that could be a bug in the server: 

http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/430449


My surprise is that the server offers me to download de phpinfo.php

Does Somebody found the same issue before today?
Any idea?

Regards and thanks in advance.
