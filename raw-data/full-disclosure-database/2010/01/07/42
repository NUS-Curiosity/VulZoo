Not creepy, just a simple matter of scale.  I'm fairly sure that Google's
done several orders of magnitude more driving around than the other guys.

Main Street in beautiful downtown Grundy, Virginia.  Yes, it's that small. Yes,
Google drove by. I wonder how many other wardrivers have hit Grundy. ;)

(Full disclosure - Verizon did do a Wimax trial in Grundy serving about 1400
subscribers.  So if anything, there should be *more* wardriving hitting Grundy
than other similar small towns that that same Google drive-by drove through
that day.
