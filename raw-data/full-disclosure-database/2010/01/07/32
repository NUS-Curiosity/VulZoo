Gmen use Gmail how appropriate.

There is a point here, who's to say that there is full disclosure of the result of the scan?

But then again when professional and qualified pen-testers are used is there full disclosure?

who to trust?


I'm not professional nor skilled enough yet to trust myself, but when I am, I could still have an off day.
I am smart enough however to never submit a mission critical site to any online scanning system,
especially when unaware of the methods used. And I would never presume a site to be safe even if the scan reported so.

This system did reveal 3 low level security risks I did not detect with Nikto and Nessus.
However as I am a novice, this could have been a result of my lack of skill in using these tools.
