Yeah, because government employees want to state on-the-record from
their @leo.gov email address that "China is bad, m'kay?". Actually, in
all my (informal) contacts with FBI folks, I've never had one of them
say to use their "official" email address, it's always Gmail (or
something else) with PGP at the client side.

By the way, the FBI folks I've dealt with have been anything but
clueless. It's the local barny-fife types that provide the hilarity.

True, but when I see a bunch of *unsolicited* scans I know they're
malicious. You're asking for them, and then you don't know what happens
to the results.

It's not paranoia when they really *are* out to get you.
