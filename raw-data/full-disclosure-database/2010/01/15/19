	Cross site scriping Vulnerabilites in Testlink TestManagement and Execution System

Jeff ,

I dont know its right or wrong to disclose developer name in a timeline  but some times it helps finding the contact points of the vendor from old mail archive and in my case it did help. I know its debatable ..

There are lots of advisories which had used timelines and these have been released by reputed companies.

http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2009-October/071052.html

If Vendor is big company i guess its not a good idea to state Vendor name in timeline. But if vendor is opensource then i guess there is no harm giving developer name in timeline .Getting contact point of open source softwares can some times be painful.

Btw that i know there is no real world revelance of and exploit for XSS which triggers a jscript alert. The POC which i  gave with this advisory was just to Verify the issue as this particular XSS can only be exploited with an "Authenticated HTTP POST"
