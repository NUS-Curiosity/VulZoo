Can you explain how this is sophisticated.  It looks to me like most 
decent malware samples I've RE'd:

The result: triple encrypted shell code which downloads multiple 
encrypted binaries used to drop an encrypted payload on a target machine 
which then establishes an encrypted SSL channel to connect to a command 
and control network.

If they are so sophisticated and organized, then why do they continually 
get noticed shortly after the attack.  A major element that you fail to 
realize about these so called sophisticated attacks is stealth and 
persistence, which this attack lacks.
