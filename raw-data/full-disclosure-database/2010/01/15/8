For the most of us, passwords consist of dictionary words, so a good wordlist would contain that and permutations of it, not just gibberish. By the way, I've scouraged the internet for wordlists and I've seen entries with !@...^&*( , !@#$% , !@#$ , !@# and the others you've included.

On an American Keyboard !@...^&*( is shift and the numbers 1 to 9, for
English it's !"Â£$%^&*( but as he said it's just wordlists filled with
that, thinking someone might use it as a password, which I guess is
possible, it's probably better then your husbands name for example, but
still shit
