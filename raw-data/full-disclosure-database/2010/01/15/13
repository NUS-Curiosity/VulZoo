Subject: avi crashes explorer.exe if samsung pc studio
	fun_avcodec.dll present

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Attached 192 bytes long 192.avi file crashes explorer.exe if
fun_avcodec.dll is present in system.

fun_avcodec.dll is installed (at least) with samsung pc studio
software for samsung mobile phones.

Tested with win xp sp3. Install samsung pc studio 3.x, open folder
with 192.avi, explorer.exe crashes.

AppName: explorer.exe AppVer: 6.0.2900.5512 ModName: fun_avcodec.dll
ModVer: 0.0.0.0 Offset: 0000301a

Example path to .dll:
C:\Program Files\Samsung\Samsung PC Studio 3\fun_avcodec.dll

Rename fun_avcodec.dll to fun_avcodec.XXX or similar to avoid crash.

No idea if this is not a real problem (for samsung pc studio users)
or if it can be exploited any further. Try and find out...
