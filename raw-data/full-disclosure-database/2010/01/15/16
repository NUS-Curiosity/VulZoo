Not based on what I've read - it was a coordinated attack via email attachments, etc.  But who really knows?  Homeland Security described the "equipment" used in the "bombing" of flight 253 to be "a sophisticated device.  It was gunpowder sewn into the crotch of dude's tighty-whities.

But, I must say, at least someone found a use for that flap think in the front of the underwear.  I mean, I know what it's for, but I don't know anyone that actually uses it.

Oop, just made up a joke.  "What kind of underwear to Nigerian terrorists wear?  Fruit of the Boom."  Badum.

They used an IE exploit to get in. I don't understand Google said that they used a complex way to access their systems. AFAIK many home users are hacked daily the same way....

Interesting article on zdnet, talking about the targeting of the
lawful intercept system at Google

...they [hackers] apparently were able to access a system used to help
Google comply with search warrants by providing data on Google users,
said a source familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press.
"Right before Christmas, it was, 'Holy s***, this malware is accessing
the internal intercept [systems],'" he said.
