Description:
    In previous versions of openssl, calling CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data
    did not properly clean up data structures used in openssl's zlib 
    compression methods.  As a result, applications which called
    CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data and subsequently processed SSLv3
    requests would leak significant amounts of memory per request.
    
    In particular, this is known to affect systems running Apache httpd
    with mod_ssl and the php module loaded.  If httpd receives SIGUSR1
    (the "graceful" command), subsequent SSLv3 requests will cause
    increased memory consumption, and a possible denial-of-service.
    
    On unpatched systems, note that the impact of this vulnerability
    can be greatly reduced by tuning the MaxRequestsPerChild
    setting in the httpd configuration, as the memory leak does not
    affect the parent process.
