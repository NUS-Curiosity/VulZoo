Subject: Re: All China, All The Time

Mark, Dan, Smasher, etc. Thanks for the feedback.

I saw the thread this weekend, but I had to wait until I today to respond. My main motivation was to point out that there is no free lunch, and often even security professionals forget to think critically. It was not meant to be a thorough assessment of the actual 0-day. However I appreciate the correction, the details of the exploit, and the observation that its sophistication was probably exaggerated in the media.

I have changed some implicit wording in the article about China and added an addendum to the blog to clarify the exploit and thank sources.
