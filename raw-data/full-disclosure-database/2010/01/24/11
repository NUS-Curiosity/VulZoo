Bty, kaminsky -- who?


Serious Fact: People will be opportunistic "throughout time" to work on their
interest only, sadly......... :(

So noone seem to care each-others agenda......... see!

"FREE STEPHEN WATT" ------------> who?


Think: solution for all evil? the world will be a better place if we
all are opportunistic in terms if timeless-consciousness and even be
kind to "animals" every "time" and try avoid being opportunistic at
"point time" -- given that all dog will have its day? ;)

Hackers! Please learn to GIVE and RETURN favors more for the keyboard
connects us to eachother, BUT if you push it too hard on the keyboard
it will "reflect back" to your "identity" as a "habit"

BUT of-course we can always tease eachother sometimes!

RELAX!!!      :P
