Subject: Re: Perhaps it's time to regulate Microsoft as
	Critical Infrastructure?

The problem with regulating Microsoft as critical infrastructure is that it
simply entrenches the existing monoculture and all the problems that it
entails.  To really improve our position regarding security, the government
ought to encourage greater diversity and openness in the OS market.  Placing
operating systems under formal regulation would have the opposite effect.
It would increase the barriers to entry, discouraging diversity.  In effect,
this proposal will formalize Windows as the official OS of the federal
government.

Second, unless the government extends its regulation to cover all consumers,
there will be little to no improvement in security.  The vast majority of
exploited bugs are not 0-day vulnerabilities.  They are bugs that have been
discovered and patched.  The problem is that the consumer has not applied
the patch.  If the government really wanted to improve computer security,
they'd mandate that citizens keep up with patches to their operating system
and applications.  Such a mandate would have a far greater immediate impact
than any regulation of Microsoft or any other OS vendor.
