Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs has discovered you can eat all the Chipotle you want and still have underwear that sparkles and shines!

Impact:

If you're like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle but you hate all those terrible bloodstains in your underwear.

Risk:
=====
Critical, Act Now!

Additional Information:
=======================
Hi, Fortinet here with another fantastic product. If you're like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle, but you hate all those terrible bloodstains in your underwear. Well now there's a product that can clean even bloodstains caused by Chipotle right off your underwear - Chipotl-away! Just one Chipotle burrito can leave up to a quarter cup of underwear blood, but Chipotl-away makes your underwear clean and ready for more.

Solutions:
==========
Stop buying new underwear every time you eat Chipotle! That can cost you thousands. Chipotl-away gets rid of bloodstains and leaves underwear good as new. Imagine having underwear so clean you can practically eat off of it.

Now you can eat all the Chipotle you want, and still have underwear that sparkles and shines. Order right now!!
