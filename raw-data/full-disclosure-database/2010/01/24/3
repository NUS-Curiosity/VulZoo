Package        : dokuwiki
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bugs    : 565406
CVE Ids        : CVE-2010-0287 CVE-2010-0288 CVE-2010-0289


Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in dokuwiki, a standards compliant
simple to use wiki.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:


CVE-2010-0287

It was discovered that an internal variable is not properly sanitized before
being used to list directories. This can be exploited to list contents of
arbitrary directories.


CVE-2010-0288

It was discovered that the ACL Manager plugin doesn't properly check the
administrator permissions. This allow an attacker to introduce arbitrary ACL
rules and thus gaining access to a closed Wiki.


CVE-2010-0289

It was discovered that the ACL Manager plugin doesn't have protections against
cross-site request forgeries (CSRF). This can be exploited to change the
access control rules by tricking a logged in administrator into visiting
a malicious web site.


The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.0.20080505-4+lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.0.20090214b-3.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your dokuwiki package.
