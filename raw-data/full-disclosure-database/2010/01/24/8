Subject: Disk wiping -- An alternate approach?

Dear all,

(I need some feedbacks/insights/comments? on this design concept)

Problem:
- The absence of evidence 9 times out of 10 is just as bad as the
evidence itself in court.
- What you type text or email can, and will, be used against you in a
court of law.


But: Digital Communication" has been the our part of life 24x7 and as
in "advertisement" we the netizens these days tend to "instantly
communicate" as with the "flow of our thought" without thinking all
the time & in every mood state, and even when drunk! Our communication
are as fluid as thoughts nothing more and seriously influenced by day
to day activities and a lot of things.

Because as in one-to-one communication people fake, joke, write to
check a response, simply scare etc in electronic communication
too..... but sadly it gets recorded and people with big equipments and
schizophrenia tent to take it all seriously!

Internet records a blur picture of who we are in "real" nothing more.
Even evidence suggest people tend to think freely? and to any extreme
at privacy of your desktop asif you are talking to yourself instantly.

How does a court sees all that?

Sadly, today we have technology to record it all. If you judge someone
24x7 you may find all evidenced to support all ends of extremes and
anything ?


So, plausible deniability solution for disk wiping?:

Let, disk wiping tools LOAD the whole WIKIPEDIA in nxn matrices and
mix ALL the words & phrases in a random pool continuously and use THIS
as the "Wiping passes and patterns" while they wipe the disk-space
(instead of using random-pass or zero) and let the people who dont
need-to-know make sense of whatever they want to pull up from the
'patterns' generated from the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNOWLEDGE & unlimited
keywords and phrases and counter the same?

Is any such software feature allowed by law or is it called "Material
Falsification" ?
