Bipin,

You're got your priorities wrong, and unfortunately many companies are
coming to the same conclusion.

The problem with security is fixing where is needed rather then shout out
"this product is secure" or "hardening".

What I'm talking about; Windows XP came with it's own Firewall, but please
note that it was a separate module (to an extent), not merged without C&C
inside the kernel, as security seems to be going today.

Indeed the worst enemy of security is complexity, and this shows, when you
get an OS which is inflexible and unusable without user input to make it
secure (Unix and now even Windows).

I consider this approach very wrong; you are mixing secure and insecure
processes, complicating matters, when actually there's only the need of one
single layer of tight security.

Same with browsers, there needs to be a security layer and companies need to
account for that layer, nothing more nor less.

My 2 cent.

Regards,
Christian Sciberras.
