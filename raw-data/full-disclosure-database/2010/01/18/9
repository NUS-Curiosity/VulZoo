Subject: Reminder: Campus Party EU 2010 Call For
	Participants

Last month we announced a technology event called Campus Party EU (
http://www.campus-party.eu/home-en.html), which will take place between 14
and 18 April 2010 in Madrid (Spain). We distributed a Call For Participants,
in which the chosen participants would attend different talks given by great
and well-known computer security speakers (Joanna Rutkowska, Stefano Di
Paola...), participate in a hacking contest, and enjoy the other areas of
the event, interacting with other European colleagues interested in new
technologies and innovation too.

We again recall that the travel and accomodation expenses are fully borne by
the organization, and it is still possible to submit us an abstract with
your personal information to the following e-mail address:

Two participants from each of the European countries will be chosen.

So if you were born in one of the member countries which consolidate the
European Union, you are a computer security enthusiast, interested on R&D,
developing any projects and want to live a wonderful European level
experience without worries about the travel or accomodation, do not hesitate
to send us a brief CV (in english) and we will contact you.
