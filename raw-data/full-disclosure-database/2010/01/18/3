Subject: Network flaw causes scary Web error

Would be fun to try and replicate this....

A Georgia mother and her two daughters logged onto Facebook from mobile
phones last weekend and wound up in a startling place: strangers' accounts
with full access to troves of private information.

The glitch -- the result of a routing problem at the family's wireless
carrier, AT&T -- revealed a little known security flaw with far reaching
implications for everyone on the Internet, not just Facebook users.
