I'm still incredulous as to how many high-profile companies fell for an IE
exploit.
Knowing many PC were for development, how many developers out there actually
use IE?
I'm not getting into the "IE is bad" crap, I'm just saying it was the very
ultimate worst an IE 0day could get.
I'm not buying this though, there's too much talk and little evidence.

Regards,
Christian Sciberras.
