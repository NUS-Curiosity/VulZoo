Christian!

I may not be "wise" as you all.... but i left FD long back --- still i
happen to stumble into security bugs every now and then. No i dodnt
sat on a chair to look for it! It JUST followed me like a shadows.

I hate it...........

At one point in time i got so sick of it all, i stopped my counting of
my number of advisory...... but that doesnt help either.

BOTTOM LINE: ITS A PROBLEM BY ARCHITECTURE! A direction where infinite
things can go wrong because "your teeth are stronger if your roots are
stronger"?

With due respect, I dont want to waste a life working on something
like that for my whole life......................... nothing
meaningful @end!

Just business and politics that is fueling this ecosystem and we are
like the soldiers fighting for "virtue"?

f*** it  ............

THINK ABOUT IT.
