Subject: On voice crypto product cracking: a nice story

Hi all,

i don't know how many of you have read about the analysis done on http://infosecurityguard.com 
  .

I have made a detailed analysis of their initiative and the result is  
that:

- it's most probably a camouflage marketing initiative and not a  
independent security research
- they consider a security context where local device has been  
compromised (no software can be secured in that case)
- they do not consider cryptographic security arguments

Below my analysis on this (read it carefully):

Maybe it's interesting, maybe not, but for sure some facts are very  
relevant!
