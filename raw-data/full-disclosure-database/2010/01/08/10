Well, as it pertains to WGA, the hack was to include the following in
./system32/drivers/etc/hosts :

127.0.0.1 mpa.one.microsoft.com

If you have a router that can run [DD|Open]WRT, you can mount a SMB
share and run tcpdump -w /that/share on your connection to see exactly
what your system of choice is "doing" network-wise. You can also do this
with a hub and another computer (or even directly on the box with
winpcap, assuming you trust that M$ didn't do some trickery that would
lie to it).

If you want to get fancier still, run Quagga on a linux box with a BGP
feed from somewhere and blackhole AS8060, AS8069, AS8705, AS3598, and a
couple of others I'm too lazy to look up at the moment .. and route your
traffic through that.
