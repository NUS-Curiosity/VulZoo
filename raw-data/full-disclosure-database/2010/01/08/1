Agreed, there are a lot of things that "try to" phone home.

I would have less dislike for MS data collection practices if there
was a tick box along the lines of "disable all communication with MS servers"
Perhaps with the exception of OS updates with the only information sent to MS
being the current patch level of the machine to be updated.
After all what other info do they need to update the OS?

I concur with your appraisal of Google. That's why I use Scroogle, don't use Chrome
and block analytics, syndication, adservices and doubleclick.

I guess I am just paranoid.

ps I wish Thunderbird would default to the list when replying.
