Subject: Re: Facebook Query Language (FQL) security issue

First of all, please excuse my language, it needs to be improved.

I did try the FQL query with three test accounts of mine and It was
successful. I could take the albums id and then the src of the pictures
in a particular album. Well, It isn't so difficult but you need some
knowledge or someone giving to you the code to paste to get the
information. I mean, it can be done when anyone has interest.

Did you told to Facebook about?
Do you have an answer from facebook yet?
