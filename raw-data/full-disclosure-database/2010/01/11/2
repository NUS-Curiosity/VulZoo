Subject: Testival released

During shellcode development, it makes sense to have a program that can
easily load your shellcode at a controlable location, allows you to set
registers and memory to certain values and execute the shellcode by setting
EIP through a RET or CALL instruction.

The Testival <http://code.google.com/p/testival/> project aims to do all
those things and more: it also allows you to test ret-into-libc attacks, set
the type of memory allocation you want (RWEflags, etcâ€¦), report exceptions
in your code to stdout as well as load DLLs to test shellcode in DllMain.

Testival is used by ALPHA3 <http://code.google.com/p/alpha3/> for
automatically testing if all the en-/decoders work.

Testival requires SkyBuild <http://code.google.com/p/skybuild/> to
automatically build all files.
