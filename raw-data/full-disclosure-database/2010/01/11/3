iAWACS 2010 : Rules of the PWN2KILL contest
*****************************
http://www.esiea-recherche.eu/iawacs2010/


The PWN2KILL Contest aims at performing a comparative evaluation of
commercial
antivirus software against actual threats.

An actual threat can be defined as any threat that is operationnally
viable. The
purpose is to show that given fixed actual malware threats, the different
existing antivirus software are of inequal quality. While a few of them
are able
to proactively detect unknown malware using known malware techniques,
most of
them are just able to detect most of the known malware (not all of them).

Moreover, the in-depth analysis of existing antivirus software shows that a
significant number of malware technique that have been published -- by
hackers,
malware writers, researchers in computer security and computer virology
-- are
still not taken into account by commercial antivirus products while those
techniques indeed represent actual threats. Consequently, it is more
than useful
for the end user and the final consumer (since AV software are products
that we
buy) to know which antivirus at the less worst and which are the worst.

The contest board will be composed of a bailiff, of five professional
journalists from the computer technical press and of three personalities
from
the scientific/hacking community renowned for their personal ethics and
skills.

His role will be to record the test results, decide of their validity
and elect
the three most efficient attacks.

The contest will be based on the only admissible approach: the
experiment and
the attacker's view.

The rules are very simple:
   1.- A number of computers -- each of them with an antivirus installed --
       will be available. The environment will be
       - Windows 7 (in a virtual machine for an easy reconfiguration
purpose).
       - User mode (without privilege).
       - No connection to the Internet (to avoid ``external'' attacks or
         manipulation during the contest). However to enable truly
network-based
         attacks (input and/or output data), it will be possible upon
request
         to open temporarily an access to the Internet provided that no
attack
         will be launched from the testing machine towards external systems.
       - Common applications installed (Microsoft suite, OpenOffice Suite,
         Pdf reader...). Any additional application can be added upon
request
         or can be used through personal USB devices.
       - A printer will be available through the network (spec data
available
         upon request).

   2.- Each participant will come with his (malware) code(s) to test
against
       the antivirus software. He can perform any action that a normal
user can
       do (including rebooting the computer, closing a session, using USB
       devices...). In case of ``proactive'' warning from the operating
system
       or from any application, the user is free to follow them or not.
Any user
       has not to be an expert in computers in order to evaluate and
interpret
       technical warnings that sometimes refers to normal behaviours. As an
       example, warnings like ``an application is attempting to become
resident.
       Do you allow it?'' has no meaning for a grandmother using a
computer.
       She is free to allow it!

   3.- In order to make a comparative and fair testing, any code must be
tested
       against ALL antivirus selected for the challenge. The test will
consist
       in two step~: first the code(s) will be scanned (on demand analysis)
       then used as intended (on-access analysis).

   4.- Any participant will have first to announce what effect/attack he
intends
       to perform. The board will decide whether this attack is
admissible or
       not. An admissible attack is an attack which affect availability,
       integrity and/or confidentiality of the system and/or the data (data
       system, user data...).

   5.- Any participant will have to write a short technical summary of his
       attack(s) which will be published on the iAWACS website. He will
have to
       present his attack(s) during the contest debriefing. A copy of
its code
       will be given to the organizers of the challenge.

For fairness purposes, no participants working for any AV company or any
company sharing common interest with AV companies, will be allowed to
participate. Any participant will thus have to sign an assessment form
confirming he is not working for such companies.
 
The organizers of iAWACS 2010 and of the PWN2KILL challenge have
selected the
following antivirus software:
   -- Avast
   -- AVG
   -- Avira
   -- BitDefender
   -- DrWeb
   -- FSecure
   -- GData
   -- Kasperky
   -- McAfee
   -- Microsoft AV
   -- NOD 32
   -- Norton Symantec
   -- Trend Micro
 
Only commercial licences will be tested -- in other words they will be
anonymously bought in public stores/website (no demo or free version).
The antivirus will be updated right before the beginning of the challenge.

The organizers will publish a technical summary of the results once
validated
by the contest board. No communication will be done directly towards the AV
vendors. Only a technical communication and press conference will be
organized
during the iAWACS event. A technical summary will be available on the
iAWACS
website. The complete data and codes collected will be communicated only
to the
French CERT-A for analysis and feedbacks. No code will be neither
published nor
distributed.

Any participant is free to communicate later on about his test/code/attack
performed during the contest. In this case, iAWACS organizers are not
responsible for that communication.
