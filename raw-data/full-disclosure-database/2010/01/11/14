Whilst I agree entirely with these sentiments, at least tinyurl has a 
(I thought well-known) "preview" option that does not require a browser 
plugin -- simply prefix the tinyurl.com domain name with the "preview" 
sub-domain and instead of auto-redirecting you tinyurl will tell you 
the redirection URL.

Also, is using a commandline URL grabber like curl or wget to see the 
301 redirect terget really that difficult for a 1337 F-D hax0r such as 
yourself?

FWIW, the target URL is:

   http://securityextension.com/securitylab

which really doesn't seem worth the effort of shortening...
