I did but I use Firefox + NoScript in a vm for such things.
Admittedly still risky especially if the site pedals a certain kind of porn and is on a watch list.
I know I should really chain proxy or TOR to such links. Unfortunately this occurred to me after clicking the link.

There is not much to see here, it's a new site with next to no content.
There are couple of examples of the typical kind of spam one gets via email:Viagra and cheap software.
It has a blog format.
I believe the guy/gal is just promoting his/her site.

There is script on the page:
jQuery 1.2.6 - New Wave Javascript
drupal.js,v 1.41.2.4 2009/07/21

as well as google analytics stuff.

To my admittedly limited knowledge the site is benign
