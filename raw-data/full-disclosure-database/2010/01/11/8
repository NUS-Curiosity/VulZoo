Hi all readers,

Just releasing a very small tool I wrote called Durzosploit.

Durzosploit is a javascript exploits generator framework that works through
the console. This goal of that project is to quickly and easily generate
working exploits for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in popular web
applications or web sites.

Please note that Durzosploit does not find browser vulnerabilities, it only
is an framework containing exploits you can use.

More info can be found here:

can get it through the SVN:
