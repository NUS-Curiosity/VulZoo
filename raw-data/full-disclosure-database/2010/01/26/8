It depends on what you define "plausible deniability" as.  Sometimes it just doesn't matter.  At an industry event here in Seattle, a guy working for the state prosecutors office was speaking on this very subject - that of forensic collection of data on a system and the "presumption" of guilt.  

I posed the question of "how do you know that the data actually originated from actions of the user as opposed to someone who could have been using the system for their own means, or someone trying to plant false data?  How do you prevent one from impugning your findings?"

He said, "Well, we're not stupid."  I'm serious. I was extremely disappointed in that answer, and it basically said, "it doesn't really matter what we find on the system- we're not stupid, and if the data is there, it means you did it."  I was appalled. 

All you have is "deniability."  This method doesn't make it "plausible" to anyone but you, which doesn't matter.  If you want any level of meaningful "plausible deniability" then leave your wireless open and have your system riddled with bots.
