Subject: Re: Disk wiping -- An alternate approach?

I was thinking, since all this (reasonable) fuss on wiping a disk over 10
times to ensure non-readability, how come we're yet very limited on space
usage?
If, for example, I overwrote a bitmap file with a text one, what stops the
computer from recovering/storing both (without using additional space)?
Just a couple curiosities of mine.
