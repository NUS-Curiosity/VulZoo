Subject: Re: Disk wiping -- An alternate approach?

This discussion is getting weirder and weirder. If an examiner finds
evidence on YOUR computer / cell phone / usb disks / whatever, please do
tell me how it's not necessarily yours? By claiming your computer has been
hacked? You do know an examiner usually knows how to double-check your story
for malicious code right? Or what are you guys talking about?

My experience is that when I find the evidence, the person/s being
investigated confesses quite rapidly.

Cheers!
