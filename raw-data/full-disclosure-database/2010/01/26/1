Subject: Re: Disk wiping -- An alternate approach?

A few phrases and "surprising" patterns are a lot more suspicious than a
hard drive full of zeroes, especially if there's evidence that other data
has been overwritten or erased.  If you present a hard drive full of zeroes
or random numbers, there's nothing to charge you with.  If most of your data
is random gibberish but there are a few telling phrases here and there, then
there might be enough for the prosecution to bring charges, even if they
aren't able to get a conviction.

Remember, "innocent until proven guilty" is nice in theory, but not so nice
in practice.  While you're under investigation, the prosecution can do many
things to disrupt your business and personal life.  The best thing to do if
there's any question is to simply clam up and sit still until you get to
speak with a lawyer.  Remember, prosecutors are judged on their conviction
rate, not on their accuracy rate.  They have no incentive to look for
exonerating evidence - that's your responsibility.  They'll only look for
evidence that'll prove you guilty.  As such, its best to leave nothing at
all that would arouse suspicion, especially if you've done nothing wrong in
the first place.
