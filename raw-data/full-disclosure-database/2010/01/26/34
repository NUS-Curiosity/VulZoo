Subject: Re: Disk wiping -- An alternate approach?

Entropy vs zeros vs random content.

Plausible deniability will only be there if there is legitimate data
that looks like it's been used and the prosecutor cannot construe any
of your data as that used for wiping or otherwise obscuring the data
on your drive. If you don't have this you better request a trial by
judge rather than jury.

Now;
Your best solution is to use an exterior OS on FDE, then, in a TC
Hidden Disk container have a VM image that you use for 'hidden works.'
You can hand over your FDE's PW and location of TC disk including the
exterior password for great fed win.
