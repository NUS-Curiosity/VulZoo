Yep, that's precisely what I was trying to get across.  If the data is on
your machine, its presumed to be yours unless you can prove that there's
cause to believe that someone else put it there.  This dovetails nicely with
what I was saying above, i.e. the prosecutor is out to convict you.  He or
she is going to whatever data he or she can find in order to do that.  The
solution do this is not to plant more incriminating data, but to wipe out as
much data as possible, giving the prosecutor no hooks to hang a case on.
