Subject: Re: e107 latest download link is backdoored

Seems as if e107.org now is spreading some bad stuff:

Virus/Spyware Mal/ObfJS-CB! - at least that's what Sophos is telling me....

Wondering why the admins of e107.org still keep this site up & running
- the site should have been taken down right after they saw that it ws
compromised.

Irresponsible from the e107.org-guys, imho...

Gregor
