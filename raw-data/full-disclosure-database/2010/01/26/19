Subject: Re: e107 latest download link is backdoored

Here is my speculation on what happened:

A few days ago, somebody found and exploited a e107 0day (for 0.7.16) on
some websites. The e107 guys were informed about this and released
0.7.17 to fix this problem.

However, at this point I suspect they were already hacked because they
are running e107 on e107.org and they were an obvious target.

The attackers waited until they released the security fix (0.7.17) and
modified the zip file to include the backdoor.

At this point, most e107 site owners were rushing to upgrade because of
security update announcement and I suspect that many people have
downloaded the backdored binary.

However, this is just a speculation. I have no actual data behind it.
