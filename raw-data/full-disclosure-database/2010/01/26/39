Subject: Re: Disk wiping -- An alternate approach?

Are you suggesting that consumer magnet-based storage solutions use
the same technology that the recovery machines use to store more than
one bit in what you consider a 'single bit location' ?
I think it would be cost and space prohibitive, not dependent on any algorithm.
If I'm thinking correctly, and I have no real idea how the recovery
process works, the recovery machines measure minute variance in the
analog magnetic signal directly pulled from the platters to figure out
what bits 'used' to be on the disk in that location. I sincerely doubt
that anything consumer accessible would be able to work with that. I
also doubt that it is exact, and protocols probably use probabilistic
methods for extraction of a given content; text for example.
Given a block of bits, the signal variance from 'clean' on those bits
(eg if never written) is x.
x is matched with a dictionary of known text.

Anyone know to confirm?
