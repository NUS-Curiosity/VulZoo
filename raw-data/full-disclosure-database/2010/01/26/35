Subject: Re: Disk wiping -- An alternate approach?

Oh yeah, another note: If you use a chaining block cipher than you
only need to wipe the first block to make the rest of your data
unrecoverable. Most FDE's actually use a pw to decrypt the actual
decryption key, that block functions much the same, if you can wipe
that then the rest of the data is unusable.
Note, anyone who has pulled your key from memory via trojan or other
means at an earlier time will be able to recover your data unless the
first block of the stream has been wiped. This might be common
practice in sneak and peek routines.
