Subject: Re: Disk wiping -- An alternate approach?

Unknown malware? Infections recently deleted by A/V?

The realm of data ownership is ridiculous. If I run an wifi AP with
WEP or no auth, my router keeps no logs, and my computer is a host to
malware then I would imagine that I cannot be convicted of a computer
crime without verification by physical surveillance.

If given the choice by a lawyer between pleading guilty and receiving
a lenient punishment and pleading not-guilty to certain loss for
severe punishment in the face of 'irrefutable' evidence most people
will choose to plead guilty. Prosecutors, Lawyers, and defendants are
largely either ignorant or apathetic to the issues around proving
culpability in computer-crime.

And case law would back me up.
