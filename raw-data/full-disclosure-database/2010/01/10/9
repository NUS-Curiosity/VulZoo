Subject: Re: iiscan results - a closer look

Have you ever performed the same analysis of the tests the paid scanning
products perform?  I think you would be amazed at the similarities in their
general lack of intelligence and poor ability to make decisions based on
context and/or environment.

Also, what do you consider "good" about the checks it performed?  Very basic
' or 1 =1 stuff, with basic URL encoding at the "high end" of the test
cases.

<rant>

I'd argue that any organization without an application security program that
would use IIScan or a similar solution is actually LESS secure if they don't
understand that a simple scan isn't the same as having an actual approach.
Finding a few simple holes and fixing them doesn't constitute improving your
security posture, at all.
