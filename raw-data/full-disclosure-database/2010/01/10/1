Subject: Multiple D-Link Routers Vulnerable to
	Authentication Bypass

Multiple D­-Link routers suffer from insecure implementations of the Home
Network Administration Protocol which allow un­authenticated and/or
un­privileged users to view and configure administrative settings on the
router.

Further, the mere existence of HNAP allows attackers to completely bypass
the CAPTCHA login features that D­-Link has made available in recent
firmware releases.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited by an individual inside the local
network, as well as an external attacker.

It is suspected that most, if not all, D­-Link routers manufactured since
2006 have HNAP support and are vulnerable. However, only the following
routers and firmware versions have been confirmed to date:

         1) DI-­524 hardware version C1, firmware version 3.23
         2) DIR-­628 hardware version B2, firmware versions 1.20NA and
1.22NA
         3) DIR­-655 hardware version A1, firmware version 1.30EA
