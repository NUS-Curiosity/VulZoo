Hello Jeff!

Happy New Year for you!

I see you liked my letter about infected google.com, yahoo.com and blogspot.com. Feel free to read my articles, both posted and not posted to WASC Mailing List and Full disclosure list.

> Have you ever thought about suicide ?

Thanks for worrying about me. I have never though about suicide and even was not thinking to think about it :-).

I hope you also have no such thoughts. Because writing such not serious letters as yours can lead to risk of such thoughts. So take care of yourself.

Best wishes & regards,

  Dear MustDie,


  Have you ever thought about suicide ?

    Hello participants of Full-Disclosure.

    Let's talk about infected sites of Google and Yahoo.

    As I wrote yesterday in my post Infected google.com, yahoo.com and
    blogspot.com (http://websecurity.com.ua/3786/), web sites of Google and
    Yahoo were infected over the last 90 days. All mentioned quotes (from
    Google's site) are at state of yesterday (19.12.2009) and you can see
    current state of these sites by provided links. Google updates their data
    regularly.

    When I found possibility to use Safe Browsing from Google
    (http://websecurity.com.ua/3785/) for checking of the sites for
    infectiousness, at first I made diagnostic of few popular web sites. And
    I've got very interesting results ;-).

    Among the first sites checked by me were google.com, yahoo.com and
    blogspot.com, which were found infected over the last 90 days. That
    blogspot.com (it's one of domains of Google's service Blogger) was found
    infected didn't surprise me, because last year I wrote about that this site
    of Google was using for malware spreading (http://websecurity.com.ua/2310/)
    (according to data of Sophos), but that google.com itself was infected and
    also yahoo.com, it's already a news.

    ...
