MustLive,

I can't see how this differs from normal XSS; the server returning
unsanitized user input. Surely we don't need to classify each kind of XSS?
In PHP, I use a function to write a PHP string into JS space safely, this
works in this situation as well.
So, how does your "discovery" affect my code at all? It isn't like I
sanitize output into say, an onload event but not on a onmouseover event,
no?

Regards,
Christian Sciberras.
