Rafael,

Well, either Windows will no longer exist, or Windows will be the only thing
that will exist.  Remember, very few people in the government have the
necessary technical knowledge to evaluate operating systems accurately.
Therefore, they will rely on private industry for input.  In practice, this
will mean that Microsoft will get to dictate the standards that every
operating system must meet in order to be approved.
