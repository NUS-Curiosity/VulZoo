That's one issue. There are others.

The real issue, though, is not "how to regulate MSFT". It's how to
level the playing field.

Best way I can think of to do that is to specify document formats, and
make them available to all. ODF may not be the right format, but it's
in the right direction. If government(s) were to specify that any
software they buy needs to read and write a particular set of formats,
with the specifications of those formats publicly available for no
more than the cost of copying them, and that they would only accept
documents in those formats, then anyone could build software that
meets those specifications.

Then you'd see a more competitive environment.
