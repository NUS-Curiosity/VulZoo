No "off-the-shelf" tool exists for cracking any of the existing ciphers
used in TrueCrypt beyond those that speed up a brute-force attack (like
the Tableau TACC1441), but those tools just speed up the password->key
generation process .. they aren't even attempting a true "keyspace" attack.

PS: as for "custom ciphers", I hear 2 rounds of ROT13 is pretty good, 4
is even better, and with 6 rounds, it's practically invincible.
