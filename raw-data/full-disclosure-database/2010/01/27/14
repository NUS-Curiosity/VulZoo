Subject: PR09-02 Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) /
 Cross Domain redirects and Server path information disclosure on SAP
 BusinessObjects version 12

Hi,

We have found that SAP BusinessObjects version 12 is vulnerable to
Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross Domain redirects and Server
path information disclosure with the following consecuences:

-An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code
in the browser of a victim user who clicks on a link to a SAP Business
Object server.

-This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the
target site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e.:
session IDs or passwords) to unauthorised third parties.

Further information can be found on the following paper:
