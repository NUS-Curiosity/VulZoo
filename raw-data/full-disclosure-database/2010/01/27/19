Really? How much do you know of computer forensics? Care to Double
clicked a few forensic tools first............

I bring up this issue here because as you can see the laws are
different in different country and at places just "possession" of a
questionable content is a crime, without much analysis from where did
it come from. Such a logic doesnt hold much water from a technical
prospective, that is what i was trying to discuss. (but you were so
much concerned about my english lol )

We were talking on a NEW topic, But if truecrypt is all you know, then
download truecrypt and add a "custom cascade of ciphers" to your
truecrypt source code... so that your truecrypt hidden volume will be
very hard to bruteforced with off the self tools (which is what most
forensic examiners do, they are tool dependent).....

(i  wish to make fun of you, but maybe another email! ;)
