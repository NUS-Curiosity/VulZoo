Unfortunately, the PR doesn't work that way.  Do you really want to be buying
an entire operating system from somebody who just admitted they can't even
produce a workable browser with all their resources?

(Note this works differently in the Linux world, where the kernel crew doesn't
even pretend to write browsers, and the Firefox crew *just* does browsers, and
somebody else *just* does OpenOffice, and distros (for the most part) just worry
about integration issues, and everybody only claims to do their little part
well)
