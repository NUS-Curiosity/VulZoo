Well, there are vulnerabilities in Linux, FF and OpenOffice but these are
not much covered in media compared to MS products.
One main reason for this is that unless it is in kernel or a default suid
application etc, -eventought it is open source- it will require significant
amount of skills (more than you need on win) to exploit these vulns for
beneficial purposes due to solid architecture of unix and variants.I am not
saying open-source folks are doing a bad job (actually I believe they rock)
but your comment leaves an impression like they have flawless quality of
code and this is the only reason there are less vulnerabilities in these
platforms.

There are undisclosed vulnerabilities in  the latest kernel and also in
Firefox but they are *most likely* not used in criminal activities and etc -
which is keeping them low/medium profile (even if they go public,
statistical data)
