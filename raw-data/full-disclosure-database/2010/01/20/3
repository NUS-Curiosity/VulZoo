Let's see.. *HOW* many years ago did we first see e-mail based viruses that
depended on people opening them because they came from people they already
knew?  'CHRISTMA EXEC' in 1984 comes to mind.

The problem here is that Google Wave is for *collaboration* - which means
that you're communicating with people you already know, and presumably
trust to some degree or other. "Hey Joe, look at this PDF and tell me
what you think" is something reasonable when the request comes from somebody
who Joe knows and who has sent Joe PDF's in the past.

I guarantee that if every time you receive a document that appears to be from
your boss, you call back and ask if they really intended to send a document or
if it's a virus, your boss will get very cranky with you very fast.

Let's look at that original advisory again:

>> An attacker could upload his malware to a wave and share it to his
>> Google Wave contacts.

Now change that to "An attacker could trick/pwn some poor victim into uploading
the malware to a wave...."  Hilarity ensues.
