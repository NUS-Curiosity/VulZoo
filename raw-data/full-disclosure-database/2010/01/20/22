"Do you really want to be buying
an entire operating system from somebody who just admitted they can't even
produce a workable browser with all their resources?"

Valdis makes the novice assumption that people consider valuations of
this sort when buying the newest iteration of Microsoft products. The
idea that consumers would actually consider an alternative to what is
an effectively locked in platform is laughable. The suggestion that
they might find such a move to be of any relevance or impact on their
purchasing decision is insane.
