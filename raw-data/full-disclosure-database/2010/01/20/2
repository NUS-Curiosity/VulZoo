Now, by analyzing the software used in the break-ins against Google
and dozens of other companies, Joe Stewart, a malware specialist with
SecureWorks, a computer security company based in Atlanta, said he
determined the main program used in the attack contained a module
based on an unusual algorithm from a Chinese-authored technical paper
that has been published exclusively on Chinese-language Web sites.

My main motivation was to point out that there is no free lunch, and often even security professionals forget to think critically. It was not meant to be a thorough assessment of the actual 0-day. However I appreciate the correction, the details of the exploit, and the observation that its sophistication was probably exaggerated in the media.
