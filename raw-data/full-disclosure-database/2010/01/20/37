Testing takes time.  That's why both Microsoft and Mozilla test.  A
fix being *available* and a fix being *deployable* are not at all the
same things.  "Just pull the latest build from SVN" is rather
noticeably not an option.

More accurate:

"Any complicated piece of software on an active attack surface will
have software vulnerabilities found."

There's a lot of projects that stopped evolving, but still have hidden vulns.
