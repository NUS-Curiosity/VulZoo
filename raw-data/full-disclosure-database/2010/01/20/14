Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS XR Software SSH Denial of Service
Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100120-xr-ssh

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 January 20 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The SSH server implementation in Cisco IOS XR Software contains a
vulnerability that an unauthenticated, remote user could exploit to
cause a denial of service condition.

An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSH
version 2 packet that may cause a new SSH connection handler process to
crash. Repeated exploitation may cause each new SSH connection handler
process to crash and lead to a significant amount of memory being
consumed, which could introduce instability that may adversely impact
other system functionality. During this event, the parent SSH daemon
process will continue to function normally.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100120-xr-ssh.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR systems that are running an
affected version of Cisco IOS XR Software and have the SSH server
feature enabled. A system with the SSH server feature enabled will
have the command ssh server [v2] present in its configuration. Refer
to the "Cisco IOS XR System Security Configuration Guide" at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/crs/software/crs_r3.9/security/configuration/guide/sc39ssh.html#wp1044523
for additional details regarding configuration of the SSH server in Cisco
IOS XR Software.

The SSH server can only be enabled in Cisco IOS XR Software if
the "security" Package Information Envelope (PIE) is installed.
Administrators can issue the show install summary command to confirm
if the security PIE is installed. This command will display an active
package similar to "<platform>-k9sec-<version>" or, for example,
"c12k-k9sec-3.6.1" if the security PIE is installed.

Refer to the "Software Version and Fixes" section of this advisory for
information on specific affected software versions.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

SSH server implementations in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE
Software are not affected by this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco IOS XR Software is a member of the Cisco IOS Software family that
uses a microkernel-based distributed operating system infrastructure.
Cisco IOS XR Software runs on the Cisco CRS-1 Carrier Routing System,
Cisco 12000 Series Routers, and Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation
Services Routers. More information on Cisco IOS XR Software is available
at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps5845/index.html.

The SSH protocol was developed as a secure replacement for the Telnet,
FTP, rlogin, remote shell (rsh), and Remote Copy Protocol (RCP)
protocols, which allow for remote device access. SSH varies from
these older protocols in that it provides strong authentication and
confidentiality and uses encrypted transactions.

The SSH server implementation in Cisco IOS XR Software contains a
vulnerability that an unauthenticated, remote user could exploit to
cause a denial of service condition.

The vulnerability is triggered when a new SSH handler process handles
a crafted SSH version 2 packet, which may cause the process to crash.
During this event, a significant amount of memory may be consumed.
Repeated exploitation may impact other system functionality, depending
upon the size of the available memory and the duration of attack.

Although exploitation of this vulnerability does not require user
authentication, the TCP three-way handshake must be completed, and some
SSH protocol negotiation must occur.

The SSH service will continue to function normally during an after an
attack.

During exploitation of this vulnerability, the system may generate the
following messages:

    RP/0/RP1/CPU0:Jan 14 16:56:34.885 : dumper[59]: %OS-DUMPER-7-DUMP_ATTRIBUTE : Dump request with attribute 407 for process pkg/bin/sshd_child_handler

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Network administrators
are advised to apply mitigation techniques to help limit exposure to the
vulnerability. Mitigation techniques consist of allowing only legitimate
devices to connect to the routers.

These access restrictions can be accomplished by using interface
access control lists (ACLs) or the Management Plane Protection (MPP)
feature that is available in Cisco IOS XR Software Release 3.5 and
later. For information on MPP, refer to the configuration guide
at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios_xr_sw/iosxr_r3.8/security/configuration/guide/sc38mpp.html
and the MPP command reference at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios_xr_sw/iosxr_r3.8/security/command/reference/sr38mpp.html.
Infrastructure ACLs (iACLs) are also a useful technique to mitigate
potential exploitation of this vulnerability.

For more information on these mitigations, consult the Cisco
Guide to Harden Cisco IOS XR Devices, which is available at
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/CiscoIOSXR.html.

Note that access classes in line templates applied to VTY pools are not
an effective mitigation for this vulnerability.
