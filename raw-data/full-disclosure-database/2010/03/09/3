Subject: GeoIPgen version 0.4 released - country-to-IPs
	generator

I've just released a new version of GeoIPgen

Description: GeoIPgen is a country-to-IPs generator. It's a geographic IP generator for IPv4
networks that uses the MaxMind GeoLite Country database. Geoipgen is the first published use of a
geographic ip database in reverse to translate from country-to-IPs instead of the usual use of
IP-to-country. Features: Random or sorted order, unique or repeating IPs, skips broadcast addresses,
one, many or all countries.

Changes: Much faster than version 0.3, for example generating all IPs for Papa New Guinea took a
couple of minutes with version 0.3. Now it takes a few seconds.

P.S. Please tell me about your projects or nationwide scanning efforts that use geoipgen. Eg. the
Australian Web Enumeration Project http://www.auenumerate.net
