Subject: Re: Mozilla Firefox 3.6 plenitude String
	Crash(0day) Exploit

I wouldn't call this a bug in the least bit.
I would call it a lack of hardware issue than anything, similar to "minimal
requirements" on software, etc.
This issue only happens on 32-bit with the configuration that you yourself
are running, there is no issue with Firefox itself, mainly because it has
been confirmed multiple times to work on multiple machines (myself
included).
I chalk this one up to single-user issue and move on.

Cheers

Kad
