You *do* realize that a *small* botnet these days is 75,000 machines, and
there's a estimated 140 million compromised zombie boxes out there? There's
very few boxes that can handle an inbound ACL of 75K entries sanely - usually
what ends up happening is the upstream drops all traffic *to* the target node
just so all the *other* boxes at the site still get some bandwidth.

And "sending too much data" is hard to quantify - if you have enough bots,
you can thoroughly DDoS a site using far *less* bandwidth per host than a
normal user does.  If the site was designed to handle 10,000 clients each
sending 5 packets per second for 10 seconds during a login at game start,
it will likely fall over if you throw 100,000 bots at it, each sending
4 packets a second continuously...
