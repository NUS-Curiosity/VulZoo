A good way to get started w/scalable DDoS mitigation is to implement S/RTBH on one's hardware-based edge routers, and then make use of open-source NetFlow tools for visibility.

There are commercial solutions as well - in the interests of full disclosure (pardon the pun, heh), I work for a vendor of such intelligent DDoS mitigation (IDMS) solutions.

These slides may be of interest in hardening/leveraging one's network infrastructure and gaining the ability to  detect/classify/traceback/mitigate DDoS:

There was also a relevant talk at the latest NANOG (a synopsis of discussions on nanog-l and cisco-nsp):

<http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog48/presentations/Monday/Kaeo_FilterTrend_ISPSec_N48.pdf>

and other relevant presentations at various NANOGs in the past.

To answer the previous respondent's question, Cisco acquired Riverhead and its Guard in early 2004:

I also highly recommend this book by Dave Smith and Gregg Schudel of Cisco - it's the best (and only!) book on real-world opsec out there, available in dead-tree, Kindle, and Adobe Reader formats:

<http://www.amazon.com/Router-Security-Strategies-Securing-Network/dp/1587053365/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1262667257&sr=8-1>

[Full disclosure again; I'm cited in the book, but received and continue to receive no renumeration of any kind due to same.]

But before going the commercial route, folks should work on hardening their hosts/OSes/apps and leveraging their existing infrastructure and open-source as noted in the presentations above - in many cases, this is all that's needed, as outlined here:
