If the attack behaved like LOTS of legitimate clients, it might have 
been hard to lock out the bots while not locking out players.

The option that the attack is just made up as an excuse for too few 
resources to support all the players should also not be forgotten, 
although I consider that improbable.

Sincerely,
Jan
