3. Problem Description

 a. vMA and Service Console update for newt to 0.52.2-12.el5_4.1

    Newt is a programming library for color text mode, widget based
    user interfaces. Newt can be used to add stacked windows, entry
    widgets, checkboxes, radio buttons, labels, plain text fields,
    scrollbars, etc., to text mode user interfaces.

    A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way newt
    processes content that is to be displayed in a text dialog box.
    A local attacker could issue a specially-crafted text dialog box
    display request (direct or via a custom application), leading to a
    denial of service (application crash) or, potentially, arbitrary
    code execution with the privileges of the user running the
    application using the newt library.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-2905 to this issue.

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 b. vMA and Service Console update for vMA package nfs-utils to
    1.0.9-42.el5

    The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server
    and related tools.

    It was discovered that nfs-utils did not use tcp_wrappers
    correctly.  Certain hosts access rules defined in "/etc/hosts.allow"
    and "/etc/hosts.deny" may not have been honored, possibly allowing
    remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-4552 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    vMA            4.0       RHEL5    Patch 3

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 c. vMA and Service Console package glib2 updated to 2.12.3-4.el5_3.1

    GLib is the low-level core library that forms the basis for projects
such
    as GTK+ and GNOME. It provides data structure handling for C,
    portability wrappers, and interfaces for such runtime functionality
    as an event loop, threads, dynamic loading, and an object system.

    Multiple integer overflows in glib/gbase64.c in GLib before 2.20
    allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
    long string that is converted either from or to a base64
    representation.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-4316 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    vMA            4.0       RHEL5    Patch 3

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 d. vMA and Service Console update for openssl to 0.9.8e-12.el5

    SSL is a toolkit implementing SSL v2/v3 and TLS protocols with full-
    strength cryptography world-wide.

    Multiple denial of service flaws were discovered in OpenSSL's DTLS
    implementation. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a
    DTLS server to use excessive amounts of memory, or crash on an
    invalid memory access or NULL pointer dereference.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2009-1377, CVE-2009-1378,
    CVE-2009-1379, CVE-2009-1386, CVE-2009-1387 to these issues.

    An input validation flaw was found in the handling of the BMPString
    and UniversalString ASN1 string types in OpenSSL's
    ASN1_STRING_print_ex() function. An attacker could use this flaw to
    create a specially-crafted X.509 certificate that could cause
    applications using the affected function to crash when printing
    certificate contents.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-0590 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch

    ESX            2.5.5     ESX      not affected

    vMA            4.0       RHEL5    Patch 3

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 e. vMA and Service Console package bind updated to 9.3.6-4.P1.el5_4.1

    It was discovered that BIND was incorrectly caching responses
    without performing proper DNSSEC validation, when those responses
    were received during the resolution of a recursive client query
    that requested DNSSEC records but indicated that checking should be
    disabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass the DNSSEC
    validation check and perform a cache poisoning attack if the target
    BIND server was receiving such client queries.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-4022 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    ESX            2.5.5     ESX      not affected

    vMA            4.0       RHEL5    Patch 3

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 f. vMA and Service Console package expat updated to 1.95.8-8.3.el5_4.2.

    Two buffer over-read flaws were found in the way Expat handled
    malformed UTF-8 sequences when processing XML files. A specially-
    crafted XML file could cause applications using Expat to fail while
    parsing the file.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2009-3560 and CVE-2009-3720 to these
    issues.

    vMA            4.0       RHEL5    Patch 3

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 g. vMA and Service Console package openssh update to 4.3p2-36.el5_4.2
 
    A Red Hat specific patch used in the openssh packages as shipped in
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 (RHSA-2009:1287) loosened certain
    ownership requirements for directories used as arguments for the
    ChrootDirectory configuration options. A malicious user that also
    has or previously had non-chroot shell access to a system could
    possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges and run
    commands as any system user.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-2904 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    vMA            4.0       RHEL5    Patch 3

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 h. vMA and Service Console package ntp updated to
    ntp-4.2.2p1-9.el5_4.1.i386.rpm

    A flaw was discovered in the way ntpd handled certain malformed NTP
    packets. ntpd logged information about all such packets and replied
    with an NTP packet that was treated as malformed when received by
    another ntpd. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create an NTP
    packet reply loop between two ntpd servers through a malformed packet
    with a spoofed source IP address and port, causing ntpd on those
    servers to use excessive amounts of CPU time and fill disk space with
    log messages.
