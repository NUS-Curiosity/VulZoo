CA20100304-01: Security Notice for CA SiteMinder


Issued: March 04, 2010


CA's support is alerting customers to a security risk with CA 
SiteMinder. Multiple cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities 
exist that can allow a remote attacker to potentially gain 
sensitive information. CA has provided guidance to remediate the 
vulnerability.

The vulnerabilities, CVE-2009-3731, are due to insufficient 
validation of input strings. An attacker can potentially steal 
network domain credentials by enticing a user to visit a web page 
that contains malicious content.


Risk Rating

Low


Platforms

Windows
Solaris
HP-UX
Red Hat Linux


Affected Products

CA SiteMinder 6.0 (SP4 and earlier)


How to determine if the installation is affected

The vulnerability is caused by an issue with the publishing tool 
used to create the online help and HTML documentation for older CA 
SiteMinder releases (6.0 SP4 and earlier). This vulnerability 
affects CA SiteMinder in the following ways:

 * HTML versions of the product documentation for SiteMinder can 
be deployed on an individual system or through a web server. If 
product documentation has been deployed on a web server the 
SiteMinder 6.0 installation is vulnerable.

 * Online help systems for SiteMinder are deployed and accessible 
through a web server. This vulnerability applies to help systems.

In both cases, this vulnerability applies if web access to the 
associated web servers has been configured to make use of 
non-public (client-specific) information.


Solution

CA SiteMinder:

 * Upgrade Policy Servers to the latest service pack for SiteMinder 
6.0. Remove older versions of the product documentation from your 
servers.

 or

 * For Integrated Document sets, if you have deployed the HTML 
version of documentation to a web server, move the documentation 
to a file server and delete the documentation from the web server.

 * For Online Help systems, remove the help systems from the 
application folders and place them on a file system for future 
reference. Note that this will cause help links to fail in the 
associated applications.

 The folders that contain help systems are:

   o Administrative UI Help:
     <policy server home>\admin\help

   o Policy Server Management Console Help:
     <policy server home>\bin\smconsole-help

   o SiteMinder Test Tool Help:
     <policy server home>\bin\smtest-help
