Subject: WhatWeb version 0.4 released

I've just released a new version of WhatWeb, a next generation web scanner. This scanner isn't
designed to find vulnerabilities but to identify web software. I've fixed some bugs,
added features and added more plugins. Thanks to Emilio Casbas and Louis Nyffenegger for
contributing plugins :)

DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identify content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, stats/analytics packages, javascript
libraries, servers and more. When you visit a website in your browser the transaction includes many
unseen hints about how the webserver is set up and what software is delivering the webpage. Some of
these hints are obvious, eg. "Powered by XYZ" and others are more subtle. WhatWeb recognises these
hints and reports what it finds.

WhatWeb has over 70 plugins and needs community support to develop more. Plugins can identify
systems with obvious identifying hints removed by also looking for subtle clues. For example, a
WordPress site might remove the tag <meta name="generator" content="WordPress 2.6.5"> but the
WordPress plugin also looks for "wp-content" which is less easy to disguise. Plugins are flexible
and can return any datatype, for example plugins can return version numbers, email addresses,
account ID's and more.

There are both passive and aggressive plugins, passive plugins use information on the page, in
cookies and in the URL to identify the system. A passive request is as light weight as a simple GET
/ HTTP/1.1 request. Aggressive plugins guess URLs and request more files. Plugins are easy to write,
you don't need to know ruby to make them.
