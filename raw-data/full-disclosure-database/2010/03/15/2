Package        : drupal6
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : not yet available
Debian Bug     : 572439

Several vulnerabilities (SA-CORE-2010-001) have been discovered in
drupal6, a fully-featured content management framework.


Installation cross site scripting

A user-supplied value is directly output during installation allowing a
malicious user to craft a URL and perform a cross-site scripting attack.
The exploit can only be conducted on sites not yet installed.


Open redirection

The API function drupal_goto() is susceptible to a phishing attack.
An attacker could formulate a redirect in a way that gets the Drupal site
to send the user to an arbitrarily provided URL.
No user submitted data will be sent to that URL.


Locale module cross site scripting

Locale module and dependent contributed modules do not sanitize the display
of language codes, native and English language names properly.
While these usually come from a preselected list, arbitrary administrator
input is allowed.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have a
role with the 'administer languages' permission.


Blocked user session regeneration

Under certain circumstances, a user with an open session that is blocked
can maintain his/her session on the Drupal site, despite being blocked.


For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.6-3lenny5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.16-1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.


We recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
