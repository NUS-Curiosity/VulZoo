No doubt.  Twitter replacing FD is just absurd.  Sure.  Let's all move to a 3rd party service that: 

1) isn't profitable; 

2) is liable to do some crazy ass shit to start making money (i.e. get your FD twitters with ads in the future? charge to post security vulns to the FD twitter feed?); and 

3) falls over and dies under heavy load.  Heaven forbid if some famous movie star dies, we might not get FD twitters for weeks while Twitter struggles with the celebrity load.

Email works.  Email is almost universally accessible.  Stick with what works.
