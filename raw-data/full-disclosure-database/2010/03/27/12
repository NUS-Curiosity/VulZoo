In your case, had you answered the question correctly I would have promised 
to never (again) blog about you arguing with Craig S. Wright.

However, it was a trick question.  There is no way to do it with Group 
Policy (at least not with XP and Server 2003... maybe they changed that in 
Windows Vis7a and Server 2008, but I really haven't kept up with the tech).

Oh, sorry I read the question wrong.  Just don't allow them to "attach" 
their local drives.  Simple.

Still, what do I win?
