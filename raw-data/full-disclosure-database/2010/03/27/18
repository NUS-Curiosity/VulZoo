Subject: Re: Security system

Is there any movement in your home when you are not there (i.e. pets, 
etc.)?  You may be able to use a web cam to alert you of any movement in 
the house if it picks up anything other then the initial background when 
you start the recording process.  There are a lot of web cams that will 
only record when movement is detected, I'm sure by now the software that 
some of these vendors have may have an alerting mechanism in there by 
now as well.
