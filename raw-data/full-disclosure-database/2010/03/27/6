Subject: Re: Possible RDP vulnerability

As far as RDP is concerned, it's much simpler (and more fun!) to host an 
Evil RDP Server than it is to hack into one.  There is no end to the 
shenanigans you can create or the havoc you can wreak, if you're into that 
kind of thing (just sayin'... as a Big Time Security Professionalâ„¢, I'm 
not).

For instance, this low quailty, seldom seen, crappy video (barely) shows how 
you can get a virus/Trojan/worm/etc. if you are insane enough to attach your 
local drives to an untrusted RDP server (the popup at the end is the AV 
going off).

EXTRA CREDIT: devise a Group Policy that will prevent users from attaching 
their local drives to a remote RDP server.

I think we are two different pages :)

what I was trying to show if you have a group policy that will only run a 
certain applications for example notepad.exe, the user is unable to access 
my computer, run or the start button or any other application. There would 
be a shortcut on the desktop for just notepad.exe for the user to execute.
