Subject: Re: Possible RDP vulnerability

So it's a super common thing for schools to have 'locked down' Windows  
desktops, and even more common for even slightly nerdy kids to take  
the lockdown as a challenge to be  defeated.

The point of course is that the kids always win:  At the point  
somebody has the set of privileges exposed by any amount of desktop  
access, constraining execution for them is similar to getting the idea  
that, perhaps, it would be the responsible thing to open discussions  
around managing the open state of the barn door.
