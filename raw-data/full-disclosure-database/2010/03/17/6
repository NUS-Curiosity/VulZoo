This not because everyone does it that it's not foolish ( History proves
it). The point is that aggregating all these twits,  blog entries and
else is a real pain in the ass and personnaly i have other things to do. 
That's why we still need places that will collect, analyze and 
redistribute the content coming from these multiple sources. So please 
stop pissing off, yelling that twitter is the futur of full disclosure 
and IT security information in general. It's probably true but unless we 
finally get absolute convergence  from these multiple sources ( it will 
never happen because of commercial issues) websites like SF will still 
be useful. it's like previously milw0rm and exploitdb now...people can 
publish exploits/pocs on their blogs but nobody contests the relevance 
of these websites that were/are  precious for the community.
