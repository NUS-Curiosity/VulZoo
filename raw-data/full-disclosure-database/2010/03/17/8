That's our problem as a security community, its not me saying let's
move to Twitter,

I'm reporting on a trend that the security researchers have *already*
moved to Twitter and are hardly ever on mailing lists anymore.

People are treating me as if I'm trying to encourage people to get
onto Twitter or something that isn't the case, what the case is
security researchers are posting on Twitter NOT mailing lists anymore.

The only people you're seeing on the mailing lists nowadays is
security companies like ZDI and iDefense using mailing lists as a
clearing house for customers who have sold vulnerabilities to them.

There is no security researcher discussions or anything like there
used to be on the mailing lists.

However, there is an unprecedented amount of information being post by
security researchers on Twitter.

It's no infulence of mine or anyone else, its just the way its happened.

Stop looking for people to blame for nobody posting on mailing lists anymore.

Andrew
