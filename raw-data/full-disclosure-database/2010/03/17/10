Subject: Re: SecurityFocus to partially shut down

Let's face the fact that twitter or facebook or whatever facesomething will
never replace mailing lists, and good
security oriented webpages. There you have over a 90% of traffic being
useless. And the wall posting system can not
replace a mail because an information get's lost very fast.

On the other side twitter can be usefull for posting a short information
(exploit, papers, events etc) or a link (webpage, downloads etc).
