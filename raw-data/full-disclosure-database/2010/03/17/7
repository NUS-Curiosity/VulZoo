andrew,
what happened to not wanting to be part of FD anymore? what happened to
moving on with your life? with your girlfriend you wanted to move in with?
you said you only returned to defend your amazing reputation that was being
spoiled by imposters who have nothing better to do with their time than
pretend to be an annoying retard such as yourself. well here you are
rambling on about something that has nothing to do with that. maybe there
weren't any imposters. maybe it's all been you. here you are annoying people
on FD again, on a subject that has nothing to do with differentiating
yourself from the wannabes.

are you here, or are you not. make up your mind
