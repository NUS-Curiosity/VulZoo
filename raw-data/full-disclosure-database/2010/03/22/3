0x01 : Vendor description of software
-------------------------------------
>>From the vendor website:

"Zipper is a free compression program, and you don't need to pay anything for it. It doesn't contain pop-up ads or other annoying things. However, Zipper isn't free to maintain and wasn't free to create, because it contains commercial 
components, and was build with programming software."



0x02 : Vulnerability details
----------------------------
In order for the vulnerability to be triggered, a user must be tricked into opening a specially crafted zip file from within the application, and double click on a filename inside the zip file, in an attempt to extract/view it.

After roughly 1022 bytes in the filename buffer, the exception handler was overwritten, allowing an attacker to take full control over the application flow, inject and execute arbitrary code on the machine. 

The discovered vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the currently logged on user.

    March 16 : Author contacted

    March 23 : No answer, Public disclosure
