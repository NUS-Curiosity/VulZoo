If you have to ask, the answer won't make any sense to you. But what the heck...

Think back a year or two to your time in elementary school.  Did you get the
sense that there were students there, and teachers, and a lot of grown-ups who
worked there that weren't teachers?  Did you get the feeling that if the
non-teacher grown-ups weren't there, the floors wouldn't get cleaned, lunch
wouldn't happen, none of the paperwork in the office would happen, and in
general things wouldn't work well?  Well, those non-teacher grown-ups were
"staff".

And a college or university needs them for the same reasons your elementary
school did.
