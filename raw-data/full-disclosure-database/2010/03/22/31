You've obviously never been to college. Or possibly never even set foot on a
college campus.  If you did, you'd know that any college or university has a
fairly large percent of "staff" to go along with the instructors.  Registrar's
office? Staff.  Financial aid? Staff. The administrative help in every
department? Staff. The people who make the phones and lights work? Staff.  The
academics are paid to teach and work on their research - in general in order to
make anything else happen you need staff assistance.

And when the university has 28,000 students, an annual budget somewhere
over a billion dollars, a quarter acre of raised floor across the hall
with enough servers in the room that we're running tight against the 3MW
electric feed into the building, you end up needing some IT staff.

(Let me tell you - when you're one of the staff who's job it is to protect the
IT infrastructure from the best attempts of students, academics, other non-IT
staff, and vendors to bungle things up, you end up with a *lot* of good war
stories to tell over beers.  Like the time that... :)
