4 actually, but y'know, I'll let that slide.

I was a hall monitor, I was pretty good at it aswell. One time, I saw this
guy coming and I was all like "WOWA DUDE, WTH DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING" and
he ran. I was pretty slick, I even rolled up pieces of paper and pretended
to smoke. I was like the bounty hunter of the halls. Do you have hall
monitors at 'college' (is that the correct spelling?)? If you do, email me,
I'm currently looking for a job where I can get lots of power.

One time I was called a 'little hitler', obviously I didnt let it go to my
head, but I am quite proud of that moment.
