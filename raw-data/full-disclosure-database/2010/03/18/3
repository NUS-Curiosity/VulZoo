Subject: Introducing SecurityTube Questions!

SecurityTube <http://www.securitytube.net/> is excited to launch a new
section - SecurityTube Questions! <http://questions.securitytube.net/>

SecurityTube Questions <http://questions.securitytube.net/> is modeled after
StackOverflow and is aimed at helping hackers, infosec professionals,
enthusiasts and students solve security related problems.

Note that SecurityTube Questions <http://questions.securitytube.net/> is not
a "forum" where members discuss security news, post links etc. It is instead
a questions and answers site, where members with specific technical queries
in the information security field are seeking answers. Members are expected
to ask and answer to the point!

To make it more interesting, expert members who ask good questions and
provide valuable answers get ranked and receive "badges" and points. Another
interesting feature, is that all questions are tagged to make searching and
posting follow up questions very easy! There are tons of other features
which you will love once you start using the site!

So, without further ado, please visit http://questions.securitytube.net !
and start asking questions and giving answers!!

Regards,

SecurityTube Team
