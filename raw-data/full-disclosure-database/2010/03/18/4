I don't think that you have the right approach.
When some kid posts a 0day on twitter, you can always send the
information to FD.


I second the request by David Alanis: Where are the tweets? Give us
some links to relevant tweets. (Tweets of security related stuff
*only* released on twitter.)

One more thought: As you know most of the projects have a bug tracker.
Information of these sources isn't mirrored anywhere. That's how it
always has been. Where's the difference now - why would we need a
directory of "whatever"?
