Subject: Fingerprinting Paper with Laser

I saw this release today, and just had to share it with anyone I could find.

"Every paper, plastic, metal and ceramic surface is microscopically 
different and has its own 'fingerprint'. Professor Cowburn's LSA system 
uses a laser to read this naturally occurring 'fingerprint'. The 
accuracy of measurement is often greater than that of DNA with a 
reliability of at least one million trillion."

I love it when old technologies and science are used in interesting new 
ways to impact the future.

Expect to see this technology at an airport near you, in five years or so.
