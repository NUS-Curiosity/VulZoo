Subject: Re: Wordpad Command line argument vulnerability
	is it known ?

This is very probably known and fixed, as I published about the many BoFs
and formatstring vulns in comand line handling in Windows applications in
2004 (http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2004/Oct/45), after which most if not all
of them got fixed. I cannot reproduce in XP sp3.

If you still want to exploit it, why don't you encode your shellcode to
lowercase alphanumeric using ALPHA3?
