Subject: Re: [cansecwest] Advanced PHP Hacking


Dear all,

Related to this "Advanced PHP Hacking" training during next Cansecwest (
http://cansecwest.com ), some people asked if I were about to release
the "PHP fuzzing tools" described on my web site with 0-days / exploits
/ advisories for the Apple iPhone product.

Those "PHP fuzzing tools" allowed TEHTRI-Security to find
vulnerabilities on the latest Apple iPhone firmware (
http://www.tehtri-security.com/en/news.php?filter=TECH ).

In agreement with Apple, who are working on solutions for their
customers, we might not publicly disclose those vulnerabilities, due to
legal and ethical issues.

However, during this "Advanced PHP Hacking" CanSecWest training (22 or
23 march), I will cover how to create your own tools for playing /
fuzzing / hacking with clients (like what we did when we found vulns for
Safari & Mail app under the latest iPhone) :
