according to glob(3) (on FreeBSD)

"gl_pathv : contains a pointer to a NULL-terminated list of
matched pathnames.  However, if gl_pathc is zero, the contents of
gl_pathv are undefined."

In your test program, glob returns 0 but with gl_pathc == 0 so it
segfaults.

ftpd should check if gl_pathc > 0.

Good catch!

Best regards.
