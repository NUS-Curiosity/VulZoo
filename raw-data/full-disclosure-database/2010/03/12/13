Or perhaps it's because they wanted to get me to commit a crime so I would talk about a friend I used to have. This is totally wrong because I'd gladly help if they didn't just ruin my life like I was a parasite. They like to "work on me" from afar, going to my friends and associates behind my back, then looking VERY strictly and scrutinizing as if nothing happened, "Let's see how our subject reacts". And of course, playing dirty is used as a psychological tactics to ruin me, anger me, and in their hopes, radicalize me (rofl).

Sure, it's shocking to _you_, but will it be shocking when it's on the desk of a conservative judge? rofl. Samuel Alito would like cops act as priests, doctors, etc and do whatever they can, "I'm strict, I'm a real bear *bends eye brows* i can articulate political opinions because I'm happy with my share in society *straightens lip, nods head* *turns on fox news* god i'm intelligent"

Look at Steven Hatfill. How he went up to the FBI that followed him, how they ran over his foot. He called the police, he got a ticket. Imagine the injustice that swirled in his life. The innuendo, the attitude that would make you believe, ya know this guy is the killer, worst person in the world. But it was all fluff, indeed, he was no criminal.

We need oversight in law enforcement even before hand to make sure this doesn't happen. These guys are like spoil kids and all you hear about is abuse, but politicians cave in easily, "It's chilling law enforcement's ability to 'investigate'". Please, you can fight crime and respect civil liberties. You can be thoughtful, prudent, rational and not ruin people's lives.

Used as if you're someone useful, and as a nobody who works at burger king, you wait all your life waiting to hear that. In reality, you're held in contempt and used cynically. Hal Turner helped find radical right wing lone wolves, and for his dedicated he is charged with a felony doing what the FBI taught him to do. Why? Just why?
> 
> He was racist and a radical. But he worked for the gov to find bad guys. And what he gets in return for helping. What kind of double standards is this? Why can't we be fair? It's just oppression, "Just cause", that's what it feels like.

> If you want to fight crime, try to actually be a cop. Because then you get all the power and ability to make "mistakes" and "accidentially' harass people for 2 years and ruin their lives. Nothing happens to cops who do bad things. I love how informants give this oscar winning performances, "Look! I can help! I can be useful", and the cops all follow you thinking they're in a movie, the world revolves around them, "I bet if we follow this kid into Wendy's we'll have a case that'll be on all the news!". Because cops can't use rear view mirrors. damn, some pretty smart craftmanship.

I love it when idiots come right to my door with a subterfuge, I sigh, no one will ever understand. Oh, I'll make sure to have no friends so you won't get them to go into my medicine cabinets, try to buy my personal perscriptions or try to entrap me as a cyberstalker or a hacker. Perhaps pretext my mom's house as a contruction worker? The red head with facial hair? Big ego smile? Seen him driving by me in an unmarked car before as if I'm a hoodrat (rofl), the tape under my car? I presume for GPS monitoring, since you don't need a warrant cept in 2 states?

"I mean, What am I supposed to do?"
Behave as the sheeple do.

"What are my options?"
When under scrutiny by the guardians of the status quo, relax as you are shafted, it is less painful that way.
Your public face should be one of yes sir, no sir, whatever you say sir.
Your attitude should be I conform, consume and obey, why are you on my case?
Your private face should be visible to only those that you trust, and I say trust no one.

Of course this is all too late if you have already pinged their radar, you now have to convince them they are wrong and wasting time in pursuing
you.

"I feel so powerless and its just."
You are powerless against the system. If you had the power you wouldn't be posting here for attention/advice, you would do that which was required.

"What the hell you do?"
I keep my head down, I have a few beers, I pay my taxes and be John Doe
I pretend to be that which I am not. I occasionally make a few mistakes... I sometimes post bullshit to FD when I have had too much to drink.(I
am learning, I think)But mostly I fly under the radar.

I have hacked nothing. I have never broken a law, I conform, I obey, I think all laws are just and I will support the state until my dying
breath and beyond. God save the king, queen, president or dictator for you are my leader and the source of all that is good. The system has
shaped me in its image and I comply.

Although pretence is not particularly difficult it is hard to keep up the facade, to be on ones guard 24x7x365.

I have to go... Elvis Costello "Watching the detectives" has just started playing, how ironic, I feel the urge to dance.

Take care
