Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 03.11.10: Multiple
 Vendor WebKit HTML Element Use After Free Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.11.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 11, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

WebKit is an open source web browser engine. It is currently used by
Apple Inc.'s Safari browser, as well as by Google's Chrome browser. For
more information, see the vendor's site at the following link.

http://webkit.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in WebKit, as
included with multiple vendors' browsers, could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs when a certain property of an HTML element is
reset via JavaScript code. When this occurs, a C++ object is
incorrectly accessed after it has been freed. This results in an
attacker controlled value being used as a C++ VTABLE, which leads to
the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the Webpage. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Webpage
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted
sites. After the user visits the malicious Webpage, no further user
interaction is needed.

Exploitation of this vulnerability is relatively simple if a heap spray
technique is used to control large portions of heap memory. It is also
trivial for an attacker to reallocate the chunk of freed memory and
populate it with controlled values. This allows an attacker to control
a C++ VTABLE, which leads to code execution. As such, iDefense
considers this vulnerability to be highly exploitable.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Google
Chrome 3.0.195.38 and Safari 4.0.4. Previous versions are suspected to
be vulnerable. A full list of affected Apple products can be found in
Security Advisory APPLE-SA-2010-03-11-1 Safari 4.0.5.

V. WORKAROUND

The vulnerability is present in the JavaScript engine, so disabling
JavaScript is an effective workaround. This can be performed via the
command line with Google Chrome, and the Preferences menu in Safari.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
