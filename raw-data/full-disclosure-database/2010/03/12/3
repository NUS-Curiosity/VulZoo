Hi,

I'd more likely believe that this is a story made up by Ubisoft to hide out their big failure in the new centralized DRM system.
Buyers of Assassins Creed and alikes that use the new DRM system haven't been able to play it for a couple of days if not an entire week.
That is damn bad business and publicity for Ubisoft and lots of money have been lost during these days when the users couldn't play the games they paid for, but they're friends using cracked versions of the games could.
Even if it was for real DDOS to be blamed for, which we may never know, still their new DRM systems raises lots of questions and will be a(another) deciding factor for new users wanting to buy some new Ubisoft game.

Br,
Shinnok

Hi there,
Ubisoft apparently got a DDoS on their DRM servers [1], causing 
legitimate players of Assassins Creed II etc. being unable to play their 
games. (as the new DRM system requires constant connection to the 
servers) - I assume pirated copies ran fine, of course...

Is there any information who was behind that attack? Some people angry 
about the DRM wanting to make a point, or criminal botherders trying to 
extort money from Ubisoft?

What are the best strategies to defend against such an attack, except of 
course not creating such a stupid thing that has a large sign reading 
"DDoS ME!" built into it and pisses of a lot of people at the same time?

Some people claim that attacks were announced "on IRC, in Usenet and on 
the Steam forums" - can anyone confirm this and/or provide message IDs?

Sincerely
Jan
