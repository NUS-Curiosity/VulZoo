Subject: Re: Security system

Buy a prepaid cell, rig your comp & phone up to a battery backup.
Breakout board on your Serial port, or from a USB-DB9 RS232 adapter.

Have the text messaged banged out on the prepaid, rig wires from the
breakout board to the cell phone, rig wires from your security sensors
into your breakout board. App to listen on com port send a nice high
signal to the pin connecting to your send key.

Done.

Like, 50$ for the phone incld. minutes.
Like less than 20$ for a breakout board.

Also, rig the ringer up to an input on the breakout board and you can
call your phone to clear your FDE keys from RAM and kill your machine
if you think the man is paying a visit once you get a text :)

Some adversaries will cut net, hardline, sometimes power.

Attacks: GSM jammers, which everyone has.
