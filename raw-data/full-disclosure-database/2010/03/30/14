For the reader : RF "noise" (or better yet, protocol-appropriate noise)
on the correct secondary frequency (135khz, 13.56mhz, etc)
For the tag : extremely high power on the primary frequency or a hammer.

The readers I've worked with (HID) are so picky they won't work if two
valid cards are presented simultaneously.
