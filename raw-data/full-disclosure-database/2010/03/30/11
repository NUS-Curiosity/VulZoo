Subject: Re: Security system

There are wireless IP cameras out there that can send out alerts when 
there are motion changes which would do the trick.
I've found a couple on newegg at a quick glance but I've never tested 
them for myself... perhaps there are others out there
that could recommend one?

Something like that would work for home use.  If the motion changes for 
whatever reason, you could login and view
the camera history for yourself to verify things are alright assuming 
the intruder hasn't spotted and disabled your camera
and logging device.
