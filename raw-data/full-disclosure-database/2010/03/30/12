ZoneMinder (zoneminder.com) does this out of the box. It's FOSS.

It can also perform "actions" (be they X10, serial, script, whatever)
based on alarms created by movements within the defined zones of a frame.

Tangential question : anyone tried to plug a USB webcam into a
pogoplug/sheevaplug and get that as a all-in-one?
