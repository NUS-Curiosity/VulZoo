Nah, I'm saying a GSM jammer would block your prepaid cell signal.

So if your adversary were to cut the power, cut the net AND jam GSM
you'd be out of luck in getting notification.

You can get all fancy and have your program try all methods available.
Cell, Wired Net, WIFI (throw an antennae on your roof,) pager, etc.
