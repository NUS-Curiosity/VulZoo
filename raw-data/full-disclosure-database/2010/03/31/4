Subject: Victorinox Launches Super-Secure USB Stick

Victorinox says that during the Secure's launch event in London, the
company offered a team of professional hackers close to $150,000 if
they could get past the Secure's security measures. The prize money
went unclaimed, Victorinox says, and the company did not identify the
hackers.
