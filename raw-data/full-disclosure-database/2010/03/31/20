No, they offered them a set amount of time to do it. In practical terms
for a "lost/stolen USB stick" this is a totally useless test, and is
100% marketing fluff.

If they were really serious, they would have published the full
specifications and provided a dozen sample units for a reasonable entry
fee to anyone that wanted to try.

They also wouldn't be the first manufacturer to severely misunderstand
the correct implementation of AES :
