(a) Apply Occam's Razor - which is simpler and more likely, that your
sorry ass is in fact being targeted by Yahoo assassins because you know
Important Stuff, or you're just having another paranoid episode that
manifests as thinking assassins are after you because you know Important
Stuff? (Hint 1:
what in the cited text implies assassins?  Zero. Hint 2: What are the
chances that you're valuable enough to be worth a bullet plus the plane
ticket for the assassin, and you're still unable to get a job in the
field?)

(b) Why do you rate a mention on valleywag if it actually happens?

> Sorry guys. I won't be coming back.

<cues up "Same old song and dance" by Aerosmith>... Yeah, we've heard
THAT before.
