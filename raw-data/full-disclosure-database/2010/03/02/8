Subject: Re: Wordpress plugin 'Analytics360'-
	authenticated user sql injection

Hi there,

here's an update to this advisory. Affected Versions are now <= 1.2.1.

Reasoning:
I noticed, that the author tried to fix this bug by implementing validation
via regex matching.
Sadly, that regex can be bypassed easily because it only checks if a valid
date string is in the GET param. That said, it should be clear that the sql
injection is unfixed in version 1.2.1.

The fix in Version 1.2.1 looks like this:
-------------
$start = (preg_match('/\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}/', $_GET['start_date']) ?
$_GET['start_date'] : '0000-00-00');
$end = (preg_match('/\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}/', $_GET['end_date']) ?
$_GET['end_date'] : '0000-00-00');
add_filter('posts_where', create_function(
'$where',
'return $where." AND post_date >= \''.$start.'\' AND post_date <
\''.$end.'\'";'
));
--------------
As you can see, the Regexp pattern is missing terminations in the form of
START / END.

Please change the first two lines like this:
----
$start = (preg_match('/^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$/', $_GET['start_date']) ?
$_GET['start_date'] : '0000-00-00');
$end = (preg_match('/^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$/', $_GET['end_date']) ?
$_GET['end_date'] : '0000-00-00');
----
