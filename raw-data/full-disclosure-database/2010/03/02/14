Subject: WebRaider [TOOL]

I did a demo of WebRaider in AppSec DC 2009 and finally managed to release it.

WebRaider is a PoC quality tool to get a reverse shell out of SQL
Injections (MSSQL)  by using One Click Ownage (
http://www.mavitunasecurity.com/s/research/OneClickOwnage.pdf ).

Slides:  http://www.slideshare.net/fmavituna/one-click-ownage-ferruh-mavituna-3

It's licensed under GPLv3 and all the source code is in the Google
Code SVN. Source code includes all the required files to create your
own payload for manually using One Click Ownage attack as well.

More information about the tool, source code and download:
