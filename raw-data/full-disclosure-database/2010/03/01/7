Well, a little constructive paranoia is a good thing, to keep everyone
aware of the risks of abuse. We do have a big responsibility to keep
moving forward, even though there is no certainty about what the future
looks like, and that involves some risk.

The best way I think you can help, is to try the new bits out, and give
good feedback in a way that helps people understand what you really
mean, and how best to balance that with everyone else's feedback too.

All the best,
Mark
