I'm not interested in this kind of behaviour from young people.

You had the opportunity to read an experts view of national
security and intelligence and you blew it.

You decided to use and abuse my web log postings for your own self
satisfaction.

You made cheap remarks about 0-day and Yahoo Messenger and hackers,
none of which I have anything to do with.

I spend my career working against hackers, proposing new laws and
lobbying the government to make life difficult for hackers.

You don't seem to care what damage misrepsentation does to someone.
You lost me my job opportunity at Yahoo and MI5.

Mark Seiden, any chance you will hire me still tho?
