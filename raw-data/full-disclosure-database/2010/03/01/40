why dont you use your big words to explain how is it fair that im
banned here

i am trying to save lives. i pose as a minor in yahoo chatrooms and
let old fat blokes message me.

i expose them.

im a mi5 honeytrap and the government is going to come to me and
ask for my help. i record videos of these guys jerking off and
forward them to mark seiden.

it's counter intelligent.

what are your accomplishments valdis?
