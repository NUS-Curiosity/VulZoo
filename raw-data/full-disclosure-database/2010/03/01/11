Yes.

To clarify, this post was meant to be satirical. It was not written
by an employee at Yahoo. I apologize for mentioning age. (In the
United States, you're not allowed to mention age, creed, gender,
etc. in terms of hiring new guys)

However, I have a question for you Mark.

What is your opinion on Andrew Wallace and "n3td3v"? Would Yahoo!
consider vouching for him after all the high-value intel he's given
you?
