Hit up one of the survivalist websites or magazines, look for info on
living off the land.  Learn bowhunting - a rifle tends to draw attention
outside the local hunting season.  Read up on how the Appalachian Trail
through-hikers handle being on a trail for 6 months.

Oh - and get a decent water filter.  Giardia out in the woods is a horrid
way to die a slow death.
