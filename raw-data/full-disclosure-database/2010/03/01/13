Hello.

I am interested in getting some advice from you security
professionals (white hat and black hat) about going underground.

I am sick of big brother, I love independence, I was to experience
the world and have no commitments.

I am just sick of being held down in one place. It's too easy for
people to harass and stalk you.  You gotta be mobile. Fancy free
and foot loose.

You gotta be underground.

Have any advice for living out of a bag? Any stories? Any lessons?
