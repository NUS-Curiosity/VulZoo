Yahoo has a ton of cash and a lot of experience put into make a
great experience.

But they do have those embarrassing security flaws you just
mentioned.

Also, they're not even using cellphone calling or having real
people man cracked email accounts. Instead they let 15 year old
4channers backdoor you.

The most secure way to fortify your mail to scramble your forgotten
pw's, and if you do that, and you lose your pw, You're toast.

I'm sure yahoo also has some shitty last 4 # of your CC.

Google's way of doing it is superior. They hire pakis to do that
stuff.

Yahoo is amazing is many aspects (for years they had a great
directory, and even today have superb search), but I never had the
impression that security was their strongpoint.

I wouldn't trust my mail or personal data with them.
