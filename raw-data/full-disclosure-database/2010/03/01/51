Really?

Cause they could sure use some.... (Considering the spam I get from Yahoo, where the
Yahoo abuse people deny that web113903.mail.gq1.yahoo.com [98.136.167.123] is part of Yahoo.)

I'd say you have a serious security problem, since if that's true, someone has compromised
your DNS servers as well as records at ARIN that say Yahoo owns that network.

That didn't come from Yahoo, either, according to your employees.

That didn't come from Yahoo either...

Looks like someone is totally having a field day with your DNS servers and ARIN, because it certainly
can't be that your abuse staff is completely incompetent and ignoring spam complaints with lies
about it not coming from Yahoo.
