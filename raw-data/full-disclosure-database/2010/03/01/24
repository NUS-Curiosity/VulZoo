Simon: What you need is a constant source of income. I suggest you
study TAO Spam (more than just inboxing, mind you.)
You will need an anonymous corporation for fund intake. You will want
a business bank account. You will want to transfer the funds that come
into your account into electronic cash. You will want to mix this cash
about. You will want to lose and create these companies often.

Expect to take a 35% (conservative figure) hit on all profit for
exchange services.

Be sure to know your way around high quality printing and photoshop.
Have a large database of Water & Electric bills. Invest in a
lamination machine. Invest in a magstrip writer & logger, invest in a
smartcard season logger/reader/writer. Learn how to solder. Learn how
to do fast-low cost fabrication.

Acquaint yourself with prepaid visa gift cards and e-cash debit cards.
Acquaint yourself with online (re-)mailing services.
Dispose of all digital equipment you already own and buy new kit with
prepaid visa gift cards or cash.  Perform activations at wifi spots,
don't make the mistake of being in the view of security cameras.
Remove their batteries. Relocate and disappear.

Do not contact friends and family. If you operate online do not use a
constant pseudonym.
