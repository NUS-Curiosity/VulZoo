You can post to Bugtraq, your own blog, pass it to people you know on F-D that
might pass along any *actual* new info you have, send it to the US CERT (who
are perfectly willing to take reports from outside the borders), etc etc etc.
I know even if I was banned from F-D and every other list I was on, I could
easily scare up 3 or 4 dozen people I could mail privately and at least one
of them would pass the info along to those who need to know.

Now, is that merely "biggest", or is there anybody with actual security clout?
L0pht was never big, but they had clue and clout.  50,000 wannabies may be
biggest, but not have clout.

And if you're an intelligence group with 6,000 professionals, *somebody* should
have a list of likely contacts. In fact, that's something that should make
you think for a moment - if there's 6,000 people, and *one* of them is banned
from this *one* list, who are these *other* 5,999 professionals who are so
incompetent that they can't get the word out for you? Please let us know, so
we can avoid hiring them.  

Seriously guys - 6,000 *professionals* and *not one* of you can find your ass
with both hands, a flashlight, and a map?

It's been a long time since I laughed so hard I almost wet myself. Thanks
for the Monday humor. ;)
