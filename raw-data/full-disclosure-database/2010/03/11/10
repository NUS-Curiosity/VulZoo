-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to remove arbitrary XML files
on vulnerable installations of Skype. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious

will trigger the deletion of an arbitrary attacker specified XML file.
