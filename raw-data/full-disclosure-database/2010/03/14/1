Subject: Re: SecurityFocus to partially shut down

Can I have a chance to be a part of n3td3v operations?


I have a diverse array of talents for my age (technology, psychology, US law) and a unique life experience. I am a former boyscout who had a great childhood. Yet a traumatic adolescence at the hands of family, peers and later my own government.

I want to make a difference in the world Andrew. I want to belong to something, and not a bunch of loser h4x0rs. I want to be the guy who defends the status quo. I aspire to be a man of honor, who is honest. That's the most rebellious, maverick-like thing I can think of.

How do I join officially? Me and that Smithwaysecurity guy want in. Maybe MrX too.

I see Twitter becoming the new way to disclose vulnerabilities,
Securityfocus is kind of old fashioned now.

I don't really see a need for Full-disclosure mailing list now either.

People can post code and messages on blogs and post the link to
Twitter, thats how the threat landscape of the future will look, we
don't really need mailing lists now for straight forward vulnerability
disclosure.
