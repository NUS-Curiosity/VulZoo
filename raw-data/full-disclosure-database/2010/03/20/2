Gadi accidentally posting a 5 year old article and said this will be
in every airport in 5 years.

What's funnier, this or his buddy Larry posting about it
http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/using_laser_to_fingerprint_pap.php
who didn't realise as well.

He thanks Gadi for a "hat tip".

"If it works out well in testing look for technology like this to
appear in passports, pharmaceutical packaging, credit cards and other
sensitive documents within a few years."

"Hat tip to Gadi Evron."

Is that 5 years as in 2010, or 5 years as in 2015.

Comedy gold,

Andrew
