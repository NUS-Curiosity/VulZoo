Dude. Take your meds. It's not all about Mossad. Or at least learn as much
about biometrics as the average CISSP does (at which point you'd realize that
what Dan actually wrote was the kindergarden primer level and unlikely to help
an actual spook agency). If you're reading "Dan defected" into it, you
totally missed the message.

Dan: Regarding the steganographic subtext in your note: Sea cucumbers, with
lots of fresh ginger, of course.
