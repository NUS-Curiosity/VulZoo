Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The 5th IEEE International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted
Software (Malware 2010) will be held in Nancy, France, Oct. 20-21,
2010. The conference is designed to bring together experts from
industry, academia, and government to present and discuss, in an open
environment, the latest advances and discoveries in the field of
malicious and unwanted software. Techniques, economics and legal
issues surrounding the topic of Malware, and the methods to detect and
control them will be discussed.

This year's conference will pay particular attention to (and will also
be extensively discussed in a panel session) the pressing topic of
"Malware and Cloud Computing".  As low-cost netbooks become popular,
Google's Chrome OS enters the mainstream, and social networks
(Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and so forth) become
ubiquitous, the security dangers associated with the new computing
paradigm increase exponentially.  In effect, "Cloud Computing",
Multi-tenant, Single Schema, Single Server Platforms (C2S3P) increase
vulnerabilities by providing a single point of failure and attack for
organized criminal networks. Critical/sensitive/private information is
at risk, and very much like previous technology adoption trends, such
as wireless networks, the dash for success is trumping the need for
security.

Thus, the organizers of Malware 2010 solicit original written
contributions addressing these issues and research questions.
Manuscripts focusing on the security properties of Cloud Computing,
the risks associated with the deployment of such networks, and the
analysis of real incidents where a breach has occurred will be
particularly welcomed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submissions are solicited in, but not limited to, the following areas
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Theoretical aspects and new directions on Malware related research
Analysis and measurements of real malware incidents
Worms, viruses and other propagating Malware
Spyware, keystroke loggers, information theft Malware
Honeypots and other sample collection methodologies
Botnet attacks, detection/tracking and defense
Malware economics and black market studies
Code reverse engineering tools and practices
Malware performance, analysis and capture tools
Anti-spam and anti-phishing techniques and practices
Legal aspects of unwanted software use
Malware and its impact in social networking and cloud computing
Rootkit and virtualization techniques
Malware in wireless mobile devices

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Publication
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The proceedings of the conference will be published in printed, and
DVD, form and will be included in the IEEE Xplore digital library.  In
addition, the Conference's Technical Program Committee will select one
manuscript as a recipient of the "Best Paper Award".  The Best Paper
Award author, together with the authors of a few selected manuscripts
from the conference, will be invited to submit an extended version to
a special issue of the Journal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Paper Submission Information
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Papers should be submitted through EDAS system at:

http://www.edas.info/

Submitted manuscripts must be 10-point font size, and should not
exceed 8 single-spaced pages in length, including the abstract,
figures, and references. Authors whose manuscript exceeds the 8 page
limit may be allowed to include two additional pages for an extra
charge.  However, under no circumstances shall a submitted manuscript
exceed the 10 page limit. Submitted papers must not substantially
overlap with papers that have been published or that are
simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with
proceedings.
