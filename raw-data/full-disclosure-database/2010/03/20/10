Subject: Re: Setting the record straight on "The Return of
	Koobface"

This reads as "waaa i noticed this first and didn't think much of it but now
that someone else is making a big deal, i want my credit". Maybe you
reported on it first on your blog, with a single sentence that wasn't even
the primary focus of the post. Regardless if an up rise in koobface is
significantly news worthy or not, you apparently failed to draw enough
attention (or the right attention) to it at the time.

In other words, maybe you did it first, but someone else did it better.

What's more valuable to an enterprise, someone that quickly writes a risk
assessment that's so sloppy the management with authority to act on the
findings don't even bother to read it, or someone that takes the time to
write a report on the same findings that actually speaks to the business and
be able to make positive changes happen.

You talk about being bitter towards the security industry (which IS
understandable) but maybe it's time to reflect back a little on yourself.
Maybe it's not ALL the industries fault. Maybe the sources of your
bitterness have a little something to do with your inability to make enough
of the right things happen. Sure you're a "Big Time Security Professional",
but maybe your blog wasn't enough to get the word out. Maybe you felt it
wasn't even worth getting the word out or sounding any alarms. If that's the
case though, don't go back now and try to take credit.
