I think its funny that he has been pretending to be me for over 12
months non-stop and failed miserably. Please try harder Son of Ram, I
need more content to forward to SOCA so they can prosecute you.

Remember and here is a quote from Andy Auld, head of intelligence at
SOCA's e-crime department:

“The legal system doesn’t work against nicknames and email addresses.
It works against real names and real addresses”.
