Subject: China denounces Google 'US ties'

Google provides US intelligence agencies with a record of its search
engine results, the state-run news agency Xinhua said.

It also accused Google of trying to change Chinese society by imposing
American values on it.

Google denied that it was influenced by the US government, a
spokesperson for the company was quoted as saying by AP.

"Google's high-level officials have intricate ties with the US
government. It is also an open secret that some security experts in
the Pentagon are from Google", reporters from Xinhua wrote in a
commentary.

It is well known that The NSA have partnered up with Google and have
refused EPIC the details of the deal, I think we should listen to what
The Chinese are telling us.
