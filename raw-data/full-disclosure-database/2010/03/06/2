Hello.

I sincerely apologize.

You cross-posting on wikipedia with an alias.
http://preview.tinyurl.com/andrew-wallace-spams-wikipedia
and
http://preview.tinyurl.com/andrew-wallace-crossposts-orig

This nobel editor corrected your Wikipedia self-promotion:
http://preview.tinyurl.com/andrew-wallace-gets-rejected

Your blog cross-posting from cnet.
http://preview.tinyurl.com/andrew-wallace-crosspost-troll

You cross-paste your delusional rants across mailing lists. Sloppily mirroring them like a deadbeat father spreads his seed.

Take responsibility for your actions. If someone did impersonate you, no one cares.

You're an infamous troll, you're on wikipedia as a troll. You're in news publications as a troll. You have absolutely no skill.

You've harassed and stalked a lot of people Andrew Wallace, and you being schizophrenic isn't an excuse any more. Take your meds and leave this list alone.

Ah,

So you have an issue with impersonation and copypasta, despite all signs appearing you are the sole source of it on this list. I haven't seen any evidence that you were ever impersonated. Every person sounded exactly like you.

Wait a second.




What's that?

And he corrected it!

That son of a bitch!
