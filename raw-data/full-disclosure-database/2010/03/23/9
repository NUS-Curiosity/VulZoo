I think someone should start a list to police the proper use of
TLD's as per RFC 1591. Because I know half of you aren't Commercial
entities!
Also the list should also enforce using a real name for an email
address, and not signing by another.
And BTW whats up with tagging numbers at the end, there is no
mention of that in the RFC......
Oh I missed this the list had been to quiet and civil lately.

Oh and on last one...
'Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!'
'I fart in your general direction.'
'and now for something completely different' .......
Well maybe three.

Thanks I'll be here all week and don't forget to tip your waitress.
