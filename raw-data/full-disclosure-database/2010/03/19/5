Do you think Gadi post this on purpose as a warning to the British
government that the Israeli government want this technology broken by
someone on the list?

Why else would the Israeli's post to a British mailing list to tell us
about our own techology that we already know about because we made it?

We can't stop the Israeli's posting to this mailing list but it seems
like a warning to me.

In other news it seems Dan Kaminsky has defected over to the Israeli
side to help them work out how to crack it.

Now that Dan Kaminsky is a supporter of the Israeli's and is helping
them out, should western intelligence trust him anymore?
