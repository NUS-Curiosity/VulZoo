Consider a production line for printing anything that is used for access control. Now providing there is absolute consistency across every
sample of the material printed/magnetised or otherwise marked during a production run, then only one token need be scanned by laser. This
single data set can then be used by access points to verify the validity of said token(s) when presented.

The token can be a bus ticket, a passport, currency or indeed anything that can be manufactured consistently to the tolerances that this laser
scanning system requires.

Of course given access to the same scanning equipment a hacker could scan the tokens and obtain the required data for cloning the material that
the token is made from. However, how difficult would it be to replicate the production process required to actually clone the material the token
is made from? Not to mention any other security mechanisms that may be employed.

I think there is a control potential here but only if the manufacturing tech is precise enough.
