I thought the point was that there *wasn't* absolute consistency, and what
was being measured was the deviations in each sample.

A bigger concern is whether normal wear and tear will invalidate the
measurements - some spots will be rubbed smoother by friction, others
will be roughed up. Yes, the fine article says this:

"This continued even after they were subjected to rough handling, including
submersion in water, scorching, scrubbing with an abrasive cleaning pad and
being scribbled on with thick black marker."

But I wonder what several years of wear will do.
