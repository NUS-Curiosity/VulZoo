If deviations in the manufacturing process were consistently between known limits, it still serves as a control.
A hacker may learn those limits but then the problem of recreating an equal manufacturing process still remains.
Obviously if the deviation in each sample is such that the known level of consistency is so wide that the process is easily
replicated then the tech is useless as an indicator of integrity.

Yes I would agree, but for tokens of limited lifetime perhaps there is still potential.
Concert tickets, travel tickets etc.
Besides one could always force renewal of the token once it's valid lifetime has expired.

I still think there may be a potential security benefit here.
