Hi Andrew. I'm sorry for your troubles. I'd be happy to go over these issues with you.

You have two main problems. One blaming others for all your faults "because of you", never taking responsibility for your own actions. Second, for believing you had any worth to this community in the first place.

Your blog doesn't really have anything useful. It's just opinions and punditry. Perhaps a little paranoia based off your psychotic agitation and behavioral trait of wanting to be someone important, and hating to watch others get spotlight... You're the janitor that has those grandiose ideations. Just like so many Americans want to be millionaires with little true work. Look at American Idol. Most people who are really low in the chain of command have wait their entire lives to hear they're in need.

Be wary Mr Wallace, people may use this to take advantage of you. Very few people win the lottery, You should know.

You need to start at the bottom, get a job fixing computers. Learn how to do more than chat and troll.

You can't really have a family until you can hold a job at Burger King or Best Buy.

Until then.

It was a good national security & intelligence blog and lot's of
experts were reading it, there was no reason for you to do what you
did on Monday, but you decided to do it anyway.

You ruined it for everyone else in the intelligence community, now
they are all needing to be added to an invite list and the general
public aren't being able to read it, because of you.

If it wasn't for you I wouldn't have been flamed into an argument on
the list and wouldn't have been banned on January 2009 and I would
still be contributing good information to the list, such as who I
think was really behind various cyber attacks that have happened and
be able to publicly post good cyber security policy suggestions to
counter the attacks, such as Google Aurora.

It just means for you less public information from the security &
intelligence community that you don't get to know about.

I have access to the information about cyber attacks and policy, I
could be posting about it all, but that all ended on January 2009
because of you.

All been thrown away and is not publicly available information because of you.

I have years of hands on experience in cyber security, have entered
into the intelligence community and had plenty to offer this list, if
it wasn't for you who flamed me into an argument on purpose just so
you could have me banned last year.

I was never a troll, however you are one big troll.

You don't have the interest of the security & intelligence community
at heart, you just create random names to wind people up, I hate you,
I completely hate you and I'm watching everything your *real body*
person are up to.

You wanted people to be more open with the public and release
information about whats going on but you blew it on January 2009.

I happily accepted being banned from the list, but you couldn't accept
it and you started popping up aliases since January 2009 pretending to
be me and people thought it was me, however it was you.

I created a national security & intelligence blog instead at the
beginning of 2010 because I was banned from the list on January 2009
to offer the public the information that I couldn't post to the list
because of you.

However, because of you, I can't even have a public blog now, because
of you, and now nobody can be open and transparent with the public
about whats *really* going on because of you.

Keep the aliases coming, I'm sure our monitoring systems don't link
them all up and know exactly who is posting even before they reach the
list as they are travelling over the internet to the list server.

You had the chance for the intelligence community to be more open with
the public about what the bad guys are upto but you blew it big time.

Son of Ram today, what alias will you be using tomorrow?

Andrew
