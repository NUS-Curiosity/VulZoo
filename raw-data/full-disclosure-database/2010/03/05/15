I don't want back on the list, I don't want to be here. I want to get
on with my life and raise a family.

Tell the person impersonating me for over a year to get off the list
and leave me and the list alone.

I don't want to be here haven't been here for over a year.

Get this sorted draw a line under it, stop pretending to be me.
