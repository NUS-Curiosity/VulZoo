Andrew, "we" (as in 'we', the community) know we had the chance to keep you
here.

But (if at all), there were just a few people who were against banning you.

There are reasons for that.

Please accept it and keep your worthless chatter out of the list. This also
applies to your "national security & intelligence topics".

Have a nice day
