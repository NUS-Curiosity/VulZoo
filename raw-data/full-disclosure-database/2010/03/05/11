Since many people on this list chime in with their .02 - I might as  
well point out to all who respond to Andrew's worthless e-mails are  
just as FUCKING STUPID if not more.

Have you seen the many worthless responses to him? GET A FUCKING LIFE!  
Stop spamming my inbox.

Why is it that the people who actually contribute you never hear them  
complain less reply and continue the worthless chatter.

Stop the bullshit, I don't want to unsubscribe from this list and I  
really don't mind having to delete Andrew's mail. I just don't want to  
be spammed by a dozen even more worthless replies.

Thank you.

My .02 -
