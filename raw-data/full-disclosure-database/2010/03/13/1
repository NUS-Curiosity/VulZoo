Would the damages come from professional losses? (Pardon me, but I believe you said you never had a paying job) or would it come from emotional distress? (Have you ever ended up paying psychiatric bills?)

Also, do you live with your parents?

Do you take welfare from the government?

What is your family situation like? Do you have siblings?

Is there anything about your upbringing you would like us to know about?
