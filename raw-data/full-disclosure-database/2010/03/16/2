Subject: Re: SecurityFocus to partially shut down

No one here wants to found a new group or whatever you try here.
just accept that you have been banned and stop that twitter nonsense.
shove that bird up your fat arse and install your damn wiki on localhost.
there you can have great discussions with other personalities..

my best wishes


btw: you realized one of the good things about this mailing list? no fucked
up idiot can easily delete all of his posts. fucking around and then
deleting your group of professionals along with your blessed twitter account
is not possible here. evidence of your bs is everywhere, eternity

PS: If you do indeed realize your crap, then please don't abuse OUR INBOXES
(=this list) to promote your "new platform". Always remember: you are not
welcome here anyway.
