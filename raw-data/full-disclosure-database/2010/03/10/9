Oh yeah, they paid a pretty penny for these things, along with the rest
of the infrastructure. It was serious business. In the early days at
that company they had quite a lot of problems, I can imagine when
capital was low and trying to get this stuff in place would be difficult.

Still trying to rack my brains what we where using...it wasn't anything
cisco though (well on the DDos mitigation anyway). I do remember it has
a horrid Java driven web GUI...what is it with net devices and Java
driven gui's...like Citrix Netscalers...absolute pain. Just tell
customers to SSH in and use that instead of wasting time and money on a
gui that was absolutely horrid to use </rant> (Yes I am awear that a lot
of people who are "network engineers" can't actually use a command line
so there is a real market for this shit)
