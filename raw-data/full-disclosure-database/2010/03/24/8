Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Only Cisco 7200 Series and Cisco 7301 routers with VPN Acceleration
Module 2+ (VAM2+) are affected by this vulnerability.

To display a summary of the configuration information for the crypto
engines and to determine if a VAM is present and used in the device,
use the "show crypto engine brief" command, as shown in the following
example:

    Router#show crypto engine brief
            crypto engine name:  Virtual Private Network (VPN) Module
            crypto engine type:  hardware
                         State:  Enabled 
                      Location:  slot 4
            VPN Module in slot:  4
                  Product Name:  VAM2+ 
             Software Serial #:  55AA
                     Device ID:  001F - revision 0000
                     Vendor ID:  0000
                   Revision No:  0x001F0000
                  VSK revision:  0
                  Boot version:  902
                   DPU version:  0
                   HSP version:  3.4(3) (PRODUCTION)
                  Time running:  00:00:10
                   Compression:  Yes
                           DES:  Yes
                         3 DES:  Yes
                       AES CBC:  Yes (128,192,256)
                      AES CNTR:  No
         Maximum buffer length:  4096
              Maximum DH index:  5120
              Maximum SA index:  5120
            Maximum Flow index:  10230

Note: In the previous example, the "Product Name" VAM2+ is displayed,
indicating that the router has the VAM2+ installed. The Enabled 
keyword under "State" indicates that the VAM2+ is enabled and active.

IKE is enabled by default if IPsec is used. Cisco IOS devices that
are configured for IKE will listen on UDP port 500, UDP port 4500 if
the device is configured for NAT Traversal (NAT-T), or UDP ports 848
or 4848 if the device is configured for Group Domain of
Interpretation (GDOI). The following outputs show a router that is
listening on UDP port 500:

        Router#show ip sockets 
        Proto    Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out Stat TTY OutputIF
        ....
         17   --listen--          192.168.66.129    500   0   0   11   0 
        ....
    
    Or
    
        Router#show udp
        Proto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF
         17       --listen--          192.0.2.1         500   0   0  1011   0 
         17(v6)   --listen--          --any--           500   0   0 20011   0 
        Router#

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the 
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router#show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of
C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds available.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
