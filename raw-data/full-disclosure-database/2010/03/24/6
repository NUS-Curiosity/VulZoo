Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Deliver

==================================
 Deliver, multiple vulnerabilites
 March 24, 2010
 CVE-2010-0439
==================================

==Description==

Deliver (http://deliver.sourceforge.net/), a mail delivery program installed
suid
root as /usr/bin/deliver, is vulnerable to several race conditions that can
be
exploited by a local attacker using symbolic links.  On systems using
Deliver
over NFS, these attacks can result in gaining root privileges via taking
ownership
of critical system files.  On other systems, these attacks can result in
denial-of-service conditions and information disclosure.  In addition, users
can
deny service to other users by creating lockfiles for other users'
mailboxes.

==Solution==

Users are advised to discontinue use of Deliver in the absence of a patch or
new release from the developer.
