Sorry, your exploit doesn't do squat on a 64-bit Firefox 3.7a3 with plenty of
RAM. It chugs for about 7-8 seconds and displays a *very* wide page.  It must
be your small-penis machine running out of RAM and swap space. :)

Hint - this issue was well understood back in 1964. Literally. IBM's OS/360 had
a GETMAIN macro that allocated storage that could encounter this same basic
"out of memory" issue.  So not only is this a non-bug that was known when you
were still being toilet-trained, this may be the first recorded case of
somebody reporting a non-bug that was known when their *parents* were still
being toilet-trained.
