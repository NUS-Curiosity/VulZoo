ZDNet and Cnet?

You take those guys seriously?

They make money off selling 20 dollar rip off magazines to laypeople at Borders. It's all about creating this fake environment where you can rip people off.

i can't think of a single thing of value that has came from layman websites like that.

Hey Ryan,

I've tried to contact you through the link on http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=5573 http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=5573  about the contents of that post, but I have not heard from you. There are some factual errors in that post that I thought you may want to correct, otherwise people might get the impression that you do not know what you're talking about or are trying to make a big story out of the release of a 5 year old exploit. I assume you missed my previous email that expanded on my original post to fix these misunderstandings, so if you read this, send me an email and I'll get you up to speed.

Cheers and thanks,
SkyLined
