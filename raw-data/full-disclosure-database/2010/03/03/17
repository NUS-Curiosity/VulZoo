Hey Ryan,

I've tried to contact you through the link on
http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=5573 about the contents of that post, but
I have not heard from you. There are some factual errors in that post that I
thought you may want to correct, otherwise people might get the impression
that you do not know what you're talking about or are trying to make a big
story out of the release of a 5 year old exploit. I assume you missed my
previous email that expanded on my original post to fix these
misunderstandings, so if you read this, send me an email and I'll get you up
to speed.

Cheers and thanks,
SkyLined
