Hey Ryan,

 

I've tried to contact you through the link on
http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=5573 about the contents of that post,
but I have not heard from you. There are some factual errors in that
post that I thought you may want to correct, otherwise people might get
the impression that you do not know what you're talking about or are
trying to make a big story out of the release of a 5 year old exploit. I
assume you missed my previous email that expanded on my original post to
fix these misunderstandings, so if you read this, send me an email and
I'll get you up to speed.

 

Cheers and thanks,

SkyLined
