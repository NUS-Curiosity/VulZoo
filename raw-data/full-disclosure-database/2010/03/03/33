Yes, very little of what you say on this list makes sense. You're better off just lurking. Do what your name says, learn.

Also, Berend-Jan is an idiot.

These tech journalists at Wired, CNet and ZDNet are all on top of their ivory towers, and they do little to answer emails, or reach out to people. Bernard is a classic example.

ZDNet and Cnet is the more idiotic of them, One of their writers is some chick who sucked chode whose resume includes making cappucinos. If you can fill a sweater you can get a job there, so you can have some know-nothing pretentious dips with black-rim glasses going down on hot starbux ladies. They write as if infosecs a high school newspaper or it's myspace.

And then of course, the thing that makes the ivory tower of tech bloggers different from traditional journalists is they go out on Twitter and such, where they ask you to follow them to ramp up their egos and subterfuge even more.

I wish Cnet and zdnet would just go bankrupt, but idiots will always buy into that cruft. (I'm not registered to comment on that site to correct their false news, it gets burried and editors never read).

Wired has some wit to it. I like wired.

Most if not all "laypeople" are behind the curve.
And although Cnet and ZDnet are the last place I would look for contemporary information,
they do help some layfolk actually realise there is a curve.
My own attempts at creating an informative and helpful website wrt security are also behind the curve,
but if the information provided stops one person clicking on that link that will turn their box into a zombie...

Yes for security professionals at the cutting edge ZDNet and Cnet are lacking.

On an entirely different tack.
I wonder how many of those subscribed to this list had a mentor during their development.
Are your skills honed from reading and associating disparate information sources, analysing
the provided information and recreating those scenarios using a lab, devised through trail and error,
on your own hardware. Or did someone hold your hand and guide you through setting up your working environment
whilst indicating the must not and must do? Or did you just learn to use metasploit and consider yourself a hacker?

Sometimes I wish I had a mentor, only because I can take it so far alone before I need a rest to allow may brain
to comprehend what I have been feeding it. It would be nice now and again to be able to take something for granted,
a trusted source of info I didn't have to double check.

Then again there is fun to be had tapping a white stick against a wall.

My apologies too much wine and too few friends ;-)

Take care
