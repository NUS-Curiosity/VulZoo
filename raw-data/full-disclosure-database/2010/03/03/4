Andrew,

I'm happy that you've made the choice to settle down and have a
family.

But wait a second, James O'Hare?

Your behaviour of using pretextual identities is suspiciously
similar to all those escapades we had.

Ah, 69? All about the family, isn't that true, Mr. Wallace?

Perhaps you should run for political office.

Did you meet this girlfriend on Yahoo chat just this morning? I'm
sure she feels very safe and secure having an authority-type figure
such as yourself with her. ;-)

You had about 12 hours to chart a new life course, and I'm positive
you won't be back trolling this list ever again.
