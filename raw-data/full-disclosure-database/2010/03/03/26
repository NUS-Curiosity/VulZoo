Details
=======

The Cisco DMM is used to manage, schedule, and publish digital media for
Cisco Digital Signs, Cisco Cast and Cisco Show and Share. This security
advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities in the Cisco DMM.
These vulnerabilities are independent of each other.

Default Credentials
+------------------

Cisco DMM versions earler than 5.2 have default credentials that could
allow an attacker full control of the installed web applications,
including settings, status, and deployment.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCta03378 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier
CVE-2010-0570.

Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
+---------------------------------

A vulnerability exists in Cisco DMM versions 5.0.x and 5.1.x that could
allow authenticated, but unauthorized users to change the configuration
and obtain full access of the device.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtc46008 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier
CVE-2010-0571.

Information Leakage Vulnerability
+--------------------------------

The Cisco DMM can be used to manage the Cisco Digital Media Player.
The Cisco Digital Media Player is an IP-based endpoint that can play
high-definition live and on-demand video, motion graphics, web pages,
and dynamic content on digital displays.

A vulnerability exists in all Cisco DMM versions earler than 5.2 that
could allow authenticated but unauthorized users to view Cisco Digital
Media Player user credentials and LDAP credentials (if configured) in
error log messages and stack traces.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtc46050 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier
CVE-2010-0572.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory based
on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in
this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS
at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the default credentials vulnerability could
allow an attacker to change the settings, status, and deployment of the
installed web applications.

Successful exploitation of the privilege escalation vulnerability could
allow authenticated, but unauthorized users to change the configuration
and obtain full access of the device.

Successful exploitation of the information leakage vulnerability could
allow authenticated but unauthorized users to view Cisco Digital Media
Player user credentials and LDAP credentials (if configured) in error
log messages and stack traces.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

All of the vulnerabilities described in this security advisory have been
fixed in Cisco DMM version 5.2.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds that can mitigate any of these vulnerabilities.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be
bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for software
upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreements with third-party support organizations, such
as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for guidance and assistance with the
appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or fix
is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it is
deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service
contract, and customers who purchase through third-party vendors but are
unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale
should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance
Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to a
free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested
through the TAC.
