Subject: Medium security hole in Varnish reverse proxy

Hi,

I've identified a couple of security flaws affecting the Varnish reverse proxy 
which may allow privilege escalation. These issues were reported by email to 
the vendor but he feels that it is a configurational issue rather than a design 
flaw.  Whilst I can partially see his point in that the administrative 
interface can be disabled, I'm not convinced that making a C compiler 
available over a network interface without authentication is sound practice, 
especially when the resultant compiled code can be made to run as root rather 
trivially.

Tim
