Subject: Malware Collections and Feed Exchange

Dear All,

I'm really proud to announce that the first stage of the Dissect.pe
project is in beta now!

The idea of the project is to provide a free interface for malware
analysis, similar to other existing projects, but with advances that
will be announced when we start freely dissecting samples.

For now, the system has malware classification and is open for
partnership with industry vendors and other projects for feed exchange.

The link for the project is:  http://feeds.dissect.pe/


Best Regards,


Rodrigo.
