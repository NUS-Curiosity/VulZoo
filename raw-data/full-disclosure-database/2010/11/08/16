ZDI-10-241: Novell GroupWise Internet Agent Content-Type Parsing Integer Signedness Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

November 8, 2010

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Novell

-- Affected Products:
Novell Groupwise

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 10653.

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell GroupWise. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the gwia.exe module responsible for
parsing e-mail messages received by the server. When the code encounters
a Content-Type header it proceeds to parse out the numbers within its
contents. The process does not properly check for signed integers and if
it encounters one, it loops excessively while writing to the stack. This
can be abused by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the
context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:

The GroupWise Internet Agent (GWIA) has a vulnerability in the way that
it parses numbers within the "Content-Type" header of a received
message, which could potentially allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of GWIA.

Affected versions: GroupWise 8.0x, 8.01x, 8.02. Previous versions of
GroupWise are likely also vulnerable but are no longer supported.
Customers on earlier versions of GroupWise should, at a minimum, upgrade
their GWIAs and associated Domains to version 8.02HP in order to secure
their system.
