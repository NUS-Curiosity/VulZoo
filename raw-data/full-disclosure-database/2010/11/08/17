-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Groupwise Internet Agent.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the IMAP server component which listens by
default on TCP port 143. When handling an IMAP LIST command with a large
parameter the process attempts to free the same memory twice. A remote
attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under
the context of the IMAP server.

Description: The GroupWise Internet Agent has a vulnerability in its
IMAP component that could potentially allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of GWIA
where IMAP services are enabled.
Affected versions:
GroupWise 8.0x, 8.01x, 8.02. Previous versions of GroupWise are likely
also vulnerable but are no longer supported. Customers on earlier
versions of GroupWise should, at a minimum, upgrade their GWIAs and
associated Domains to version 8.02HP in order to secure their system.
