Subject: Fuzzing and SEH

Hi list,

When i run some fuzzing tests i can't trap the exception when found some
bug due invalid input. I'm trying to figure out a smart way to handle
the exception, and tell me when it run.

On the PoC i've got the daemon crashed but it still working whithout
response the requests.

I'm reading the Sulley framework and PyDBG doc to find some trick to get
it working.

Any ideia?
