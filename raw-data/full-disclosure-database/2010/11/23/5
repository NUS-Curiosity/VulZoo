With a CISSP I expect you would have the skill to set up a VM, replicate the scenario and monitor system activity... Analysis.
A Scroogle/Google on some of your results should provide the answers you need. I'm sorry but I fail to understand how someone with a CISSP would
require help in dealing with this.

My limited experience leads me to believe that like any security analyst, a CISSP should have a lab of some description at home. Doubly so for a
CISSP who is a security analyst. Your initial post did you no favours and casts doubt on your abilities to live up to the standards required by
your qualification and position. The only time to leak information about security practice to this list is when you want a free pentest from
some of the less scrupulous members of FD.

Using plain text for emails shuts down a whole lot of attack vectors in OE, as it does in any email client. But you are a CISSP, you don't need
me telling you this.

Don't take my comments or the comments of others too hard and certainly not personally. This is a tough room, with some exacting professionals.
