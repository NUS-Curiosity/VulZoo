The person's domain that you were replying to is Canadian. They guy is
also not doing much to hide his name. Such skills that I employed are
beyond the normal abilities of a CISSP certified person, but I will now
disclose a special, top-secret tool that I used to probe to deepest,
darkest reaches of the Internet. It finally allowed me to find out
about Mr. Mullen. Now, just for you, I will tell you about it: It's
called "whois". This is just between me and you, so keep it under your
hat, OK?

On a more serious note, you need a thick skin for this list. I use
heavy filtration to weed out what I don't need, and focus on the
security announcements that interest me. Then, every once and a while
something comes along that makes the list worth while, like the thread
on SSH scans and the Chuck Norris bot.

Take care.
