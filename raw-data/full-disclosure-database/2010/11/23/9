Alright, before this REALLY explodes, I'm going to go ahead and point out the obvious troll behavior here. This might be my last response to this. :-P

We don't believe ourselves gods by any means, but YOU also can not call yourself a security professional in any sense, as you have little to no knowledge of security, and you have conducted yourself in a *very* un-professional manner. The reason that we are so angry about this is because you've taken our passion - the one thing we strive to do with the rest of our lives and essentially crapped all over it. You claim to be a CISSP, but thanks to you I now have to re-evaluate the value of such a title. If someone who clearly doesn't know what they're doing in the world of security can get one, then I don't believe it's a very good cert, now is it. 

I have absolutely *no* idea what you mean by 'hiding in such Russian-born domains'. I don't have too much time on my hands, but when I see someone taking something I love and trying to slap me in the face with it, I WILL say something, regardless of how busy I am. But then again, going back to the troll behavior, that might be exactly what you want, eh?

You sir, like I stated before, are exactly what's wrong with the security scene. There are so many subtle nuances in the security world, and the more I learn, the more I realize how little I actually know. You on the other-hand don't even realize that they're there! Security is ever-dynamic, so you need to constantly be learning (even if you've been in the industry for some time). 

Frustrating. That is the one word that comes to mind with your responses. Within our disclosures of your idiocy, we WERE trying to help you. You're just too smug to see that, so I think you may be the one with a god-complex sir, not I. I KNOW that I'm not the best at *anything* by any means, but I am learning every single day about stuff I don't know, and the cutting-edge of security technologies. You refuse to learn though, then expect to be right about everything. 

THAT'S why I'm pissed off.

As we see, our list has a few (luckily just a few) unprofessional people thinking of themselves as gods, and hiding in such Russian-born domains. It's useless to engage in any discussion as they have too much time and will waste our time as well. And it's useless to explain ethics, security basics, and our experience as they are kiddies. Eventually they will grow ... may be.

List, thank you very much

Keep it on the list.  No need for private emails if you need assistance - give everyone a chance!

My response was far more useful than your post - "I got pwned by an Office virus by opening an attachment in OE - What could it be??"  Jeeze dude.  And I didn't give any "adice" about "Noton."  I said to get someone professional, which you *clearly* need to do. 

You should look up these guys:  
http://www.rubos.com/pisa.html

Apparently they are Information System Security Professionals, and they are in the same town as you.  One even has a CISSP, so you KNOW that he knows what he is doing.  Funny thing is that he has the exact same name as you do.  What are the chances of that?  If these guys formed the company to sell services to businesses and individuals to comply with legal security and privacy requirements, then they should be able to figure out how to find an Office virus on XP, right?

You can even join them as "Security professionals and experienced Information Sestems professionals are welcome."  I'm not sure what a "Sestems professional" is, but it must be very important work.

Waste of time indeed.  Apple Stores are hiring "geniuses" for the holidays - even they know how to use XP and could help.

Your email is useless. It is on my home PC. If you have better adice than using Noton SW, then please use your mind to get something minigful.
If you can name the virus or where to find its instance, it would be a help. Otherwise do not waste you and my time.

You know, every time I start to get a bit of hope for what looks like an upward trend of businesses and organizations taking security seriously, I see crap like this.  Your organization is a Medicare prescription contractor with a national network of 61,022 contracted pharmacies, and not only are you running unpatched versions of old OS's and opening email attachments because they "look OK," but you have to post to Full Disclosure asking help for trivial virus detection and removal advice?   Now that everyone on FD knows that you are vulnerable and that you open email attachments, you've probably just caused the organization to be pwned 9 ways from Sunday. 

To answer your question, call a professional and have them do it.  And in the future, don't send out emails like this from your organization email announcing the state of your security.  That's what Hotmail is for.

Hello,
Opening looking OK email message in my MS OE I've very likely got new kind of virus, which exploits MS Office flaw recently announced. Immediately after, my OE started consuming huge memory when I switched between folders or messages. I've not seen any process in Task Manager taking up to 1 GB memory (physical is 512M). I did not find any newly installed executables either. When I shut down OE, the computer works fine.
Any thoughts?
Thank you

Mikhail
