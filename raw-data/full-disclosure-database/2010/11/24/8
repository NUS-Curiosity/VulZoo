Hello

My friend is a public official and he believes his Android (HTC Dash) 
was bugged/infected by someone through a text message attachment. Has 
anyone seen anything commercially available or available online to do this?

I don't know anything about smartphones but was wondering if anyone has 
Android experience with something like this. Does the Android have 
startup functions like Windows's Startup folder where we can investigate?

The issues are a real bad echo, the phone acting really weird such as 
the battery life going bad and the phone lighting up on the table during 
it being idle.

Thank you
