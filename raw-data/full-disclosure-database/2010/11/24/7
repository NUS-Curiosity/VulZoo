i love dual port gumstix and the old yoggie gatekeeper pro form factor
for this; both are now EOL and long past last fab run.

what is the new best form factor in production?  i'd love a hw crypto
accelerated T3 more than AES-NI or Padlock style mobile kit. does one
yet exist, or perhaps soon to be?
