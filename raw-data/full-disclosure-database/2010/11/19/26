Hi,

It's no Apple fault, but AT&T software QA.

I have did software review for one of applications for other major
Telko and they has used Device ID as login identifier for one of their
POC apps.
So this mistake is common.

Alternative approach for identification and prefiling inputs was
suggested by is usage of iOS property lists.
You can take a read a few here:
http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PropertyLists/QuickStartPlist/QuickStartPlist.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000048i-CH4-SW7

Summary: this mean it's not an Apple fault, but AT&T developer or
contractor who has coded app with auto-filling based on SIM ID.
