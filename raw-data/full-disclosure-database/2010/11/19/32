Well,

If you need reasons to blame Apple - then you can blame them for
accepting App in AppStore.

Apple is already involved in process of testing ALL apps - so you can
request Apple to do more security testing for submitted apps (if you
believe in AppStore distribution way).

Now it's OK?

This posting was never sponsored by Apple. As well it is not powered
by Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant since 2001
