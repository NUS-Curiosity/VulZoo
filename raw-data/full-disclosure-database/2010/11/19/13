I must admit I may not know all the story of Andrew/weev or whoever he is.

It does however seem that some of the claims made by Andrew is correct.

A few of the ranters here could try using google perhaps? Or read on links already provided..?

He is indeed mentioned online and he has indeed made important contribution regarding the Apple fiasco with the iPad.

In any case, if "weev" is a troll etc etc he seem not to be the only one here.
