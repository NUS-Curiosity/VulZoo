Subject: cve-2010-4091 exploited ?

Hi to all,
Seems that with a crafted PDF, a bit different from xpl.pdf, the code flow
may be hijacked somewhere.  As reported it's only an attempt to understand a
bit more about this issue.So mistakes are very likely. If you are interested
try to check:

Feedback are welcome.
