 Assistant United States Attorney in regards to the Goatse Security
 iPad case.

Notice how weev fails to mention his drug charges, like always, and if 
he does he claims it's some kind of FBI setup like the FBI put LSD in 
his house plus crack cocaine but he was high as a kite at Toorcon on LSD 
claiming Firefox bugs for media attention.

Did you know most oxycotin addicts smoke crack cocaine when they cannot 
get their pills?
