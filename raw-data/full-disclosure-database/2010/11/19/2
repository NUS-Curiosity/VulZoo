Although I very much agree with what you've said, Andrew has said previously that the charges have been dropped, or atleast, they have been 'forgotten about'.

Platitudes, lies, half truths, and bullsh*t aside Andrew, let's get down
to brass tacks.  By the time you get out of jail, there's not even going
to _BE_ IPv4 anymore.  What, with the multiple state level drug charges,
and the federal computer fraud charges, you've gotta be looking at at
least 20 years.  Mods, time to killfile this loser, I don't think he's
got any friends left here.
