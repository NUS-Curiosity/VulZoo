In details about such vulnerabilities, about sending of spam via web sites
and creating of spam-botnets it's possible to read in my article Sending
spam via sites and creating spam-botnets

Insufficient Anti-automation (WASC-21):

http://site/contact/

There is no protection at contact page from automated requests (captcha).

Insufficient Anti-automation vulnerability it's possible to send spam from
the site in automated manner on a large scale.
