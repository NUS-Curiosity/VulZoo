Subject: Eclipse IDE | Help Server Local Cross Site
	Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

=========================================================
 Eclipse IDE | Help Server Local Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
=========================================================


1. OVERVIEW

The Help Content web application of Eclipse IDE was vulnerable to
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability.


2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Eclipse is a multi-language software development environment
comprising an integrated development environment (IDE) and an
extensible plug-in system. It is written mostly in Java and can be
used to develop applications in Java and, by means of various
plug-ins, other programming languages including Ada, C, C++, COBOL,
Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala,
and Scheme. The IDE is often called Eclipse ADT for Ada, Eclipse CDT
for C/C++, Eclipse JDT for Java, and Eclipse PDT for PHP.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Eclipse Help Contents are served as a web application via the built-in
Jetty Web Server plugin. Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities were
found in  /help/index.jsp and /help/advanced/content.jsp URLs. XSS on
/help/advanced/content.jsp url makes the browser hang
but even after clicking "Stop Executing" button, users can still get XSS.


4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

Eclipse IDE Version: 3.6.1 <=

Tested Editions(SDK, Java, J2EE)


5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

http://localhost:[REPLACE]/help/index.jsp?'onload='alert(0)
http://localhost:[REPLACE]/help/advanced/content.jsp?'onload='alert(0)


6. IMPACT

In a situation where users' browser security settings are weak, the
localized XSS vector could enable attackers to perform a number of
black acts including cross site content access, smb shares
enumeration, remote code execution, malicious trojan downloading and
execution ...etc.


7. SOLUTION

Apply the recent error-free nightly builds (ie.
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/N20101110-2000/index.php)
.
According to the developer, "Chris Goldthorpe", the fix is in the
nightly build, http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/N20101108-2000/index.php
, it will also be in 3.6.2 (February 2011) and 3.7 (June 2011).
