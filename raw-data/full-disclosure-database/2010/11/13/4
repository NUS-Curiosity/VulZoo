I just gave a test-run for Hydra against my own site and noticed:

It does support only single proxy, any site that has even a bit protection
will defeat it. NiX does support HTTP/SOCKS4/SOCKS5 (as much as you have
working proxies) with randomization etc. This is significant advantage
over any other tool.

I have worked 1.5 months constantly on NiX, after i have had a little
break. I will implement support for other major protocols which is now
really easy after having otherwise working engine.
