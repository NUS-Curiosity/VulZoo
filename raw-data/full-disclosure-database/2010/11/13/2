Then, you should have started by that, it is that simple.
We are all busy and you can't expect anyone to even have a look on your
tool or link if you don't highlight how different it is from others or
why you did it.

As far as I am concerned, these features may be nice, but I don't need
them and will stick to Medusa for the brute force tests I run from time
to time (ie not often, a few times a year at most).
But, to make it clear, it is just my personal opinion, I am not saying
that your tool is not interesting or useless.
