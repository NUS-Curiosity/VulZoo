I am of course aware of proxychains as i use it myself. But lets get back
to one feature: Auto-removal of dead or unreliable proxy and when site
protection mechanism blocks the proxy

That is not possible using proxychains. A less your program depends on
other programs, the better. I am not saying, ten points to THC for coding
it in pure C.

I could not find any kind of FORM support from hydra, i have put a good
amount of time to FORM auto-detection logic as well (very good for less
advanced users).

Some people have asked what advantages NiX offers over other tools, this
question should have been answered now.

Thanks, really difficult and time consuming project but i have verified it
to be stable (45k combolist and over 1000 proxies).

PS. If any of you downloaded yesterday 1.0.0 version, please download
immediately the latest 1.0.1 version is i forgot to fix something
important (told in CHANGELOG) before i packed the release version.

If you find a bug, just let me know and i try to fix it asap.
