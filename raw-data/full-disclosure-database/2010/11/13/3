If you read the first post i did regarding NiX:
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Nov/115

It is listing the features. I can understand everyone is busy as i am as
well. If you take a look at similar windows tools, none of those have an
SSL support and pretty much them all are unreliable, that´s why i wanted
to come up with more powerful solution.

I am not saysing Hydras´s etc. are bad tools, I usually can make custom
features regardless of a tool made.
