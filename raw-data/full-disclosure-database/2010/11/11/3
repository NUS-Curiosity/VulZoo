Subject: Building wireless IDS system (article) | Sagan
	with Prelude


	Hello All, 

	I've released a new article I've been working on for a bit.  Its
title is,  "Building wireless IDS systems using open source".   The idea
of this article is to use open source solutions (Snort, Kismet, Sagan, hostapd)
to build wireless IDS systems that report back to a unified/single console
for threat analysis.   It has a bit of a different 'twist' from previous
wireless IDS articles.   Let me know what you think about it.   

It can be found at:

	I've also released a new version of Sagan (0.1.7) that supports 
the Prelude frame work.  I'm pretty excited about Sagan's Prelude output
format.   This gives Sagan IDMEF output and can log to a Prelude back end for
viewing with Prelude's "Prewikka".    Of course,  all the standard Sagan
to Snort logging (MySQL/PostgreSQL) are still there :)

For more information on Sagan,  please check out:
