Subject: Understanding Man-In-The-Middle Attacks

Hi everyone, a few instructors here at InfoSec Institute have put together a
short presentation and video tutorial on how to perform a Man-In-The-Middle
(MitM) attack. You can view the presentation that diagrams out how a MitM
attack works:

You can also view a how-to video tutorial that you can follow along with if
you have a few virtual machines to play with on your local network:

In a pen test, it is important to learn how to do these attacks to intercept
server to server communication, server to client communication, etc. 

 

Coming soon we will demonstrate how to perform a MitM attack against SSL
encrypted sessions. 

 

Happy hacking!
