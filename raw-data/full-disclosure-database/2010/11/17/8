Subject: Fun statistics on who is naughty and nice.

For a talk he gave @ Cambridge on Tuesday, the VP Product Management for
ThreatSTOP (my company), Francis Turner, did some interesting analysis
on the sources of badness, and the drop-boxes and call-homes, by
country.

 

He's posted the results in our blog.
