-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's QuickTime Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the application's support for huffman
tables within a flashpix file. By specifying an index larger than a
particular value, a pointer will cease to get initialized. Later the
application will use this pointer to as the destination in a copy
operation. Successful exploitation will lead to code execution under the
context of the application.
