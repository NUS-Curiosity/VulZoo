-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within the QuickTimeMPEG.qtx module. When handling an
ELST atom's edit list table data large values are not handled properly.
Specifically, the media rate field is explicitly trusted and can be
abused to control memory copy operations. By specifying a large enough
value, an attacker can utilize this to write to an arbitrary address in
process memory. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the user.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple states:
Fixed in Mac OS X 10.6.5: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4435
