Subject: CarolinaCon-VII/2011 - Call for Papers/Presenters

InfoSec professionals, h4x0rs, international spies, script kidz, and 
posers,

CarolinaCon is now accepting speaker/paper/demo submissions for its 7th 
annual hacking/InfoSec conference.  This year's event will be held on the 
final weekend of April 2011.  The venue is Holiday Inn (Crabtree) in 
Raleigh, NC.  Raleigh is about 30 minutes from Durham, Chapel Hill, and 
Research Triangle Park.


Who develops and delivers CarolinaCon?

CarolinaCon is proudly brought to you by "The CarolinaCon Group".  The
CarolinaCon Group is a non-profit organization registered in the state
of NC, dedicated to educating the local and global communities about
technology, information/network/computer security, and information
rights. The CarolinaCon Group is also closely associated with various
"2600" chapters across NC, SC, TN, VA, LA, DC, and NY.  Many of the
volunteers who help develop and deliver CarolinaCon come from those
chapters.


What events will be at CarolinaCon?

CarolinaCon is mainly about the educational talks, presentations, and 
demos.  Alongside those we will have several other technology-related 
contests and challenges.  Details on other events will be announced on our 
website as they are planned out.


Who will be presenting which topics this year?

That's where YOU possibly come in.  If you are somewhat knowledgeable
in some interesting field of technology, hacking, science, etc., and are
interested in speaking/presenting at CarolinaCon, we invite you to submit
your proposal (in brief) for our review.  If you're interested in 
presenting please send;

- your name or handle
- presentation name/title
- brief topic abstract
- estimated time-length of presentation

....via e-mail to:
speakers <at> carolinacon.org

*NOTE: All submissions are due BY March 1st, 2011.  We may be making some 
early selections this year from amongst the submissions, so please be 
timely in submission if you're committed to being part of the elite cadre 
of chosen presenters.  We value diversity, so please don't hesitate to 
propose your ideas no matter how outlandish.

If you speak at the Con, you will receive;

- free Con admission for you and one guest
- one free CarolinaCon-7 t-shirt
- minimal fame, glory, and possibly even notoriety
- mad props and much love from our staff and attendees


SPONSORS:
We don't accept any, so don't bother asking.  Capitalism and hilanthropic 
knowledge-sharing don't mix in our opinion.  We keep our admission price 
to the bare minimum to cover our venue and equipment expenses.  All of our 
staff are volunteers who generously donate their time and energy.  All of 
our presenters likewise generously donate their time and talent.  The only 
items sold at CarolinaCon are a limited quantity of single-design 
CarolinaCon t-shirts....and we only make and sell those because attendees 
and staff want them.


ATTENDEES:
If you are interested in attending, watch this space for more details:

...and don't forget to mark the dates on your calendar.  We look forward
to seeing you at our 2011 chill event.


Peace,
Vic
