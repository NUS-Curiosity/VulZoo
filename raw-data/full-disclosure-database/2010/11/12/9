Well that's not really a useful response. He asked a simple question (the
first one that popped into my head as well).

Basically it comes down to this: THC's Hydra already does all that stuff,
and they've been doing it for years and years. How does your tool fit in
with it? It sounds like you basically coded the exact same thing, and
while frustrating - happens.

Medusa:
Medusa is a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer for
network services created by the geeks at Foofus.net. It currently has
modules for the following services: CVS, FTP, HTTP, IMAP, MS-SQL, MySQL,
NCP (NetWare), PcAnywhere, POP3, PostgreSQL, rexec, rlogin, rsh, SMB, SMTP
(VRFY), SNMP, SSHv2, SVN, Telnet, VmAuthd, VNC, and a generic wrapper
module.

THC-Hydra:
Currently this tool supports:
  TELNET, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP-PROXY, SMB, SMBNT, MS-SQL, MYSQL, REXEC,
  RSH, RLOGIN, CVS, SNMP, SMTP-AUTH, SOCKS5, VNC, POP3, IMAP, NNTP, PCNFS,
  ICQ, SAP/R3, LDAP2, LDAP3, Postgres, Teamspeak, Cisco auth, Cisco enable,
  AFP, LDAP2, Cisco AAA (incorporated in telnet module).

Comparison between the two (keep in mind hydra is currently at 5.8 and
medusa is at v2):
http://www.foofus.net/~jmk/medusa/medusa-compare.html

These can crack any authentication protocol that I can really think of,
and they're stable. People are probably not going to stop using what they
know how to use, especially if it works and fills up the space the tool is
required for nicely (as both of these currently do).

Again, please read the features listed at my site. It offers the features
no other tool provides. Where is for example FORM auto-detection for those
other tools? Where is SOCKS4 proxy support? Where is proxy randomization?
Where is logic to drop dead proxies? Where is logic for fake-detection?

If offers more than reasonable features over any other tool. I do not
force none to use my tool if you have fallen in love with those other
tools and you are simply too blind to see advantages using NiX.

I can obviously see none actually does bother reading anything properly
and keep asking me the same questions.

>> Why would we use this tool over say Hydra or Medusa?

I have just compiled Hydra first time (donÂ´t know about Medusa, please
link me). Obviously you did not read nor understood features it offers
over any other similar tool.

Please read again features listed at my site and you get the answer to
your question.
