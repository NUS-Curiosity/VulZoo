--[ Synopsis:

Hackito Ergo Sum conference will be held from April 7th to the 9th of  
2011
in Paris, France.

Following last edition's success, HES2011 will be a bigger event with  
even more
talks, focusing on hardcore computer & network security, insecurity,
vulnerability analysis, reverse engineering, research and hacking,  
and will try
to keep the high quality content. Our dear Program Committee is there to
ensure this.

HES will this year be a fully international-oriented conference, 100% in
English, aiming to gather the best security researchers, experts and  
decision
makers in one room.


--[ Introduction:

The goal of this conference is to promote security research, broaden  
public
awareness and create an open forum so that communication between the
researchers, the security industry, the experts and the public can  
happen.

Last year, we pioneered a domain with the first Capture The Flag  
(CTF) contest
on FPGA, with excellent result that exceeded by far our expectations.  
This
year, new contests will run with hopefully even more diverse and new  
approaches
to security. Of course, network-based CTF and lockpicking contest  
will still
happen.

We will have a specific session for new works, including slots for new
presenters -i.e. typically people whose personal research are extremely
interesting but who do not usually present at conferences- because
security innovations occur at the fringe of the security industry,  
very often by
passionate people, and that's what we are and love. Submissions from  
students,
academics or otherwise passionate people from anywhere on the  
internet are
therefore most welcome.

We will also have an anonymous side track so that people who wish to  
present sensitive
subjects can do so in total freedom. As we believe the academic  
system as setup a good
precedent with anonymous submissions, review and voting, we wish to  
pursue this direction
by providing researcher a way to share important contribution without  
being concerned
with politics and other non-research influences.

This conference will try to take into account all voices in order to  
reach a
balanced position regarding research and security, inviting businesses,
governmental actors, researchers, professionals and the general  
public to share
concerns, approaches and interests for this topic.

During three days research conferences, solutions presentations,  
panels and
debates will aim to view and determine the future of IT security.


--[ Content of the Research Track:

We are expecting submissions in English only.
The format will be 45 mins presentation + 10 mins Q&A.

Please note that talks whose content will be judged too commercial or  
biased
toward a given vendor will be rejected.

For the research track, preference will be given to offensive,  
innovative and
highly technical proposals covering (but not restricted to) the  
topics below:

  [*] Attacking Software
     * Automating vulnerability discovery
     * The business of the 0-day market
     * Non-x86 exploitation
     * New classes of software vulnerabilities and new methods to detect
       software bugs (source or binary based)
     * Static and Dynamic binary or source-based analysis
     * Current exploitation on Gnu/Linux WITH GRsecurity/SElinux/ 
OpenWall/SSP
       and other current protection methods
     * Kernel land exploits (new architectures or remote only)
     * New advances in Attack frameworks and automation
     * Secure Development Life Cycle and real-life development  
experiences

  [*] Attacking Infrastructures
     * Botnets and C&C abuses
     * Exotic Network Attacks
     * Telecom (from VoIP to SS7 to GSM & 3G/4G RF hacks)
     * Financial and Banking institutions
     * SCADA and the industrial world, applied.
     * Governmental firewall and their limits (Australia, French's  
HADOPI,
       China, Iran, Denmark, Germany, ...)
     * Law enforcement : how to / how to deceive / how to abuse.
     * Satellites, Military, Intelligence data collection backbones
       ("I hacked Echelon and I would like to share")
     * Non-IP (SNA, ISO, make us dream...)
     * M2M
     * Wormable vulnerabilities against protocols & infrastructures

  [*] Attacking Hardware
     * Hardware reverse engineering (and exploitation + backdooring)
     * Femto-cell hacking (3G, LTE, ...)
     * BIOS and otherwise low-level exploitation vectors
     * Real-world SMM usage! We know it's vulnerable, now let's do  
something
     * WiFi drivers and System on Chip (SoC) overflow, exploitation and
       backdooring.
     * Gnu Radio hacking applied to new domains

  [*] Attacking Crypto
     * Practical crypto attacks from the hacker's perspective
       (RCE, algo modeling, bruteforce, FPGA ...)
     * Algorithm strength modeling and evaluation metrics
     * Hashing functions pre-image attacks
     * Crypto where you wouldn't think there is

We highly encourage any other presentation topic that we may not even  
imagine.

Thumbs up to the /tmp/lab hackerspace for their support and the final  
HES
party which was a tremendous success.

We would also like to greet all the speakers of last year's edition  
for the
quality of their presentation and the great time we shared in Paris :  
you are
all most welcome back in Paris for the 2011 edition.

Likewise, we'd like to thank last year's sponsors for their  
unconditional
