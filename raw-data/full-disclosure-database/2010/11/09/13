ZDI-10-247: Novell Groupwise GWPOA HTTP Request Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-247

November 9, 2010

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Novell

-- Affected Products:
Novell Groupwise

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 10328.

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Groupwise. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in a function responsible for assembling an
HTTP response. The following modules implement this functionality:
gwpoa.exe, gwmta.exe, gwia.exe. When responding to an HTTP request sent
to TCP port 7101 or 7100 or in the case of gwia.exe the user configured
"Message Transfer Port", the process uses the client-specified "Host: "
header to create an HTTP 301 redirection message. Within this code a
local stack buffer is used to store the redirect location and can be
overflown with a sufficiently long header value. A remote attacker can
exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context
of the SYSTEM user.


-- Vendor Response:
Novell states:
Linux - http://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=04oMMaiI9nI~
NetWare/Windows -
http://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=aq06Eoy7rf4~

The HTTP interfaces for the GroupWise agents (Message Transfer Agent,
Post Office Agent, Internet Agent, WebAccess Agent, Monitor Agent) are
vulnerable to an exploit that could allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell Groupwise.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
Affected versions:
GroupWise 8.0x, 8.01x, 8.02. Previous versions of GroupWise are likely
also vulnerable but are no longer supported. Customers on earlier
versions of GroupWise should, at a minimum, upgrade their GroupWise
systems to version 8.02HP (or disable the GroupWise Agents' HTTP
interfaces) in order to secure their system.
This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Anonymous working with
