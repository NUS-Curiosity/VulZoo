Subject: Re: [0dayz] Acrobat Reader Memory Corruption
	Remote Arbitrary Code Execution

Adobe is aware of a potential issue in Adobe Reader posted publicly 
today on the Full Disclosure list. A proof-of-concept file 
demonstrating a Denial of Service was published. Arbitrary code 
execution has not been demonstrated, but may be possible. We are 
currently investigating this issue. In the meantime, users of Adobe 
Reader 9.2 or later and 8.1.7 or later can utilize the JavaScript 
Blacklist Framework to prevent the issue by following the 
instructions below. Note that Adobe Acrobat is not affected by this 
issue.


Adobe Reader 9.2 and later and Adobe Reader 8.1.7 and later – 
Windows

On Windows, the JavaScript Blacklist can be in two locations. 
Please review the following options and then create the registry 
key of your choice:

Enterprise list: This blacklist helps enterprises roll out policies 
that block exploitable API(s) from executing in their environment. 
Populating the blacklist in this location is the responsibility of 
the enterprise. Adobe patches never modify this registry location.
To create the registry key:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Adobe\ 
\\FeatureLockDown\cJavaScriptPerms\tBlackList

Adobe’s update/patch list: The Adobe blacklist is modified by Adobe 
Reader patches whenever an API is deemed vulnerable. APIs are also 
removed from the blacklist whenever a fix for a vulnerability is 
provided by the current patch.
To create the registry key:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Adobe\ \\JavaScriptPerms\tBlackList

      On a 64 bit Windows system, the path is:
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Adobe

->To prevent this particular issue, add the following value to the 
registry key created in the previous step (case sensitive):
Doc.printSeps

->Exit and restart the application

Adobe Reader 9.2 and later and Adobe Reader 8.1.7 and later – 
Macintosh

   6. Expand Preferences
   7. Create a backup of the FeatureLockDown file.
   8. Right-click on FeatureLockDown.
   9. Open With TextEdit.
  10. Just before the last >> add the following line to the 
FeatureLockDown file (case sensitive):
      /JavaScriptPerms [ /c << /BlackList [ /t (Doc.printSeps) ] >> 
]
  11. Save the file
  12. Restart Adobe Reader

Adobe Reader 9.2 and later – UNIX

   1. Go to the Global Prefs file at:
