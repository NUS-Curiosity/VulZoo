It's been a month now ... Any word from the vendor (HumanWare) yet as
to what the official remedy will be, and/or how this sorry flaw came
to be shipped in a released product (build error ... design misfeature
... worse) ?

I see no bulletin or alert of any kind on the HumanWare website, nor
does a search for the word "security" produce any meaningful hits
there.

I'd like to advise a colleague who works for an organisation
supporting vision-impaired people.

Cheers
Tweedle
