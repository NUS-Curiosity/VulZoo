Subject: New version of ddosim - DDOS simulator

Dear All,

I am pleased to present the new version of *ddosim* (v0.2) - the application
layer DDOS simulator.

Description
========
DDOSIM simulates several zombie hosts (having random IP addresses) which
create full TCP connections to the target server. After completing the
connection, DDOSIM starts the conversation with the listening application
(e.g. HTTP server). Can be used only in a laboratory environment to test the
capacity of the target server to handle application specific DDOS attacks.

Features
======
   - HTTP DDoS with valid requests
   - HTTP DDoS with invalid requests (similar to a DC++ attack)
   - SMTP DDoS
   - TCP connection flood on random port

Download
=======
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddosim/

Documentation
===========

Enjoy!
