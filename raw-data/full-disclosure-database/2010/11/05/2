There hasn't been any kind of contact to the community announcement list, or to their official news channel.

On the other hand, they're already making murmuring noises about their upcoming KeySoft (software) minor point release to various blindness conferences/exhibitions; I'll be sure to find out exactly how this issue is resolved in that update, and whether or not there's any actual announcement of the fact.

I am dabbling with the competition, which gives me a bit more flexibility.  Hopefully, I won't have the same news about that.  I regret it though, because the hardware is somewhat behind.

Cheers,
Sabahattin
