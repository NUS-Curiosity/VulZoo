Subject: fusermount: Unmount any filesystem

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello List,

To evaluate the pros and cons of various disclosure methods, I'm trying
full disclosure this time:

At least on ubuntu lucid, the fusermount tool contains a timerace
mounting a user filesystem and updating mtab, thus mtab entries with
arbitrary path can be created. Crafted mtab entries can then be used to
unmount live parts of the filesystem.
