 Assistant United States Attorney in regards to the Goatse
 SecurityiPad case.

All,
I think I can shed some light on this point of interest. If it pleases
the esteemed readers of full disclosure.

Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business
relationship with you. This is a letter of expressing interest only. I
got your contact from the International web site directory. I prayed
over it and selected your name among other names due to it's esteeming
nature and the recommendations given to me as a reputable and trust
worthy person I can do business with and by the recommendations I must
not hesitate to confide in you for this simple and sincere business.

I am Ummar AlMaymunah; the only Daughter of late Mr and Mrs George
Abdul. My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant in Abidjan,the
economic capital of Ivory Coast before he was poisoned to death by his
business associates on one of their outing to discus on a business
deal. When my mother died on the 21st October 1984, my father took me
and my younger brother HASSAN special because we are motherless.
Before the death of my father on 30th June 2002 in a private hospital
here in Abidjan. He secretly called me on his bedside and told me that
he has a sum of $12.500.000 (Twelve Million, five hundred thousand
dollars) left in a suspense account in a local Bank here in Abidjan,
that he used my name as his first Daughter for the next of kin in
deposit of the fund.

We have in good faith taken upon ourselves to trust our respect to
Andrew Auernheimer who was, after claiming a substantial amount of
these funds for himself as his fee, to return the remainder of my
father's estate to me in the US in US dollars or bank account.
Auernheimer has claimed these funds and seemingly escaped to the world
with our fortune and any assistance in bringing this delinquent to
justice is appreciated.

Best Wishes and Regards,
Ummar AlMaymunah
