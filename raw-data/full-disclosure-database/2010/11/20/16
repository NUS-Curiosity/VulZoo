Subject: Re: SSH scans, i caught one

Ok so, I've setup debian MIPS with qemu to make it 'work' with the 
intention to sniff what it does.

Can't get it to work.

debian-mips:~/SSHard# sh ssh
ssh: ssh: cannot execute binary file
debian-mips:~/SSHard# file ssh
ssh: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), 
statically linked, stripped
debian-mips:~/SSHard# uname -a
Linux debian-mips 2.6.18-6-qemu #1 Fri Dec 12 23:23:12 GMT 2008 mips 
GNU/Linux
debian-mips:~/SSHard# cd /bin
debian-mips:/bin# file ls
ls: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), 
dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.8, with unknown 
capability 0x41000000 = 0xf676e75, stripped
debian-mips:/bin#

Normally this should work, right? Or am I missing something?

Grtz,
Marco van Berkum
