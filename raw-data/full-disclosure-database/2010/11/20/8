Nice one. I assumed the syslgd was for overwriting syslogd to hide its 
tracks but it doesn't look like that indeed. Like many people already
thought, this is starting to look like a mips-router-hacking-irc-botnet.
Leaves me with two questions. Why MIPS? And whats the purpose. I think 
DDOS, but who knows...
