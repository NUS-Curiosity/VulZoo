Subject: [HITB-Announce] HITB2011AMS -- Call For Papers
	now Open

The Call for Papers for the second annual HITBSecConf in Europe is now
open! Taking place from the 17th - 20th of May at the NH Grand
Krasnapolsky in Amsterdam, HITB2011AMS will be a quad-track conference
line up featuring keynote speaker Joe Sullivan (Chief Security Officer
of Facebook) and a special keynote panel discussion on 'The Economics of
Vulnerabilities'!

HITB2011AMS will also feature a brand new Capture The Flag - World
Domination competition run by the HITB.nl CTF Crew, an expanded
Hackerspaces Village (with participation from .NL and .EU based
hackerspaces) a Lock Picking Village run by members from TOOOL.nl and of
course the HITBSIGINT sessions - 15 minute talks held during the coffee
and lunch breaks with a focus on highlighting up and coming research and
researchers.

As always, talks that are more technical or that discuss new and never
before seen attack methods are of more interest than a subject that has
been covered several times before.

Submissions are due _no later than 18th February 2011_
