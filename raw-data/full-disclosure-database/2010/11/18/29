-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within the ienipp.ocx component. When handling the
exposed method a GetDriverSettings call is made into
nipplib!IppGetDriverSettings2 where the process will blindly copy user
supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker
can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the
context of the browser.
