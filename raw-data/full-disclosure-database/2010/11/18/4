Subject: Re: Open Letter to Lee Vartan,
 Assistant United States Attorney in regards to the Goatse Security
 iPad case.

In 2006 we began operations aganist Denise Paolucci, the self-appointed
Queen of the child pornographic fiction scene. Denise Paolucci had started
out small, as a producer of child pornographic fanfiction centered around
Harry Potter characters. Using her position as head of the abuse team at
Livejournal, she had appointed many producers of child pornographic fiction
as abuse volunteers. We started out by reporting clear content abuse
involving child sex to the Livejournal abuse team, but Denise's team would
bury it every time. We reported it to law enforcement repeatedly. Though
there have been multiple obscenity convictions obtained on the basis of
child pornographic literature, most law enforcement and federal prosecutors
do not want the challenge of handling a case with complex technical, speech
and cross-jurisdictional issues.

Inspired by a sermon I heard at a Mormon stake conference, I decided the
best solution was to whip up a group of highly moral mothers into a frenzy
and give them the contact information for most major ad networks. The idea
was that if blog hosters do not comply with takedown requests solely on the
basis of the presence of child pornography we would hit them where they
would be assured to respond: their advertisers.

A forceful insistence from management finally lead to Livejournal's change
in policy prohibiting the posting of child pornographic fiction and art.
Months later Denise was forced to resign. If you want to verify this chain
of events, check with ex-Six Apart employee and current SAY Media
stakeholder Mike Baehr-- a charming Jewish man who I connected with at the
company as he was one of the rare ones who really cared about the welfare of
children. I fed him the details of what I was doing step-by-step so he could
inform management and perhaps limit the financial damage Denise Paolucci's
negligence was causing them.

Denise Paolucci eventually runs off to form Dreamwidth, which, by our
estimates is the largest aggregation of child pornographic fiction content
and links to child pornographic fiction in the world.

Now we get to recent history, where I have externally verifiable evidence.
 As soon as I was elected the new leader of the GNAA in January, my only
major executive directive was to restart the war on child pornographic
fiction. I immediately had people make spreadsheets cataloguing child
pornographic fiction they found upon Denise Paolucci's service. Here's one I
personally made, and you should be able to verify the date of last editing
in the top right corner, 302 days ago in January:

We began to apply the same techniques to Denise Paolucci's new service,
Dreamwidth, cutting off their revenue stream from their credit card
processors:
http://dw-news.dreamwidth.org/16590.html
http://dw-news.dreamwidth.org/16338.html
http://dw-news.dreamwidth.org/17858.html

As well as developing a set of dossiers on their development and support
volunteers:
https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AUouGn11ZRNXZGhuNWoyd18xMmZnaHFta2Nu&hl=en
and letting their employers, families and academic departments know exactly
what kind of things they're into.

Unfortunately, after this we got so busy doing innovative research into
Apple products that we forgot to keep this up. I think the GNAA will be back
to teaching these perverts a lesson any day now.

Beyond this, I can't tell you the number of chink and russki botnet CNCs
we've popped over the years. As soon as the federales give back our
illegally stolen machines, I'll give you all the evidence you want of it.
 We have years and years of good public service under our belts. Do you?
