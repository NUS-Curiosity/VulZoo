Interesting... So you and Andrew are the same person!!
And I am not telling my life here, so I don't expect anyone to care
about who I am. You are just doing the opposite, so please don't compare
or insult me.
I am just a subscriber interested in security, not in someone's life or
law cases.

I hope it sounds reasonable and understandable to you.
