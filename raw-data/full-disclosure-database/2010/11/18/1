Weev,

I can quote people too!
Andrew, this one is for you:
It is always better to have no ideas than false ones; to believe
nothing, than to believe what is wrong. --Thomas Jefferson
And this one is for the members of the press unfortunate enough to be in
this thread:
The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who
reads nothing but newspapers. --Thomas Jefferson

I always was a Jefferson fan.

Cheers,


Andrew D Kirch
