Speaking for only myself, I could care less about your personal / political
views. The reality is you are inconsequential to security because you are a
script kiddie. I had read articles about your various high profile
'trolling' incidents before, but until your asinine post here had never
bothered to research you. What I've read was nothing but humorous. At one
point you claim to hate bloggers, yet in a pre Web 2.0 world, you and your
Encyclopedia Dramatica generation script kiddies would have no notoriety at
all. Nobody would care about your bizarre high profile cries for attention,
and personally, I certainly don't.

You are a troll and a script kiddie. Your whiney rants have no place on a
mailing list for the security community. I'm sure the kids that support you
on various forums eat your crap up, but you will find little sympathy here.
You claim constantly to hunt pedophiles, thats great. Somehow I'm sure most
people in prison have done good in their lives as well as bad. Hopefully, if
my tax dollars do their job, you will have plenty of time in the near future
to contemplate all of this in jail.

Grow up kiddo. Personally I resent how you and your ilk cheapen this
profession, and applaud law enforcement for doing their job.

Troy,

As with many of my critics, you insist on attempting to libel me and defame
my character (clearly having an objection to my political views) instead of
honestly debating the merits of my actions and the reality of my many
well-received research contributions. I take ad hominem attacks like yours
in stride with the civility and grace befitting of a Christian man, and urge
you to think more critically before you say more things that
will embarrass you in front of your peers.

"You see no evidence of"

Your implication that because you have not seen evidence of something it has
not happened is fallacious. Regardless, I will enlighten you with some
history of our anti-pedophile activity (with links to backdated posts
pedophile posts detailing our successes against their infrastructure and
payment systems, emails with full headers and evidence of ongoing pedophile
activity), some of which predates the iPad incident by years.  You haven't
seen any evidence of it because we, unlike many people, do not wear every
bit of public service we do on our sleeve. We live in the spirit of Matthew
6:6.
