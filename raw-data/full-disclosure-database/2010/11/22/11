Subject: Agnitio Security Code Review Tool v1.0.0 released

Hi,

I've released a tool called Agnitio which I hope will help people
carryout security focused code reviews and find vulnerabilities in the
source code they are reviewing. The tool is basically a checklist with
some process enforcement, audit trail creation and reporting built in.

You can download Agnitio v1.0.0 here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/agnitiotool/files/

Let me know what you think of it!

Dave
