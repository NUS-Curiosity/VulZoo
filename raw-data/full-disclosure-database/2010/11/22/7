Hi Mahesh, I generally try to find the one which offers the most HTML-evasions.  There's a few people who require say, 10 evasions, but those are often individuals who settle for less in life.  When speaking with our vendors we always require, at a minimum, at least 11 evasions to be available.  If a vendor were to offer, say 20 evasions, well they would most certainly have our business because 20 is clearly more than 11 or 10 respectively.

Hi,
 
I have a query regarding HTML evasions. 
 
While buying any NIPS/NIDS product, what kind of HTML-evasions we should look from product? 
 

Mahesh.
