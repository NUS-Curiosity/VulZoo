Have to agree there, criticising a guy beacause he can't write English
very well is never a good idea, I'm french Canadian, but happen to speak
and write English just fine. It doesn't remove the fact that looking
for Virus help on FD just isn't a good idea, even less if you use a
business EMail!

Download AVG, Search and Destroy, the M$oft cleaner and run them all ..
if that doesn't work, then unplug the tower and go to the nearest decent
computer shop!
