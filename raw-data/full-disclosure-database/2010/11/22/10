Subject: virus in email RTF message MS OE almost disabled

Hello,
Opening looking OK email message in my MS OE I've very likely got new kind of virus, which exploits MS Office flaw recently announced. Immediately after, my OE started consuming huge memory when I switched between folders or messages. I've not seen any process in Task Manager taking up to 1 GB memory (physical is 512M). I did not find any newly installed executables either. When I shut down OE, the computer works fine.
Any thoughts?
Thank you

Mikhail
