Ok, got some off-list comments on my sh ssh action, which obviously will 
never work. I just tried some stuff and pasted the wrong 'paste'
Ofcourse I did try the normal actions, like just run ./ssh and they 
failed too (with exactly the same error btw).

I now know its because I have set up a Debian Most Significant Byte 
system and not a Least Significant Byte system.

Which btw I now have set up, so I'll try again with a LSB.

So if anyone could help me instead of correcting my FAIL pastes, that 
would be nice. Thx :)

Grtz,
Marco van Berkum
