Subject: cve-2010-4091 exploited via womens-puzzle.com ?

Hi there,
Sorry for annoying all you with this issue. But I believe that is a very
strange (and a bit funny) issue. For example... did cve-2010-4091 really
exploited with a PDF hosted on womens-puzzle.com ?

If you are interested check:

Feedback are welcome
