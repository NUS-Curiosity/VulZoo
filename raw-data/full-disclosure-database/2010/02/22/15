I'm not a lawyer, and I assume Benji isn't either, but it's worth noting
that Title 18 Section 1030, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986,
pretty much limits crimes to those intent on committing fraud or
disclosing national secrets.  Exposing personal information doesn't seem
to fit under any of the statutory definitions of crime unless you use
that information to commit identity theft.  The word "intent" figures
prominently in that statute, so I'd surmise full-disclosure actually
argues against this access being a crime.
