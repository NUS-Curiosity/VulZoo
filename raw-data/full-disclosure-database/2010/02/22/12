Subject: Re: ACM.ORG data leak still there 4 days after
	announcing to CEO John White

I have a question..

I get the idea you've extracted the whole database, or as much as you can,
and you have approached the company? Im confused as to why you'd attract the
attention to yourself when you've broken quite a few laws. Sure, you can say
you havent given them any information, but your twitter photo is a photo of
you (I'm assuming), it doesnt give the feeling that your personal
information would be very hard to obtain or that you're particuarly bothered
about hiding your identity/any personal info ?

Why are you so sure, that after posting a screenshot of their members
addresses etc, that they wont turn on you and just go "dear sir, here's a
lawsuit, your move" ?
