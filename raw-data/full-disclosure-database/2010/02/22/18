That's a gray area. Intent does matter:

"naked" - not wearing any clothes.
"nekkid" - naked and up to something.

Do you want to bet 3-5 in the pen that the DA won't be able to convince a jury
you didn't have intent? 

That's why it's always recommended you have a written "Get out of jail free"
card when doing a pen test - that significantly raises the bar to proving you
were up to no good.
