Subject: Re: ACM.ORG data leak still there 4 days after
 announcing to CEO John White

After raising pressure a little bit (also by writing to this list) ACM 
has finally reacted and asked where the problem is.

I told them the details so I guess they will finally be able to fix it.

My opinion is still that I did never try to conceal anything, I gave 
them my real contact information and even sent the mail from the same ip 
I accessed their site etc., so this should not be illegal.

But of course Benji is right in some way because you can always sue 
anybody for anything  - the question is just who will win the trial.

In this case I really don't think it would be worth trying to sue me...

But I think its an important discussion & I look forward to more feedback.
