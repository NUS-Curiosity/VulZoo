Subject: ACM.ORG data leak still there 4 days after
 announcing to CEO John White

4 days since I informed ACM's CEO John White of the severe data leak on 
acm.org - but the leak has not been fixed

26 hour after contacting ACM and 2 hours after a reminder to the CEO I 
got an email from ACM member services:

"Thank you for pointing out the security issues you located on acm.org. 
We are in the process of updating these security issues."

But that was 3 days ago and nothing has changed - they did not even ask 
me where the leak is!

as stated before full postal and email address data can be extracted 
from a database & also overwritten

I'm going to write CEO Mr. White again and attach a sample of 2500 
extracted addresses & send it to some CC's

Its weird, I mean this company is not selling flowers, ACM states on its 
website that " ACM is an educational and scientific society uniting the 
world's computing educators, researchers and professionals to inspire 
dialogue, share resources and address the field's challenges. ACM 
strengthens the profession's collective voice through strong leadership, 
promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical 
excellence. ACM supports the professional growth of its members by 
providing opportunities for life-long learning, career development, and 
professional networking."

so where is technical excellence here???
