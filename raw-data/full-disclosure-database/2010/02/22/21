 announcing to CEO John White

Were you contracted by them to conduct a penetration test?  If not, legal or no, it is an ethical violation.  I'm not a lawyer, but I have asked questions of lawyers and law enforcement pertaining to similar situations and the answer is that it is considered trespassing/breaking and entering and unethical unless there is a binding contract which you are fulfilling for a client.

Thanks!
