Hello,

  as I stated previously, the intent is critical in determining
criminality based on the statue.  Each sentence that includes
"unauthorized access" also include "with intent."  For instance:

"knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer
without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of
such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value"

If you do accidentally mistype a URL it clearly is not a violation of
the statue.  If you utilize SQL injection to retrieve financial
information in order to support a carding ring you clearly violate the
statue.  If you expose a vulnerability in order to report it to the
responsible parties and to raise awareness, well, that falls into a gray
area where "intent" is probably the crux of the decision.  You can read
the statute online in many places
(http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1030.html), it's worth checking out.

One more time for emphasis - I'm not a lawyer ;)
