Subject: Re: SMS Banking

First,
'Thor', get me sponsored and I will be more than happy to debate you at
Defcon. Being in Au, it costs a little more for me to get there than a
simple interstate flight. 

I am happy to be an egoist. I am not an altruist, I invest, I do not
sacrifice. So no insult.

"Your "risk formula" is ridiculous." Why? How is IT different to all other
aspects of life and the world. Why is it sacrosanct and unable to be
modelled? As for real experience, I have been doing this over several
decades. I may be teaching at CSU (csu.edu.au - gratuitous plug), but that
is a side line, not what I do. 

" Since you are (self-described) as "currently the only GIAC GSE
(Compliance) holder globally "
Check the page - http://www.giac.org/

" What number would your formula have yielded 2 weeks before SQL Slammer was
released?"
The same as at any time before the incident. SQL was a time degrading
function similar to the SMS example. The end result is a reliability value
[R(t)-> 0] that approaches 0 and is prone to catastrophic failure. The rate
of failure being related to the no. of access paths, no. of systems and the
number of users.   

"Where is the variable for unpatched systems?"  
This is a function of both local and remotely accessible services. Some of
these are dependant. This calculation has to account for each of these
services on the host as well as a vulnerability model for each service. I am
publishing a paper on this later in the year.  

"What number do we plug in for malicious employee factorization?"
A prior data from similar industries, areas etc.

Now, the real issue is that you (thor) seem to have this idea that
multiplying risk is a function of multiplying one made up number by another
made up number. The 'expert' who cannot be wrong. 

The example spanning this is simple, a single SMS based function with open
access. This example was a trivial example in modelling. Firewalls and other
choke points make calculations simpler, multiple paths offer complexity.
What I see from this is that a lack of understanding = a dangerous level of
ignorance. 

Like it or not, security is an economic function, pure and simple. There is
a cost for all actions and at the end of the day, somebody has to pay.
Perfect security is not a goal, optimal security is. They are not the same
thing and the later requires better modelling. 

Welcome to the future, there will be math.

Subject: RE: SMS Banking

I'm looping in the FD list because often my replies don't make it to
Pen-Test, and this has hit a nerve with me.

I've looked over your post at:

http://gse-compliance.blogspot.com/2010/02/modelling-risk.html .

Once I was able to get past the overwhelming egoism and self-substantiating
claims of your contributions to the industry, I arrived at the conclusion
that the only portion of the aforementioned page that is not complete drivel
and even laughable to anyone who has actually worked towards ascertaining
actual risk in production environments, is where you describe your own words
as "ravings."  Ravings, of course, means "delirious, irrational speech."  

I'm fine with you sitting back and gloating about the Security Hero award
you got from Northcutt, but when I see that you are actually contributing to
ANY level of Critical Infrastructure Protection, it makes me fear for anyone
who might be counting on your presumed skillset to actually make intelligent
decisions about risk where human safety is at stake.  Your "risk formula" is
ridiculous.  What number would your formula have yielded 2 weeks before SQL
Slammer was released?  Where is the variable for unpatched systems?  What
number do we plug in for malicious employee factorization?   More
importantly, where is the calculation for self absorbed snake-oil selling
academics with no real experience using their calculator to come up with
magic numbers that represent the risk of a nuclear power plant being hacked?

Since you are (self-described) as "currently the only GIAC GSE (Compliance)
holder globally and the most highly accredited Global Information Security
Professional" and thus (presumably, if only in your mind) the greatest
security mind in the world, how about accepting a challenge to an open
debate on the subject at Defcon?  People like you are dangerous and need to
be exposed before someone in a position of power actually believes that you
know what you are talking about.  Bring your abacus.
