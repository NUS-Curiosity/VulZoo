I have a simple answer to this. Forget the debate, rhetoric is not a
scientific method of determining truth.

"Thor" wants a challenge, let's have one - a real one and not one based on
verbalisations, abuse and unfounded assertions.

I suggest two components;
1	A selection of software products are tested using both processes,
that is I use a model for the risk of these products, and "Thor" can make up
whatever guesses he wishes. We model (or "Thor" guesses, pulls from a
hat...) the vulnerabilities over a time period. The number of bugs in
software as well as the risk are to be presented as a monthly estimate. 

2	We model a few systems (say 50). We can use Honeypots (real systems
set to log all activity without interference) run by an independent party to
each of us. I use probabilistic models to calculate the risk. "Thor" does
whatever he wants.

Each of the predictions is published by all parties. The one who is most
accurate wins. Fairly simple?

I will even give a handicap to "Thor", I will offer to predict within a 95%
confidence interval and that for me to win, at least 90 of the 100 software
products and 45 of the 50 systems have to lie within my predicted range that
I calculate and release. "Thor" has to simply guess better than I do no
matter how far out he is.

I will put up $10,000 Au for my side. Let's see if "Thor" has something real
to offer.
