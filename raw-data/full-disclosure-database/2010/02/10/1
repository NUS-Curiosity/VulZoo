> ==============================
>
> When performing a security assessment it’s important to have a plan of
> attack. All machines do not have the same level of criticality. For
> example, a missing patch on a Windows workstation will not be
> perceived as being as serious a flaw as a missing patch on a Windows
> domain controller. For a Windows assessment, one routine that I found
> useful was to target the following hosts in the following order:
>
> - Windows domain controllers
> - Windows servers
> - Windows workstations
>
> Locating Windows domain controllers can be a bit of a hassle
> sometimes, especially if you have no knowledge of the network you are
> assessing. If that is the case for you, the following may provide some
> help.

> DCLookup – Provides a list of domain controllers that are available to

> Usage:
>
> DCLookup.exe <hostname | ip address>
>
> DCLookup.exe 127.0.0.1
> DCLookup.exe MyMachine

> Example output:

> C:\>DCLookup.exe 127.0.0.1

> What to do next:
>
> Once you have a list of domain controllers, the next step would be to
> start running various checks against them to assess their security
> stature. The following is a short assessment flow for a domain
> controller using WinScanX:
>
> 1. Using WinScanX, attempt to retrieve the account lockout threshold
> using the Get Account Policy Information feature against a domain
> controller.
>
> 2. If the account lockout threshold is not set or if it is 5 attempts
> or higher, attempt to retrieve the user information using the Get User
> Information or Get User Information via RA Bypass feature of WinScanX
> and run a quick password check using the Guess Windows Passwords
> feature.
>
> ***NOTE***
> Make sure to only use the Guess Windows Passwords feature on one
> domain controller ONLY. Using this feature on multiple domain
> controllers in the same domain may cause accounts to lock out.
