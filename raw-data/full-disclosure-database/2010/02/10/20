Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IronPort
Encryption Appliance

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100210-ironport

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 February 10 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IronPort Encryption Appliance devices contain two
vulnerabilities that allow remote, unauthenticated access to any file
on the device and one vulnerability that allows remote,
unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code with elevated
privileges. There are workarounds available to mitigate these
vulnerabilities.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100210-ironport.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following Cisco IronPort Encryption Appliance versions are
affected by these vulnerabilities:

  ��� Cisco IronPort Encryption Appliance 6.5 versions prior to 6.5.2
  ��� Cisco IronPort Encryption Appliance 6.2 versions prior to 6.2.9.1
  ��� Cisco IronPort PostX MAP versions prior to 6.2.9.1

The version of software that is running on a Cisco IronPort
Encryption Appliance is located on the "About" page of the Cisco
IronPort Encryption Appliance administration interface.

Note: Customers should contact IronPort support to determine which
software fixes are applicable for their environment. Please consult
the Obtaining Fixed Software section of this advisory for more
information.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco IronPort C, M, and S-Series appliances are not affected by
these vulnerabilities. No other Cisco products are currently known to
be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Note: IronPort tracks bugs using an internal system that is not
available to customers. The IronPort bug tracking identifiers are
provided for reference only.

The Cisco IronPort Encryption Appliance contains two information
disclosure vulnerabilities that allow remote, unauthenticated access
to arbitrary files on vulnerable devices via the embedded HTTPS
server. The first vulnerability affecting the Cisco IronPort
Encryption Appliance administration interface is documented in
IronPort bug 65921 and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2010-0143. The second vulnerability
affecting the WebSafe servlet is documented in IronPort bug 65922 and
has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
identifier CVE-2010-0144.

The Cisco IronPort Encryption Appliance contains a remote code
execution vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to
run arbitrary code with elevated privileges on vulnerable devices via
the embedded HTTPS server. The vulnerability is documented in
IronPort bug 65923 and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2010-0145.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote,
unauthenticated attacker to access arbitrary files or execute
arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

Workarounds
===========

It is possible to mitigate the administration interface file access
vulnerability (IronPort Bug 65921) by using the IP address
restriction feature of the administration interface to limit access
to trusted hosts. Access to the administration interface is not
restricted by default. To configure access limits, an administrator
should navigate to "Configuration -> Web Services -> Admin -> Console
Security" area in the Cisco IronPort Encryption Appliance
administration interface.

It is possible to workaround the remote code execution vulnerability
(IronPort Bug 65923) by disabling HTTP Invoker in the Cisco IronPort
Encryption Appliance configuration files. To disable the HTTP
Invoker, an administrator must delete several files in the PostX
application home directory and remove a directive from the web server
configuration. The following files must be deleted:

    jboss/server/postx/deploy/http-invoker.sar

    jboss/server/postx/deploy/jms/jbossmq-httpil.sar

The following directive must be removed from the
"jboss/server/postx/conf/jboss-service.xml web" server configuration
file.

    <mbean code="org.jboss.varia.deployment.BeanShellSubDeployer"
          name="jboss.scripts:service=BSHDeployer">
     </mbean>

After deleting the files and removing the directive from the
configuration file, the PostX application service must be restarted.

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:
