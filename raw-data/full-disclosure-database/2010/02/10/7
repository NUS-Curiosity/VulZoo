"Exactly.  So, before the incident, you would have come up with Some Number
and said, "this is your risk."  After the incident your number would
(hopefully) change to Some Number + Some Other Number, and you could say
"Oops.  Didn't think of that.  Sorry."

Are you trying to be clueless? [R(t)-> 0] means that the system was
inherently unreliable. That is no change before or after. I recommended a
probability distribution that links to a financial model. 

" Fine.  Let's do it this way then.  We'll have someone implement an SMS

pay, are you saying that you are willing to assume responsibility for
financial losses when your numbers come out wrong?"

Yes simply I will. In case you have not as yet had a clue, I stated
reliability limits towards 0. That means the SMS solution is inherently
insecure. 

"So which is it?  Is quantifying the probability of compromise "fairly
simple using a formula" or is it "not an economic function pure and
simple?""
Both.

" Since *someone* has to pay, are you saying that you are willing to assume
responsibility for financial losses when your numbers come out wrong?"
I am working on a hedging instrument at present, and yes, where I am paid to
model systems I will negotiate for losses. 

So where are all the lives being lost through a banking app?

"Surely as the most highly certified security professional in the world you
don't need me, a mere working stiff, to find you a sponsor."
If you want me there, yes. I work by the hour, I am not going to waste time
paying for this "opportunity". How about you come to an IEEE conference?

Surely as the most highly certified security professional in the world you
don't need me, a mere working stiff, to find you a sponsor.  As the greatest
mind on the face of the globe, I'll leave that one for you to figure out.

No, we sacrifice for you.  Or will, that is, if you or your formulas have
anything to do with real human safety.

Because it fails to take into account simple reality.  Risk is assessed as
the result of human interaction, not calculated by some formula.
Information security is about people as much as it is about technology.
Your math fails here, and it fails grievously.  Have you ever been in love
and acted out of that?  If so, then prove it mathematically.  Show me the
variables that take into account human actions and reactions.

Exactly.  So, before the incident, you would have come up with Some Number
and said, "this is your risk."  After the incident your number would
(hopefully) change to Some Number + Some Other Number, and you could say
"Oops.  Didn't think of that.  Sorry."

So you just take historical data that may or may not have anything to do
with anything, and apply it to your formula just because it is what has
happened before?  Your source is from only reported incidents or discovered
incidents?  Does it take into account anything of value?  Are you saying
that with all of your education, and your globally superior intellect, the
only value-add you bring is to tell us what has already happened in the
past?  Seems a bit obvious if you asked me irrespective of the fact that
it's basically worthless in the absence of an assessment.

Sure I can be wrong.  I'm wrong all the time - it gives me an opportunity to
learn.  And I'm not the one who claims to be an "expert" Craig.  Let the
readers of this thread look at my site and then yours to make that
comparison.  The actual proof in one's capacity to learn is simple.  No one
who has actually done this in a meaningful way would ever think that they
can quantify risk with a formula when they haven't even bothered to qualify
it.  A child can read volumes of books on how to ride a bicycle and immerse
themselves in the physics behind balance and force, and the way the cilia of
the inner ear works to communicate movement to the brain.  But they will
NEVER learn how to ride until they get on and start pedaling.   Let me know
when you stop peddling and start to pedal.

I could not agree with you more, sir.  A lack of understanding does indeed
equal a dangerous level of ignorance.  Which is why I so look forward to an
open debate on this subject where I can hopefully intervene on the adoption
of your formulas when human life is at stake.  Your formulas can't even be
reliably assigned to the SMS model; to apply them to your CIP contributions
will certainly be dangerously ignorant.

Fine.  Let's do it this way then.  We'll have someone implement an SMS
solution for banking that we don't have anything to do with.  I'll assess
risk my way, you assess risk with your calculator.  Since *someone* has to
pay, are you saying that you are willing to assume responsibility for
financial losses when your numbers come out wrong?

And you actually making my argument for me;  YOU are the one who stated this
to my question, and I quote:

T: "And just how do you come up with the probability of compromising the SMS
function and the user authentication method?"
C: "Actually, fairly simply using Bayes' formula."

So which is it?  Is quantifying the probability of compromise "fairly simple
using a formula" or is it "not an economic function pure and simple?"
