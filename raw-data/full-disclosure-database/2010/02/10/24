Subject: Re: SMS Banking

I don't know who all those other guys were, and since everything on FD gets replicated, I'll just keep it here.  SANS has dropped out, so it's just you and me, kid.

The "initially proposed tasks" were what YOU said, not me.  You calculating the propensity for some package to have a software vulnerability over time is NOT calculating risk.  Again - this is YOUR words, not mine:

"Where a system uses an SMS response with a separate system (such as a web page), the probability that the banking user is compromised and a fraud is committed, P(Compromise), can be calculated as: P(Compromise) = P(C.SMS) x P(C.PIN)
Where: P(C.SMS) is the probability of compromising the SMS function and P(C.PIN) is the compromise of the user authentication method"

You say you can model the probability of compromise with a formula.  I say you can't.  Period, end of story.  I said let's debate it.  You said you won't unless I pay you.  Then you bet me $10,000 while trying to say you can model software vulnerabilities and then said you can put up a system that I can't hack in 6 months after upping the bet to $100,000.  

It's all there in black and white.  In writing.  

Are we all here to understand that it takes the greatest mind in the world and the most highly certified computer professional on the face of the globe to understand that a system becomes less secure over time when left alone and that the more people that use it the less secure it becomes?  Really?  That is your contribution?

You won't wiggle out of this one, sir.  You've bet $100,000 that you can put up a system that can't be hacked.  You've staked your reputation on the fact that you can use a calculator to determine the probability of a system being compromised. Please note that *I* don't even have to hack it.  In fact, I plan on being on a beach somewhere after offering $10,000 for someone to hack it for me.  There are about 1 billion people in China would could use $10,000.  But that's another story. 

I further predict that this is about the time that you'll say "oh, no, I didn't say that" and that I somehow agreed to your silly "choose 50 or 100 packages and I'll model code vulnerabilities instead."  Once everyone here replies back saying "dude, you are changing your tune" you'll whimp out, and rescind the bet, and crawl back into your academic womb. 

If not, produce the contract stating that you will pay me $100,000 if your system gets hacked "any way I choose" and that you can calculate risk of compromise with a formula.
