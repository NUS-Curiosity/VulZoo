ZDI-10-020: EMC HomeBase SSL Service Arbitrary File Upload Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-020
February 23, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-0620

-- Affected Vendors:
EMC

-- Affected Products:
EMC HomeBase Server

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files on
vulnerable installations of EMC HomeBase Server. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the HomeBase SSL Service due to a
failure to sanitize '../' directory traversal modifiers from a
parameter. This will allow a user to specify any filename to upload
arbitrary contents into. Successful exploitation can result in code
execution under the context of the service.

-- Vendor Response:
EMC states:
EMC has released a Security Alert (ESA) identifier to customers through
Powerlink.
