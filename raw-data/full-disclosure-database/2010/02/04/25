Are you serious? People have been using rainbow tables for years mate.. and they are rather widely used.. no need to replace useful with anything, the statement was plain wrong..

FINE. Replace "useful" with "widely popular".

just because YOU never found a use for them doesn't mean noone else has :)

Uh, in the sense that they are finally becoming actually useful...

as far as know rainbow tables has been around for years...

Actually dictionary attacks seem to work quite well, especially for common users which typically use dictionary and/or well known passwords (such as the infamous "password").
Another idea which seems to be cropping in, is the use of hash tables with a list of known passwords rather then dictionary approach.
Personally, the hash table one is quite successful, consider that it targets password groups rather than a load of wild guesses.

Cheers.

Given enough hardware and a specified md5 hash, one could at least
hypothetically find an input text that generated that hash.  However, that
may or may not be as useful as one thinks, as you wouldn't have control over
what the text actually *was*.  It would suck if you were trying to crack
a password, and got the one that was only 14 binary bytes long rather than
the one that was 45 printable characters long. ;)

Having said that, it would take one heck of a botnet to brute-force an MD5 has
in 1 or 2 days. Given 1 billion keys/second, a true brute force of MD5 would
take on the order of 10**22 years.  If all 140 million zombied computers on the
internet were trying 1 billion keys per second, that drops it down to 10**16
years or so - or about 10,000 times the universe has been around already.

I suspect they're actually doing a dictionary attack, which has a good chance
of succeeding in a day or two.
