> First of all, "security" is a myth. One can presume they're "secure"
(or secluded) from danger sitting behind a firewall, but to do so is
just foolish.

Something is better than nothing ;).

> People in power love to say "if you have nothing to hide then nothing to
worry about" when it comes to tracking, keeping data, searching data etc
etc 1984 et al...but this is wrong. I'm not doing anything wrong in my
eyes, but that may mean topperling the over bearing government that
wants us all chipped, so my privacy is worth a lot. Once it's too late,
it will be very difficult to get privacy back.

Yet worse than being chipped is that somebody is looking forward to harm
you. Even if they don't know you and even if also you don't know them. Never
forget about that.
