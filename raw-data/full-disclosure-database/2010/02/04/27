What’s with everyone calling out “son” all of a sudden?  As a southern bred boy, I’m used to it, but have found most other people find it very condescending and disrespectful.  And Mr. Seltzer of all people should not be referred to as “son” in any case.

Wow, that’s a searing indictment if I’ve ever heard one, I think.

win7x64 Direct General

破机器花一天时间才好不容易装好win7x64，结果还是通用通杀，我对我自己都无言了。 Spend a day breaking the machine a good time to finally install win7x64, the result was universal pass to kill, I myself have had silently.
microsoft不花千万年薪挖我，简直都对不起我的这程序的通用性了。 microsoft does not pay to spend millions of years digging me, I'm sorry I really have the versatility of this procedure.
