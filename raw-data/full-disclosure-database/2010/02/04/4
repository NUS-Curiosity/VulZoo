Subject: Re: NSOADV-2010-002: Google Wave Design Bugs

In any case i wonder how much google is going to respect corporate, industry
secret or all that stuff you don't want them to know with google wave. Best
thing to do is not to use that. I really doubt that it is an improvement and
i think i will hardly ever need it. Is just more fanboi food. (knowing gmail
how i know it and left for public stuff only how i left it)
