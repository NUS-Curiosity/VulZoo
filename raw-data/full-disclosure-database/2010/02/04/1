Dear Google Apps admin,​

In order to continue to improve our products and deliver more  
sophisticated features and performance, we are harnessing some of the  
latest improvements in web browser technology.  This includes faster  
JavaScript processing and new standards like HTML5.  As a result, over  
the course of 2010, we will be phasing out support for Microsoft  
Internet Explorer 6.0 ​as well as other older browsers that are not  
supported by their own manufacturers.

We plan to begin phasing out support of these older browsers on the  
Google Docs suite and the Google Sites editor on March 1, 2010.  After  
that point, certain functionality within these applications may have  
higher latency and may not work correctly in these older browsers.  
Later in 2010, we will start to phase out support for these browsers  
for Google Mail and Google Calendar.

Google Apps will continue to support Internet Explorer 7.0 and above,  
Firefox 3.0 and above, Google Chrome 4.0 and above, and Safari 3.0 and  
above.

Starting this week, users on these older browsers will see a message  
in Google Docs and the Google Sites editor explaining this change and  
asking them to upgrade their browser.  We will also alert you again  
closer to March 1 to remind you of this change.

In 2009, the Google Apps team delivered more than 100 improvements to  
enhance your product experience.  We are aiming to beat that in 2010  
and continue to deliver the best and most innovative collaboration  
products for businesses.

Thank you for your continued support!

Sincerely,

The Google Apps team
