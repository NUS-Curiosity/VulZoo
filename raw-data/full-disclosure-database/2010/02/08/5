Subject: The true power of cache

Hello participants of Full-Disclosure!

As I wrote in January in my article The true power of cache
(http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2010-02/msg00024.html),
the cache of search engines can be useful tool in skilful hands. There are
many possibilities of using of cache for hackers.

Possibilities of cache of search engines:

1. Search for vulnerabilities of the site in cache.
2. Search for vulnerabilities of the site in snippet.
3. There are no records in the site's logs.
4. Bypassing of restrictions on access to the site.
5. Existence of vulnerabilities in cache.
6. It's always possible to retrieve information from the site.
7. Finding out of the last time, when the site was working.
8. Finding out of the time, when the site was hacked.
9. Malware spreading.
