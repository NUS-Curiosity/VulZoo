Ok, now we have the evidence: The research was a fake security research arranged for a marketing campaign.

They was able cheat most journalists, bloggers and security magazines.

I don't remember in all my life a so irresponsible and dirty marketing trick in the security world, abusing of hackers reputations.

Read below, they leaked the IP of the anonymous author of http://infosecurityguard.com and it's confirmed that it come from SecurStar GmbH office:

Debunking Infosecurityguard identity<http://www.lastknight.com/2010/01/31/debunking-infosecurityguard-com-identity/> from Matteo Flora .

It's hilarious and unbelievable that a security company had done something like this.

Hi all,

i don't know how many of you have read about the analysis done on http://infosecurityguard.com .

I have made a detailed analysis of their initiative and the result is that:

- it's most probably a camouflage marketing initiative and not a independent security research
- they consider a security context where local device has been compromised (no software can be secured in that case)
- they do not consider cryptographic security arguments

Below my analysis on this (read it carefully):

Maybe it's interesting, maybe not, but for sure some facts are very relevant!
