Andrew Wallace didn't write a word of the quoted text, which has a
byline of Marc Ambinder.  Particularly sad given that Andrew was flaming
just last week about Gadi presenting a talk at BlackHat - even if Gadi
wasn't the lead researcher, he at least wrote his own presentation.  I
have to conclude that either Andrew didn't actually add any of his own
text when he posted it to wherever you found it (shame on you Andrew if
that's the truth), or his added text was so un-quoteworthy that you left
his text out and only quoted Marc's text.  But in either case, the
credit should be given to Marc.
