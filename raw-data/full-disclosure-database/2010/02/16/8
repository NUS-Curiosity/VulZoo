Andrew Wallace didn't write a word of the quoted text, which has a byline of
Marc Ambinder.  Particularly sad given that Andrew was flaming just last week
about Gadi presenting a talk at BlackHat - even if Gadi wasn't the lead
researcher, he at least wrote his own presentation.  I have to conclude that
either Andrew didn't actually add any of his own text when he posted it to
wherever you found it (shame on you Andrew if that's the truth), or his added
text was so un-quoteworthy that you left his text out and only quoted Marc's
text.  But in either case, the credit should be given to Marc.
