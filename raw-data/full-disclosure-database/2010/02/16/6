Greetings,

Over here in I've been having the feeling again that I'm being followed.

I never act when I'm being followed. It's like being touched in the
wrong place if you're a kid. You're just traumatised. But it's been
happening to me so long I'm not scared.

I've posted here before ranting about harassing surveillance and
entrapment attempts. Cept mine are fo realz. Seriously. All my friends
have turned on me. I got this ancient dude with glasses who'd stalk me
for 2+ years. Then after I moved back in with mom it'd get worse. It's
like a nightmare of clandestine government trolling psyops on me.

netdev is some paranoid schizophrenic who chatters his teeth and talks
to himself. Someone send that idiot an NSL and leave me alone. =[

Why do I have to suffer because of things that are out of my control?
This is not fair.

Quoting Andrew Wallace:

U.S. To Be Hit By Massive Cyber Attack On Feb. 16

    On February 16, at about 10:00 am ET, the U.S. will be hit by a
massive, crippling cyber attack from an unknown entity. Key players will
convene in the White House situation room and plan the response, from
mitigation to (possibly) retaliation. It'll be live on television --
G.N.N.

    Of course, my knowledge of this attack will not add me to the radar
screens of the FBI -- they know about it too. The reason I felt
compelled to write a pseudo-serious lead to this post is because, for
the first time, a cyber attack is going to be war- gamed, in public, for
all the country to see. The war-game is not being put on by the
Department of Homeland Security or the Obama
administration: it is being run independently and will include former
officials who are not part of the federal government. It will be quite
realistic, featuring senior intelligence and national security
officials, including former directors of intelligence agencies and
combatant commands and homeland security advisers. A production company
has been hired to re-create a White House Sit Room in the Mandarin
Oriental Hotel, and professional scriptwriters have been working with
experts to create a real-life scenario.
