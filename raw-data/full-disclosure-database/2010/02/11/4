Subject: Two papers on Oracle 11g Security

Hey all,
Since there seems to be a fair bit of disinformation, and utter nonsense, 
floating around since my talk at the Black Hat Federal security conference 
the other day, I have decided to publish the following papers.

http://www.databasesecurity.com/HackingAurora.pdf
http://www.databasesecurity.com/ExploitingPLSQLinOracle11g.pdf

Whilst the papers were written on the 14th and 21st of October respectively, 
Oracle were informed on these issues discussed in these papers on the 11th 
and 13th of October 2009.

The slides from the talk can be found here:

Cheers,
David Litchfield
