Wow
This has been one of the most delightful little sparring session. With no
head or tails though. If by pure number crunching, we, humans were capable
of ascertaining actual risk, our world would not be in a moshpit right now.

I think people at the Wall Street were also number crunching risk analyst.
Look at them now. I wouldn't place my bets on measuring It risk either.

Thanks and Regards
