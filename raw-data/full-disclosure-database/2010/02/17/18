Subject: Cross-Site Scriting on Portwise SSL VPN v4.6

PR09-04: Cross-Site Scriting on Portwise SSL VPN v4.6

Vulnerability found: 25th March 2009

Vendor informed: 28th April 2009

Vulnerability fixed:

Severity: Medium

Description:

The Portwise portal login page is vulnerable to XSS. Portwise is a
SSL-VPN portal.


Note: Other version might be affected as well


The following demonstrate XSS:

1) Login page XSS

https://example.com/wa/auth?&authmech=Assess&reloadFrame=%22;%3Cscript%3Eblah%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E



Consequences:

An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code
in the browser of a user who clicks on a link to a Portwise Portal-based
site. Such

code would run within the security context of the target domain. This
type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the target
site, or the

redirection of confidential information (i.e.: session IDs) to
unauthorised third parties.



Fix:

Ensure all input parameters (especially "reloadFrame") are filtered
sufficiently before beign echoed back to the client.
