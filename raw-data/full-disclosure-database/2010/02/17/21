 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2010:040
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : gnome-screensaver
 Date    : February 17, 2010
 Affected: 2010.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in
 gnome-screensaver:
 
 gnome-screensaver 2.28.0 does not resume adherence to its activation
 settings after an inhibiting application becomes unavailable on the
 session bus, which allows physically proximate attackers to access
 an unattended workstation on which screen locking had been intended
 (CVE-2009-4641).
 
 gnome-screensaver before 2.28.2 allows physically proximate attackers
 to bypass screen locking and access an unattended workstation by moving
 the mouse position to an external monitor and then disconnecting that
 monitor (CVE-2010-0414).
 
 This update provides gnome-screensaver 2.28.3, which is not vulnerable
 to these issues.
