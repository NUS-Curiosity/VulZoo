Subject: Nmap5 cheatsheet

Hi everyone,

Here i attached a quick reference (also known as cheatsheet) for NMAP,
incorporating in addition to common parameters, some commands which
are specific of the last branch released. I've also incorporated on
the lower section some examples with typical scans which can be
performed with this tool.

It includes a spanish translated version, so this information could
reach the entire spanish-speaking community.
