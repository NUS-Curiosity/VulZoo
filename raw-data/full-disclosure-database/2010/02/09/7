So ... your original note about junctions did not cover "well-known
facts", but my note about other reparse point types did?

Not in my testing, at least not for junctions and symlinks. User with
requisite authority could traverse the junctions and symlinks locally,
but not remotely via a share.

Unless the reparse point already exists.

This particular exploit happened to involve a remote user creating a
symlink. That doesn't mean there are no other imaginable vulnerabilities
stemming from filesystem objects that violate the notional tree
structure of the directory hierarchy.

The obvious one: someone shares a branch of the directory tree in the
belief that clients only have access to that part of the tree, but the
tree already contains a convenience symlink (Unix) or reparse point
(Windows) that points elsewhere in the hierarchy. That's one reason why
Samba has had the "wide links=no" option since, what, the mid-1990s.
