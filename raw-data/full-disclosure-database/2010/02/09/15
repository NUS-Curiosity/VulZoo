-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to force a Microsoft Windows
system to execute a given local executable. User interaction is required
in that the target must access a malicious URL.

The specific flaw exists within the ShellExecute API. Using a specially
formatted URL an attacker can bypass sanitization checks within this
function and force the calling application into running an executable of
their choice. Successful exploitation requires a useful binary to exist
in a predictable location on the remote system.

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
