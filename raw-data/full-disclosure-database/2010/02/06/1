Dear Kingcope,

Correct.

Maybe what you want is for Samba to add and support an option like
"allow create symlink" (with default "no"). I myself do not think it
would be useful... would surely be a few lines of code only, so if you
want to submit a patch to the Samba team... or just patch your own
servers (as I do, see http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/psz/samba/).

Cheers, Paul
