Dear Thierry,

Hmm... looking at
http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#WRITEABLE
http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#READONLY
it seems that writeable is off by default: a Samba installation, as per
default, is not vulnerable.

Is that vendor Samba?
