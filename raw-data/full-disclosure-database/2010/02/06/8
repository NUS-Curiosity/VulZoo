Dear Paul,

seems like u get personal pissed about the situation or you are not
able to see that this is obviously a problem. But maybe you can
enlighten everybody how it is possible per "default" not to
traversal a directory by cd but doing this via symlink? To put the
circle
the other way around, do you have an option per "default" enabled
which forbids to traverse a directory? No?

Regards,
 Marx
