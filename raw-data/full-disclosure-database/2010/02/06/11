Subject: Re: Samba Remote Zero-Day Exploit

I find it puzzling how this discussion, including the official Samba
response

  http://www.samba.org/samba/news/symlink_attack.html

fails to consider whether the mentioned configuration (when admin sets
non-default "writeable = yes" but leaving default "wide links = yes")
allows write access to the whole filesystem (where the user has UNIX
rights). I also wonder about the interaction with the setting of "unix
extensions" (which I had set to non-default "no" to help Mac clients).

Cheers, Paul
