Subject: Re: Google Buzz and blind CSRF attacks

It works for me, thanks Kristian Erik for this found !

I tried to inject an IMG tag with XSRF URL into Google Reader in my
Share, and all my Followers were disconnect from Google SSO each time
they visit my Shared items in GReader. As GReader shared items are also
shared in Google Buzz, the PoC worked, but only for some hours.

It seems that Google doesn't accept <img> tags anymore in GBuzz ?

I wrote a quick article on my blog, thanks to your PoC Kristian ! It's
available here :
