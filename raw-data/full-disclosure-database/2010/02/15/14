I guess if it's friendly (Georgia) governments from whose computers we 
(US) see attacks, _they_ have been hacked.
When it's Chinese computers, it's they are hacking us...

Go figure....

    -h

p.s.: it is (or should be) common knowledge that Chinese zombies were 
aquired in huge numbers in the early 2000s and are now being used to 
launch attacks and host botnets for people most definitely not Chinese!
So it is actually probable that the Georgians have been hacked and are 
used as launchpad. I just wish the same logic would be applied to the 
so-called Chinese cyberattacks much ballyhoed lately...
