Subject: help fuzzing/finding Horn CNF formula


i know i am dumb.

i am looking for a HORN CNF that is SAT if and only if |x != y| ($x \ne y$) for boolean x,y.

using the Horn constraints in [1] (at most k '1's) + the sought inequality/negation, it might be possible to encode Exact Sat (XSAT) to fast Horn CNF (md5 preimage falls in this case)

i am not sure if such CNF formula exists though current academics claim Horn Sat is "P-complete", i.e. powerful enough for the formula.

note that the size of the CNF doesn't matter much (it cares about just 2 variables, the other vars are temp).

i failed fuzzing it :)
