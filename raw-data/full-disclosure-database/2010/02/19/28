Greetings.

I've been holding this one back for a while. It's been eating at my
skin.

I was just an intern at the time, but I'd get the mail, copy the
text, delete his mail, and send the mail to my supervisor, authored
by me.

I still remember the friendships I made at Yahoo. The cute
girlfriends I have and how it changed my life. I remember I was
just some office kid opening up emails in outlook 2000. But I risen
to be so much more. This mysterious person helped me do it.

Eventually, I was promoted up Vice President of Security at Yahoo!
and made nearly six figures a year.

This is what I did. And I told no one. All I know is there is a kid
whose advice I took credit for and he is the key factor for my
success in life.

I live in a $500k condo in Mountain View. Wife, 2 kids, and a Lexus
(2009 Hybrid, Italian leather seats, TV in backseat for the kids).

I just wanted to let you know that the security tips helped. I feel
pretty guilty for flat out taking credit for all his work though. I
just had to get it off my chest.

Thank you so much, if you read this list. You've touched my life.
