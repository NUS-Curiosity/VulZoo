The problem isn't in the algorithm -- it's in the passwords themselves.
Salting helps in that the attacker can't amortize the work effort across the
entire population, but at the end of the day, even PBKDF2 isn't going to do
much against 1234567890 and its ilk.

To put it another way, if EasyJet *did* have a breach, they couldn't very
well say "It's OK, because the passwords were hashed".
