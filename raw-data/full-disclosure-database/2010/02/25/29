Subject: Ubuntu Lucid Lynx is Big brother Ubuntu

wtf is this.

A centralized identity system?

In an open source operating system? By default?

You're going overboard here. You're just a rich trustfunder and
your proles are afraid to say you're making a huge error.

I never asked for my OS to become this big chatroom filled with a
bunch of autistic, idiotic facebook kids. I can't stand that.

Ubuntu one? Chatroom accounts? Online, Invisible? You're turning
the default Ubuntu into your huge autistic chatroom.

Disable this, or name it teenbuntu.

You are integrating this immature stuff into a Long Term Support
version of Ubuntu. Desktop or not, I don't want to be forced into
your schema and big brother "social tray icon". Remove it by
default. Make it available via the software center.

Please fix this, you're making a big mistake. Other than that, I'm
extremely excited for Lucid Lynx.
