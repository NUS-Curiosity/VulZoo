Ah, behold the fascist lulz of censorship by these antitrust
criminals.

Basically, all these big web portals have these PDF guides for law
enforcement of how they give your private docs away.

Cryptome / John Young has been posting these for a while. Now
Young's site is down. Great censorship. Nice freedom.

Isn't this just a beautiful hypocritical world we're living in?
Everytime government spying gets exposed, they squirm to protect
themselves.

These documents can be taken by government going to a judge with
probable causes to get a writ "a search warrant". Also, the FBI can
just go ahead and leave a post-it note warrant on a wall (telecom
style) to get your docs and personal info. And of course, who could
forget, NSL's. Because your rights are a passing bureaucratic
triviality.

Enjoy your censorship. Enjoy your rights violations. I'd give you
the number to the FBI to report this, but they're in on it too.
