Subject: Re: ACM.ORG data leak still there 4 days after
	announcing to CEO John White

Seriously dude this is not a big deal. This site does not have any
information worth protecting. Stop acting like you hacked the fucking
Pentagon and move alone.

 They don't give a shit and nether does anyone else.

Its a professional group who would give you the information you found if you
asked nice enough!
