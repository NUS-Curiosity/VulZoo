Subject: Re: EasyJet is storing user passwords in the clear

If I reread your statement, and take it as "70% of people's passwords suck"
-- I'd have to agree.  I'd say though, for the remaining 30%, algorithm
choice, even without salting, can make a difference.  My password audits go
much quicker when LM is enabled, vs NTLM.  Same for MD5 vs SHA1.
