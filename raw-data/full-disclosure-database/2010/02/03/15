Subject: Creating An IP Input File for WinScanX

For those of you that are using WinScanX Pro, you may find the need to
create an IP input file at some point so you can cover a large range
of hosts very quickly. The following script can help you to do just
that.

http://windowsaudit.com/downloads/CreateIPInputFile.zip

Usage:

- Unzip the contents of CreateIPInputFile.zip to a folder and run the
CreateIPInputFile.vbs script.

- Enter an IP range (i.e. 192.168.1.1-192.168.10.254) and click OK.

- A new file named iprange.txt will appear in the same folder as the
CreateIPInputFile.vbs script.

- In WinScanX Pro click the Browse button to locate the iprange.txt
file, select your scan options and click Start Scan to scan all of the
hosts in the iprange.txt file.

====================

Get WinScanX Pro for just $10 this month (regularly $250)!
