Subject: Re: anybody know good service for cracking md5?

Actually dictionary attacks seem to work quite well, especially for common
users which typically use dictionary and/or well known passwords (such as
the infamous "password").
Another idea which seems to be cropping in, is the use of hash tables with a
list of known passwords rather then dictionary approach.
Personally, the hash table one is quite successful, consider that it targets
password groups rather than a load of wild guesses.

Cheers.
