	We all know the streisand effect, but why is Ron Livingston so desperate to quell on this information..
	
	Because he doesn't want people to understand that he has _Multiple_ male partners.
	
	He does all of this look in his face to make it look like he's the "Pure" (pewer) guy. But we all know the secret truth, he's fighting tooth and nail because he has something to hide.
	
	Ron Livingston needs to learn to stop censoring and just come out of the closet now.
