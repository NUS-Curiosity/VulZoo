Subject: Re: Risk measurements

Let's presume 100k was spent on risk modeling, which actually is way
less then the norm, where was the gain again?
Why exactly does the flaws have to be fixed economically instead of
designing the system correctly in the first place?
And on this same argument, why spend a huge amount of time (money and
resources) *guessing flaws* rather then correct system function?

"why are you spending $250,000 extra to fix the flaw?"
Because the estimate is abviously wrong. You cannot predict the full
outcome which brings the sum from the least possible number up to
infinitum.
For instance, let's imagine a flaw in your favourite OS happens to
allow any hacker backdoor access to it, there's the possibility of it
being covered up neatly, with just paying your developers OR getting a
nice load of media hype and pay dearly with losing your customers.
Personally, I'd rather not do risk modeling at all, or at least, keep
the information within reasonable bounds rather then let it reign my
(hypotethical) company.

Kind regards,
Christian Sciberras.
