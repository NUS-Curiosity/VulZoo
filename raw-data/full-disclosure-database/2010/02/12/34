Another Thing, your emails are arriving very followed to my buzon...
Because?   

 

I dont mean to be rude, but I just dont think this is going to work.   If
the most my translation engine gives me is something about coconuts, a
ladron being put in my house, and emails following your buzon (whatever
that is) I think its time for me to bow out.

Throw a coconut?  Craig, did you throw a coconut at me?  Or did Val throw
a coconut at me?   I feel a Monty Python joke coming on.  

 

Rosa, I dont speak Spanish, so I dont know what that really means.

Saben, en verdad no se mucho de computacion, redes, prgramas y que se yo,
pero por lo poco que he visto
para una persona que le heche "coco" a esto pienso que si puede, despues de
estudiarlo muy bien, meterse
en lo que quiera, deberian de inventar algo o crear un sistema donde el
"ladron" no se pueda meter a tu 
casa.

Perdon que me meta, es que ya les he dicho recibo tanto estos emails, que ya
no se que hacer, sera comentar al respecto,
claro está, no estoy segura de lo que hablan.

Saluditossss
