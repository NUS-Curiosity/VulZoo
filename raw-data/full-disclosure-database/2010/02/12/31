You don't want "the least flaws possible".  We can get very close to zero
flaws per thousand lines of code - but the result ends up costing hundreds
of dollars per line.  You want "the most economical number of flaws" - if
you get it down to 10 flaws, and the next flaw will cost you $750,000 to fix,
but you estimate your loss as $500,000 if you don't fix it and get hacked,
why are you spending $250,000 extra to fix the flaw?

Risk modeling is what tells you the flaw will cost $500K to not fix.
And since you totally screw the pooch if you got it wrong and not fixing
it costs $1M, people like to do a good job of risk modelling.
