Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 02.09.10: Microsoft
 PowerPoint OEPlaceholderAtom Invalid Array Indexing Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.09.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 09, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft PowerPoint is an application used for constructing
presentations, and comes with the Microsoft Office suite. For more
information, see the vendor's site found at the following link.

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/default.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an invalid array indexing vulnerability in
Microsoft Corp.'s PowerPoint could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

This vulnerability occurs when parsing an "OEPlaceholderAtom" record.
This record type is used to create a placeholder for an object
(picture, text, etc.) on a slide. By providing a value greater than the
size of an array, it is possible to corrupt stack memory beyond the
bounds of the array with a fixed value. By overwriting critical
structures like the saved return address, it is possible to execute
arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user opening the file. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious
file. If the targeted user is running PowerPoint 2000, and the "Office
Document Open Confirmation Tool" is not installed, then it is possible
to exploit this vulnerability directly through the browser.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the
following versions of PowerPoint:
