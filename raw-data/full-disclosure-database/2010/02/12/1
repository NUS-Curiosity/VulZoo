Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 02.09.10: Microsoft
 PowerPoint OEPlaceholderAtom Use-After-Free Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.09.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 09, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft PowerPoint is an application used for constructing
presentations, and comes with the Microsoft Office suite. For more
information, see the vendor's site found at the following link.

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/default.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s PowerPoint could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the current user.

This vulnerability occurs when parsing multiple "OEPlaceholderAtom"
records present in a "msofbtClientData" container. This record type is
used to create a placeholder for an object #picture, text, etc.# on a
slide. When a certain series of these records are present, it is
possible to trigger a use-after-free vulnerability, which can lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user opening the file. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a user to open a
malicious file. If the targeted user is running PowerPoint 2000 and the
"Office Document Open Confirmation Tool" is not installed, then it is
possible to exploit this vulnerability directly through the browser.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the
following versions of PowerPoint:

PowerPoint 2002 #XP# SP3 PowerPoint 2003 SP3 PowerPoint 2007 and
PowerPoint 2007 SP1 are not affected.
