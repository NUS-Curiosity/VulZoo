Subject: Remote Vulnerability in AIX RPC.cmsd released by
	iDefense

Hey guys,

Just now I saw that iDefense did not include in their advisory the
triggering code for this
(http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=825). 
I believe it's very important to test your
systems and verify the released patch.

So here we go:
