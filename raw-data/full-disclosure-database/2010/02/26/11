Subject: Re: Ubuntu Lucid Lynx is Big brother Ubuntu

I must admit that this is crap. I don't blame the ubuntu team  for 
wanting to integegrate this kind of tools in the default base packages, 
Since ubuntu is mainly designed for the masses. Nevertheless i will 
remove them ( the ubuntu one client as well ) in my upcoming lucid lynx 
fork ( www.shadowcircle.org )

The simplelogger will remain, though with an improved hacked theme that 
makes it less crapy.
