Well, it is hard to believe that you don't have an agenda concerning this 
stuff.
It would mean you are a bad leader, what I am sure is not the case.
I don't believe that the goal is just satisfying your users. Nothing wrong 
about it, of course, open source is in no way incompatible with buisiness.

So your bet seems to be on cloud computing,
This and the recent move to Google Docs instead of Open Office show that 
clearly.
What's less clear to me if you are planing a buisiness model on it or if you 
are just following the trend Google is pushing for. It's probably both.

Anyway, the result is that Ubuntu is going to be a Chrome OS like, and that's 
really sad.

Decide what's good for the users in their place is a mistake.
Internet ad Computer as we know them will disapear, leaving the place to 
devices without intelligence used by brainless users.
The only right thing to do is to improve usability but not at the cost of 
functionalities, and, the most important, educate users.

Computers are wonderful tools. Let's use them correctly. Many people don't 
want of it again : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel (something we had in 
France in the 80s, no wonder it never spread out).


I hope somehow it will be heard.
