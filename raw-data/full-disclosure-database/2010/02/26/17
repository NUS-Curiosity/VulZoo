Well considering the tone I used, Frankly, I'm surprised you even
dignified that. I don't always speak in such a tone. It's just the
atmosphere of the scene here.

I want my system here to be pure and free. No blogcruft.

Remember how XP and Vista would always come with Windows Messenger?
It's the same philosophical issue.

It integrates social networking too closely, and it makes me wanna
go into FUD mode. I'm scared here.

I'm worried to be stuck with a LTS desktop for 4 years with an
experiment that should be done in the _NEXT_ 6mos, in a non-LTS.


I appreciate it Mr. Shuttleworth. Our Linux communities are one of
the brighter beacons of efficient development out there.

Keep up the steamrolling Ubunteros.
