Care to expand on "locking down" and "2 years old"? This looks like
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513808 which has never been
hidden and is based on the year-old http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7842

(Someone tried to repost it Wednesday as
http://www.exploit.db.com/exploits/11561 but they left out the part that
actually does anything. "Verified: yes" my ass.)

The "exploit" is a long way to go for what is essentially
onclick="document.location='http://Maliciouswebsite';" which is going to
work on all browsers and couldn't be "fixed" without breaking sites.
