John Q. Public: Ubuntu can't guess your account details without you entering
them, so even if you don't remove the "offensive" software from your system
it won't bother you with popups telling you that you've been poked by your
autistic  (your word) Aunt Mildred or your ex girlfriend's mother's third
cousin's daughter (who is also autistic?).

Ubuntu has had Gaim/Pidgin installed by default for years, and latterly
Empathy in it's place. Did you also complain about that integration? What
about an evil email client being installed by default, which also provides a
gateway into your brain for these autistic people?

Mark: aparently intel graphics chipsets weren't supported entirely by the
last two ubuntu releases (as reported to me by a friend who has such a
chip), so there are situations where things can slip through the net that
are signed off as ready but still don't work for all users. In this instance
I believe it is the intel code dump to support 3d acceleration that caused
the issues(?) with absolutely no research into the matter done by me. (yey
for broad generalisations with no grounds) :-p

this is what makes linux distributions with package managers so great. If
you don't like something, just rip it out and either leave it or replace it
with something you prefer. Ubuntu defaults to, for e.g., installing
xchat-gnome when you look through the software centre, but personally I
prefer the original xchat. Do I complain that I'm being forced by the Ubuntu
people to use an "evil" minimalist HIG-compliant xchat? no, instead I fire
up synaptic and install the xchat package instead of the xchat-gnome
package.
