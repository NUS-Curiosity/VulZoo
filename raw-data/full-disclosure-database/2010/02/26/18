Subject: John Young of Cryptome on Infowars with Alex Jones

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Alex Jones is a Hal Turner like intel-asset. He runs this gig out
of Austin, TX called infowars. Kind of a conspiracy-minded,
rightwing news portal.

Think about the waco/ruby ridge typo culture. Stuff that the gov
monitors very closely.

I don't know if he's funded by DoD or FBI. But he's a deep
undercover operative. He has his comment honeypots on his site just
like Hal did.

Regardless, John Young (Of cryptome) is going to be on his show now.

http://www.infowars.com/listen.html

If you're not in the loop, Cryptome.org had their domain locked by
NetworkSolutions over this (now revoked) DMCA.  It was just a law
enforcement guide. Nothing trade-secret like. It's not comfortable
to have it out, however, not damaging in the slightest.

If you miss it, his show reruns every 4 hrs. Like schizophrenic,
government-ran, honeypot numbers station.

Regards.
