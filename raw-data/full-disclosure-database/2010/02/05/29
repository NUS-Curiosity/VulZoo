Subject: Re: Samba Remote Zero-Day Exploit

Dear Dan,

You mean "creatable".

> ... the fact that he can *generate* the symlink breaks ...

Nothing breaks if the admin sets "wide links = no" for that share: the
link is not followed.

> But Samba supports dropping a user into a path ...

I never noticed such support documented: references please?

> ... and it really does need to keep him there.

You cannot "break out" of shares with "wide links = no".

> ... Samba is supposed to match Windows semantics in general.

No please, do not dumb it down.

Cheers, Paul
