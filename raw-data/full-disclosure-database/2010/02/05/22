Arian,

Sorry for the slow reply.  I'm overseas right now and it's tough to
keep up with email.

I think this thread might be about dead, but I will respond to a few
comments:

Far too often security initiatives fail to gain any momentum because
they bite of far more than they can chew.  I'd love to redesign digest
authentication, for instance, or push for good browser support of some
truly safe HTTP authentication protocols, but that would be much more
likely to fail.  I see this as a relatively easy fix to open up a new
option in web app development.

I never said cookies should go away.  I merely want cookies to stop
being used for managing authenticated sessions in most applications.
Some applications may still require that flexibility, however, and for
those they can be more carefully audited.

Well, sure, they do currently rule.  There's no reason HTTP
authentication can't be used to authenticate a cross-origin unified
identity.

I'm fine to agree on disagreeing as well.

Cheers,
