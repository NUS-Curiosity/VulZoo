Subject: [Tool Announcement] NoMore AND 1=1 - a Web
	Application Testing Tool

Dear list,

NoMore AND 1=1 is a tool that helps the Web Application Tester by
containing a large categorized list of useful expressions to inject in
his day to day duties . Those expressions come from guys like Ferruh
Mavituna, Hack.ers, etc (all credited in the sources) and personal
experience.

A standalone and a Webscarab attached version exist and can be found here:
- standalone http://wiki.eslimasec.com/esliwiki/ProjectsPost?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Standalone_NoMore_AND_1%3D1_v04.zip
- webscarab attached:

I hope it will be useful.
