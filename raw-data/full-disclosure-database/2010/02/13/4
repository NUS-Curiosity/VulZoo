Subject: [FD] password recovery for iwork docs

hi, all.


i was wondering if you guys know of any password recovery software (free or otherwise) for recovering password-ed documents created from iWork 09 (Pages, Numbers, Keynote).

been scouring the search engines a mile deep with no luck. posted the same query in Apple's discussion forum, too.

thanks.
