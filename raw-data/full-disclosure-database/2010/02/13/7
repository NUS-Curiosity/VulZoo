Subject: Re: Risk measurements

Exactly,
As Valdis has stated, we want economic optimality. Valdis has stated this in
a far easier to understand manner than I.

I will publish a financial model on the blog this weekend that displays the
relationships graphically.

You don't want "the least flaws possible".  We can get very close to zero
flaws per thousand lines of code - but the result ends up costing hundreds
of dollars per line.  You want "the most economical number of flaws" - if
you get it down to 10 flaws, and the next flaw will cost you $750,000 to
fix,
but you estimate your loss as $500,000 if you don't fix it and get hacked,
why are you spending $250,000 extra to fix the flaw?

Risk modeling is what tells you the flaw will cost $500K to not fix.
And since you totally screw the pooch if you got it wrong and not fixing
it costs $1M, people like to do a good job of risk modelling.
