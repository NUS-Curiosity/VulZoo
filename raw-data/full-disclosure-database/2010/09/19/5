"i doubt this can be remotely implemented in practice because of
dynamic code like |eval| and mobile code."

Because we all shout at and blacklist browsers when a website gets
hacked and starts monitoring users' actions.....

On a more serious note, try a program, like Comodo's Firewall. You can
change the operation mode, from "learn which programs do what", to
"block all programs".

I'm afraid most of this talk is theoretical crap. Then again, during
Godel's age, there weren't computers that could calculate how many
people believe in spaghetti monsters.
In short, there is the social factor, which computers seem to be more
and more dependent on. There are no precise mathematics, in fact, all
notion of
probability is fragmenting so much, that the probability that anything
happens nears to 1.

My two cents,
Chris.
