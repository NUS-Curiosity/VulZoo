What is impossible is reliable and perfect discrimination between "good"
and "bad" programs for any nontrivial definition of "good" and "bad"
(this follows from Rice's theorem).

On the other hand, It is possible to "detect all bad programs" if it is
allowed to err on the safe side and mistake some good programs for bad
programs. An extreme example is to call all programs bad unless their
exact code appears on the list of known good programs.
