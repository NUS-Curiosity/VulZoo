Mr. Szabo has already slapped your wrist for such undeserved arrogance.

And yeah, I find it a joke that you think that ".ppt.exe" isn't pretty
damn obvious.

I might have fell for that when I was 9, but I haven't had a problem
with a windows box in years.

I will admit, at 3AM when I've been working for 18 hours and awake for
36, it is possible that I may double-click
such a malicious file and then immediately think "OH shit" and rebuild.

I know what we can do, we can repackage the "Hey watch out for badguys
masquerading as innocent files"
that everybody already knows about, contact CERT and negotiate a fix
between major vendors (Hey this isn't just a MS vulnerability
right??), then give a talk at blackhat to establish our fame, but now
that I think about it.. that would be rude to the people who have been
complaining about this since 1999.

What? I don't even understand what you are getting at. This has
nothing to do with faith in icons.

My statement was that windows defaults arguably represent a
vulnerability in the GUI
by making "proposal.doc" indistinguishable from "proposal.doc.exe with
a crafted icon",
when you are encouraged to double-click the icons through the GUI, and
when "doc" files
are supposed to be innocent to open. I was also stating the fact that
this vulnerability
should be addressed outside of the scope of the "DLL Hijacking" mess.

Cheers,
Charles
