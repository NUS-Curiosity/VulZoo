Subject: LDAP NULL Bind being picked up,
	making non PCI compliant


We recently ran a scan against our exchange servers and got the error that our server was vulnerable to an LDAP NULL BIND overflow. This vulnerability is now making out network uncomplient to PCI and are having trouble with a way to fix the problem.
 
I know we can't deny or shut up down LDAP as it is needed by RootDSE, but we need to find a fix or way to stop the LDAP from being picked up as vulnerable. The server is runing Windows 2008, and from what I read is that Win 2008 will show the server as vulnerable but, doesn't really pose any kind of threat? Is this true? Any information will help! Thanks!
