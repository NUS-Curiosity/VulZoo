Thats the real threat of this, to be honest.  Yes, you, me, and
(hopefully) the rest of the people on this list know what to look for
before clicking on something.  But, > do you view a .doc, or .ppt, or
.mp3 as malicious and threatening as a .exe, .bat, or .vbs?  Probably
not.


And, you cannot honestly tell me that you've never browsed to a
network share and opened a Word document.  And, if that Word document
opens and there's legitimate data being displayed (ie - it's the
document that you were expecting to open), would you ever consider
that you just compromised your system?


I think that's what a lot of you are missing.. there's no real
trickery involved; No changing of icons, no hiding extensions, no fake
files.. a DLL could be dropped into any directory containing Office
documents and now each one of those Office documents are, essentially,
backdoored.  And, not only that, but this is affecting file formats
which were previously considered benign or harmless (for the most
part).
