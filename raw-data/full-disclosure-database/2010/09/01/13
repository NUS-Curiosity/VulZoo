Subject: Month of Abysssec Undisclosed Bugs - Day 1

Hi Lists, 

The Abysssec Security Team has started its Month of Abysssec undisclosed
bugs (MOAUB). 
During this month, Abysssec will release a collection of 0days,  web
application vulnerabilities, and detailed binary analysis (and pocs) for
recently released advisories by vendors such as Microsoft, Mozilla, Sun,
Apple, Adobe, HP, Novel, etc.
The exploits, papers and PoCs will be featured on the Exploit-Database
(http://www.exploit-db.com), averaging one 0day and one binary analysis a
day. 
Get your hard-hats on, your VM¹s and debugging tools organized ­ it¹s going
to be a an intensive ride.

Posted today - MOAUB Day 1:
