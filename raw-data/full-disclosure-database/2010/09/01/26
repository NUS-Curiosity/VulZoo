Subject: DLL hijacking with ZIP files in email?

The essence of DLL hijacking is to deliver an innocent file together
with a malicious DLL, in the one directory. Would it be possible to do
this via email: a ZIP (or similar) archive containing the two files?

Thoughts about this? I know that an emailed ZIP is searcheable by
desktop AV systems; but the signature-based AVs forever play catch-up
with the attacks in the wild.

Cheers, Paul
