Subject: Re: DLL hijacking with Autorun on a USB drive

Are you seriously suggesting that just because errors in implementation happen
(such as malformed gifs leading to bugger overflows, etc), that it's OK to have
a totally broken security model that doesn't even *try* to get it right?



No I'm suggesting to fix those implementation errors not focus on damn
crippling the OS!!

When I plug in a USB, I expect to run whatever I want from it, be it
"dll hijack exploits" or not.
At most, there might be a system policy for not running *any* file
from removable drives, and of course there's the usual antivirus/ips.
But that's a damn system policy not software lockdown.
Why the hell should I, as a developer, end up fixing this shit just
because some "security experts" think they discovered the next
generation of exploits from running programs out of USB drives
(network shares or what the fk there is out there).

Perhaps you haven't noticed, Windows sees dlls as files, not as system
libraries, unlike unix (linux/bsd/whatever). Whereas I could cripple a
linux install just by removing certain non-system libraries, you can't
do this in Windows, thanks to "dll hell".
Call it like that all you want, but I've found it convenient. If you
guys can't understand a damn thing out of some crappy unix standard,
it most certainly ain't my fault.

Rant aside, I'll iterate my same central point, *this is not a
vulnerability*. I won't consider it as such, ever.
