Synopsis
========

An integer overflow vulnerability in wxGTK might enable remote
attackers to cause the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

wxGTK is the GTK+ version of wxWidgets, a cross-platform C++ GUI
toolkit.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /    Vulnerable    /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/wxGTK      < 2.8.10.1-r1                  *>= 2.6.4.0-r5
                                                        >= 2.8.10.1-r1

Description
===========

wxGTK is prone to an integer overflow error in the wxImage::Create()
function in src/common/image.cpp, possibly leading to a heap-based
buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker might entice a user to open a specially crafted JPEG
file using a program that uses wxGTK, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All wxGTK 2.6 users should upgrade to an updated version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/wxGTK-2.6.4.0-r5"

All wxGTK 2.8 users should upgrade to an updated version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/wxGTK-2.8.10.1-r1"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since August 9, 2009. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
