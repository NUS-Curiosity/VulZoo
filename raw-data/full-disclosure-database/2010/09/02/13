Subject: Re: DLL hijacking POC (failed, see for yourself)

I think that depends if its installed and on how the setting is
configured. Some environments are going to require DLLs to be loaded
from remote shares, others not. This isnt a 'patch' to a software
security flaw, its a security setting. Im guessing the default
configuration maybe messing around with the mentioned PoC, that was my
only point.
