Subject: Re: DLL hijacking POC (failed, see for yourself)

FYI everyone, ACROS has fixed the POC for 64-bit systems. The old one
failed on my Win7 64-bit and the new one works.

http://www.binaryplanting.com/test.htm

I did notice that if you just click on the link
(\\www.binaryplanting.com\demo\windows_address_book_64) Windows turns it
into a file:// url and opens it in the default browser (Chrome in my
case). The POC won't work because there's no remote CWD (at least I
imagine there isn't).  If this is consistent behavior then I think it's a
serious mitigation, since users typically click on links, not open
Explorer and paste them.

Am I wrong on Windows behavior here?
