there are some useful mitigations around these inevitable failures,
  http://qubes-os.org/Architecture.html is an example of isolation
rather than correctness i've liked since NetTop wrapped RSBAC policy
around vmware guest isolation...

defense in depth loves company, so application correctness, in
addition to NX / other hw protections on guest/host, in addition to
virtual machine isolation, in addition to RSBAC constraints, in
addition to ... are all useful and can be combined in many ways to fit
various threat models and usability requirements.

this is "hard" to design, implement, and maintain compared to the
cheap and slutty coding and configuration pervasively deployed in our
current reality, however.  don't hold your breath; just stay ahead of
all the other low hanging fruit running un-patched, un-managed Windows
installs.
