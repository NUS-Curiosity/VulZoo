Subject: Re: DLL hijacking POC (failed, see for yourself)

As I said above, it was tested on Windows 7 64bit.
As to the dll as far as I know, I'm not sure about that, however, it should
be an easy matter of checking the binary file.
Currently, I'm not on a terminal which I can do that, though.

Cheers,
Chris.
