I did better, I wrote my own test, which just like your test, it
failed proving the vulnerability.
The only difference was that I knew what was going wrong and tried to
get it to work in all ways possible;
it only seemed to work when the right possible wasn't anywhere near
the running executable (or system directories).

Unless the whole point of the vulnerability was to exploit non-existent dlls??

Sure, fine by me.
