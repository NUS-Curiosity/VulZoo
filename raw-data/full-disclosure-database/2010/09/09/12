I can confirm the demo worked as expected; first shot on an up-to-date auto-patched win7 box.
That said, I did a quick search to see if I had a local copy of wab32res.dll (dunno what the dll in the subject line is about, the DLL in question is wab32res.dll), and I did not. I wrote a quick DLL with a simple MessageBoxA() into the Windows directory and tested it again and got a pop up informing me I am about to import an address book (versus their lolhacked popup). If I had to take a stab at it, judging by this comment:

my guess would be that one of you has a copy of the DLL in the DLL search path (which *doesnt* include . until the second to last stage by default), and one of you does not.
