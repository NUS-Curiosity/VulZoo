Subject: Re: KeePass version 2.12 <= Insecure DLL
 Hijacking Vulnerability (dwmapi.dll)

Hi Christian

The reason I use "Clean" doesn't mean (or I'm not accusing) your
Windows is infected.
It's better to test DLL Hijacking in Clean Copy of Windows without any
prior applications messup.

Please take a look at
http://core.yehg.net/lab/pr0js/texts/when_testing_for_dll_hijacking.txt

We thank ACROS Security for bringing life to this issue.
We'll take social responsibility as a security community to stop this
issue as much as we could.
