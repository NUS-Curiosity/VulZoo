Indeed, we're seeing problems with accessing (any) remote WebDAV shares from various
Windows computers, while it works just great on others. Based on network monitoring,
it doesn't seem to be the problem with the server though, but rather with occasionaly
unreliable support for WebDAV folders in Windows. We're looking for possible causes
and especially for workarounds that could improve the reliability.

We'll appreciate your feedback - tell us how it worked or didn't work for you. It's a
chance for us all to learn something new.

Bwt, you can simply turn our Internet-based test into an intranet or local test by
copying the files to your local share or a folder on your computer and double-click
the .wab file from there. The usual caution with runnning code from unknown sources
applies, of course.

Can you please send the Process Monitor log for this case? We'll be happy to look
into your case.
