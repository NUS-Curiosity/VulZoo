Fyodor,
Nmap do load airpcap.dll from insufficiently qualified path. If you don't want it to call it a vulnerability, then it's your choice. But if you look at the issue its between apps and Windows DLL search path not only for the apps which register Windows file extensions.
Apps which register Windows file extensions are Exploitable by default while nmap is not.
So, according to me nmap is vulnerable but not exploitable by default. Please, try to figure out the difference b/w exploitability and vulnerability.

All,
You can and you should use nmap without any fear of getting exploited until you are stupid enough to open a file from a shared location using nmap. nmap _is_ safe to use.
