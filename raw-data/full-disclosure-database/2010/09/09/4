Subject: Re: KeePass version 2.12 <= Insecure DLL
 Hijacking Vulnerability (dwmapi.dll)

I must say I can't take your word according to my testing.
I've tested on Clean Licensed Windows 7 Professional Edition 64-bit
with latest windows updates applied (as of Today -sept 09 2010). I
used Acros Security's 64 bit demo.

Should I make movie to prove that like
1- Updating Windows (check for updates) ,
2 - Go to \\www.binaryplanting.com\demo\windows_address_book_64
3 - See the popup box

?
