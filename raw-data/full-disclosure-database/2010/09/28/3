Subject: Free Anti Social-Engineering Seminar

Hi,

I will be using current OSSTMM research to teach how to see through 
lies, stop yourself from being used or fooled, and how to better 
decisions by fixing your "gut instincts". It's a heavy intro to anti 
social-engineering and a way of applying security awareness that makes 
sense to non-security people.

where: Meredith College in North Carolina
when:  October 14th at 2:00 PM.

The 2-hour seminar is free and open to the public. We hope to see some 
of you there!

More details of the Smarter Safer Better seminar series is available 
at the ISECOM website:

during the production of this event :) Sponsored by Meredith College

Sincerely,
