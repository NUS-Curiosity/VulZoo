Subject: Profile - OSSTMM use at a Security Consultancy

Hi,

I just got word that InfoSec Island published an interview with a 
company that uses the OSSTMM for security tests. He explains why they 
use it and what it means for them.

Mike starts the article: "While re-addressing the OSSTMM and its 
application/usefulness in my firm's business, I wanted to gain the 
perspective of a company that's been using the OSSTMM for some time. 
More specifically, I wanted to know if that company's clients have 
seen a measurable improvement in their information security programs, 
since that is our overall goal, right?"

It's a nice follow-up to the OSSTMM overview Mike posted earlier and I 
think it answers some of the things we get asked all the time at ISECOM.

Sincerely,
-pete.
