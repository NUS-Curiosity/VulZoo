Subject: Re: Virus submission site

You could setup a website that proxies submissions to virustotal, anubis (so
it's from the future) and retain the executables. Post this website to FD.

You could also deploy a botnet of your own and use them as honeypots then
jack the networks of the lower tier *ircbot fellows to expand your
'honeypot' network.

A good place to start building your "whitehat use honeypot/botnet" is
scraping dronebl, spambl and IP addresses posted to the IRC-Security mailing
list. (Archive helpfully provided for registered users.)

Once you have a sizable network set up you can start "baiting" scammers by
offering various services like selling proxy servers, providing bulletproof
hosting and spamming. You can use this supplemental income to quit your day
job and become a full-time vigilante whitehat.

Eventually you'll build a nice portfolio of clients, if any of them becomes
competitive you can just report their information to the appropriate
authorities, this would also be a nice side-channel of income to enable
further whitehat pursuits and make sure you stay firmly in the man's good
books.
