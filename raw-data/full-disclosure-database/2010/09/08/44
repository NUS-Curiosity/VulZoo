 Hijacking Vulnerability (dwmapi.dll)

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107

That is installed both in my win7 64bit workstation system and the
32bit XP Pro (virtualized) system.
For the matter, that POC never worked on my PC, at least their initial
implementation was always flawed.
(speaking of which, did they really have to fail it when my own POC,
written under an hour, worked perfectly?)

If you still think my POC was wrong, please do try it and highlight
what is wrong with it.
Though I take no offense in no one trying it - it was more of personal
satisfaction than real use, hence it being written in Lazarus.

Cheers,
Chris.
