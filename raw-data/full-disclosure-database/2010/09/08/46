That is not a "patch", not installed by default: is only for
uber-geeks who manually install it. Was issued a week ago, in
response to this kerfuffle, not "quite some time ago".

Which setting of CWDIllegalInDllSearch did you choose: was it
0xFFFFFFFF which may be "safe", but is known to break Outlook
(and others), as noted in

  DLL hijacking vulnerabilities

(geeks can add further tweaks to the registry to fix).

Cheers, Paul
