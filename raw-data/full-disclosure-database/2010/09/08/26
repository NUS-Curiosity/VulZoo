 "screw you" to certificate authorities

We want a certain X people from a certain X chan dictating how some X
software is fully trusted and can run on my computer.

Call me paranoid, but I stick to the #1 rule of never ever trusting the public.

I'd rather have a company pay some good bucks to get their hands on a
highly trusted certificate than kids who's aim in life is wiping as
much hard disks as possible.
Which also answers why those $10-$20 assholes does a better job than
the kids we all know about...
