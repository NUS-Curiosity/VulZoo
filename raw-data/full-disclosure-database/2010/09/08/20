 Hijacking Vulnerability (dwmapi.dll)

So you might then add another pass of making a hash after the details of
transaction are known that embodies transaction details, then use oblivious
transfer again so that each end knows that the transaction was done and
was thus accepted?

Takes care of someone taking over the transaction perhaps, and this could
bind in the initial data so the password exchange might be rechecked.

In the first step though, there is a reliance by the client that the server
uniquely knows the password, as it seems. If many servers know that password,
at best the client knows the server is one of those that know it.

If something at the client end fiddles with the transaction, the above kind of
signing only says that the client end is consistent, does not ensure the
user at that end actually has anything to do with those bits.

At any rate, for such a thing to work you want something better than the
usual "12345" kind of password, and to overcome things like the reported 73%
of the population who use the same password for everything.

This use of oblivious transfer though, giving mutual proof, is a useful 
primitive.

Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] KeePass version 2.12 <= Insecure DLL Hijacking Vulnerability (dwmapi.dll)

With the recent MS update/patch and my POC failure (to exploit the
vuln), it is clear that this type of "vulnerability" is impractical.
In the (few) cases where it *might* work, the approach to fixing it is
not practical; that is, there are hundreds if not thousands, of
vulnerable applications.
Just consider that DWM (as in above) is loaded via well known and
widely used API.
If that ain't proof enough, see what they did with mshtml in Notepad.
Whichever the case, it is not the application's fault, but the
underlying dll loading mechanism.
Having each vulnerable application's developer fixing it is hardly
practical, thus, your (and other related) reports are, mildly put, a
huge waste of time.

Cheers,
Chris.
