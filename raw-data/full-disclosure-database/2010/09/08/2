Subject: Re: KeePass version 2.12 <= Insecure DLL
 Hijacking Vulnerability (dwmapi.dll)

A vulnerability is a vulnerability.
A SQL Injection is a type of Vulnerability.
For each type of Vulnerability, there will be thousands of web
applications that might be vulnerable to it.
DLL Hijacking is same.

We do each post rather than a list so that security vulnerability news
site can get required detailed information
as possible.

If you don't want it, set filter for each post subject with "DLL
Hijacking" or from our email.

We can't underestimate such an easy flaw that leads to system
compromise or command execution under user' privilege.

Disabling remote share/WebDav is not a solution to DLL Hijacking at all.

DLL Hijacking is highly effective in combination with the use of
Social Engineering Toolkit.
