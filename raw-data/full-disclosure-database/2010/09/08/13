Subject: Re: KeePass version 2.12 <= Insecure DLL
 Hijacking Vulnerability (dwmapi.dll)

With the recent MS update/patch and my POC failure (to exploit the
vuln), it is clear that this type of "vulnerability" is impractical.
In the (few) cases where it *might* work, the approach to fixing it is
not practical; that is, there are hundreds if not thousands, of
vulnerable applications.
Just consider that DWM (as in above) is loaded via well known and
widely used API.
If that ain't proof enough, see what they did with mshtml in Notepad.
Whichever the case, it is not the application's fault, but the
underlying dll loading mechanism.
Having each vulnerable application's developer fixing it is hardly
practical, thus, your (and other related) reports are, mildly put, a
huge waste of time.

Cheers,
Chris.
