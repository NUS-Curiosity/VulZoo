I think you're on to something there, in that if a company's business
model were completely built on trust, then they would actually want to
protect that and not give up keys to governments.

However, why don't we have server certificates with multiple
independent CA signatures?  From there, browsers/clients could be
written to be more suspicious of single-signature Sub-CAs signed by
CAs that aren't considered as safe/trustworthy (based on whatever
political prejudices you choose).

SSL PKI won't work if it's as flexible as PGP's web of trust, but
there's no reason it needs to be as fragile as it is now.
