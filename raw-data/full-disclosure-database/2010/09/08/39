Did you read my email about real-world testing of this issue?
MS issued a patch quite some time ago.
This "vulnerability" is no more on all of MS's OSes (due to the
several replies to that email, I also tested it on XP Pro SP3 +
patched...the vulnerability didn't work).

Sure, fix them all up, be my guest. See you in 2 years' time.

Perhaps you would be intrigued to know that an issue, which shares
this same concept, also applies to Linux.
Well, actually it ain't Linux's fault. It is the fault of most
scripting applications' out there (batch, php, asp and probably python
ruby sh etc, and of course, all applications that use them). And this
time it can't be easily fixed.

That said, since I consider the underlying risk well beyond useless, I
won't even bother arguing about this (so don't bother asking).


Cheers,
Chris.
