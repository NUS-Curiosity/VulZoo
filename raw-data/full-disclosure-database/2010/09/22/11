Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software H.323 Denial of Service
Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100922-h323

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-h323.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 September 22 1600 UTC (GMT)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The H.323 implementation in Cisco IOS Software contains two
vulnerabilities that may be exploited remotely to cause a denial of
service (DoS) condition on a device that is running a vulnerable
version of Cisco IOS Software.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds to mitigate these
vulnerabilities other than disabling H.323 on the vulnerable device.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-h323.shtml

Note:  The September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. Five of
the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the
vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table
at the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS
Software vulnerabilities that have been published on September 22,
2010, or earlier:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle.shtml

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual
Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the

Affected Products
=================

These vulnerabilities only affect devices that are running Cisco IOS
Software with H.323 voice services enabled.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software versions
that are configured to process H.323 messages are affected by these
vulnerabilities. H.323 is not enabled by default.

To determine if the Cisco IOS Software device is running H.323
services, issue the show process cpu | include H323 command, as shown
in this example:

    Router# show process cpu | include H323
     249       16000           3       5333  0.00%  0.00%  0.00%   0 CCH323_CT
     250           0           1          0  0.00%  0.00%  0.00%   0 CCH323_DNS
    Router#

In the previous example the processes CCH323_CT and CCH323_DNS are
running on the device; therefore, the device is listening to H.323
messages. The device is vulnerable if any of these processes (or
similar) are active.

Note: Creating a dial peer by issuing the dial-peer voice command
will start the H.323 processes, which causes the Cisco IOS device to
process H.323 messages.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
show version command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router# show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of
C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:

    Router# show version
    Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T,
        RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by these vulnerabilities.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

H.323 is the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard for
real-time multimedia communications and conferencing over
packet-based (IP) networks. A subset of the H.323 standard is
H.225.0, a standard that is used for call signaling protocols and
media stream packetization over IP networks.

The H.323 implementation in Cisco IOS Software contains two DoS
vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities
remotely by sending crafted H.323 packets to an affected device that
is running Cisco IOS Software. A TCP three-way handshake is required
to exploit these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco Bug IDs CSCtc73759 (
registered customers only) and CSCtd33567 ( registered customers
only) , and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) IDs CVE-2010-2828 and CVE-2010-2829, respectively.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities described in this
advisory may cause the affected device to reload. Theses
vulnerabilities could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended
DoS condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a
Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the
earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed
Release For This Advisory column. The First Fixed Release for All
Advisories in the September 2010 Bundle Publication column lists the
earliest possible releases that correct all the published
vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled
publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available
release, where possible.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds to mitigate these vulnerabilities apart from
disabling H.323 if the Cisco IOS device does not require it. Applying
access lists on interfaces that should not accept H.323 traffic and
placing firewalls in strategic locations may greatly reduce exposure
until an upgrade can be performed.

Cisco provides Solution Reference Network Design (SRND) guides to
help design and deploy networking solutions, which can be found at
http://www.cisco.com/go/srnd Voice Security best practices are
covered in the Cisco Unified Communications SRND Based on Cisco
Unified Communications Manager 6.x at 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/6x/security.html

To disable all H.323 call processing, administrators can issue the
call service stop forced command under the voice service voip mode,
as shown in this example:

    voice service voip
     h323
      call service stop forced

Note: The call service stop forced command disables all H.323 call
processing.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the companion document "Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the
Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Voice Products", which is available
at the following location: 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100922-voice.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.

Refer to 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html
for additional TAC contact information, including localized telephone
numbers, and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various 
languages.
