1. OVERVIEW

The Nitro PDF Reader application is vulnerable to Insecure DLL
Hijacking Vulnerability. Similar terms that describe this
vulnerability have been come up with Remote Binary Planting, and
Insecure DLL Loading/Injection/Hijacking/Preloading.


2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Nitro's new free PDF reader takes the key features that you want in a
PDF reader, a familiar interface, and smooth functionality and
combines them into an eminently usable program that doesn't get in
between you and your documents. Nitro has turned the free PDF
alternative business model on its ear by providing you with a smart
selection of watermark-free editing, drag-and-drop PDF creation, and
tabbed PDF reading.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

The Nitro PDF Reader application passes an insufficiently qualified
path in loading its external libraries -  "dwmapi.dll,  nprender.dll"
when a user opens its associated file with extensions - fdf, pdf .
(N.B. first launch with nprender.dll may not be successful. CPU Usage
might jump up. Kill the application. Reopen the pdf and DLL Poup
message will be seen)
