Subject: Firefox same-origin policy for fonts

One of my users asked me to install MathJax on my server.
Reading installation instructions in
  http://www.mathjax.org/resources/docs/?installation.html#notes-about-shared-installations
I came across the following:

  ... Firefox's same-origin security policy for cross-domain scripting.
  Firefox's interpretation of the same-origin policy is more strict than
    most other browsers, and it affects how fonts are loaded with the
    @font-face CSS directive. ...
  There is a solution to this, however, if you manage the server ...
    create a file called .htaccess that contains the following lines: ...
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"

That would suggest that this same-origin policy can be defeated by
settings on the "evil" server: the policy is not enforced, useless.
Did I misunderstand something?

(Does not really matter to me, am not planning on using that setting,
but am wondering about Firefox workings.)

Thanks,
