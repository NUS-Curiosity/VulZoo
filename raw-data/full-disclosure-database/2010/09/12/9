Subject: Re: Adobe Flash Player IE version 10.1.x Insecure
	DLL Hijacking Vulnerability (dwmapi.dll)

Hello YGN Ethical Hacker Group!

Nice vulnerability and nice video. As I see from your list of DLL Hijacking
vulnerabilities in different applications, published in FD mailing list and
at securityvulns.com
(http://securityvulns.com/news/Microsoft/Windows/DLLHijacking.html), you are
planning to actively work with this type of vulnerability and find a lot of
applications with it. Good luck you in this work.

For me DLL Hijacking is not very interesting (because it's not web security
related issue), except using this attack on browsers. And yesterday I
checked many versions of many browsers which I had and I found such DLL
Hijacking vulnerability in Opera (which I posted about at my site yesterday,
and in my testing different versions of Firefox were not affected, but which
must be affected according to Mozilla). The most interesting that I found
new attack vector (on example of Opera), besides first attack vector with
using of DLL Hijacking (which was described in August). I'll write more
details about it soon.

Concerning your vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player. Did you test only in IE
and only in IE8? Because I used my own dwmapi.dll (which I created for DLL
Hijacking tests) and I not found any affected browsers from all my browsers
(including different versions of IE) at watching of flash-files (but your
video shows that hole exists). Did you check only flash player 10.1.x or
10.0.x also?
