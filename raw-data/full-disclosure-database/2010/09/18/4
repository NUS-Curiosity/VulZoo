Gödel and the limits of logic

Quote:

Another result that derives from Gödel's ideas is the demonstration that
no  program that does not alter a computer's operating system can detect
all programs that do. In other words, no program can find all the
viruses on your computer, unless it interferes with *and alters* the operating system.
