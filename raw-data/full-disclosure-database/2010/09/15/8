Word (resp. MS Office) documents ain't harmless: they may contain VBA
code.
Plain text files can be harmfull too: any *.pl, *.js, *.vbs, *.reg
which gets opened^Winterpreted by its associated application, not
just viewed in the editor, can cause havoc.
And it doesn't really matter whether the user double-clicks the file,
or starts the resp. application first and opens the file from there.
