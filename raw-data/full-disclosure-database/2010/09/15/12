You're new here, aren't you? :)

Out in the real world, if they have a McSE cert and know enough to keep the
server running, they get the job even if they don't understand what some of
those mystical registry keys do.  The sad fact of the matter is that there are
a *lot* of servers out there, and there simply aren't enough truly clued
experienced admins to run them all.  So most of them limp along with an unclued
admin (who very well may be also acting as a secretary, or a junior designer,
or a tech writer or a grad student, and who really wants to get back to their
"real" job instead of futzing around with the server).
