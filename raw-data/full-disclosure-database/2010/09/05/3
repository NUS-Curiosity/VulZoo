It depends. Can Harvard architecture stop a careless program from loading 
a malicious DLL? From interpreting parts of data files as programs in 
some kind of script language?

Actually, you prove my point. Qubes OS does not try to separate code and

expected. It throws everything in an isolated box and makes sure nothing
leaves the box and enters another one without your explicit approval.
