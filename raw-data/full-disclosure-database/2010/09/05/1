It just adds more "trust" between the site running the CAPTCHA and 
Google. It's sent in plaintext to the reCAPTCHA server, anyways.

Quoting reCAPTCHA Supprt

So as far as I can tell, Google/reCAPTCHA only require you get a private 
key to "lock you in" to it. According to that post, there's no major 
risk if someone else has your private key, but it should stay - as the 
name implies - "private".
