-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli FastBack Server. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe which listens by
default on TCP port 11460. The vulnerable function uses values directly
from a received packet as the size and data to several memcpy calls. By
providing crafted values this issue can lead to remote code execution
under the context of the fastback server.
