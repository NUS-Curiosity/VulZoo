Synopsis
========

fence contains multiple programs containing vulnerabilites that may
allow local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.

Background
==========

fence is an I/O group fencing system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-cluster/fence      < 2.03.09                      Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

The fence_apc, fence_apc_snmp (CVE-2008-4579) and fence_manual
(CVE-2008-4580) programs contain symlink vulnerabilites.

Impact
======

These vulnerabilities may allow arbitrary files to be overwritten with
root privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Gentoo discontinued support for fence. All fence users should uninstall
and choose another software that provides the same functionality.

    # emerge --unmerge sys-cluster/fence
