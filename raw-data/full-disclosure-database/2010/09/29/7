Subject: Backward disassembler for ROP exploitation

Dear all,

I want to share with you a tool that I wrote for helping me find
gadgets useful in ROP exploits.

bdasm is a PyCommand for Immunity Debugger (v 1.73) which can search
the address space of a process for a certain opcode/instruction and
disassemble backward and forward for a  specified number of
instructions.

You can find more details for usage and examples here:

If you find it useful or have any questions please drop me a comment.


Regards,
Adrian
