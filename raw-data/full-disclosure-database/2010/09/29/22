-- CVSS:
5, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

-- Affected Vendors:
IBM

-- Affected Products:
IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial of service
condition on vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli FastBack Server.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe which listens by
default on tcp port 11406. The issue is due to an unchecked user
supplied length value. This value is used to iterate over supplied data
and calculate a CRC value. Successful exploitation leads to an unhandled
access violation and immediate termination of the FastBackServer.exe
process.
