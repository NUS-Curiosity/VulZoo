i did not say bushehr was not impacted; a side effect of the re-use of
same real-time PLC workflow controller there resulted in cluster fuck
and non-operation.

however, the target was centrifuges and in this regard, it worked
perfectly: the only outward signs of interest at natanz and qom while
affected was then un-explained 2x to 4x under-yield from the
cascades...  the running total spinning looked nice though - steady
progress! heh

in any case, you confuse me with someone who has something to say.
really EOT this time...
