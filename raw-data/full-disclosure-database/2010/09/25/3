misleading because the failures induced in target present as
inefficiencies and mechanical fatigue in centrifuge process; intent is
to cast suspicion and resources on manufacturing and/or assembly of
centrifuge hardware as cursory checks of digital systems (data
presumably acquired from floor) return normative.

good game, sirs!
 target spends dollars and weeks/months pursuing errors in physical
supply and installation paths en-route to / on site, all the while the
wear is digitally done; out of sight, out of mind...

this game (offensive, methodical, precision targeted high-assurance
malware) is an odd sort of global-actor assasination politik. like
china blasting sats in space, it was bound to happen sooner or later
:P
