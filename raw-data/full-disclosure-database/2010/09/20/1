Subject: Re: Gödel and kernel backdoors

The solution could be a virtualized operating system, which has a control layer between the operating system and the hardware abstraction layer. Changes to data could be non-persistent in the first step, and only written to the hdd after a heuristic check of the changes and a interaction with the user.  

In the end, the problem is on one side the os vendor bothering endusers with stupid stop signs that can be disabled with a simple click, and on the other side the user again, clicking on every accept button like a woodpecker.
