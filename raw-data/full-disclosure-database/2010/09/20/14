Subject: Deutsche Post Security Cup

Dear security community, 

We would like to inform about a security initiative aimed at bringing
together your security expertise in testing a new web application. We
would also like to invite you to the open competition on that web
application, the Deutsche Post E-Postbrief ('online letter').

Contestants in the Security Cup are equipped with accounts on the live
system and the funds needed to operate it. Participation is rewarded
with a sign-up premium of EUR 3,000; discovered vulnerabilities are
awarded EUR 1,000 to EUR 5,000 each.

A sign-up form that wants to be mailed to securitycup@...tschepost.de is
available here:
http://www.deutschepost.de/securitycup/signup

Further information can be found at:

We are looking forward to seeing the security elite compete in the Cup.
Thank you for your attention,

Marcus Rubenschuh

Vice President IT-Security & Compliance
Chief Information Security Officer
Deutsche Post AG
