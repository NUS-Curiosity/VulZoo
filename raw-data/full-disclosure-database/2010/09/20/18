Subject: Intro to Using the OSSTMM 3

Hi,

I saw a good article on OSSTMM 3 was written and posted to infosec 
island. It's a different viewpoint then my own which is probably 
refreshing for most of you ;) This is from a security tester / 
consultant / business owner who began using it recently.

Sincerely,
-pete.
