Subject: Binary Planting Attack Vectors - There's more
	than one way to skin a cat... or plant a binary, for that matter


ACROS Security is presenting an analysis of many different delivery methods for
binary planting attacks, providing a hopefully more comprehensive view on the
feasibility of such attacks. We looked at some of the most popular web browsers, most
popular e-mail clients and most popular document readers, trying to use them as
delivery mechanisms for binary planting attacks.

Some interesting findings:

- Clicking a link to a remote shared folder on a web page will open this share in
Windows Explorer without a warning for 67% of all Internet Explorer users.

- Clicking a link to a remote shared folder in an e-mail message will open this share
in Windows Explorer without a warning for all Outlook, Windows Mail and Windows Live
Mail users, regardless of their default web browser. (E-mail is the most likely
vector for targeted attacks on corporate and government networks.)

Do the demonstrations for yourself and let us know how they worked for you.
