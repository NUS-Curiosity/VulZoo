The same-origin rules on WOFF are about IP rights rather than security.
Unlike images, a page can only use a WOFF font with the cooperation of the
font-hosting site. If it happens to be a licensed font and is being misused
then the foundry knows who to talk to. A site using a font they don't have
a license for will have to host it themselves, they can't hide behind the
link being just text and claim it was the browser that did the infringing.
