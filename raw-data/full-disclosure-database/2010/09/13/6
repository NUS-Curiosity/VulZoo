ANY DLL is/may be exploitable when referenced without its (often
well-known) complete pathname.
It IS necessary to name all the applications with unqualified
references and to have them fixed by their authors/vendors.

And there are MANY places where DLLs or EXEs are referenced, not just
in binaries: the registry, DESKTOP.INI files (especially in the start
menu and %ProgramFiles%), batch files (do you reference CMD.EXE always
as %SystemRoot%\System32\CMD.EXE? No? It really doesn't hurt!), scripts
(including AUTORUN.INF.-), ...
