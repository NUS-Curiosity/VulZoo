4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in MailEnable,
which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of 
Service).

1) An insufficient length check when appending data to a predefined
log message into a buffer using strcat_s() may result in an unhandled
invalid parameter error. This can be exploited to crash the SMTP 
service (MESMTPC.exe) via an overly long email address in the "MAIL 
FROM" command.

2) An insufficient length check when copying data with a predefined
log message into a buffer using strcpy_s() may result in an unhandled
invalid parameter error. This can be exploited to crash the SMTP 
service (MESMTPC.exe) via an overly long domain name in the "RCPT TO" 
command.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 4.26 or apply hotfix ME-10044.
