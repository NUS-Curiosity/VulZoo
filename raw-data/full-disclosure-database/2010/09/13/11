ZDI-10-169: Novell Netware SSHD.NLM Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-169
September 1, 2010

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Novell

-- Affected Products:
Novell Netware

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Netware. Authentication is required
to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within SSHD.NLM. When the application attempts to
resolve an absolute path on the server, a 512 byte destination buffer is
used without bounds checking. By providing a large enough value, an
attacker can cause a buffer to be overflowed. Successful exploitation
results in remote code execution under the context of the server.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
