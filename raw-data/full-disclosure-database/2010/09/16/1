This patch adds support for getsockopt for MCAST_MSFILTER for
both IPv4 and IPv6. It depends on the previous setsockopt patch,
and uses the same method.

Thanks you for signing-off on this one guys.

This exploit has been tested very thoroughly
over the course of the past few years on many many targets.

Thanks to redhat for being nice enough to backport it into early
kernel versions (anything from later August 2008+)

Ac1dB1tch3z would like to say FUCK YOU Ben Hawkes. You are a new hero! You saved the
plan8 man. Just a bit too l8.

PS:
OpenVZ Payload / GRsec bypass removed for kidiots and fame whores. (same thing right ;))
