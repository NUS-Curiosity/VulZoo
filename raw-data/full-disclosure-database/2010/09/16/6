Subject: Workaround for Ac1db1tch3z exploit.


If you do not actually need to run any 32bits binaries on x86_64 you can
do: 

echo ':32bits:M:0:\x7fELF\x01::/bin/echo:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

This will make the kernel run /bin/echo filename instead of executing
the file whenever it sees a 32bit ELF binary.

Of course if you actually *need* to run some 32bits binaries this will
not help you.
