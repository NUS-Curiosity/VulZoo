Subject: stuxnet DATA decoder

i have a couple of network intercepts from a large WAN that i am tasked to
monitored . they show Stuxnet infections . i have extracted the DATA that
stuxnet sends to C&C , the ones that are all start with : 66a96e28
we know that this Data sent over http is encrypted ( XOR ) with a 31-byte
Key . is there a decoder available somewhere ? if not , is there more
detailed document on this other than Symentec's so i can develop
a brute-forcer based on the knowledge of what info is located at which point
of this data stream ? i think a simple known plain text style brute forcer
can do this , i wanted to know if anybody did that before ?
Regards
