reminds me somehow of
 
http://www.metasploit.com/modules/exploit/windows/ftp

"This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in EasyFTP Server 1.7.0.11 and earlier. EasyFTP fails to check input size when parsing 'CWD' commands, which leads to a stack based buffer overflow. EasyFTP allows anonymous access by default;"

You didn't even bother to write your own stuff?

Pen-Testing has nothing to do with pressing buttons or a fancy looking gui.
Nor shouldn't it ripoff open source solutions and selling it for money. 

dude...
