Are you expecting us to believe that a windows only supported penetration tool 
with absolutely zero information regarding true effectiveness or methods is 
supposed to compete with metasploit? For all I know I could be paying $500 for a 
shiny box that spits blinkenlights at me with a message saying "you just h4x0red 
y0urself! Trust meh1"

umm yeah....I think ill go back to reviewing that PoC args

Subject: [Full-disclosure] New tool for pentesting

A new product was born, similiar to Core Impact, Metasploit and Immunity Canvas.
INSECT is affordable, easy to use and it has a friendly user
interface. It promises to be an excellent tool and it allows
organizations of all sizes to conduct comprehensive penetration
testing across their infrastructure and applications.

INSECT's interface is designed to be usable by individuals both with
and without specialized training in penetration testing and
vulnerability assessment, and includes functions for generating
reports from the gathered information.
