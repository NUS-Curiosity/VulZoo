I know the story of this guy. He was fired from Core for 
incompetence and swore he'd make a better product and compete with 
them. I bet they're still laughing their asses off...

Check out his Twitter account: https://twitter.com/runlvl

Apparently this guy used to do website defacements, judging from 
his tweets...
