Subject: reCaptcha secret key - where is the point?

Reading here & there i found lot of people scared about they "secret
key" of reCaptcha coud be publically discovered;
But, at this moment, is kind of useless for an attacker, right? or at
least until we find out how the reCaptcha response is calculated..

Am i right? Suggestions?
