Synopsis
========

Insecure permission handling in maildrop might allow local attackers to
elevate their privileges.

Background
==========

maildrop is the mail filter/mail delivery agent that is used by the
Courier Mail Server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-filter/maildrop       < 2.4.2                       >= 2.4.2

Description
===========

Christoph Anton Mitterer reported that maildrop does not properly drop
its privileges when run as root.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create a specially crafted .mailfilter file,
possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary commands with the "root"
group privileges. NOTE: Successful exploitation requires that maildrop
is run as root with the -d option.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All maildrop users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-filter/maildrop-2.4.2"
