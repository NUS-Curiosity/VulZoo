Subject: PAPER: JIT spraying and mitigations

ABSTRACT

With the discovery of new exploit techniques, novel protection mechanisms 
are needed as well. Mitigations like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) or ASLR 
(Address Space Layout Randomization) created a significantly more difficult 
environment for exploitation. Attackers, however, have recently researched 
new exploitation methods which are capable of bypassing the operating system's 
memory mitigations. One of the newest and most popular exploitation 
techniques to bypass both of the aforementioned security protections is JIT 
memory spraying, introduced by Dion Blazakis. In this article we will 
present a short overview of the JIT spraying technique and also novel 
mitigation methods against this innovative class of attacks. An anti-JIT 
spraying library was created as part of our shellcode execution prevention 
system.
