You *do* realize that out in the real world, an NMAP scan is very likely to not
actually be noticed and cared about, right?  If you got a security analyst out
of bed every time Snort detected an nmap scan at 3AM, very soon you'll have a
sleep-deprived analyst who won't be worth shit when a *real* attack happens.

Often, you can use that "this attack is detected" feature against the site
under attack. A lot of black hats will intentionally launch a whole mess of
nmap and nessus scans from zillions of throw-away zombies, just so their *real*
attack can fly under the wire.
