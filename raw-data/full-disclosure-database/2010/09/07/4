Subject: Re: KeePass version 2.12 <= Insecure DLL
 Hijacking Vulnerability (dwmapi.dll)

I'm getting a bit tired of throwing away these "security advisories".

Really, someone should install a whole load of popular applications, ensure
any of them load their own files, and finally, thanks to a mass dependency
check, ensure DWM is being loaded at runtime.

At least, it would be just one email/thread to trash.
