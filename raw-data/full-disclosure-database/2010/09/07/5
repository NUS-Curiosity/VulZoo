Synopsis
========

The secure path feature and group handling in sudo allow local
attackers to escalate privileges.

Background
==========

sudo allows a system administrator to give users the ability to run
commands as other users.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /    Vulnerable    /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/sudo      < 1.7.4_p3-r1                  >= 1.7.4_p3-r1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in sudo:

* Evan Broder and Anders Kaseorg of Ksplice, Inc. reported that the
  sudo 'secure path' feature does not properly handle multiple PATH
  variables (CVE-2010-1646).

* Markus Wuethrich of Swiss Post reported that sudo fails to restrict
  access when using Runas groups and the group (-g) command line option
  (CVE-2010-2956).

Impact
======

A local attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain the
ability to run certain commands with the privileges of other users,
including root, depending on the configuration.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All sudo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/sudo-1.7.4_p3-r1"
