TPTI-10-09: Adobe Shockwave CSWV Chunk Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-10-09
August 24, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-2877

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within IML32X.dll and DIRAPIX.dll which are
responsible for parsing the Director movies, a RIFF-based file format.
The code trusts a value from the file as a count and performs an
endian-flipping loop on data in heap memory. If the value is large
enough the process can be made to seek outside the bounds of the
allocation and thus corrupt memory in a controlled fashion. This can be
leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of
the user running the web browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
