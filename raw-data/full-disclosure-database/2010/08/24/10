Hi,

Since the dawn of our species (well 2005, if you want to be picky about
it) t2 has been granting free admission to the elite of their kind, the
winners of the t2 Challenges. Don’t be suckered in by all the cheap
imitations out there, their snooze-fest la-di-da dog and pony shows,
because t2 is back! And we’re pleased to announce the release of the
t2’10 Challenge!

Now is your chance to join the past elites (http://t2.fi/challenge/) by
winning free admission to this year’s t2’10 Infosec Conference!

This year’s t2’10 Challenge is based on multi-staging (much like good
shell code), which will be powered by a scoreboard
(http://t2.fi/ext/scoreboard) so that you can see — (almost) in real
time — how the other participants are fairing out there in the land of
the living.

The rules are simple: t2 will release the t2’10 Challenge and the first
one to solve it will win free admission to the t2’10 Infosec Conference.
But don’t stop just because you weren’t the first one to solve it: The
Advisory Board will select another winner among the next ten correct
answers, paying particular attention to the elegance of the solution
rather than the speed. In other words you can win with either speed or
style :)

The t2’10 Challenge will be released 2010-08-28 10:00 EEST at http://t2.fi/

Good luck,

- --
