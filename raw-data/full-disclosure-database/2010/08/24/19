TPTI-10-15: Adobe Shockwave Director mmap Trusted Chunk Size Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-10-15
August 24, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-2870

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the DIRAPIX module responsible for
parsing the RIFF-based Director file format. When handling the mmap
chunk, the process trusts the chunk size immediately following the
fourCC value. It is passed to Ordinal1111 exported by the IML32X module
which is responsible for allocating a heap buffer for processing the
rest of the chunk. If an incorrect size is provided, later memory copies
can corrupt data beyond the allocated buffer. This can be abused to
execute remote code under the context of the user running the web
browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
