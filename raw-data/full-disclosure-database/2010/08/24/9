1. Navigate to the Facebook "Friend Finder" feature.

2.  Click the "Upload Contact File" option in order to access the file 
upload prompt.

3. Upload a contact file of ANY of the accepted formats that contains a 
list of email addresses that you would like to enumerate.

4. Select the target email(s), and click "Invite to Join.

5. If the email you are targeting DOES have a restricted Facebook 
profile then an email invite will not be sent, and a page which contains 
a link to the Facebook profile associated with the target email address 
to be enumerated will be displayed, thus allowing you to link the email 
with the corresponding account.
