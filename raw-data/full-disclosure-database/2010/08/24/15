TPTI-10-12: Adobe Shockwave TextXtra Allocator Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-10-12
August 24, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-2879

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists due to a faulty allocation routine within the
TextXtra.x32 module. This allocator allocates a buffer on the heap based
on arithmetic involving a number of elements and a size of an individual
element. As the fields come from the file, if either of them are large
enough, the value used for the number of bytes to allocate can be made
to overflow. As the return value is rarely checked any caller of this
function can usually be made to overflow the returned buffer with
user-supplied data. An attacker can leverage this to execute remote code
under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
