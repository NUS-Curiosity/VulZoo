-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Internet Security Pro. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the UfPBCtrl.dll ActiveX control. The
extSetOwner function accepts a parameter and assumes it is an
initialized pointer. By specifying an invalid address, an attacker can
force the process to call into a controlled memory region. This can be
exploited to execute remote code under the context of the user invoking
the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Trend Micro has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
