Subject: Method to encode DLL payloads for hijacking
	purposes.

Hey..

Yesterday I wrote a post describing how to exploit these vulnerabilities
using the "webdav_dll_hijacker" Metasploit module, but it requires you to
jump through some hoops in order to get your victim to browse to the rogue
share.  So, here's a new article that doesn't use the "webdav_dll_hijacker"
module and details how to encode a payload into a DLL using "msfpayload",
which allows you to put the exploit files on any share that you'd like.

Enjoy.
