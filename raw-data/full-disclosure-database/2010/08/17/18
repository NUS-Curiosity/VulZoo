>>From what I have read in the past, Microsoft's security team responds
to secure@...rosoft.com. Howard and Lipner state such in The Security
Development Lifecycle, p. 30; and the MSRC webpage states it responds
to over 100,000 emails to the address annually
(http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/).

But I do see your point - RFC 2142 was an Internet Draft in early
1997, and the Microsoft Security Response Center was set up in 1998.
It appears the email address was never reconciled.
