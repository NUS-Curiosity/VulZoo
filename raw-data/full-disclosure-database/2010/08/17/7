Please open bug-tracker for FuzzDiff and put the program under some
version controlling software.

You have temporary file vulnerability in FuzzDiff
(5b6b5c6c22c1103b4169b9fe6e7bfbc3
c0ce0235f8f0026988c60a3217233c36d829ecdf). Maybe you want to use
this module: http://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html
