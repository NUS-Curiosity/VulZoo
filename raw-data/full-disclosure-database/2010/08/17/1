Its unfortunate that the vendor did not respond. But in the US,
legislation is such that its more cost effective to suffer the breach
and then turn it over to PR rather than invest the time and money in
fixing/training/etc.

It seems that corporate America's purchasing of politicians (err, PAC
contributions) has been well worth the investment. Legislation is such
that victims and shareholders both suffer after a breach.
