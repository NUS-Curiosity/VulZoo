At CCBill we take web application security very seriously. I can assure you that no one in this organization received any type of disclosure prior to the posting of the vulnerability to this list. It is very easy to reach our Information Security team at security@...ill.com<mailto:security@...ill.com>. We are working hard to identify the issue in question  and a post will be made here once it is resolved. I ask that the researcher from ariko-security.com please contact us at the email provided.
