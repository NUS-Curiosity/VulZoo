Subject: FreeSSHD 1.2.4~1.2.6 Remote Buffer Overflow DoS

This is to confirm FreeSSHD 1.2.6 , latest version, is still vulnerable to this:
http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/11842/

The bug report can't be submitted on the author site - http://www.freesshd.com
because of a php bug in form submission.
But it was sent to emails from its commercial site - WeOnlyDo -
http://www.weonlydo.com/.

I request exploit researchers to find remote code execution capability
in this flaw.
