Hi List,

Normally don't post much, or at all- mainly just a lurker. But has anyone
heard of this 'Project Vigilant' asshattery that has emerged post-defcon?
Seems like Chet Uber claims to have a Avengers type squad of uber nerds, but
I can't find any record of his '10 years' of crime-fighting awesomeness.
Thoughts? Opinions? Flames?
