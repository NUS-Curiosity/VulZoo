It didn't work for me.  I use VoiceOver, which didn't like the (fake) slider implemented in javascript, so I had to spoof the UA on a Mac, grab the source, inspect it, grab the PDF, email it to myself ... it didn't work. :-(  iPhone 3GS = 2,1, yes?

Nice, did you just try it in case it might work, or does this constitute a vuln that wants fixing in current lighttpd?  It's just that indexing happens to be enabled on http://jailbreakme.com/_/ too.
