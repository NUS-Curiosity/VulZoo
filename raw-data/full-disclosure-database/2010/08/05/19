-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to delete all files on a
system with a vulnerable installation of the Novell iPrint Client. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the nipplib.dll module that can be
reached via the ienipp.ocx ActiveX control with CLSID
36723f97-7aa0-11d4-8919-FF2D71D0D32C. The CleanUploadFiles method
appears to be used to remove temporary files within a contained
directory. However, due to a logic flaw a remote attacker can abuse the
function to force the process to recursively delete all files on the
target system. 

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
