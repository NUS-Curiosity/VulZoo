-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Novell iPrint client. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the ienipp.ocx ActiveX control. The
control accepts a 'debug' parameter that is expected to be either "yes"
or "true". If a string of a specific length is provided instead, a
processing loop within the ExecuteRequest method can be made to corrupt
a stack-based buffer. This can be leveraged by a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the web
browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
