-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Novell iPrint Client browser plugin.
User interaction is required in that a target must visit a malicious web
page.

The specific flaw exists within handling plugin parameters. The
application does not properly verify the name of parameters passed via
<embed> tags. If a malicious attacker provides a long enough value a
destination buffer can be overflowed. Successful exploitation leads to
execution of arbitrary code under the context of the user owning the
browser process.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
