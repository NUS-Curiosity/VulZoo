Subject: CyberLink products vulnerable to DLLHijacking

Hi

Trying to play with the HD Moore tool on a default HP  notebook
installation, I have found that the CyberLink products seems vulnerable to
this kind of threat. I have check and test the proof of concept generated by
dllhijacking and works. The products are:

- CyberLink PowerDirector v7
- CyberLink Power2Go DVD v6.0

The issue is trigger with the iso,pdl,pds,p2g and p2i file formats, and DLL
request by the applications is the mfc71loc.dll or mfc71<country>.dll . If
