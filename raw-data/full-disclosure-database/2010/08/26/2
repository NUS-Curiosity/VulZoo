Subject: YouTube remote unsubscribe exploit

A remote unsubscribe exploit has been discovered by an unknown source. 
This allows for a remote user to ubsubscribe another user's subscribers.

Example code:

http://pastie.org/1115557.txt

You may also manually test out this bug. Send the ubsubscribe request 
numerous times and watch the count of other subscribes go down.

Again, I did not write or discover this problem. It is already well 
known, and I just hope you users here benefit from knowing about it.

Keep safe!
