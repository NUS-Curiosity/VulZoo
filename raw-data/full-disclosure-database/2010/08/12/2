Subject: Facebook name + photo extraction using 'Forgot
	Password' page

Hi everyone,

This is with reference to the post by Mr. Atul Agarwal dated 11-Aug-10, and
posted here (http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Aug/130), in which
Mr. Atul describes how a spammer might enter email addresses and extract the
names (and photos) from Facebook accounts registered against those email
IDs. Mr. Atul also mentions that this technique can be used to
*validate*email addresses in one's possession.

Would like to point out that another way to harness this information is
through Facebook's "Forgot your password?" page (located at
http://www.facebook.com/reset.php). By entering an email address on this
webpage, a user's name, a photo and possibly a snippet of text is displayed
(assuming a Facebook user exists against this email ID).

I came across this on 6-Jun-10, and posted the same on my blog on 7-Jun-10.
You might want to read the details on my blog (
