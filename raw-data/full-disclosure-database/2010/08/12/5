4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a security issue in Opera, which can 
be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

The "Download" dialog provides the option to run a downloadable 
executable at a predictable location in the browser window. This can 
be exploited to trick a user into clicking on the "Run" button by 
positioning a new window on top of the "Download" dialog that is 
closed e.g. via a timeout shortly before the user clicks on a link 
within this window.
