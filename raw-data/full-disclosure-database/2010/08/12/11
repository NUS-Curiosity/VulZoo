Bingo!  You hit the nail on the head.  The only difference between medical 
networks and any other network is the type of data at risk.  The attacks and 
attack methodologies are the same, the success rate is the same, the quality of 
the risk aversion is the same.  There's nothing special about medical networks 
from an attack standpoint.

As with anything, this is only as true as the number of people who are 
conscientious and the subtlety of the attack.  I never meant to say that 
medical personnel aren't highly trained or capable.  All I'm saying is that 
humans are humans.  If you don't specialize in IT, you're less likely to be 
aware of the risks and possible attack methodologies, but you're more likely to 
detect attacks that affect things you specialize in and are aware of. 
Conversely, an IT person might not recognize a faulty setting on a machine that 
a medical person would immediately recognize as wrong.

We can't all be radiologists any more than we can all be computer specialists.

The vast majority of attacks are going to be "throw it up against the wall and 
see if some sticks" type of attacks.  Who knows what impact they might have on 
heart monitor or a networked IV?  And since most expensive equipment that 
requires a separate PC controller will be running Windows, older OSes, 
unpatched and without AV, the chances of a "throw it up" attack being 
successful are relatively high unless you've mitigated the risk in some way.

The annual Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report is a good place to start.
