That depends on where you are, and who is enforcing the requirement..

Non-lethal attacks are happening, for sure, but they're buried in the 
deluge of press about sensational data breaches, SCADA, GSM hacks and 
exploding generators- and usually the data exposed is the same as 
everywhere else- PII and financial stuff. The health records, on the 
other hand, might be of interest to insurance companies and other groups 
that could benefit from that kind of information on their clients or 
employees. However, if those companies and groups are interested enogh, 
they probably already have a way of getting that information.

The reports exist. If you're looking for risk assessment information, 
you may want to start with groups like IHE, who do quite a lot of 
technical policy work. The people who work there have been involved in 
medical IT since before it was a buzzword.

In the world of radiology, anyway, there are famous cases of accidental 
damage and death caused by code errors (see:Therac-25), and it's not too 
much of a stretch to imagine human-driven attacks, rather than just poor 
code.

Some hospitals have a well guarded network. Some Medical IT systems are 
secure. Some are not. The Threat Environment for medical institutions is 
similar to any other large company, except there's the added risk of 
medical records and data being exposed- which might be handy for all 
sorts of things (think insurance fraud, blackmail, etc). The truth is, 
it doesn't make much of a difference- the attack surface is also pretty 
similar to any other large institution; so much of it depends on 
internal policy and politics, as well as the technical stuff.

Most Radiology personnel would catch on to this pretty quickly- assuming 
it was meant to be a lethal attack. Pretty much any operator who has to 
train to the level these people do should be able to spot a lethal 
attack in progress, since the attack would cause the machine to behave 
erratically. You need the equivalent of an associate's degree to be an 
x-ray tech where I am, at least, and I think it's the same for most of 
North America and Europe. Hospitals often have their own specialists who 
tend to train like pilots- a certain number of hours with a specific 
machine, and then retraining when it gets updated. IT staff are 
sometimes part of that group.

This level of training may not, however, be the case for something like 
a network-enabled IV (don't laugh! they exist)- since the telemetry that 
the IV is sending to the nurse's station could be falsified, and you 
don't really need specialized staff for this type of system. The same 
goes for things like heart rate monitors, etc... This is why we have 
local audits, external audits and Audit repositories, along with node 
and program authentication as a base requirement for the IT and data 
interchange standards that I'm aware of that certify these devices. 
Obviously, audit trails are post-facto, but proper monitoring should be 
able to detect an attack in progress.

I'd suggest looking to the standards groups in whatever area you're in 
to see if you can find the risk and attack statistics; IHE is global, 
and they have a number of partner organizations- it's a reasonable 
starting point.
