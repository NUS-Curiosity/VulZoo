Subject: TGP 1.2.4 beta

TGP beta updated as follows:

http://www.hammerofgod.com/tgp.aspx


 08/07/10 v1.2.4 - Beta (RC) now including x64 bit versions.
- Added single-file AES256 encryption functions for binary encryption of files outside of the TGP KeyFob/MSL framework, using user-supplied passwords instead of RSA key-based AES key encryption. It's your basic "password protected AES256 encrypted files," but it actually has a pretty decent use case.
- Added file/text hashing capabilities for MD5/SHA1/SHA256/SHA512. You select an input file or paste text into the generator, and select which hash message digest you would like to generate. It's quite helpful for, um, whatever you want to generate hashes for, I guess. For instance, I use TGPWin to get a SHA256 hash of itself to post for signature verification.
- Added block cryptostream buffering in order to support very large AES file encryption (tested to several gig). This is not yet possible for TGP XML files due to the complexities in creating large embedded crypto-blobs inside XML text files. But I'm working on that. However, I did optimize bitchunking as much as I could in my current generation framework and have no problem with generating 500 meg TGP XML files. That's pretty big for a single file, so I'm OK with that for now.
- Added "Auto Complete" function to predict decryption output file name and auto-populate the OutFile variable. Note this function automatically overwrites existing output files by design. User toggled.
- Added "Launch File on Success" feature to automatically launch decrypted files upon successful decryption. User toggled.
- Added multi-threaded operation for AES cryptographic functions, and updated my "ThreadUpdate" status capabilities to track multiple threaded operations throughout the operation lifespan.  For example, if you launch a 16k Key Fob generation process, which will take a while, you can now go and AES encrypt a 3 gig file while that is going on, and while THAT is going on, you can TGP decrypt an .xlsx.tgp file and launch Excel with the decrypted file.  When the AES encryption is finished, TGP will let you know that you've still got a background process running (the Keygen).  If you try to exit, it warns you before you orphan your existing threads.
