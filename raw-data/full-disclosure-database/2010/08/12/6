Did you ask for CVE-identifier for this issue? Did you report this to
the developers? You should include more information to your reports.
For example, which version isn't affected if any.

If I am correct this is english-speaking mailing-list so we are not
interested about your www-page when the articles are in a language that
most of us can't read. The page does not seem to include the
information I am looking for.

Best regards,
