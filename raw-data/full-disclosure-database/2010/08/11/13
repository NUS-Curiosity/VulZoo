Hi Geeks,


 There was a bug on Snort w.r.t the cache Part. BoF gets triggered when the
URL gets hit by a RegEx signature which consumes more than the cache memory
available (8MB is default).

I am unable to find further details, I remember there was such type of bug
in Snort.

Regards,
Srinivas Naik
