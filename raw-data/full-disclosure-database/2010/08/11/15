Subject: Re: Facebook name extraction based on email/wrong
	password + POC

Uploading an address book will check the privacy settings of each contacts
and it will not display contacts that have chosen not to appear in facebook
search results.
It's the same that searching for the email directly on the seach box:
http://www.facebook.com/search/?q=bob@something.com

As said by Atul, when email is valid and password is not, it does not check
the privacy settings and displays profile pic+name, so this is a bug.
