I guess most hackers will know, to which infrastructure they are connected (If
you are sitting in front of a hospital and get a connection to the WLAN with
SSID "[name of hospital]-AMB" you might have a good guess where you are in). And
as soon as they start looking around (e.g. sniffing of SMB broadcasts), it would
take only some reasoning to find out, what the machines are for. The hospital
data theft/blackmailers seem to have known where to look for data too.

So your are telling that problems with hospital IT/medical systems are not
reported and published? From my understanding, the medical devices directive
would force producers to report incidents and these reports _have_ to be
published. I also think that laboratory/clinics information systems do not fall
in that category, so reporting might be optional.

Anyway, these reports would be useful to perform sensible risk assessment when
producing new software and would allow fixing of "community-known-bugs" before
someone turns them against infrastructure or people.

Sorry, I was unclear: Of course, they cannot detect the hackers, but they might
see the results and act, e.g. normal dosage of medicament is 10mg and computer
requests to give 1000mg (100 pills) or computer says "perform amputation of left
leg" but leg seems health, while other one has severe circulatory disorder.
