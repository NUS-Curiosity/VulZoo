Your "request" was examined. This is nothing more than a null pointer
deference, which cannot be easily exploited. However you should have a
look at the code below, it compiles with libssh 0.4.5. You need to
provide a valid login to the SSH server.

This vulnerability says long about the seriousness of this application.
I will probably find more in future if I find time to reverse it.
