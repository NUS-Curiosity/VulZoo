Like the Therac-25? "...it was involved with at least six accidents
between 1985 and 1987, in which patients were given massive overdoses
of radiation, approximately 100 times the intended dose... Three of
the six patients died as a direct consequence....." (
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25).

BTW, what is the difference in erratic behavior due to a software bug,
and erratic behavior due to an attacker?
