Subject: Windows Kerberos Authentication Bypass

OVERVIEW:
A vulnerability was found in all recent Windows operating systems. The
attack allows a malicious user to physically login on a target host in a
Kerberos-based network, under the assumption that he knows a valid user
principal and has the ability to manipulate network traffic. Our research
shows that all recent versions of the Microsoft Windows operating systems
are vulnerable to the attack.

AFFECTED SYSTEMS:
Windows XP Service Pack 2
Windows Vista Service Pack 1
Windows 7
(using a Windows Server 2008 Domain Controller)

INFO:
More detailed info, with whitepaper and proof-of-concept code can be found
