Subject: On the iPhone PDF and kernel exploit

For the first time in my life, a 0-day exploiting remote code execution,
sandbox escaping and privilege escalation has been packaged for general
user consumption via a web site ( http://jailbreakme.com ). The actual
pdf exploit can be downloaded here: http://jailbreakme.com/_/.

What puzzles me is.. no notices here on FD, no info on Bugtraq, no CVE,
no press release by the CERT, as of now.

The cat & mouse game played by the iPhone dev team and Apple is done to
liberate our devices from useless restrictions, but the whole point for
them to exist is because said devices live in a walled garden, that is
really useful only to the company behind it.

I've posted more thougths and the few technical details I was able to
gather (from a tweet!) here:

What do you think? Did someone reverse engineer the exploit?
