It's not the IT department's fault if the vendor ships a product that 
refuses to run with a patched system.

There have always been products out there that behave like this, it's a 
simple coding or policy mistake to make. The attraction is that they 
don't have to support any configuration that they haven't tested.

Unfortunately, products that do so are straying away from the herd and 
choosing not to participate in its collective defense. They are still 
subject to all the same published attacks, but cannot benefit from the 
standard update and patch cycle.

A secondary effect is that since it's so hard to predict the security of 
such a system over the long term, they simply can't be considered when 
developing general guidelines and best practices. For example, we might 
be discussing the schedule of disclosing a bug in the SQL vendor's 
product. If the SQL vendor can patch it easily for their primary 
customer base, those oddball downstream vendors are just not going to 
get much consideration. Eventually, they will probably tire of playing 
catch-up and adjust their policy.
