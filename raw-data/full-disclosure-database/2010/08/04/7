Subject: GMail complete anonymity possible via IPv6

If a user connects to an account using gmail.com in IPv6, the "last account activity" feature will say "Unknown" as the IP address.

Screenshot example:

All "Unknown" entries in the screenshot are IPv6 connections, using a gmail username no one else knows of (just a garbage account I made to test this out), with a secure password (hence I am positive that there were no connections made other than mine). Erased entries in the screenshot are IPv4 addresses that I manually censored.

2001:4860:b009::53 is the current IPv6 address for gmail.com. It's an AAAA record on the domain, but I am posting it here if Google goes the easy route and just deletes the DNS entry.

This should be a major security concern for Google and all Google/GMail users. With this bug, any user can connect to GMail using IPv6, access your account, and you will not be sure if it was an accidental IPv6 connection you did, or if someone had access to your account. If you casually use IPv6, you will be unable to tell if one of the "Unknown" connections were from your IPv6 range, or a remote intruder's.

Stay classy, Google.
