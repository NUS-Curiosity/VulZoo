Yep, but the attack surface was more wide open at the time: in the 1.x era
applications ran with root privileges (now they run under the "mobile" user)
and there was no sandboxing of user processes (no seatbelt :-).

In a nutshell, it was feasible to exploit a system configured that way with
any remote execution vulnerability, such as the TIFF[1][2] one.
