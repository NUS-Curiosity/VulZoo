This is all true, however Paul is also correct. In the real world
where you may not get to make the decision of what software
products to implement, mitigating controls for that exposure
must be put into place; whether they be firewalls, patches,
extensive logging, or etc.

It isn't the IT Department's fault that the product is garbage,
however it is the IT Department's fault if they don't control and isolate it.
The reality is that when you walk into a room one of your options
isn't always "clean house"..
