Subject: Re: so like i hrd python devz like mudkipz?

Someone told me my python bug was sent to FD. What kind of lulz is this?
I was waiting to read the messages that are not visible on the
website(I am not subscribed to this list) before I replied, but I gave
up waiting. spamtesterspamtester is not me.  Look I link to things on
irc and people read mailing lists, so sue me ?

IMHO people can read the bug report  at
http://bugs.python.org/issue9702 and make up their own damn minds.

Yes us 'kids', learning asm before we learn python are wrong ;) - it
must be something about jmp, call, load, set that breaks out fragile
minds.
