Subject: nonsense fun: 100 000 bit rsa key

nonsense fun: 100 000 bit rsa key

out of boredom i generated two 100K bit rsa key in about 30 hours on 1 core (i would be interested how long it will take generating it on openssl. a wild guess is *at least week* if not using sophie-germain primes, otherwise much longer).

the first key is with public exponent e=2^16-1, the second is with with 100Kbit e and d, the modulus is the same for both keys.

stats:
     sign   verify
key1  5min   <1sec
key2 48min   21min
(tested on patched openssl1.0.0a)

attached are two certs + the keys, openssl needs recompilation with increased limits.
