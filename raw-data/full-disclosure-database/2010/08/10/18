Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 08.10.10: Microsoft
 Word RTF File Parsing Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 08.10.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 10, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Word is a word processing application from Microsoft Office.
For more information about Microsoft Word, see the following website:
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/default.aspx

Rich-Text Format (RTF) is a document file format developed by Microsoft
for cross-platform document interchange.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Word could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code under the
privileges of the targeted user.

This vulnerability specifically exists in the handling of some drawing
object control words in an RTF document. Under certain circumstances,
Word will copy a property value into a heap buffer without checking the
length, which causes a heap buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the
affected host under the context of the user who opened the malicious
RTF document with Microsoft Word.

Exploitation might require that the user open a specially crafted RTF
document with a vulnerable application. The most likely exploitation
vector involves convincing a user to open an RTF document sent to the
user via e-mail or linked on a website.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Microsoft
Word 2003, Microsoft Word 2007, and Microsoft Outlook 2007. A full list
