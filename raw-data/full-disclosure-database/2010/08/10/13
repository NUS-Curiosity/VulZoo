Not a chance.  How would they even know they were medical devices until *after* 
they have successfully attacked them?

Most likely answer.  I know about some, but I'm not telling you.  Or anyone 
else for that matter.  :-)

Laughable.  Medical personnel wouldn't have a clue about whether their systems 
have been hacked.  Their IT staff *might*.

Very likely.

Beyond the realm of possibility.  Most medical instruments are controlled by 
old versions of easily hackable systems that cannot be patched or they lose 
accreditation.  In many cases they are not even allowed to run security 
software on them (antivirus, firewalls, etc.)

Government probably doesn't know about them.  When they do, they will pass a 
stupid law that will make them feel better and extract money from the victims 
but will not solve any problems.  Case in point: HIPAA.
