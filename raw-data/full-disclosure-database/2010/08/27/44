Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS XR Software Border Gateway
Protocol Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100827-bgp

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 August 27 2200 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IOS XR Software contains a vulnerability in the Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP) feature. The vulnerability manifests itself when a BGP
peer announces a prefix with a specific, valid but unrecognized
transitive attribute. On receipt of this prefix, the Cisco IOS XR
device will corrupt the attribute before sending it to the
neighboring devices. Neighboring devices that receive this corrupted
update may reset the BGP peering session.

Affected devices running Cisco IOS XR Software corrupt the
unrecognized attribute before sending to neighboring devices, but
neighboring devices may be running operating systems other than Cisco
IOS XR Software and may still reset the BGP peering session after
receiving the corrupted update. This is per standards defining the
operation of BGP.

Cisco developed a fix that addresses this vulnerability and will be
releasing free software maintenance upgrades (SMU) progressively
starting 28 August 2010. This advisory will be updated accordingly as
fixes become available.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100827-bgp.shtml

Affected Products
=================

This vulnerability affects all Cisco IOS XR Software devices
configured with BGP routing.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

To determine the Cisco IOS XR Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the 
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software by
displaying text similar to "Cisco IOS XR Software". The software
version is displayed after the text "Cisco IOS XR Software".

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The following Cisco products are confirmed not vulnerable:

  * Cisco IOS Software
  * Cisco IOS XR Software not configured for BGP routing

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR devices running affected
software versions and configured with the BGP routing feature.

The vulnerability manifests itself when a BGP peer announces a prefix
with a specific, valid but unrecognized transitive attribute. On
receipt of this prefix, the Cisco IOS XR device will corrupt the
attribute before sending it to the neighboring devices. Neighboring
devices that receive this corrupted update may reset the BGP peering
session.

Affected devices running Cisco IOS XR Software corrupt the
unrecognized attribute before sending to neighboring devices, but
neighboring devices may be running operating systems other than Cisco
IOS XR Software and may still reset the BGP peering session after
receiving the corrupted update. This is per RFC 4271 that defines the
operation of BGP.

After an affected device running Cisco IOS XR Software sends a
corrupted update, it will receive a notification from the neighboring
router and will create a log message like the following example:

    bgp[122]: %ROUTING-BGP-5-ADJCHANGE : neighbor 172.16.1.251 Down - BGP Notification received: update malformed

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCti62211 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
CVE-2010-3035.
