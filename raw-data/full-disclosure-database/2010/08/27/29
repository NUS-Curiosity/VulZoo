The point was that the *beta* UAC was prompting *all the frikking time*, and a
lot of stuff it wouldn't allow, prompt or no prompt, so you'd have to log out
entirely and log in as Administrator.  It made people say "Geez, if it's going
to be *this* painful, I may as well move to Ubuntu and get anally raped with
one species of cactus for free, rather than paying Microsoft for a different
species of cactus".

No, UAC did *not* make Windows act just like Linux. It just made it painful enough
that other alternatives started looking reeeeaaal good.
