I presume you are Dave B?


So this is a great example of why introductory programming courses in
college should teach C (or something similar) as a first language
rather than Java.  Kids these days don't understand what operating on
something by reference is and why you'd want to do that.

Also Dave, your example Python code in the bug report doesn't match
the scenario in the SSL socket wrapper bug.  The former tries to
isolate the differences in operating by reference or value and the
latter confusion comes about because the programmer didn't understand
the Python scoping rules.  (At least that's what I gather from the bug
report alone; didn't look at the rest of the code.)

I'm really not sure how any of this is security related.
