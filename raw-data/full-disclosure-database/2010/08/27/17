Subject: Re: Geolocation spoofing and other UI woes

Pavel, did you actually check out the PoC?

It actually invalidates your idea as well!

These UI issues remind me of how MSIE made the security UI work for
ActiveX, where you get a topbar as well, but clicking it would shown
up a popup instead of allowing the activex.
As far as my mind goes, one can't exploit this since there is the
concept of requiring at least two clicks; if the first one was
misinformed, the second one surely can't be, besides, showing yet
another overlay popup would (should?) invalidate/hide the previous
popup menu.

In reply to lcamtuf, the usability issues are crap, really. What is so
difficult in implementing a menu? The menu might have items saying
"don't ask again for this site" or "always allow for this site".

Cheers,
Chris.
