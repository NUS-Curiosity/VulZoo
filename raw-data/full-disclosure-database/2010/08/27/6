Or for that matter, test, which is actually an exe with the icon of a  
vcf.  Thus the problem with all this chortling about foolish

There may very well be a legitimate boundary cross from this DLL

indelible mark of a false boundary, in that no fix can be imagined  
that actually closes the vector.
