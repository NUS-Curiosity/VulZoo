Hehe.  You start with the beginnings of imagining a fix.  Here, you say 'the
desktop will be aware of when it is launching content safe for viewing, vs.
dangerous, and will behave differently'.  Eventually you realize:

1) You have to build this database
2) You have to maintain this database, even in the face of third party apps
adding handlers
3) You have to determine what the differential behavior is going to be on a
safe vs. unsafe type

And it's in the middle of 3) that you end up...well...where UAC ended up :)

Again, let me emphasize.  Really interesting vector, will probably end up
attached to an unambiguous flaw.  But right now, we're just seeing flaws
along the lines of "Double clicking an icon in Explorer might execute
arbitrary code".  It doesn't matter that that's true even if there's a
network share, or a USB stick.  That's what Explorer *does*.
