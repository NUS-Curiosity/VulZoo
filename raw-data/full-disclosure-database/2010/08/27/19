The mentality that "Our program only works with version 1.14 of the DLL so
we'll ship a copy of it in the directory" is too entrenched.  That's why you'll
see a box that has 4 or 5 different copies of the Java RTE on it.  Of course,
on a *sane* system you'd use a variable like LD_LIBRARY_PATH to say where to
find the libraries (and maybe apply some W^X exclusion to path components).
But there's just too many 3rd party packages that would have to be updated to
make it palatable.

Remember - Microsoft doesn't have any real committment to deliver a truly
secure system to you. It has a committment to deliver just enough security
and other features so it can deliver dollars to its shareholders.  We all *know*
what it would take to secure it - and it won't happen because the resulting
paradidm shits will torpedo sales.
