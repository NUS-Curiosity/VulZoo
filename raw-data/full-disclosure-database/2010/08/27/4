I thought that the point is that the victim does not invoke wab.exe
directly, but simply double-clicks on the innocent VCF file.

The attacker provides an innocent (and innocent-looking) VCF or similar
file, and places some DLLs in the same folder (or in some cases in a
lower-level folder). The unsafe application foolishly looks for its DLLs
in (or under) the current dir.
