Subject: Re: Geolocation spoofing and other UI woes

Pavel, did you actually check out the PoC?

It actually invalidates your idea as well!

These UI issues remind me of how MSIE made the security UI work for ActiveX,
where you get a topbar as well, but clicking it would shown up a popup
instead of allowing the activex.
As far as my mind goes, one can't exploit this since there is the concept of
requiring at least two clicks; if the first one was misinformed, the second
one surely can't be, besides, showing yet another overlay popup would
(should?) invalidate/hide the previous popup menu.

In reply to lcamtuf, the usability issues are crap, really. What is so
difficult in implementing a menu? The menu might have items saying "don't
ask again for this site" or "always allow for this site".

Cheers,
Chris.
