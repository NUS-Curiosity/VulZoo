The whole point is that launching wab.exe and opening a test file is relatively
innocuous - but if you can do that, you're basically holding the user's
testicles in one hand and a very sharp knife in the other. It *could* have been
anything - but we'll just do something mostly harmless just to be nice.

Feel free to rewrite it to do a format c:\ instead, and test on your box. Let
us know which variety of PoC you prefer...
