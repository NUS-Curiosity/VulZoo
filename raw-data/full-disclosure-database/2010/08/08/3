 of	concept

Your confusion, it seems to me, is common.  Generally XSS is
demonstrated as a simple alert box.  This PoC shows that JavaScript can
run.  The vulnerability is much deeper than an alert box, and goes to
the heart of why XSS is often not evaluated as a dangerous
vulnerability.  The PoC is harmless, but demonstrates that attackers
could inject much more damaging code than an alert box (Ref:
http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/apacheorg-hit-by-targeted-xss-attack-passwords-compromised/6123).


Arbitrary script injection allows the attacker to craft code that
executes client side with the domain of the origin site.  This bypasses
much of the same origin protections built into JavaScript.  Attackers
can also inject script that writes additional HTML to the page, such as
iframes that source malicious drive by download sites, Flash, Java
applets, or other plugin driven software that could compromise a host,
write HTML to obscure parts of the page, and make AJAX GET and POST
requests from the page to external sources.  The possibilities are
nearly limitless.  If there are XSRF vulnerabilities in the site,
arbitrary script could allow an attacker to leverage those as well,
doing things like changing administrative settings, adding new accounts,
changing privileges, etc.

So on the surface it looks like the PoC is just a lame pop-up box.
However, the pop-up box demonstrates that an attacker can actually
execute script limited only by their imagination.  Hope this helps.
