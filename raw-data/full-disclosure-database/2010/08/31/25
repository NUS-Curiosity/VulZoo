Only if your OS's security model understands the fact that executable code
and data belong in different security domains and thus different rules should
apply about what files to "trust" in each category.

(and yes, "interpreted data" like shell scripts and Java .class files and Flash
are the sort of neither-fish-nor-fowl that give security models headaches, so
don't bother flaming about that. ;)
