It's not that they can't. It's that they don't, and we have huge  
amounts of data confirming this. Have you never been to a Moxie  
Marlinspike talk?  His success rates on SSL Stripping a tor node were  
100%. 100%!!!

It's not about intelligence, it's about what you and I care about. For  
example, I don't care about how cars work. I want to put my key in the  
ignition and go.

There's only so much anyone really cares about. Outside of our little  
club here, people want the computer to just work.
