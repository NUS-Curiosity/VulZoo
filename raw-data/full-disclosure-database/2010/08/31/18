What?

I can differentiate my coolProposal.doc from msword.exe just fine..

If your statement is that the windows defaults should be changed,
including the "hide extensions" default, then I wholeheartedly agree
as I detailed in my first post. It's the first thing I turn off.

Many people who think the same way have considered that a
vulnerability in windows for years, I wouldn't consider it part of
the "DLL Hijacking" fiasco.

Cheers,
Charles
