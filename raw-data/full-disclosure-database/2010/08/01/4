Has one week been enough for you? :)

Obviously not serious enough to prevent their use by US Federal Bridge CA.

Governments and big companies *are* hierarchical and bureacratic and X.509
was developed for them.

Can't you? The world is full of unpatched systems. You can even find
systems where patches are not installed because it is running a piece of
mission critical software and they would lose support if they installed
any patches (I am not making this up).

This is a red herring. When you have got a bag of certificates, it is
trivial to pick the right certificate for every host and check it
automatically both before and after deployment. And everything else but
the bits (place where the cert is installed, services that need to be
restarted etc.) can stay identical.

Yes. And you can teach your users to check all server public keys
manually. You can also make a choice to send everything in cleartext and
set all passwords to "123456" because it will make your life much easier.

I do not say X.509 never fails, I question

There are various cases of epic fails related to electric bills but I
admit I have not found a clear example affecting IT infrastructure 
directly.

Replace interrupted power supply with expired domain registration and
you'll be able to find dozens of incidents, all of them affecting IT for
obvious reasons--and some of them involving big names like Microsoft and
Google.
