Subject: PAPER: Security Mitigations for Return-Oriented
	Programming Attacks


ABSTRACT

With the discovery of new exploit techniques, new protection mechanisms are 
needed as well. Mitigations like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) or ASLR 
(Address Space Layout Randomization) created a significantly more difficult 
environment for vulnerability exploitation. Attackers, however, have 
recently developed new exploitation methods which are capable of bypassing 
the operating system's security protection mechanisms. In this paper we 
present a short summary of novel and known mitigation techniques against 
return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. The techniques described in this 
article are related mostly to x86-32 processors and Microsoft Windows 
operating systems.
