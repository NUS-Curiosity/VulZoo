-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
IBM
Autonomy

-- Affected Products:
IBM Lotus Notes
Autonomy KeyView

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Notes Email Client. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must open a malicious email attachment.

The specific flaw exists within the Lotus Notes file viewer utilizing
the KeyView SDK to render a malformed Word document. The application
will copy an arbitrarily sized ASCII string representing the font name
into a constant sized buffer located on the stack. If large enough this
will lead to a buffer overflow and can lead to code execution under the
context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
IBM states:
Autonomy corrected the above issues in the patch releases of versions
10.10, 10.8, 10.4, 9.2, 7.4 of IDOL Keyview on February 28, 2010.
