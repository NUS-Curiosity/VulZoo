Or is it morbid curiosity (it motivated me as I've never gone above 15360)....

Crypto++ uses e=17.

You also might consider making the bit length a power of 2 to take
advantage of any available optimizations.

Shooting from the hip, it looks like you need a larger sample size
(assuming the weights of the second key's exponents are about equal).

Crypto++ RSA key generation stats (Core 2 Duo T6500 at 2.1 GHz with
plenty of memory. The EXE was built with -DNDEBUG and then strip'd.):

512 bit: 0.02 seconds
1024 bit: 0.02 seconds
2048 bit: 0.14 seconds
4096 bit: 0.81 seconds
8192 bit: 25.87 seconds
15360 bit: 4 minutes, 11.17 seconds
30720 bit: 43 minutes, 42.57 seconds
61440 bit: 11 hours, 21 minutes, 34.52 seconds
122880 bit: no dice

I'm not bitting on 100000 (its linear when plotted using logarithmic
scales). But it is impressive that you were able to generate two keys
in under 30 hours.
