Dear list,

Since Microsoft official fix is out, we published full details about
"ScriptResource.axd" vulnerability in framework 3.5 sp1 and above
which leads to arbitrary file disclosure in the virtual path.
In addition we have included also details about the "T" exploit
that can be used to circumvent initial Microsoft workaround.
