Subject: Re: Multiple vulnerabilities in WordPress 2 and 3

Hello MustStfu,

I want to warn you about a heavy inform security bug which is can be
found in of any linux distribution. also, one can if he has, then you
can exploit it on windows and mac os X.
For this type of attack, which i classify as a new bug category:
fapwhilereseach, you can log in with admin credentials and then delete
* /etc/passwd on linux and darwin
* \Windows\win.com
on win95 and above.
Also it is pissbile to change the wallpaper, remove NTLloader on XP
and other impotent files.

You can read everything on my site, where I announced this bug on
1971-02-29 and i have also you me in order to read, published there
and here on my site on another day.

All versions but the one mentioned not are vulnerable. but I warn you
- this can also be a problem with other systems.

I informed microsoft, but they did not respond :(
From now on they must face the consequenes, because I am not willing
to inform them about further bugs which i will be disclosing on next
day before this other day.

Have a nice different day.
