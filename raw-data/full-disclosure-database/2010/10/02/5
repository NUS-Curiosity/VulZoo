BrailleNote is unsafe on any network whose devices you are not in full charge of, and which (by NAT or firewall) does not protect BrailleNote from the Internet.

In a chance port scan of my entire network looking for interesting services and protocols that were not accounted for by visible configuration options in all my devices, I found this disaster staring me in the face on the least likely candidate of them all.  On the one hand, now I don't need ActiveStink in order to access my files, over the network, from my Mac.  I want these services running, for sure (maybe just FTP) but dammit, authentication first!  On the other hand, there is no doubt my trust in HumanWare is badly dented, as I was clearly optimistic that they would, and did, do the right thing and secure the device firmware before shipping it.  Anonymous FTP and telnet are obvious, easily found and effectively exploited.  If it isn't configurable, it shouldn't be enabled.  I am quite sure this was the case before now.  The most likely explanation is a build with a test configuration and services for development still in use on the newest model; t
he USB vendor string is further evidence of this.  Note to self: that popular expression about assumptions turns out to be true.

If "Bad guys" are on your network, the BrailleNote Apex is, alas, easy meat.
