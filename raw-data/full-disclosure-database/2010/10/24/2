Subject: Lexis search for "scada + hackers" 1996-2010 --
	544 citations

Hi List,

Below are the citations from the results of a Lexis-Nexis (Academic
Universe) search for keywords SCADA and HACKER going back to 1996.
For copyright reasons I cannot provide full documents, but you can go
to a college library, do the same search and pull the full-text.  I
was going to cull through the full-text and write a compendium of
quotations/warnings/call-to-action starting from 1996, but I've not
the bandwidth at the moment.  Perhaps someone else will.

Cheers,
