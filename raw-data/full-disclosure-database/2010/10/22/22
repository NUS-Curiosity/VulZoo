Hello Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting and Local File Inclusion 
vulnerabilities in W-Agora. In addition to vulnerabilities in this system 
which I found and disclosed in 2006 (SecurityVulns ID: 6960).

Vulnerable are W-Agora 4.2.1 and previous versions.

Local File Inclusion (WASC-31):

It's possible to include php-files (with extension php3 in version W-Agora 
4.1.5 or with extension php in version 4.2.1).

2010.08.29 - informed developers. Developers of W-Agora didn't answer and 
didn't fix the holes (unlike in 2006).
