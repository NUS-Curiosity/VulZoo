Subject: 10G virtual network traffic

Hello list.

 

I��m making a virtual network which has 10G traffic for testing 10G IDS
performance.

I use a Breaking point device. http://www.breakingpointsystems.com/cyber-
tomography-products/

Are there any tips or document about making 10G virtual network?

And what point is important?

How can I analysis without knowing real network traffic?

 

What is the different things? 1G network traffic VS 10G network traffic
