Subject: NIST Electronic Health Record Approved Test
	Procedures Version 1.0

Hi FD,

"The list below contains the Approved Test Procedures, Version 1.0,
for evaluating conformance of complete EHRs and/or EHR Modules to the
initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and
certification criteria defined in the Health Information Technology:
Initial Set of Standards, Implementation Specifications, and
Certification Criteria published on July 13, 2010." [1]

An example of testing under the "170.302.t Authentication" criteria [2]

<snip>

This test procedure consists of one section:
Verify authorizationâ€“ evaluates the capability to verify that a person
or entity seeking access to electronic health information is the one
claimed and is authorized
o The Tester creates a new user account and assigns permissions
o The Tester performs an action authorized by the assigned permissions
and verifies that the authorized activity was performed
o The Tester performs an action that is not authorized by the assigned
permissions and verifies that the action was not performed
o The Tester deletes (e.g., deactivates or disables) the user account
o The Tester attempts to login to the account and verifies that the
login attempt failed

</snip>

Fwiw, we'll likely need more work on these kinds of requirements if
testing is even going to begin to address issues such as, for example,
McKesson's use of hardcoded passwords. [3]

After all, a good chunk of the American Recovery and Investment Act of
2009 is going to towards health IT investments and incentives. [4]
