Hi Harry, et al.

I'm not going to personally insult you. But I have a rant.

War is war.

You vote for a hawk, you get a war.

You'd learn more from history. Philosophy. You'll find you're not this ground-breaking, secret-spiller. This is business as usual.

I understand you're an aclu, eff, pirate party, and/or whatever makes you as an apple-using, facebook-stalking teenager feel special, but please take that stuff somewhere else guys. This is not club penguin, cnn comment section or facebook. Security and attention whores like assange don't mix, you'll end up like that weev kid a few threads up.

Julian Assange is under investigation for molestation. Bradley Manning is a soldier with security clearance who swore and oath and broke it to give boring docs which would have been released under FOIA a few decades later anyway.

Don't support snake oil like wikileaks. http://cryptome.org/0002/wikileaks-unlike.htm

Thanks

Sorry to all of those who think this is "gossiping", but:

Wikileaks has been down for ca. 2 weeks now during which time the US has 
at least cut off their financial channels.
This during a period where WL has announced another major leak release 
this time re. Iraq.
What is also extremely disconcerting is the absolute silence of _all_ 
main street media to the topic (gag...?)

Now the latest tweet reads:
"WikiLeaks communications infrastructure is currently under attack. 
Project BO move to coms channel S. Activate Reston5."

Yet again I would like to pint out that there seems to be a concerted 
high power attack going on against WL
And yet again I would like to point out it would be
 interesting to know 
what is rally happening.
And yet again I'd like to emphasize that this indeed a security issue; 
it does concern netizens and citizens in general if major government 
organisations engage in what seems to be a dirty war against a 
whistleblowing organisation.

If anybody knows more, pls. do share insights...

     Harry
