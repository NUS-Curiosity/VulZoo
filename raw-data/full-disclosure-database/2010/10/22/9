Moreover.
1 unique media is giving factuals datas.
Others medias are dressing reality like lil girls play dolls.

The troops in dangers we're talking about
goes out in heavily armored apache helicopter, or Kombat-grade Light tanks
Then ( sometimes ) make strawberry milk-shakes with civilians, because one of them is handling
" what could be interprated as a weapon "

Guess, who's the most at risk, here?

Should we consider releasing war.logs, and thus speed up troops.withdrawal process, a mess?
I believe the opposite.
