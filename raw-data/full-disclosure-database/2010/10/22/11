not validate input and the _requiredFields.

Dear gentlemen,
 
All usual cross site scripts in theory could be applied to variables.
 
Within the paypal enterprise, please do make sure that any 'variable' in either 
Javascript, or Ruby , or any web language the 'input' is sanitised. Therefore , 
in the main xlick , business variable on paypal.com make sure the search string 
is sanitised.
 
Please read below for more details.
 
 
Any help , please do not to call me for more details :)
 
 
Thanks,
 
N.Y

Dear Sirs,
 
Further to our conversation, here are the details of the 'possible' 
vulnerability on your website. Although i have not carried further investigation 
on the bug, just by leading to the website through gooogle search and viewing 
the source legitimately, the accidental bug could be of great importance, as a 
user could masquerade to perform future phishing attacks, by a fooling a 
legitimately logged user from an other paypal site, within the enterprise..

Dear Sirs,
 
A vulnerability has been realised accidentally whilst casually browsing the 
website and through a search engine redirection of results to paypal bussiness 
UK. The  report has been made on the 02/07/2010
 
The security issue looks like an XSS scripting attack, whereby an attacker could 
execute an .xss script on the user, or either to redirect to a third party 
website, where an xss backdoor or either an xss cookie grabber could be 
installed. The attack could be further encoded to fool legitimate users of 
PayPal through a phishing attack, or either with the execution of illegal 
scripts on legitimate users. The script could also be potentially used for spam 
emailing, or for further access to other PayPal domains, if controlled.
 
the vulnerability occrus on an ASP form on the paypal UK website. 
 
Affected URL:  
https://www.paypal-business.co.uk:443/scripts/formmail.asp/?_recipients=jONOrbeton%40paypal%2Ecom%2C%20ahicks%40paypal%2Ecom&_subject=Business%20Hub%20Form%3A%20Sign%20up%20for%20Newsgroup&_requiredFields=1<script>alert("is
 this 
safe")</script>&_redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Epaypal-business%2Eco%2Euk%2Finformation-for-developers%2Ffrm_thankyou%2Ehtm&firstName=333-342-4533info@...pal.com&lastName=331-123-5674infol@...pal.com&emailAddress=331-542-2463infol@...pal.com&jobTitle=A%20St

 
Please do also note that  an <img src=.../../paypal.gif> onload, or either a 
redirection to a third party website pointing to an xss script could also be 
possible.
 
 
We did try to get in touch with you, although the IT department anounced a 
remedy for this bug. Please, do also let me know if possible to post this 
message to a vulndev according to your public disclaimer for security.
 
The bug is of a similar nature as , 
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Mar/488 

 
Thanks,
 
Nick.
