(If a bad guy is on your network, you're screwed anyway)

With those services closed, it doesn't take a five-second run of nmap and wget to ransack the owner's device, though.  And since network shares are mounted inside the filesystem, that's a double win for the poor sod who has his corporate shares in his stored network places.  No, it can't actually get worse than this.  I'm not even sure it's accidental.  I'm not taking chances.

Cheers,
Sabahattin
