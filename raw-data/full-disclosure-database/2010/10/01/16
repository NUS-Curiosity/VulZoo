>BrailleNote Apex offers telnet and FTP access on the standard ports, with
>read/write privilege on the entire file system, to all comers.  No
>authentication is required.  BrailleNote is unsafe on any network whose

>I am happy and sad.  In a chance port scan of my entire network looking for

>configuration options in all my devices, I found this disaster staring me in the
>face on the least likely candidate of them all.  On the one hand, now I don't
>need ActiveStink in order to access my files, over the network, from my Mac.
>I want these services running, for sure (maybe just FTP) but dammit,
>authentication first!  On the other hand, there is no doubt my trust in
>HumanWare is badly dented, as I was clearly optimistic that they would, and
>did, do the right thing and secure the device firmware before shipping it.
>Anonymous FTP and telnet are obvious, easily found and effectively
>exploited.  If it isn't configurable, it shouldn't be enabled.  I am quite sure this
>was the case before now.  The most likely explanation is a build with a test
>configuration and services for development still in use on the newest model;
>the  USB vendor string is further evidence of this.  Note to self: that popular
>expression about assumptions turns out to be true.
>
>KeySoft version 9.0.2 build 756, Windows CE 6.0, with telnet and FTP services.
>
>While we await an update that either disables the services or allows the user
>to specify the authentication credentials, do not use your BrailleNote Apex on
>any untrusted network, or if you are network administrator, temporarily
>prohibit these devices from connecting to your networks.  If "Bad guys" are on
>your network, the BrailleNote Apex is, alas, easy meat.
