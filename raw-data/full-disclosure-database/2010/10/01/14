ZDI-10-190: Novell iManager getMultiPartParameters Arbitrary File Upload Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-190
October 1, 2010

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Novell

-- Affected Products:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell iManager. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the nps.jar web application exposed via
the Tomcat server running by default on TCP ports 8080 and 8443. The
com.novell.nps.serviceProviders.PortalModuleInstallManager servlet
exposes a function called getMultiPartParameters which parses POST
variables from a multipart form request. The getEntry function that the
above uses can be made to write an arbitrary file to disk. An attacker
can abuse this to place a malicious JSP document in a web-accessible
location. By uploading a malicious script, this can be leveraged to
execute remote code under the context of the Tomcat process.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
