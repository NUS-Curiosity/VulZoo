*** ABOUT ******************************
THOTCON (pronounced \ˈthȯt\ and taken from THree - One - Two) is a small
venue hacking conference based in Chicago IL, USA. This is a non-profit,
non-commercial event looking to provide the best conference possible on
a very limited budget.

This is the 2nd year for THOTCON. Last year was a sold out event with 
world-class speakers and talks. The conference will again be held at a 
bar (for 10 hours). If the thought of speaking in front of smiling drunk 
hackers is terrifying, this con is not for you.

This year we'll be expanding the attendance to 300 and 10 talks.

*** WHEN / WHERE ***********************
The conference will be held in Chicago, IL USA on 04.22.11.

It will be held at a location only to be disclosed to attendees and
speakers during the week before the event. It WILL be in the City of
Chicago and close to a CTA train stop, accessible by bus, cab, and even
a rickshaw.

*** FORMAT *****************************
The event will be a single track.

There will be ten (10) 45 minute talks selected.

Topics we are interested in: retro computing, forensics, robotics,
physical security, 0days, application hacking, wireless, malware
development/research, hackerspaces, The Muppets, Penguins, zombies,
attack detection, the number 7, online game hacking, consumer device
hacking, beer, and bananas [foster].

*** SPEAKER PERKS **********************
Speakers will be given free admission to the conference as well as one
(1) free attendee badge (to bring a guest). In addition, speakers who
give their presentation as planned, will be given a THOTCON life-time
attendance badge. This means you will be given free entry to every
future THOTCON event for life.

You will also have access to the THOTCON VIP Lounge. This means you will
have access to free stuff and other highly discounted stuff all day. We
don't have anything else to give, except you can tell your mom and your
friends you spoke at the THOTCON.

*** HOW TO SUBMIT **********************
If you are interested in speaking at this event, please send your
completed speaker application <http://www.thotcon.org/cfp.html> to
cfp@...tcon.org.

Once we receive your submission, you will get an email back within 48-72
hours. If you do not hear back from us, please resend.

The CFP will close on 01.01.11 or when we feel we have 10 outstanding
talks. We anticipate having all speakers selected by 02.01.11.

Note: We will not accept CFP submissions as PDF attachments. No need to 
get fancy on us.

*** Sponsors ***************************

use your help. We are not looking for actual conference sponsors, but 
Saturday night (04.23.11), we're having a party for attendees and
speakers. We are looking for 5 sponsors at $1,000.00 USD each to cover
the cost of the party. Email sponsors@...tcon.org to become a sponsor.
