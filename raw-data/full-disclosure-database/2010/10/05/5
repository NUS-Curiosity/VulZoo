Thank you.  Here is the workaround for now.  Telnet into the device one last time and do:
services unregister ftpd
services unregister telnetd
softreset

That reboots the device without telnet or FTP.  A memory erase (4-5-6-reset or J-K-L-reset) restores the bad behaviour, but this shouldn't be a practical problem until the software is updated.

Cheers,
Sabahattin
