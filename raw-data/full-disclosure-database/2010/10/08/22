How well it protects who's liberties. Show me some factual information
on "where it saved anything for anyone." Or please explain to me and
perhaps the thousands of soldiers from ALL SORTS of countries in
Afghanistan, etc, how its protecting them by outing information with
regards to military operations. Give me a break, I've been there, done
that and to be honest, I grew up a while ago so spare the "give me
Wikileaks or give me death" speech. Wikileaks wasn't the first, nor will
it be the last.

1) Security regarding network and or computing related capabilities,
contexts, etc.... There is no purpose to the initial message and or thread
2) Security regarding "wikileaks" defending against ANYTHING other than
someone's own pockets... Is also irrelevant.

Perception and reality are two different equations to any interpretation
of "fact/story/etc." while you and others like you believe "Wikileaks! -
Defender of Justice" I see "Wikiwhore - Take the money and run"

Again, been there done that when I ran, Politrix way before wikileaks
became a site, been there done that with JYA/Cryptome, been there done
that with J Orlin Grabbe (RIP) and the list goes on. Spare me and the
list the dramatics.
