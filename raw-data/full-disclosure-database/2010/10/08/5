Hi Ryan,

No inline comments. Sorry (I wanted to reorder topics).

This is an alarming trend in open source software, and diametrically
opposed to the claims of "more eyes equates to more secure"", "open
source software is more secure", and "open source software fixes bugs
faster than other software models".

Is also blows away the theory of "Darwinian Software Evolution": good,
robust, secure software thrives and lesser software dies. Filezilla
and the Python example below are "proofs by counter example". It
appears the model in use is greatly influenced by popularity, which
makes it more appropriate for politicians (who tend to lie for a
living) ;)

That should earn the project a Pwnie Award nomination for lamest
vendor response (http://pwnies.com/).

Agreed.

Other recent similar examples of this sort of response by open source
projects include "Python ssl handling could be better...", where the
Python Standard Library did not (still does not?) verify the hostname
in the certificate with CN or SubAlt name
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Sep/381). The python bug was
filed in 2007 (http://bugs.python.org/issue1589).

There have been quite a few bug and features requests filed, and they all get closed or rejected within a week or so. I also posted something in the developer forum inquiring about this, and received this response:

This is particularly dangerous in multi-user environments with local profiles, because as we all know physical access to a computer means it's elementary at best to acquire information off it. Permissions only work if your operating system chooses to respect them, not to mention how simple it is *even today* to maliciously get around windows networks using pass-the-hash along with network token manipulation techniques.

This really concerns me because a number of my coworkers and friends were un-aware of this behavior, and I didn't even know about it until I'd been using it for a year or so. All I really want to see is at the very least just some warning that Filezilla does this.

Similarly, the fact that there are others (pidgin) who indulge in the same faulty reasoning does not make the reasoning any more sound." ~btrower
