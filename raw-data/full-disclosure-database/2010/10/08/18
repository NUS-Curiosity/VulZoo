There have been quite a few bug and features requests filed, and they all get closed or rejected within a week or so. I also posted something in the developer forum inquiring about this, and received this response:

This is particularly dangerous in multi-user environments with local profiles, because as we all know physical access to a computer means it's elementary at best to acquire information off it. Permissions only work if your operating system chooses to respect them, not to mention how simple it is *even today* to maliciously get around windows networks using pass-the-hash along with network token manipulation techniques.

I reported a similar issue in a certain SSH client a few years ago, it
was keeping the passphrase as cleartext in memory
for the duration of the session as well as an arbitrarily long period
after you disconnect but keep the window open.

They added protections like a simple encoding for the credentials
where they are stored, and nulling out the region
when you ended the session. They still wanted to keep the credentials
intact during the session in order to quickly
create new terminal windows.

This issue was much less serious than storing the cleartext in a file,
and they thought it appropriate to add protections.

It IS an issue. Plain and simple.

That type of developer response really gets me.

Personally I won't be allowing Filezilla on any of my systems even if
they do eventually patch this issue..
who knows what else is lurking behind the scenes?

Cheers,
Charles
