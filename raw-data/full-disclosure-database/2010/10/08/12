Subject: Re: WikiLeaks

  Sorry but I find the whole subject incredibly boring, as do quite a 
few other people (again, each to their own).

Because, when it comes down to it, breaches happen all the time, and 
cryptome/wikileaks is no different. It's really is *just another 
website*, despite what it is used for and despite the publicity 
surrounding them. This is no different to someone posting a link on here 
to a defaced popular site. I mean, come on.

I understand why everyone *thinks* they are important and must be 
gossiped about, but I don't agree with it in the slightest. (imo)
