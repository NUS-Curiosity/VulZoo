Oh please. The world does not stop for Wikileaks going down in fact, I
guarantee you that in over 90% of the places you will visit this week,
no one will know or even care that Wikileaks is down.

"Security issue of international proportions" my ass. Life goes on,
people go on, no government, agency, official, business nor individual
stopped functioning, living, breathing because Wikileaks went down.

Reality is, outside of a "very small segment" of individuals, no one
cares to be quite frank. To prove this point, ask the next 10 people you
say: "Do you know Wikileaks is down!?" and study their response. Wanna
bet 99% will respond something similar to one of the following:

"So?"
"What's Wikileaks?"
"Why would Wikipedia be down?"
"Who cares"
"What do they do?"
"Why should I care"
"And this has what to do with me?"
