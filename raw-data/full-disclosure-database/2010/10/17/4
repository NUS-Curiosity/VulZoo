Subject: Re: XSS in Oracle default fcgi-bin/echo

Hi Paul,

The mere mention of fcgi-bin/echo in your first mail is enough for anybody
to derive the PoC. Here's what I found in under a minute:
*/fcgi-bin/echo/<script>aler('xss')</script>*

Anybody with a days work in Web Application security would be able to figure
this out knowing the vulnerable script.

Just my two cents.

Regards,
Riyaz Walikar
