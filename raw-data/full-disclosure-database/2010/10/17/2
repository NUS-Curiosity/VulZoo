Subject: xss in blackboard 8

I don't have access to many blackboard systems but I can confirm that
in Blackboard Learning System version 8  (8.0.375.0) and Blackboard
Learning System - CE Enterprise License (Release CE 8.0.4)  that
CVE-2006-4308 was not actually fixed.

Any user with access to forums, assignment submission(comments /
submission)  which allows for html input is open to xss and open
redirect.
Blackboard does filter the <script> tag (and use of other tags) but
you can use <meta>(refresh) and the following xss example *should*
work.

<input type="text" AUTOFOCUS onfocus=alert(1)>

I do not have access to a blackboard 9 system, but I suspect this will
not work as the interface has been redone from the screen-shots I have
seen.
