*facepalm*

<rant>

The only sensible restriction for LD_* environment variables (as well as
many other env. vars.) when a setuid or setgid program is executed is to
erase all traces of them at the first opportunity.

Those two or three guys who might ever need to execute a set*id program
with LD_PRELOAD or LD_AUDIT or whatever in order to do something other
than exploit a vulnerability are free to rebuild Glibc with
-DI_WANT_TO_PLAY_RUSSIAN_ROULETTE. Or perhaps it can be controlled by
a configuration file in /etc. But it is pretty silly to enable it for 
everyone and trade convenience for a very small minority of users
for extra risk for ALL users.

(To be honest, I would go as far as to propose to erase ANY environment
variable upon the execution of set*id program. At least unless it is
allowed EXPLICITLY.)
