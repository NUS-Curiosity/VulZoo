-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Informix Dynamic Server. Authentication
is required in that an attacker must have valid credentials to connect
to the database.

The specific flaw exists within the oninit.exe process bound by default
to TCP port 9088 or 1526. A lack of sanity checking within a logging
function can result in a stack based buffer overflow leading to
arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.
