-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Informix Database Server. SQL query
execution privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists when processing the arguments to the DBINFO
keyword in a SQL query. User-supplied data is copied into a stack-based
buffer without proper bounds checking resulting in an exploitable
overflow. Exploitation can result in arbitrary code execution under the
context of the database server.
