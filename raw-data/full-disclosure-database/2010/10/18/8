Subject: How Visual Studio Makes Your Applications
	Vulnerable to Binary Planting

Microsoft Visual Studio makes it possible to develop a binary planting-positive
(i.e., vulnerable) application without you having to write a single line of code.
Every MFC application seems to be automatically made vulnerable, with those
statically linking MFC libraries actually having the vulnerable code integrated in
their executables, making it harder to deploy patches to users.
