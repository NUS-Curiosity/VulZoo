Subject: .net framework 4 installation on XP temporarly
	stop firewall

Hello,

With a ghost image of my XP SP3 FR 100% patched from january 2010:

If i decide to install ".NET Framework 4" from optional windows-update,
the internal XP  firewall is stopped during 30 seconds at every reboot
:-( 

If i uninstall the KB982671, i have not this problem.

why dev tools manages the firewall ? i can reproduce this abnormal
behaviour when i want.

Hope it is not off-topic here ^^
