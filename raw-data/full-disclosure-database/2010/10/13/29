If the encryption key stays on the same PC, there is absolutely no security
in that. Given that this is open source, security through obscurity can't
even start working (-> encrypting local files with a local key / using
custom algo == security through obscurity).

I think it ought to stay plaintext and people limit access to this file
whenever possible.
It's hardly a trivial matter to delete this file....if an attacker can
search for and read this file, a user could search for the same file and
delete it.

Fortunately, for the poor souls out there that allow read access to their
drives, computer forensics haven't caught up yet (and probably won't in the
near future).

My 2 cents.

Chris.
