Subject: Re: Filezilla's silent caching of user's
 credentials

What do you mean by that? There have been a *lot* of good points made through this whole thing, both on the list, and in the forums. 

This is a multi-tiered issue, both in the fact that it stores your credentials, and the fact that it does so in a very insecure manner. 

As with any program there are scenarios in which you're forced to log into secured resources in a 'less-than-secure' way. Maybe someone is middling your connection? Maybe someone has a metasploit dll agent hiding in your filezilla.exe process sniffing for keystrokes? It happens, thanks to windows' plethora of 'features'. 

However with the right measures it can be tougher to leverage. Everything is psudo security by obscurity in one way or another when you think about it. Imagine encryption as a needle in a haystack, but instead of a needle you're looking for a single atom, and instead of a haystack you're looking at every single atom on the face of the planet (please correct me if I'm mistaken in this point. I am by no means a crypto expert). 

The only way to be really secure is run FreeBSD on a computer not plugged into any network and uses absolutely nothing external (usb drives, etc). Then it becomes a trade-off in usefulness. Also what happens when someone discovers a 0-day in BSD?

Security is a constant up-hill battle, which is why I find it so interesting. Very smart people are *always* coming up with more creative ways to manipulate systems of *any* kind. All you can do is learn as much as you can about how they're doing it, and come up with any mitigations you can.

Finally, a note of sanity in this thread.

The issue is that someone gained access to that file. You sharing your 
drives over the internet with read privileges? You have other 
vulnerable software being leveraged to read that file? Would you prefer 
they MD5'd it? It sounds like your issue is that your password is 
stored. I mean, they moved your encrypted password from passwd to 
shadow for a reason, but that doesn't change the fact that it's stored 
and if someone doesn't need access to shadow or passwd, they shouldn't 
have it. 

Stop logging into your FTP server from a public terminal with Filezilla.
