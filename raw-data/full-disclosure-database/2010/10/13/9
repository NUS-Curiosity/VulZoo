Subject: Windows Credentials Editor v1.0

Windows Credentials Editor v1.0

Supports Windows XP, 2003, Vista, 7 and 2008 (Vista was not actually
tested yet, but it should work).

Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) allows to list logon sessions and add,
change, list and delete associated credentials (ex.: LM/NT hashes). This
can be used, for example, to perform pass-the-hash on Windows and also
obtain NT/LM hashes from memory (from interactive logons, services,
remote desktop connections, etc.) which can be used in further attacks.

You can find it here:

Thanks!,
Hernan
