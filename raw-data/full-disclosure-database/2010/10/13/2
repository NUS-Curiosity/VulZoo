Subject: Internet Exploiter 12 - Oracle Java COM object
 docbase property buffer overflow.

Goedemiddag,

Oracle has released a patch for a vulnerability in Java 6 that I reported to
them. If you like to know more, you can read about it here:
*
http://skypher.com/index.php/2010/10/13/issue-2-oracle-java-object-launchjnlp-docbase/
*

(Note that this issue was found independently by Stephen Fewer of Harmony
Security and reported to Oracle through ZDI)

As I mentioned on twitter <http://twitter.com/berendjanwever>, I finally
managed to created a <512 byte exploit for MSIE, something I had been
wanting to do ever since Internet Exploiter 0. Besides this very small
exploit that targets this issue, I also created a much more elaborate
exploit that uses ret-into-libc to bypass DEP. This second version of the
exploit showcases some advances in heap spraying and ret-into-libc attack
implementation and may be of interest to you if you care about such things.
I have attached both exploits to this email, but they can also be found in
the my issue tracker <http://code.google.com/p/skylined/issues/detail?id=23>
.

Cheers,
SkyLined
