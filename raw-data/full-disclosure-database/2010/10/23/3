I was trying hard to not respond to this thread.  I am not condoning
or condemning wikileaks however the above statement sort of misses the
point of wikileaks.  the mass media does what you have suggested and
look how well that works.  wikileaks rightly or wrongly (and possibly
unsuccessfully) tries to overcome these issues by presenting the raw
information so people can make there own mind up.
