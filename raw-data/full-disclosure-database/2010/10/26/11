Subject: [Full-disclosure] looking for enterprise AV solution
















Folks,

We
are looking an enterprise level AV-software to replace our current AVG having
in our eyes poor detection and removal capability. Reviews bring really mixed
results as “nothin’s perfect”. Access to logs and relible management
control features are important as well. Any advising?

Thank
you
