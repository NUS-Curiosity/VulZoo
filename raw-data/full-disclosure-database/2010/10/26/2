Subject: Identifying handler and agency of police
	informant?


 

 Hi,

For the past few years I have been having my friends turned into informants against me by an unknown investigator/group of investigators.

Being able to identify their handler and agency would make life simpler. They've been being heavy handed, stealthy, lost friends have been threatened and told not to talk to me, I'm satan, I'm a horrible person, etc.

If you have any brainstorming ideas. I already know the legally safe option is distance obviously, but any other creative advice is welcomed. Must be lawful, low-risk, virtuous. Deception or a ruse to ascertain this information is ok, after all they're spying.

Current informant is contacting me via internet.

tks
