Subject: 0-day "vulnerability"

Sorry to rant, but I have seen this term used once too many times to
sit idly by. And used today by what I once thought was a respectable
infosec publication (that will remain nameless) while referring to the
current Firefox vulnerability (that did, by the way, once have a 0-day
sploit)  Also, by definition, a 0-day no longer exists the moment it
is announced ;)

For once and for all: There is no such thing as a "zero-day
vulnerability" (quoted), only a 0-day exploit...
