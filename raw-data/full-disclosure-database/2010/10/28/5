	rockin' beats"

Good news everyone!
nSense is releasing a tool which instruments executables during
runtime in order to extract code coverage data. This is done through
runtracing using runtime instrumentation.

Why?
Analyzing code coverage of large or self modifying executables with
various input files is a non-trivial task. This may result in the
analyst having several hundred thousand blocks of code and no
reasonable way of setting soft breakpoints on all of it
simultaneously.

The tool is written in Python and is released under the Beerware license[1].

This tool release celebrates the t2'10 infosec conference, starting
08:30 @ 2010-10-28 EEST

If interested, you can find Blocks from nsense.fi / nsense.dk -> 31337 -> Tools

Kindest regards,
nSense Vulnerability Research
