Subject: Re: 0-day "vulnerability"

I would further define it as "code that can be run on a machine remotely without any human interaction."   What I think would be ultimately effective is if researches and those who make disclosure announcements quit trying to make their discoveries or processes "cool" and just stick to the facts.  Vendors want to downplay vulnerabilities, disclosures want it to sound as bad as it can be.  That's why we have people describing a user following a link in an email to download something from their site to be subsequently executed as "Remote Code Execution" that is "Moderately Critical" as if there are actually varying degrees of "Critical."  

The same holds true for quantifying "likelihood of exploitation" as "high" based on what researchers call "extremely common deployment environments in many businesses" when they are actually inferring what they THINK is common based on what two of their 5-10 workstation clients are doing  with XP peer-to-peer configurations.  

I think that the only people really paying any attention to this are other researchers, who basically ignore what other people call something - this doesn't really benefit the "user."  People want the "vulnerability" they "discover" to be awesome and cool and critical because it substantiates their egos.  For now, preceding anything with "0-day" is a way of invoking fear and urgency as if it represents some immanent disaster, but soon people will become desensitized to that as well.
