Subject: Breaking The SetDllDirectory Protection Against
	Binary Planting


An old unfixed Windows functional bug was just upgraded to a security bug. Our
researchers have discovered that Windows' inability to consistently expand
environment variables in user and system PATH breaks the binary planting protection
provided by the SetDllDirectory function. The article describes how already fixed
iTunes and Safari - both using SetDllDirectory - can again be successfully
binary-planted due to this bug. This time it's not Apple's fault.
