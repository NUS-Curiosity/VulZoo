Description:
    In previous versions of automake, when producing a distribution
    tarball for a package that uses Automake, insecure permissions
    were assigned to directories in the build tree, which introduces
    a race condition that allows local users to modify the contents of
    package files before the build is complete.  This has been fixed.
