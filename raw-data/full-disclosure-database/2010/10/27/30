-- CVE ID:
CVE 2010-0112

10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL into
the packaged database on vulnerable installations of Symantec IM
Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the Administrative interface installed
with IM Manager. While there is authentication on the main page of the
installed IIS extension, many of the pages can be accessed directly. One
of these pages, IMAdminReportTrendFormRun.asp, is vulnerable to a SQL
injection vulnerability. The ASP code lacks sanity checks on the
'groupList' parameter. Thus, an attacker can abuse this to inject
arbitrary SQL into the backend database.

-- Vendor Response:
Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
