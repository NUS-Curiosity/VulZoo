-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Symantec IM Manager. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the rdpageimlogic.aspx and rdPage.aspx
pages which is exposed through an IIS extension on the default web
server port. By setting the 'rdReport' argument to the value
'LoggedInUsers' an attacker can force the server to load the
LoggedInUSers.lgx definition file. This file contains multiple SQL
injections within the following parameters: 'loginTimeStamp', 'dbo',
'dateDiffParam' and 'whereClause'. An attacker can abuse this to inject
arbitrary SQL statements to be evaluated by the back-end database.

-- Vendor Response:
Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
