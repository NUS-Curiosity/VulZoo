If you've got a decent perimeter, it should keep the threats out for
some time, but I tend to agree. AV these days is starting to be more
about detection than prevention - it will at least highlight that you
have a problem so you can deal with it. Think of it as part of your
intrusion detection if it helps.

Oh, and somewhere I used to work ran two separate AV products on the
mail gateway, and then a third on desktops on servers. I suspect this
was more about licensing models (couldn't do per-seat for email as we
had >100k email addresses) than paranoia, but it did help out
considerably to have independent engines.

cheers,
 Jamie
