Loosely speaking a hack could be defined as using a system for
something against its original intention/purpose (e.g SQLi is a hack,
because the search function (or whatever) was not intended to allow
the user drop databases/give away passwords etc). A breach can be
defined as a leak of information to an unauthorized third party.

In this case it can be considered a breach because the system is
acting as intended (i.e. letting the admin login and maintain the
system), however it has been compromised because the admin's username
& pwd have been leaked, thus breaching the system. Now where it gets
really tricky is if he used social engineering to get the password,
some would consider that a hack, others a breach, really they both
amount to the same thing.
