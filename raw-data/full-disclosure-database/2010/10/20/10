The Host: header trick was also used back in 2008 in Billy Rios' GIFAR
attack -- to get around the fact that Picasa hosts images on a separate
domain:

http://xs-sniper.com/blog/2008/12/17/sun-fixes-gifars/

The blog post title was "SUN Fixes GIFARs", although it's not immediately
obvious to me what was changed or fixed.

If anyone knows what was changed back then and/or in this latest release, it
would be interesting to see it documented.


Cheers
Chris
