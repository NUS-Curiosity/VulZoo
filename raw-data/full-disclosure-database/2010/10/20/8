Eh, you can see where it came from though. Design bugs like this are absolutely miserable to fix (see how we'll never get rebinding out of the browser) and letting identical IP's script against eachother lets an awful lot of legitimate traffic through while blocking almost all attacks.

I'm not saying it's a preferred design, but let's reserve "horrible" for things that don't have quite the obvious thought process behind them.

Is this, in fact, gone now?
