Subject: Re: Joomla 1.5.21 | Potential SQL Injection Flaws

P.S.  You don't sanitize input on your "Subscribe for Updates" post before sending it to Feedburner.   You know, the one located in "http://yehg.net/lab/#home" across from your "XSS attack demo on Joomla!" log update.  
It's trivial to generate "Trouble at the mill! FeedBurner encountered some kind of error performing the task or displaying the page you requested. Fear not, this event has notified the appropriate people within FeedBurner and we will have this all ironed out soon."

I'm  sure there are people on the list here that can help you with that.

According to your site, you want "to entice young Burmese people into ethical hacking" and "raise students' interest in security/hacking in an ethical manner," yet you "disclosed these flaws in order for someone who can exploit these flaws to the next maximum level"? 

Douche.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Joomla 1.5.21 | Potential SQL Injection Flaws

1. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION


Potential SQL Injection Flaws were detected Joomla! CMS version 1.5.20. These flaws were reported along with our Cross Scripting Flaw which was fixed in 1.5.21. Developers believed that our reported SQL Injection flaws are not fully exploitable because of Joomla! built-in string filters and were not fixed in 1.5.21 which is currently the latest version.

As a result, we disclosed these flawsÂ  in order for someone who can exploit these flaws to the next maximum level.
