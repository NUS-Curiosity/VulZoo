Hi Brent,

I'm doing good too, thanks.

Sorry for the delay. You own a multi-million dollar hosting business and your mail hit my spam box.

Making Good Money With HostGator. 2010-10-30.

Let's say these "sponsored conversations" mentioned are not created by your management or company and all in fact affiliates: Just because they are affiliates doesn't make you less culpable for the noise your business causes. You are allowing the net with garbage and puff pieces posing as authentic reviews of your business.

You run a hub for affiliate link spam. Your business is a call center filled with monkeys paid at minimum wage where you cram clients into ungodly spaces on ancient web 1.0 software.

How is this different from spamming porn or viagra? The only difference is it's crappy hosting.

You haven't denied your online advertising budget on Google not being 7figs. While mentioning affiliates, you did not deny you didn't market yourself, only the denied the subjective term Google bombing. I am not "quickly seeing" you're not google bombing.

You're not the only company guilty of this, you're right that the other garbage web hosts like 1and1, bluehost and etc. play similar games. Look, McDonalds gets clients, Walmart gets clients, but they rely on cost, product and dependability, while your type is cram n' cruft.

I am working on a new exposé on a "penny auction site" scheme that uses similar marketing techniques called quibids (and their copycats). Will expose mass-sock puppetry and of course fraud. Should be ready next week.
