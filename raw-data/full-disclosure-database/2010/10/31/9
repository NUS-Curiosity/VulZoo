Hm, I'm new to this list. so I find this a bit strange.

Christian, Vladis, are you the same person?
what are your motives?
do you really believe the things you are saying? 
you seem to be just generally negative, jumping from point to point and being very silly.

"Just signing the update packages prevents this attack, so it's not that hard to fix."

there is a REAL attack vector that needs to be fixed, and you are saying that it shouldn't be fixed as every 
line of code creates a POTENTIAL attack vector?

a signing key might be stolen, so we shouldn't use it?
do you use passwords chris? why? they might be stolen?
you can't possibly believe that?

code-signing infrastructure? ofcourse, code for those things is well known, packed in libraries, 
and trivial to use. ofcourse. and...
and bla.
I could go on, but probbably the whole list is aware of those things.

I'm wondering what's going on?
are you payed list-posters from an evil rival company? this is the only idea I have.
