Amen to that.

A more subtle issue is the tradeoff issue:  Any time they have a code engineer
spending time building and feeding that code-signing infrastructure is time that
code engineer *isn't* spending writing actual new features the users *want*.

Which user-requested feature are you going to heave over the side in order to
do code-signing instead?  That question has to enter into the calculus as well.
