Valdis,

I've read all of your postings on this thread and I just don't buy
what you're saying.

Having a signing key that is poorly protected at the vendor's offices
is still better than not signing any updates.

It *really* doesn't take that much effort to enforce SSL/TLS
certificate verification in the automated update process.  You don't
need to do anything special with "code signing".  Just check for
updates via HTTPS URLs and require that verification checks out.
