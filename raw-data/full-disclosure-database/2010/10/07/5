Subject: Ebay and HTML/JS/PDF/FLash includes

hi there,
does someone can tell me why ebay allows html/javasciprt/pdf/flash - includes
on their pages via OBJECT - tags?

http://members.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewUserPage&userid=shakyoneill

i had some issues last year with malicious memberpages, spreading
exploits'n'stuff,
and emailed them about this, but they just removed the pages, not the cause.


regards,
tanja
