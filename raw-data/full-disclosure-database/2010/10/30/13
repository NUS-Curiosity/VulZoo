Yeah, and C) I can take a rubber hose and choke you with it until you give
me the admin password.  That C works does not obviate A or B.

There are...side effects to C.

What you're not understanding is that many autoupdaters operate with zero
user interaction.  There is something to be said about silent ownage, simply
because you connected to a network.

Also, note that Evilgrade has been out for several years, and there are
still (many) vulnerable endpoints. This is the reality of design bugs --
they can survive the light of day, because they're such a miserable pain to
fix.
