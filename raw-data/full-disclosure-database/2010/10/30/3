And do what differently, exactly?

OK, so it's *possible* to fake out the iTunes update process.  But which is easier
and more productive:

A) Laying in wait for some random to think "Wow, I should update iTunes" and
hijack the process.

B) Send out a few hundred thousand spam with a 'From:update@...le-itunes-support.com'
with a link to a site you control and feed the the sheep some malware.

Evilgrade looks like a nice tool to have if you're doing a pen test or a
targeted attack and can somehow get the victim to do an update (possibly social
engineering), but for any software vendor feeding software updates to Joe
Sixpack this threat model is *so* far down the list it isn't funny.  Simply
compare the number of boxes pwned by (A) and (B) - how many people have gotten
pwned because somebody hijacked their update from Symantec or wherever,
compared to the number pwned because they got a popup that said "Your computer
is infected, click here to fix it"?

Remember - just because a new tool useful for an attacker shows up, does *not*
mean it's a game changer for the industry at large.
