I have reviewed the former communications, and must state that I was
mistaken in that your emails were in fact addressed to the
SquirrelMail team via our security address.  My apologies for that.

However, as I stated early on to you, "Daniel and I will be working to
get the code up to date and release it as soon as possible."  I did/do
not believe you needed to be part of discussions that did not regard
the issue you reported.  At the time you last asked if the plugin
could be published, I was already waiting for Daniel to respond
regarding the changes I asked him to make.  I could have replied to
you that as far as I knew, we were still waiting, but your overly
impatient emails were quite insensitive toward we overworked and
unpaid FOSS developers, to which, for sanity's sake, an appropriate
response is none at all.  It's too bad Daniel wasn't able to reply,
either, but perhaps he had the same reaction.

Petty details and timelines aside, the point that IS relevant for
public consumption is that, after you waited four months and decided
that you'd unilaterally publish your report, you didn't bother to
contact the plugin author nor the SquirrelMail team AT ALL.  This is
inexcusable, and, having worked with other over-anxious reporters in
the past, I believe this is something others out there should learn
from.

I'm sorry if a public lashing doesn't seem like the nicest way to
handle such matters, and I do hope it does not cause resentment or any
other regretful emotion, but I think discussion of a proper and
considerate reporting process (which I sincerely believe should be
different when dealing with FOSS software, since many of us aren't
paid to do it full time) is quite relevant.
