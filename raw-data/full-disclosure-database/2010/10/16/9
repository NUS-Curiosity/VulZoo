Subject: Re: All the md5 hashes in every single update
 message sent to this list

Because you have a separate "out-of-band" communication from the publisher containing the hashes.  Anyone hosting the files somewhere could have altered the patch and then generated their own MD5 hash and "signed" it themselves and provided that on their site.  It's just another layer of authentication.  

Best thing to do is just ignore it if you don't agree with the practice as you can't control how or why a developer chooses to publish patch details.
