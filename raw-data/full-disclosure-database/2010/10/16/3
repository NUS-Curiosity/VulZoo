 message sent to this list

They do this so that people who are manually installing or updating software
can also verify that the package they are installing is, in fact, the exact
same one that the software packager released -- this reduces (but not
eliminates) the chance that someone malicious may have been able to slip
something into the update package unnoticed by the installer or the
packager.
