Subject: Re: All the md5 hashes in every single update
 message sent to this list

What is the advantage of having all the hashes posted to the list over
doing something like having a digitally signed text file next to the
update on their servers and occasionally publish the pubkey to the list? I
feel like that would provide the same level of confidence the package was
unaltered as just reading the hashes from the list.
