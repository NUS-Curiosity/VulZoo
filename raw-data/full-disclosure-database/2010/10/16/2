Subject: All the md5 hashes in every single update message
	sent to this list

What is the purpose of all the patch notification emails that when a security vulnerability is fixed the people who send out the notification email include a 5 mile long list of md5 hashes for every single package and all dependancies for the package that was updated? I feel that information does not need to be in the notification that the latest version fixed a security vulnerability, and to me it just gets in the way of reading the occasionally useful content this list has to offer.
