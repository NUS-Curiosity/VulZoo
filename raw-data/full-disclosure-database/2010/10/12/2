Subject: Cryptome and Kryogeniks - Obstruction of Justice
	/ Evidence destruction


 

 Anyone else getting nice lulz out of the kryogeniks - john young drama?

How much trouble are these script kiddies in? They don't sound very intelligent.

They picked a wrong target when they picked on Mr. Young - who is basically the last person you would want to hack.

I'm honestly expecting this personal vigilante case w/ Young and Kryogeniks to escalate into raids and arrests (Kryogeniks on their website posted they were destroying HD's, obstruction of justice).

When people lulz up like that or just commit crimes I love to use webcitation to snapshot the proof so officials can use them for easy pickings.

Enjoy

The theory is everyone is held accountable to the law, if you were suspected of breaking the law or knew someone who does you would be harassed and investigated. When someone else breaks the law and isn't held to the same standard, it is personally crossing you. The laws are rendered useless if you don't report.

Can't wait to have john young drop the rest of the docs on these criminals. It'll be sweet justice to people who just don't care about the rules and honestly come off like a bunch of trash.
