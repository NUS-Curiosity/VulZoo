ZDI-10-207: Oracle Java ActiveX Plugin Uninitialized Window Handle Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-207
October 12, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3555

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

-- Affected Products:
Oracle Java Runtime

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle's Java platform that utilize the
ActiveX Plugin. User interaction is required to exploit this
vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a
malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the plugin initializes objects.
While the plugin is in a particular state, the application will fail to
initialize a field that is used as a window handle. Exploitation can
lead to code execution under the privileges of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
