-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of SAP Crystal Reports. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the CMS.exe process which listens by
default on several TCP ports above 1024. When parsing a GIOP request,
the process trusts a user-supplied 32-bit value and allocates a buffer
on the heap. The process then proceeds to copy the string following this
value from the packet until it finds a NULL byte. By crafting a
specifically sized packet a remote attacker can overflow the buffer and
gain code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
SAP states:
A solution was provided via SAP note 1509604
