My point is, if you are granting access to this password file to everyone,
the security hassles you're going through are all useless.
I mean, ok, you might prevent script kiddies (or lazy hackers) from getting
to the passwords, but discrimination is not the point of security is it?

With regards to the handcuffs example, yes let's. They're no use if the
criminal with the handcuff is situated in the red district and won't budge
out of there.
I think it's the context that makes this work. Users/admins should be
limiting access to the passwords file in the first place.

So far the security flaws we've seen (with this bad practice of using
plaintext) is people happily handing out passwords.
OK, encrypting the file would have prevented this mess - somewhat.
Better still, they shouldn't be handing out the file in the first place.

@Chris/silky - I didn't ask for your comments - maybe you didn't realize,
yours are just as useless.
No not in the theoretical context you keep coming up with, they *are* really
useless.
I mean, arguments like "you are shit, without doubts", really won't get you
anywhere.

@Ryan - I don't need to take to anyone's defence. As you correctly said, any
security precaution might not work when put through certain conditions.
Maybe it's just my opinion, I don't know. But the problem I see is people
shouldn't be assuming something is safe and hand it out.
Sharing a whole hard drive with the web doesn't sound like a smart idea to
me.


Cheers,
Chris.
