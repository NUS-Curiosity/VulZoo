It's about a program insecurely and permanently storing user
credentials without informing the user about this - in many cases
certainly uncalled - behaviour.

This issue is not about public terminals or users uploading
their backup files to indexed, publicly readable web shares.

Argumenting that the issue was about "someone gaining access to the
file" is not valid. There's code in a program silently writing highly
sensitive
information to places where they are not wanted and not expected by
most users - proven by all the recentservers.xml files on Google.
