Just because someone has managed to sign up to full disclosure and
send an email doesn't entitle them to have an email from me explaining
exactly how wrong their thought processes are. My post was meant to
encourage the reader to actually try and re-evalue his position own
his own and try a little bit of self-education on the matter.

Like I said to the other guy, I really don't care if you understand
the issue.The game now (or at least here, on this list) is to try and
steer people away from FileZilla if it doesn't change. Anyones opinion
other than the developer on the issue of the nature of stored
passwords on a local machine is meaningless. If their position is
*influenced* by yours, then I will comment, otherwise, I don't see the
point.
