It's no use the criminal is handcuffed if he's not locked up in jail (or on
the way to one) - it's a matter of time for him/her sawing/picking them off.

The objective was to get people like you and Evans to think about it. I
don't care if people like silky
just won't hear any reason, opinion or whatever, on the matter. Ever since
he wrote "there's no discussion", I realized he's a lost case.

That's some nice encouragement. Kind of reminds me of Windows XP's
connection troubleshooter;
"Please visit the interwebz and we'll help you connect to the internet."

Just because you signed up on FD and have a fancy blog doesn't mean you're
any better.
Really.
I wonder how many under-paid chinese hackers even own a wordpress account -
 and we know how they seem to find 0days which we don't find with our fancy
tools.

And that is my point exactly. While I'm shouting out loud, let me ask a
question:
How many FD readers are dumb enough to share their harddisks with the world?
None? So what is the problem in using FileZilla personally? I mean, anyone
which
takes security seriously, would be encrypting their drive in the first
place.
