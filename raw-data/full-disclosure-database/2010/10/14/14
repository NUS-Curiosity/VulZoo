Turns out FileZilla is GPL'ed:
http://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FAQ#FileZilla_Client_FAQ
(No idea why I had thought otherwise until just now).

It seems like you are a fan of the software but feel passionately about the
password issue.

In this instance, the most productive way forward might be to submit a
patch. I'm sure the developers would be more receptive to an approach based
on "here's a nice new feature" rather than an approach based on "pitchforks
recruited from full-disclosure".

No, and I apologize if it came across this way. Any rant can be traced back
to issues such as:

- The industry-wide overuse and misuse of the word "critical" when referring
to a security bug.
- People piling angrily into the thread despite the absence of any attempt
at a detailed threat analysis.
