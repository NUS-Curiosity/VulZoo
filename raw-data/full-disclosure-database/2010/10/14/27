Defense in Depth.  It's a Good Idea.

Yes, that guy who lost his house and got to watch it burn down because he
forgot to pay a $75 fee *should* have paid it.  That doesn't mean a policy
of "they should have paid, so let it burn if they didn't" is a good idea.

File permissions also limit software capability.

So tell me - why is 'chmod -R 777 /' a bad idea? After all, /bin/login *should*
be stopping unauthorized people from logging in, and authorized users *should*
be exercising due diligence in accessing files, so under normal operation,
file permissions shouldn't ever reject an attempted access.  So why do we
have them?

If you can't create a backup copy of the file, and then restore the exact same
pattern of bits when recovering the file, merely because the contents are
encrypted, there's something else wrong with your backup scheme.
