Subject: Re: XSS in Oracle default fcgi-bin/echo

as i remembers oracle simply remove the vulnerable samples/demo from the system 
after applying the patch. but it would be interesting to check if they still 
shift the vulnerable demo/sample with there products latest release (i.e 
releases after patch release ).

Regards
Sumit

Oracle now told me that (they double-checked and)
  The issue ... has been addressed by the fixes released in CPUJan2007.
Could someone verify whether that in fact solves the issue?

Hmm... maybe difficult to verify, since I did not post a PoC test.
Maybe a kind Oracle admin could point me to a patched fcgi-bin/echo?
Funny if any such existed: an admin careful to keep patches up-to-date,
but careless in not following security recommendations to remove...
Maybe, contact me off-list so I can provide PoC?

Cheers, Paul
