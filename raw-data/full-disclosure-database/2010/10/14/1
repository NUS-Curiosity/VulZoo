No, you are completely wrong and I encourage you to specifically
consider a layered threat model or perhaps just read the information
*already presented* in this thread. Not all attackers are created
equally.

There is no question here. There is no discussion. It should be done,
and if it is not, password saving should be stopped in FileZilla or an
alternative program should be sought. It's that simple.

(Note that BeyondCompare and probably at least N other programs out
there *do* perform a trivial encoding of the passwords, and it is a
good and appropriate policy).
