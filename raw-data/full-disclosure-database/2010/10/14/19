Valdis, the thing is, if people want their password-keeping software secure,
they ought to be limiting access to this said software.
Instead, what we are proposing here is limiting software capability.
Why? I can't back up the password file reliably anymore, thanks to this
"feature".
I can't understand why we are encrypting the file from this level, rather
than relying on the environment.
The only reason I can see so far (which you and others have repeatedly
cited) is that the said
environment *might* not be secure. My opinion about this? I'd rather have to
fix the environment than
have to maintain both. Then again, security is all about layers and adding
bloat upon bloat to somewhat limit access.

Since there seems to be some sort of "standard" which everyone seems to have
agreed on, this is where I quit.
Though I still see this idea as simply adding bloat without a real cause.
