I think it's getting ridiculous.  Who cares about bureaucratical terms?  I
find more and more 'researchers' trying to just be auditors and categorize
exploits and try to follow some kind of universal naming convention for
exploits that doesn't exist and shouldn't exist.  I'd rather see information
on exploits and interesting ways to use them than saying it's one type or
the other.

This 'scene' is not about politics and terminology for me.
