Original message:

I first noticed this business years ago when I set up a website for a friend's forum. He was extremely appealed by the deal. After hosting with them for a very short time he parted ways.  At first I thought they were just another lowly shared host. Recently, I checked back to see how this web host innovated.

Instead of innovation, such as cloud architecture, exchange or inhouse solutions, they're making millions google bombing and spamming their homepage, and are one of the most prolific corporate spammers I've seen. By my estimates, they likely spent well-over 7 figures on blackhat SEO campaigns which earned the #1 result for hosting on Google search.

Further, They are Google bombing results like "Hostgator sucks" and "Hostgator scam" to bury criticism and constantly policing blogs for any critical comments. If it's a fraudulent bill, it was a mistake out of odds. If it's an ex-employee, they'll say it's a personal grudge over incompetence firing.

What is most despicable about this business is their management and lackey employees scour and attack people who have legitimate criticism of their business.

There literally thousands more. They have spent 6 or 7 figs burying negative reviews, making them one of the top black hat spammers on the internet. This is pure blackhat SEO.  A sponsored conversation means Host gator paid bloggers to write a puff piece, see sites like https://payperpost.com/. Rarely do you see a legitimate client, out of 20 pages of sifting through hostgator ads, almost  9/10 of them were bought through ad services.

They will likely proffer it's by rogue affiliate advertisers. This is for the most part untrue - they're not even pretending to hide it with affiliate or referral links. They are that sloppy and obvious about it.

Hostgator even claims their own spam campaign speaks in their favor them:

"From the above number, only 1 out of every 10000 pages about HostGator says that this hosting sucks. This is still quite good considering other hosts we have looked at have way worst [sic] ratio.". 2010-10-28.

A Small Orange: Brent Oxley, a trust funder from Boca Raton Florida, owner of hostgator bought a small orange. The owner of a small orange said: "ASO will not be turned into a HostGator clone by any means. I am very interested in continuing to develop ASO as a high-end hosting company that prides itself on quality customer service."

To which an ASO user responds:

"I hope that's a promise :) HostGator seem to suck in a lot of newbies with over-inflated packages for below-reasonable prices and almost certainly with unfair conditions to stop you using it."

That is my fair and truthful review of hostgator. Haadquartered in Houston, Texas. In 2010 it opened a satellite in Austin, Texas. Your unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, shared hosting services has been exposed.
