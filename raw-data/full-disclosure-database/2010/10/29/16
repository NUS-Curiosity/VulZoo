ZDI-10-227: Adobe Shockwave Player Lnam Chunk String Processing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-227

October 29, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3655

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Shockwave Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the support for parsing Director movies.
The .dir format is RIFF-based and is parsed mainly by the dirapi.dll
module distributed with Shockwave. While parsing the Lnam chunk within a
DIR file, the process attempts to extract a string into a fixed-length
buffer located on the stack. The string is prefixed with a one byte size
value. If the value is 0xFF the process blindly copies the following
string until a NULL byte is found. This can be abused by an attacker to
overflow the stack buffer and consequently execute arbitrary code under
the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
