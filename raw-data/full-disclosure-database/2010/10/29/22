Infobyte Security Research is pleased to announce the release of evilgrade 2.0
with a lot of new modules and a bunch of squashed bugs.

[-] RELEASE DETAILS

BRIEF OVERVIEW

Evilgrade is a modular framework that allows the user to take
advantage of poor upgrade implementations by injecting fake updates.

This framework comes into play when the attacker is able to make
traffic redirection, and such thing can be done in several ways
such as: DNS tampering, DNS Cache Poisoning, ARP spoofing
Wi-Fi Access Point impersonation, DHCP hijacking with your
favorite tools.

This way you can easy take control of a fully patched machine
during a penetration test in a clean and easy way. The main idea
behind the is to show the amount of trivial errors in the update
process of mainstream applications.
