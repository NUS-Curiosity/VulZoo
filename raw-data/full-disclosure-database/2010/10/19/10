So often on these lists do we see the over-dramatization performed by weeblos, Benji and co. who provide nothing but continual stupidity.
Weev, you have next to no skill in web dev or anywhere else. You have written no kernel extensions for Mac OS X, you probably haven't
any idea of the first thing pertaining to exploitation except for latching on those more skilled than you are, i.e., sloth, nc, etc.


Instead of wasting your time, and ours on fruitless endeavours, coming here and posting idiot messages about zdnet (you could've just
emailed eugene, since he's the only person who found any interest in the matter), along with creating organisations such as 4chan, 
bantown, goatsecurity, et al. Why don't you spend some time sharpening your coding skills?


Thanks ~batched
