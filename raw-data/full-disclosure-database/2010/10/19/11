Dear Lists,

I'm happy (and proud) to announce that the registrations for H2HC Cancun
are finally available online. 

This is the first year of the conference in Cancun/Mexico (on 3rd of

support of organizations such as Microsoft, Check Point, Nitro Security,
Trend Micro, Symantec, Secureworks, iDefense, Core Security, Immunity
Security, Trustwave, Tenable and many local companies like Secure1 and
Conviso.

Hope to see you around,



Rodrigo (BSDaemon).
