-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM DB2. Authentication is required in that
a user must have the ability to connect to the database.

The specific flaw exists within the install_jar procedure. The
install_jar procedure contains a directory traversal vulnerability that
will allow the attacker to upload a Jar file to a directory outside of
the intended "\function\jar\Name_of_logged_user\" directory. A remote
attacker can abuse this to execute arbitrary code under the context of
the SYSTEM user.
