I think people would like to know and you've been prudish on facts, probably out of a veritable casserole of fear, uncertainty, pain, daze and jade. I'd prefer to hear it in your own words; specifics if you have the courage.

We don't need 50 news sources with identical content - you just get into blackhat spamwars with sensational article titles, topics on Google News and Magazine covers to get people to buy. You're a dying a breed. For christ sakes, instead of being a bunch of pretentious losers in thick rimmed glasses trying to hit on attention whores who don't put out. What is the matter with you.
