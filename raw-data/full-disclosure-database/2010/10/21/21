Agreed. I am all for the transparency, but WL is possibly putting our troops
at risk by releasing military strategy.  I wouldn't expect JA to think that
there is any inclination of strategy in the documents they published, but
there is a lot of strategy and a LOT of information that is now visible to
more than just United States citizens.

I believe that most of the times it is not what you defend but how you
defend it.
I believe in Government transparency but the way WL is going about it it's
not right, in my honest opinion.
So this is good news in my opinion...
