Subject: Rooted CON 2011: Welcome Hex Rays as new sponsor

Hello all,

We don't send emails to communicate sponsorships as we undertsand is
quite disturbing and we all receive a lot of email.

But this is a special situation as I want to transmit a big THANK YOU to
the Hex Rays team, and specially to Ilfak Guilfanov, as he has been
absolutely kind with us, giving it support as quick as he was able to.

IDA Pro es a great product, but the team behind is the greatest.

Thanks a lot, Hex Rays
