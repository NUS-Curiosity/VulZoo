Agreed.

Just to play devils advocate:
Would Barrack Obama also be culpable? His campaign platform included a
withdrawl from Iraq (Afghanistan was a different story). So troops are
still there because he [apparently] lied to [fraudulently] obtain the
office.

If the troops weren't there, then the troops would not be at risk, and
there would be no wiki leaks story. quod erat demonstrandum.
