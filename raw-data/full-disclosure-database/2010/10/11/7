Hi,

I suspect that real reason for this app is intelligence on data about
bank clients from Facebook database.
To be used during debt collection or while making loan decisions.

App has no Privacy Policy defined, but request permissions to access
Facebook profile, friends list and other info. ;-)

Person who has "invented" this app Alexander Vityaz  has posted on his
wall (on 1 October) link to article on how many data-mining employees
LinkedIn has and that they do.  Seems like he is willing to replicate
same effort for banking purpose.
