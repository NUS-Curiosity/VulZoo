Subject: Re: Filezilla's silent caching of
	user's	credentials

If this is the wrong list for this question, I appologize.
Is there any precedent for notifying those whose results have popped up
for the below referenced google search?
I would be happy to send out an email to the domain owners?, to alert
them of a problem, but I am not sure if this is recommended.
