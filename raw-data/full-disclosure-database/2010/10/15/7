-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealPlayer. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page.

The specific flaw exists during the parsing of long CDDA URIs due to a
failure to initialize a particular component of an object. The
application will later call a method in the object leading to the
uninitialized pointer being called. If an attacker can place data they
control at the uninitialized location, the application will call
malicious pointer which can lead to code execution under the context of
the application.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
