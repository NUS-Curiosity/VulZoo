Subject: Re: OT: Hacking Pink Floyd

How is this 'hacking', you're just finding a message that I thought was
obvious on the compact disk if you paid attention or spun the thing until
memorization.
And you didn't even find the reversed message in 'Empty Spaces' just before
the singing kicks in.
Further more, why is this on Full Disclosure, it is kind of cool to kick off
a blog/website or whatever, but I don't think this is the place for it
....but I maybe mistaken.
