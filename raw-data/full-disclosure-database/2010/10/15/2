Quoting from Ryan's message that started this thread
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Oct/86>:

    There have been quite a few bug and features requests filed, and
    they all get closed or rejected within a week or so. I also posted
    something in the developer forum inquiring about this, and received
    this response:

    "I do not see any harm in storing credentials as long as the rest of
    your system is properly secure as it should be."

It would appear that your certainty that "the developers would be more
receptive..." to a patch is misplaced.
