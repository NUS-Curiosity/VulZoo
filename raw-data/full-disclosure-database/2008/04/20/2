again you show your ignorance.

if you are aware of the risk, there are a multitude of mitigations,
outside of official vendor patches.  these range from firewall /
packet filter, to applications configuration changes, to third party
patches, to alternate implementations, etc.

if you are aware of the vulnerability, it is no longer 0day.

if you get pwned by a known vuln, that is your laziness or stupidity at fault.
