No, you show yours by only reading the first sentence of my e-mail and
cutting the rest out which explained it all to you.

But from the computers point of view it doesn't care, if the
vulnerability is not patched by the official vendor then its still a
0-day.

As I said in previous e-mail, *you* being aware doesn't matter to the
term 0-day, because its a reference to a threat level to a computer,
not the human mind and how many days ago the human became aware.

Its purely a mechanical term for the computer, not anything to do with
what humans think.

A computer doesn't count how many days ago, it counts in 0 and 1's, so
it doesn't count the days inbetween, to the computer there is only
0-day then patched is 1, thats what the reference is all about.
