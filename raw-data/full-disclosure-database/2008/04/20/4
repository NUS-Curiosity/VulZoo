if we determine 0day by "patched" or "not patched" you've applied a
useless metric which means nothing.

when Oracle doesn't deliver a patch for a known vuln for 1.5 YEARS and
you get exploited via this vector, that is a 0day attack?
(a vector easily mitigated by disabling a known, often unnecessary
component added for marketing value to product..)

please, use your crack addled mind (what is left of it) and think
through the logical conclusion of your assertion.

0day is a perspective.
