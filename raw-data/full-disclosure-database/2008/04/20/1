It doesn't matter how old it is, as long as no patch is available, it
will always come out of no where and pwn your ass.

Just because the human is psychologically aware of the unpatched
vulnerability and that it exists, to the vulnerable computer it is
still a 0-day and can come out of no where and pwn your ass.

0-day is about computers, its not ment to be a reference to a human
perspective. The term 0-day is used to determine a threat against a
computer, not a human state of mind on how early the computer user was
alerted to a no patch available computer vulnerability.

The problems that arise is, people think 0day is a stage in human
psychology of becoming aware of a computer threat, when its actually
used to reference the threat level to a computer system, the human
mind is irrelevant to how pwnable your system is from public
disclosure until patch release day.

If the computer is vulnerable, the computer is vulnerable, the human
mind is irrelevant.
