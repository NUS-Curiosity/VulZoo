No, it is you that is sadly mistaken.

IETF RFCs are not versioned.  If substantial changes are made, the
document is re-issued with a new number.  And you'd know that if you
had actually spent any significant time reading RFCs.

Hint: When arguing about the contents of an RFC, it's usually advisable
to actually have found and read said RFC before opening your mouth in order
to insert your foot.
