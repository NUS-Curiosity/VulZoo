0959 File Transfer Protocol. J. Postel, J. Reynolds. October 1985.
     (Format: TXT=147316 bytes) (Obsoletes RFC0765) (Updated by RFC2228,
     RFC2640, RFC2773, RFC3659) (Also STD0009) (Status: STANDARD)

RFC2228 is in fact about a security extension to FTP - unfortunately, section
4 of it does not have any subsections, so there is no 4.4.3.

RFC2640 is about internationalization of FTP, and has sections 4.3, 4.3.1,
and then 5.  No 4.4.3 to be found.

RFC2773 is about encryption using SKIPJACK, but it goes from 4.0 to 5.0
with no intervening 4.4.3.

RFC3659 is about FTP extensions, but unfortunately section 4 is about the
SIZE extension, and has a 4.4 but no 4.4.3 subsection.

So which RFC were you talking about?

Hint: When you find you've dug yourself into a hole, it's usually not a
good idea to keep digging...
