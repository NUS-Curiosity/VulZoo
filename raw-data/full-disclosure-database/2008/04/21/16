I've been beating on CS3 a bit the past few days myself... I ran  
across the same issue. Here is a little helper function

def addr_to_asc_pad(addr)
         low = (addr & 0x0000ffff)
         high = (addr & 0xffff0000) >> 16
         a = (low & 0x00ff)
         b = (low & 0xff00) >> 8
         c = (high & 0x00ff)
         d = (high & 0xff00) >> 8
         sprintf( "%s\x00\x00%s\x00\x00%s\x00\x00%s\x00\x00", a.chr,  
b.chr, c.chr, d.chr )
end
