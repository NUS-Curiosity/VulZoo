I don't know if HD Moore will or not, he is probably busy doing more
important things than web application security awareness day.

On the other hand, he must have a couple of XSS's he knows about, this
is the one time in the year people like him can post them and not be
laughed at, thats what web application security awareness day is all
about.

Its about getting everybody together no matter what skill level you
are, and post web application security bugs.

Its time to unite the community together instead of flaming with each
other and get behind a common cause. And everybody has at least an
XSS, so everyone has the ability to join in, from newbies, to flamers,
to lamers, to script kiddies, hackers, security researchers,
everybody!

Join in this new and innovative day brought to you by n3td3v.

Where: The mailing lists

When: May 1st 2008

How: Post white papers, research, bugs, tips, and any other web
application security information. As long as the theme is web
application security, then I don't care.

Its the first "theme day" of its kind on the mailing lists has been
held, get involved and make web application security awareness day a
success!

If this day is a success it will lead the way for other security
researchers to start a theme day on a different topic / subject. I'm
doing web application security awareness day, but other security
researchers might have ideas for different theme days on the type of
hacking their interested in.

I'm pioneering the start of a new trend, theme days on the mailing
lists, so get involved in this new and innovative day brought to you
by n3td3v.

Regards,

n3td3v
