Thanks a lot who has replied to me.
Basically 64.40.117.19 is foreign IP and connection from all over world 
means
I've seen accesses from various different IPs to 64.40.117.119.
Before client's connection was without firewall.
I put firewall and also notified client's admin and now it seems like 
everything is fine.
