The Pope?

As the probability that your CRM output is or is not spam is something 
we cannot know, how the fark do you think we can sensibly answer your 
question?

Oh -- and in general, NOT having Hotmail accept your mail is probably 
considered a positive thing here.  Now, if theer was just some way to 
stop Hotmail trying to send Email _to_ us...

Let's _all_ send him a message saying we incorrectly received a copy of 
his message and affirm that we destroyed it, did not copy it nor 
disclose it nor use it in any way (except as directed in the pseudo-
legalistic footer) _AND_ demand that his lawyer send our lawyers 
acknowledgment that we have acted in accordance with their legal 
demands and thereby acknowledge that they will not ever be taking any 
kind of legal action against us as a result...
