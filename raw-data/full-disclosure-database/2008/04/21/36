You obviously tuned in late. ;)

When 3.4.3  was pointed out to Joey, he claimed he meant 4.4.3, and when
it was pointed out that there *was* no 4.4.3 in 959, he said "in the revised
version", and when it was pointed out that RFCs aren't versioned, he claimed it
was in one of the other mentioned RFCs, which didn't have a 4.4.3 in them
either...
