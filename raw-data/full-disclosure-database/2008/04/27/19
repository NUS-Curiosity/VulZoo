Ureleet deserved it, he's been trolling me for weeks. The only purpose
of "Ureleet" is to reply to all my messages and make me angry. Its
actually quite interesting, its obviously someone with a grudge
against me, from something i've said in the past.

You script kiddies need to get a life instead of trying to annoy me, though.

He has kind of succeeded in turning the list against me, but people
will see through it.

His plan was probably to get me to threaten him, its all fun and games...
