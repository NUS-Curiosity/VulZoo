Guys, I know this has been said time and time again, but:

1) if you don't like n3td3v, just set up a filter to direct his emails into the trash, and
2) if you don't do this, you have no right to complain.

We're all tech-savvy enough here to know how to block someone's emails and, presumably, mature enough to know how to cope with people we can't get along with (ignore them).  Instead of contributing to the threads and fighting it out, get off of your own high-horses and just leave the issues alone.  If you all believe that, indeed, n3td3v is only after attention, then -- well -- look what you're giving him.
