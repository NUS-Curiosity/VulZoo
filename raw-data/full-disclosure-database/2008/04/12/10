Human Honeypot: reader comment from n3td3v

Story: Black Hat with a Vista twist

Its the 'manufactured' hackers who go to these 'talk to the police'
conferences, you know the ones who spent thousands on student loans to
become a hacker.

Any criminal hackers who go are just stupid and don't realise what
they are actually attending.

The U.S Security Services will have hidden cameras and befrienders in
place to grab as much information out of people as possible.

These conferences have just turned into a 'human honeypot' for the
intelligence services.

Good on the people who are brave enough to step into that 'human
honeypot', but the majority in the underground wouldn't go near these
conferences.

Keep up the good work Joris Evers.
