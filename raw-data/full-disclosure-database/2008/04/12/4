This is a request to ban n3td3v from full-disclosure, here is a poll
titled "Do you want n3td3v banned from full-disclosure" and I hope
that a moderator will take notice.

It is sad having to bother with a troll like n3td3v in the first place
,but it is clear to everyone at this point that he is impotent and
an attention seeker and directs discussions in his way so that he
can make references to himself and Agenda child games.
