Regarding the particular person in question, I'll defer to others who know 
him (or her, or they, or whomever) better than I do. Instead, I'll say that, 
generally, on lists like FD, there is a minority of out-spoken personalities 
who sadly support the stereotypical hacker persona: condescending egoists 
who are socially inept and emotionally charged when discussing topics that 
relate to their knowledge domain. That's unfortunate, since the broader IT 
security community is poorly represented due to attention-seeking zealots.

Regarding the idea of "oulawing security conference spamming," I'd say the 
literal idea of outlawing cross-posts to multiple security mailing lists is 
a bad idea. The idea that the legislature should write into law legislation 
that reduces our freedom in such a sense is a slippery slope borne of 
emotionalism and narrowness. What else should the government do to curtail 
our freedoms? I tend to side with libertarian types (though I don't call 
myself a "libertarian" un-qualified) on what the government should do and 
what they should not do. And micro-manage security mailing lists is 
something they should not do. It's a bad idea and would make a dreadful 
precedent.

As a medic working as a associate specialist in the treatment of
substance misuse disorder for the last few years n3td3v reminds me of
my patients who indulge in polydrug abuse mainly involving cocaine and
alcohol, often in combination.

This is a very dangerous thing to do due to the 2 drugs being combined
by the liver to form cocaethylene which is significantly more euphoric
and hepatotoxic.

-tip i have done some "n of 1" trials with patients showing that
antabuse (disulphiram) can help with this as it seems to inhibit
dopamine decarboxylase in the brain thus raising basal dopamine levels
reducing cravings as well as preventing alcohol use. Modafenil also
seems quite promising for stimulant misuse but my bosses are being
slow about letting me set up a proper double-blind placebo controlled
study of this.

I also think this is why the analysis of n3td3v done previously came
to the conclusion that it was several separate individuals. It is
merely one guy in different states of intoxication.

The evolution of his evolving addiction and deteriorating mental
health has been quite clear over the last few years.

Soon , if he follows the pattern set by many Scots indulging in hard
drug use he will start to use benzodiazepines more and more and if he
is very unlucky he will be exposed to heroin.
At this point he will go away and FD can return to its true nature as
a list for sec matters with occasional furry pr0n spam.
