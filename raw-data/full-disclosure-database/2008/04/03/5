Referring to oneself in the third person can be a symptom of identity
confusion or identity alteration, a subset or trait of dissociation. In
ancient times, it was referred to as demonic possession.

Self-objectification is also a trait of narcissism, perhaps because
narcissists love and feel empowered by (possession of) objects. And what
better object for a narcissist to love than themselves, objectified? Other
traits associated with narcissism are bragging, attention-seeking, delusions
of grandeur, etc. In modern times, I believe it is sometimes referred to as
being a bore.

Am I the only one who is getting annoyed by n3td3v speaking in the
third-person like he's an entity, rather than a single person? I suggest we
all take a moment to psycho-analyze this, rather than taking time out of our
day to do our real jobs. ;)
