you are the one bragging about making a difference, all i see is you being
annoying.  but i don't know ur full history on the mailing list, but from
what i see, its not very positive.
and am i annoying everyone?  or just you.  speaking about stopping the storm
worm and trying to stop the storm worm are two different things.
