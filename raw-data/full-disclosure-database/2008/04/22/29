Pretty shocking stuff. I seriously recommend a scholarly, peer-reviewed book 
on basic social skills.

In addition, finding a role model who has both strong domain knowledge (in 
the field of your choice) and also who communicates effectively (i.e., 
without losing his/her equanimity when faced with benign or even vehement 
dissent) could also be helpful for you in the long run. So, rather than 
flaming others, you will have a greater capacity to engage in rational 
discourse.

I feel compelled to add that I'm seriously not saying this to be offensive, 
nor am I only directing this message to you (it is, quite literally, 
impossible to over-emphasize those points on this particular list).

Hope that proves helpful,

- G
