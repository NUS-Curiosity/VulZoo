I didn't get a script alert on 2.0.0.12 or 3.05b. On both times I saw RAM
kept see-saw'ing from 400mb-1gb and CPU go to 50% and then the script loads.


So really, if you think about it, an analogy for this would be if you fill
an elevator (in your case) with a low max-load with too much shit, do you
really expect it to work?
