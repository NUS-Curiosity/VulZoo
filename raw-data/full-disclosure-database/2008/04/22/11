v3nt3d is happy to accept these first two entries to "Tuesday" (A new and
innovative day brought to you by v3nt3d) - If you want a real chance to win
you may have to try to be more obnoxious (Releasing an XSS under creative
commons is a good start though). n3td3v,  v3nt3d likes your entry, but knows
you can do much better...
