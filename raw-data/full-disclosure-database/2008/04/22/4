Joey, Wikipedia has some decent write-ups on both compression and 
encryption. Understanding those concepts would be helpful before tackling 
RFCs. Hope that helps.

The design goal of most compression algorithms is that *anybody* can take
the compressed data and get back the original.  The design goal of most
encryption is that *only the intended recipient* can decrypt and get the
original data back.

The only question left at this point is whether the contents of your brain 
were
compressed, or merely encrypted, and which of the two would be more secure.
