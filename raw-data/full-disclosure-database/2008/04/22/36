Richard is actually a good guy who I talk to with off list all the
time and advises me casually as a friend on what i'm doing on the list
at any given time, he works in a position of government, he doesn't
deserve to be made fun of. You could actually learn from him, he
doesn't have a bad bone in his body.

If I were you I wouldn't *knowingly* make fun of government officials,
as they look after our well being to keep us safe.

All the best,
