Subject: Defining Tuesday

I just caught this video which sums it up nicely:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6F2J3_v3U

"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday".

But v3nt3d think maybe we should move Tuesday to start of week.

v3nt3d is the founder of a new and innovative day called Tuesday or second
day of week, or day after Monday. It was announced by v3nt3d on April 22nd
2008 on Full-Disclosure mailing list.

Tuesday will be host on April 22nd 2008.

A winner will be declared for the most obnoxious post to a mailing list.

To be in the running, your submission must be publically disclosed to a
mailing list on April 22nd 2008. This will be the first time Tuesday has
taken place.

I hope it will catch on and that it will take place every week.
