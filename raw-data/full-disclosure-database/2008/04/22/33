Subject: Misquoted here on FD...

	Clearly someone has misused what I have written in kindness and
turned it into something I would never say. List members; please be aware
that the person who quoted me apparently has added some words of his or her
own.
	 Let us know how you really feel since you hide behind a pseudonym
anyhow.
	Richard
