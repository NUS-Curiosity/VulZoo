You should consider using rlimits, which tend to contain this problem
decently well. But yes, the Linux scheduler is utter crap when it comes
to handling OOM conditions and thrashing.

Actually, I find it somewhat stupid of the end user distributions to
ship with most rlimits set to unlimited. I mean, it keeps the most
stupid software from crashing, but with a scheduler as bad as this, I
wouldn't dare letting the users run without rlimits.
