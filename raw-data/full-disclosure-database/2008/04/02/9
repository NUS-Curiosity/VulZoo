Subject: Nipper update released

Nipper is a network infrastructure parser. It processes configuration files 
from network devices and produces a report including a security audit of the 
device, configuration settings and other relevant information.

Nipper currently supports the following device types:

  * Cisco IOS-based routers
  * Cisco IOS-based catalysts
  * Cisco NMP-based catalysts
  * Cisco CatOS-based catalysts
  * Cisco PIX-based Firewalls
  * Cisco ASA-based Firewalls
  * Cisco FWSM-based Firewalls
  * Cisco Content Service Switches
  * Juniper ScreenOS-based Firewalls (NetScreen)
  * Nortel Passport devices
  * CheckPoint Firewall-1 Firewalls
  * Sonicwall SonicOS-based Firewalls
  * Bay Networks Accelar
  * Nokia IP Firewalls

The security audit includes details of the findings, together with detailed 
recommendations. The security audit can be modified using command line 
parameters or an external configuration file.

This update (0.11.5) includes improvements to the report output, some minor 
PQR issues have been resolved. It also includes bug fixes for issues 
identified by the community.

Nipper is available for Linux, Windows and other platforms. More information 
and downloads can be obtained from the project web site at 
http://nipper.titania.co.uk 

If you have access to device configuration files for network devices, please 
consider sending them to me. I will be discrete, but you are welcome to 
sanitise them first. However, if you do sanitise them, please ensure that the 
structure of the config file is not modified.
