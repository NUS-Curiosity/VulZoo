I'm not trolling if I want a security conference mailing list setup so
the rest of us don't need to suffer an inbox of 20 identical
commerical *come to our conference, or, book our training*.

This is a big issue, and if we dont create a mailing list for it, next
year we won't have 20 duplicates per spam run, we'll have 40 per spam
run.

Imagine if n3td3v post to *every* mailing list and not just *one*,
would you not get tired and frustrated?

All the best,

n3td3v
