Subject: Re: sans handler gives out n3td3v e-mail to public

Actually, they are getting on with their business, keeping thousands of 
network security professionals informed and updated. What they aren't 
doing is engaging in childish postings to listservs, silly braggadocio, 
and generally making a fool of themselves.  When you are  good at what  
you do, your work speaks for you, and you don't need to  fill up 
people's inboxes with rants and rambling calls for action from the White 
House (that one split my side laughing). "In the Presidents Early Bird 
briefings today is yet another serious cyberwarfare warning from that 
accomplished and respected security researcher, n3td3v. Mark this Top 
Priority and make sure he sees it first thing!". This is what you put up 
with to have unmoderated lists.
