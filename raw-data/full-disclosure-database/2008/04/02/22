No, it was sending signals to important people to take action to get
it further pushed up the ladder. In no way do I expect my e-mail to be
directly looked at by the white house. Through signal intelligence,
the folks at GCHQ and NSA would see it and it would infulence others
who lurk on this list to take action. And for your information, thats
whats happened.

For instance, http://blog.securitynow.us/2008/03/19/storm-worm-russian-business-network-rbn/

"I have sent a plea for assistance to some of my contacts within the
US government and hope others do as well to get this issue resolved."

So unless you've got other ideas on how to stop Storm Worm, stop
trolling in my threads with off-topicness.

n3td3v is big in the security community and is working with others to
get things done for the better of everyone.

Regards,

n3td3v
