Once upon a time in toy town, I offered to contract
the services of a professional hit-man to have n3td3v
executed - in part a joke, my black humour. However, I
have received so many donations from various gmail.com
addresses that I have just been able to purchase my
first car with the left-over change. As I type this
from my Lamborghini Diablo parked up in a car park at
London's heathrow eagerly awaiting the arrival of
"Aghbad", a delightful eastern european chap with a
pretty impressive handlebar mustache which matches the
colour of the AK-47 i believe has been paid to come
off before the concourse, i can't help but realize
just HOW MANY of the SANS people paid their donations
to this worthwhile cause. I also wonder if n3td3v
thought the CIA would allow him to continue his
campaign of hate.

Maybe the FUD will stop and we can all get on with
whatever we were doing before the n3td3v agenda.
