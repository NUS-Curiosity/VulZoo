Subject: Fwd: Let's outlaw mass security conference
	spamming its fucking gay

I don't want people to get angry about this, this is actually a serious
issue that n3td3v has noticed, and those security guys who are subscribed to
more than one mailing list will understand. Full-Disclosure, I want action
taken on the *growing* amount of security conference spam. It used to be
acceptable, but these days its becoming intolerable. I don't know who in the
security community would setup a mailing list for security conferences to
advertise and get feedback from, but I think one should be created. Gadi
Evron might be able to set a security conference mailing list up? I don't
know. Who else is into the mailing list creation business? For sure though,
there is an issue with Securityfocus accepting security conference spam on
their mailing lists, and its not even funny now. The security conferences
spam lists like vuln-dev and pen-test and the Securityfocus boys still
accept it onto the mailing list, even though its been already accepted on
the big main mailing lists a day or so before. What happens is, folks who
are good at security, and are subscribed to all the mailing lists, get an
inbox flooded with duplicate security conference spam, and people aren't
even interested. People may think this isn't a big issue, but it is for me
and i've been in contact with people who agree with me, now let's take
action now before we get more security conference spam in our mail boxes.
Securityfocus, stop accepting every security conference e-mail onto *every*
mailing list, i'm becoming increasingly angry. Now somethings got to be done
about this, and i'm calling for security community support for this, as the
growing number of security conferences grow every year, and the problem will
only get bigger and bigger, so let's join as one to get this situation
sorted.

i'm sick of the security conferences spamming every single fucking
security mailing list on the internet about their security conference,
its getting out of hand now and there are more and more new
conferences appearing by the month.

isn't it about time there was a new mailing list just for advertsing
and talking about security conferences, fucking hell. when you're
subscribed to 20 or more mailing lists and each one is spammed with
the exact same advert, it becomes a fucking pain in the fucking neck.

someone create a mailing list for security conferences, i'm going off
my head here!!!

back in the day it was fine with getting e-mail once or twice a year
about a security conference, but now there are so many being announced
that these commercial venutres are creating their own unsolicited mail
(SPAM) eco-system.

i'm beginning to wonder when enough will be enough and a public outcry
will take place.

already i've shouted down those fucks from offensive-security.com for
doing it, but i can't keep publically flagging-as-spam everytime
because these
mass-multi-mailing-list-announcements-are-happening-more-often-now-than-not.

i would just end up sounding like a fucking parrot.

fuck you security conferences you dick fucks, stop
mass-mailing-everyone-is-subscribed-to-the-same-mailing-lists-no-need-to-spam-every-single-one-you-fucking-morons.

no there won't be a n3td3v cyber security conference i can't be fucked
anymore its a boring idea so die!!!

why the fuck does securityfocus allow security conferences to spam
every single last mailing list of theres? what the fuck!!!

i'm going crazy with the security conference spam insanity!!!

regards,

n3td3v

But "someone create a mailing list for security conferences" is a pritty
sound idea.

Its not a reference to homosexuals.
If they were non-commercial it would be fine, but what it amounts to
is commercial spam the same as viagra etc.

Back in the day it was only one or two conferences getting *mass*
announced, but now there are tons of conferences and they keep sending
their shit to every single e-mail list they can think of.
Nope... only when I see security conferences being spammed on *every*
mailing list possible.

The result, about ten copies of the same e-mail sitting on my mail
box, asking me to purchase a ticket or buy security training.

This has to be nipped on the bud at the highest priority and urgency!!!

Its SPAM, so let's not dress it up as something else... get these
fucks blacklisted like the viagra spammers!!!

regards,

n3td3v
