And in fact, the last time there was a bug in zlib, there *were* a zillion
advisories, because at the time, a zillion packages carried their own private
copy of zlib around because it may or may not have been available on the
target system, or because they statically linked zlib in so just updating the
system copy of the shared library doesn't help.

Nobody (as far as I know) filed an advisory for packages that used the system
zlib, only for those packages that wouldn't be fixed by updating the system
copy.

I'd be interested in knowing what Luigi would recommend be done for such
packages...
