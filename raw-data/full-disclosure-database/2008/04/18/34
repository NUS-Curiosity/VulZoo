Subject: Re: Security issue in Filezilla 3.0.9.2:
	passwords are stored in plain text (sitemanager.xml)

I have noticed a similar, yet much more severe flaw in Filezilla. 
When logging in to a remote server, Filezilla will send the 
password in clear text without encrypting it. This means every 
machine on the internet that it routes through can intercept it. 
Same flaw, much more serious consequences, since, who has access to 
your personal PC anyway?
