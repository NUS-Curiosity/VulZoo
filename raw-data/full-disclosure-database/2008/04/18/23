Sorry to answer for Valdis, but here...

https://dmcdonald.net/iframe.html if I were a *VERY* popular site, that
would ddos google. Although including somekind of search request would
make it a little better, and realisticly id go down well before google.

But it's not exactly rocket science, is it? Although you may have been
confused by the term "iframe injection".

Best,

Darren
