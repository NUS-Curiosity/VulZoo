Subject: lots of connections to 64.40.117.19 port 80

Hi,

Recently I have seen a lots of connections to 64.40.117.19 port 80 in 
one of our clients network.
Connections are coming from all over the Internet (various different 
IPs) specifically to this IP.
Due to this problem (I guess it is DDoS) one of our router's CPU usage 
grew up to 100% and stopped a service
for a while.
What kind of problem this could be?
Has anybody seen this kind of attack before?
I appreciate if somebody can enlighten me in this regard.

thanks in advance,

Ganbold
