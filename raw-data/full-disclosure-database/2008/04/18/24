I find it interesting you were able to develop a tool to DDoS 
Google so quickly. Is there something going on with you I need to 
know about? Last time I checked, this was full-disclosure not black-
hat.

Is it *rocket* science? Or is it *computer* science? What I propose 
is that it is neither. In fact, what I propose is that it is *black-
hat* science. I still respectfully disagree with your analysis 
though. Perhaps more evidence on how you have successfully DDoS'd 
Google in the past?
