Subject: Re: lots of connections to 64.40.117.19 port 80

I didn't see any claims being made, just a question, albeit maybe
rhetorical.

Either way, who gives a shit.  Back to the OP-

*Recently I have seen a lots of connections to 64.40.117.19 port 80 in
one of our clients network.
Connections are coming from all over the Internet (various different
IPs) specifically to this IP.*

      I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding this, or if the grammar is just
unpleasant. It's always nice to make sure before I show my ass.

     I would assume the first sentence means you are seeing outgoing
connections, from your client's site, destined for the IP/port above.  So
then, the second sentence makes even less sense, connections coming into
your network from all over the Internet, but 'specifically to this IP'?
Huh?  Maybe I just need more coffee, but please explain this one for me.
