Yes, but although we have evidence that a DDoS of some sort is underway,
we have *ZERO*, *ZIP*, *ZILTCH*, *GOOSE-EGG* indication that an XSS was
involved.  For all you know, it was an iframe injection into clients that
visited a compromised webserver that downloaded the DDoS tool.

Sounds more like a "textbook case of calling it an XSS because when you only
have a hammer everything looks like a nail".
