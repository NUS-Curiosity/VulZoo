J,

Eh? The closest thing I can think of to what you're saying is if the cause
of a DDOS was stored XSS on a popular site(s) being used get users
browsers to request information from 64.40.117.19. The XSS would be done
else where, and the DDOS attack itself would contain no 'payload'.

In which case filtering user input on his side isnt going to anything.
Plus, you still have no reason for calling this a textbool case of XSS, or
anything else for that matter. Without seeing the tcpdump, all we can do
is reel of a list of things in might be.

Best,

Renski
