	are stored in plain text (sitemanager.xml)

Per the FileZilla feature page 
(http://filezilla-project.org/client_features.php):
"Supports FTP, FTP over SSL/TLS (FTPS) and SSH File Transfer Protocol 
(SFTP)"

Did you try selecting the option to use FTPS in FileZilla?

Using the plain vanilla FTP protocol in any other FTP client will yield the 
same problem (plaintext passwords, commands, data, etc, over the 
communication channel).
