"Get involved in this new and innovative day brought to you by n3td3v.

All submissions must be legal and above board, I do not want things compromised.

Submissions are only valid on May 1st, if you post on any other date,
your disclosure won't be counted.

Your real name, alias or fake handle will be post on the n3td3v
website as having post on May 1, but the winner will go at the top of
the list of real names, aliases, fake handles."

A page has been setup about it all,
