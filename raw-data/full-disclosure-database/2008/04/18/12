could be a lot of things .. do you have tcpdump? .. a packet trace would 
make your attempt at collective troubleshooting a *lot* easier .. but 
DDOS is an easy "malicious" guess. Non-malicious ones could be something 
like a blog/article on that box that just got featured on Digg/Slashdot/etc.

Yeah .. that's how the Internet works.

Do you admin that box at 64.40.117.19? .. if it's a webserver, check the 
logs .. what's being requested?
