"Measurements and Mitigation of Peer-to-Peer-based Botnets: A Case
Study on Storm Worm"

section 4.2 describes the implementation of a sybil attack which is
the most effective way to observe and manipulate DHT's without
endpoint based partitioning of the DHT address space.  (for example,
achord, would make a sybil attack more difficult, but this too can be
mitigated with enough address space on hand...)

the polluting attack appears most effective for the overnet/stormnet
routing described; for other DHT's the index poisoning (Eclipsing
Content in paper) would be even more effective (CAN,KAD,etc).

additional variations on these attacks are described in: "Security
Considerations for Peer-to-Peer Distributed Hash Tables" and
elsewhere.
http://www.cs.rice.edu/Conferences/IPTPS02/173.pdf

if persistent tampering of decentralized botnet C&C is pursued by
researchers and/or industry actors, it will be interesting to watch
the defenses evolve.  defeating sybil attacks and robust resource
discovery have been persistent problems for peer networks of any type.
 (my money is on achord style endpoint id space partitioning and
iterative unicast discovery that would adapt to malicious pollution
effectively and efficiently.)
