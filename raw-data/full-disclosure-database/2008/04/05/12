Well as of recently:

Storm Worm (We need the White House to put pressure on Russia to end
RBN operations.)

Profiteering on FD (Do you know the difference between disclosure and
profiteering? Let's bring an end to hack*spam.)

Vulnerability Pricing (How much should vulnerabilities cost? Let's
phase out the black market.)

Privacy Woes (Sans handler gives out n3td3v e-mail to public, worried?
I am; One of the biggest and most respected security institutions
exposed.)

All the best,

n3td3v
