Hello everyone,

I’ve decided to create a community-supported free IT security training
portal at http://www.FreeITSecurityTraining.com. If you have resources for

legitimate/legal (according to U.S. laws), so please don’t post
copyrighted information.

Here are a few examples of training types to post:

    * Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
    * CompTIA Security+
    * Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
    * Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP)
