I swear I head angels sing when I read this.  Unfortunately, this whole
thread started when you complained, rightly or wrongly, about your
communcations with a Sans handler being released on irc.  Kinda makes this
whole thread inolve you.

At the risk of dragging this kicking and screaming to somewhere remotely
close to on-topic, the general consensus seems to be that you have a point
but the issue isn't as big a deal as you think it should be.  I don't think
continuing this discussion here is going to get you anything else.
