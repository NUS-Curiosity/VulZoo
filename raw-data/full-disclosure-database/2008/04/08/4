No, this thread is about me having a fan, who said he is going to take
up the storm worm with his US government contacts.

We had actually moved on from the sans handler business... new topics
are now on the agenda.

There is actually news on this:

Keith http://blog.securitynow.us/ was intimidated by nasty people who
left horrible comments under the original blog post
http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:z27vNE_ikM0J:blog.securitynow.us/2008/03/19/storm-worm-russian-business-network-rbn/+http://blog.securitynow.us/2008/03/19/storm-worm-russian-business-network-rbn/&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a
which he removed for a short time because people claimed Neal Krawetz
had used a text analysis program to determine I was nothing but a
troll, but Keith doesn't believe this to be the case.

Keith has repost
http://blog.securitynow.us/2008/04/07/storm-worm-russian-business-network-rbn-repost-from-march-19-2008/
his original entry after finding out i'm not a troll.

Infact, Keith is about to post a blog entry against Neal Krawetz to
say his text analysis is flawed and that he stands by what he
originally said.

So, not only is the blog entry back up after being intimidated by
n3td3v enemies, he is about to come out and slam Neal Krawetz.

I'm in talks with Keith at the moment on what the wording of the new
entry about Neal Krawetz will be to slam his smear campaign about me.

I don't know when the blog entry about Neal Krawetz text analysis is
coming out, but stay stuned to http://blog.securitynow.us/ because its
coming soon.

A pdf file of the original post is attached to this e-mail as well, so
when the google cache expires.

The truth will preveil that n3td3v is a serious security researcher
and not a troll, like i've said in the past, Neal Krawetz and a
certain journalist tried to ruin me, so this is the first step to
countering the claims.

All the best,

n3td3v
