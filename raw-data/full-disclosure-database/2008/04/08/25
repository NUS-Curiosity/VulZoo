You can send these messages directly to the trash with Gmail -- play
with the filters.

On the top right dropdown, where it has reply, choose "Filter messages
like this"

Putting "n3td3v" in "has the words:" will mark the message.  click
next, and choose "delete it" or "skip the inbox", for instance.
