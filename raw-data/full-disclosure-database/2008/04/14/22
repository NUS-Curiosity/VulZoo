Do you understand the point of terrorism?  The end goal is not to kill
people.  There are plenty of more effective methods to kill people than
they've been using.  No, the end goal is to cause TERROR.  They want us to
be afraid to live our lives.

Security Theater does more to cause terror in the minds of the people than
it does to deter terrorists from committing these crimes.  People in the US
are starting to believe its reasonable to prevent tourists from taking
pictures from a moving train.  As though taking these photos are somehow
going to threaten our lives.

How does this help?
