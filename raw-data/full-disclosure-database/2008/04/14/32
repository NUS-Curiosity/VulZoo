For the wannabe bomber, the fact that the area has *also* been mapped by Google
Maps and Microsoft Terra and probably bunches of others is probably a lot more
important.  Among other things, the average amateur photo does a really shitty
job of telling you things about stuff like approaches, ramps, lane markings for
turns, and where you can and can't drive a vehicle of a given size.

If the owner of that gatehouse doesn't care about publicly available
satellite imagery at that resolution, why should Yahoo care about amateur
photos?

Yahoo may suck enough to motivate a car bomb, but the owner of the gatehouse
is truly a world-class Hoover.. ;)
