i love my psychotomimetic mind expanders as much as the next guy, but
r4td3ad is really over doing it here!

based on careful analysis of high order syntax and grammer of the
n1td3ad text communications to this list, it becomes readily apparent
that a staggered concomitant consumption of powerful mind altering
substances is at work.

a careful deconstruction of the linguistic transformations and
grammatical structure expressed in writing by this n4dd4d individual
exposes the mental state transitions corresponding to the interplay of
each distinct chemical mind adulterant as it ebbs and flows through
the metabolic cycle of this rambling human organism.

i have built and experimentally confirmed to greater than 99.9999942%
accuracy a finite chemical model [0] of the biochemical brain fuck
that is his chosen melee of psychonaut adventurism, however, the
margin of this email body is not sufficient to contain it.

let it suffice to say, this F.I.N.E. gentleman is enjoying copious
quantities of ritalin, hashish, whippits, adderall, provigil,
cannibis, magic markers, hydrocodone, methamphetamine, absinthe,
no-doze, and the occasional "space monkey" interlude with his mother's
panty-hose round his neck!

please n3tsk4b, share the love! you've got enough mindfuck to satiate
all of DEF CON into sunday!!!
