That would work if I wanted to be subscribed to your group.  "Don't

I'm sure my car and its license plate are on the Internet somewhere.

http://digital-photography-school.com/blog/photographers-rights-and-photography-privacy-advice/

This link gives basic information on what photographers are and are not
allowed to do.  In the "Photographer's right" section, it mentions that
anyone can photographs of whatever they want in public places, or places
where they have permission to do so.

They specifically mention that streets are considered public.

So while Yahoo may potentially have the rights to prevent you from taking
pictures while on their property, they cannot prevent you from taking
pictures of cars that come and go from their property.

Enforcing these rules would have a real cost.  There's the time of the
security guards, court time if they press charges, and
annoyance/inconvenience of their employees.  Is that cost going to be
worthwhile for the little added protection that they provide?   I doubt it,
but at the end of the day, its up to them to decide.

No, its public information.

Names/Addresses/etc is legally protected PII (Personally Identifiable
Information).  License plates/car models are not.
