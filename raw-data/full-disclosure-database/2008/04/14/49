Man, and I thought your tin-foil hat conspiracy bullsh*t was bad enough
before.
Do you, as a PERSONAL MATTER, oppose to Google Street View too, because
showing who parked where is a matter of national security or some other such
bullsh*t?

On a more serious note, PLEASE take your personal opinions off this list.
I don't want to block anyone on this list for fear they might actually, one
day, hopefully, come out with something intelligent so please up your game
and remove your opinion from all your future posts. I feel that this simple
move on your part, will alleviate most of the hatred this group tends to
feel for you.
