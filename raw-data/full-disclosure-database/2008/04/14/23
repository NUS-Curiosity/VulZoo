In fact, a number of people believe this is why we've not seen any more major
attacks from the al Quaeda crew - there's no reason for them to invest time,
effort, and resources in terrifying us when we're doing such a good job of it
ourselves.

I find it hard to believe that n3td3v has read and understood *any* of
Schneiers's writing if he managed to miss the very large and often repeated
message of "Refuse to be terrorized".
