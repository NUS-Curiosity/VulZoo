No, it wastes lots of resources and keeps us from deploying security that
actually works.  There's no indication that the terrorists actually worry very
much about beating security-theater policies, and plenty of indication that the
security theater rules are causing *real* problems - for instance, the recent
event where a pilot's gun went off in the cockpit was likely due to very poor
rules on the part of the TSA:

Actually, there's little or no *real* security behind the theater at most
airports.  If there was, why is there a real and persistent problem with
things like cameras being stolen from inside luggage by baggage handlers?

Starting from such wrong beginnings, your essay goes rapidly downhill from
there.
