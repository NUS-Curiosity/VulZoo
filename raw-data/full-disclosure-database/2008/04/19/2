I've noticed an increase in web application stuff on the list since April 15th.
Please only post these on May 1st...
it will look better if the list is full of xss for one day...and send
out a bigger message to the powers that be who don't take web
application security seriously enough.

Btw, I see what you did there with the e-mail address, nice.

All the best,
