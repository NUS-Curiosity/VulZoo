Synopsis
========

policyd-weight uses temporary files in an insecure manner, allowing for
a symlink attack.

Background
==========

policyd-weight is a Perl policy daemon for the Postfix MTA intended to
eliminate forged envelope senders and HELOs.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                     /   Vulnerable   /         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-filter/policyd-weight      < 0.1.14.17          >= 0.1.14.17

Description
===========

Chris Howells reported that policyd-weight creates and uses the
"/tmp/.policyd-weight/" directory in an insecure manner.

Impact
======

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary
files or change the ownership to the "polw" user via symlink attacks.

Workaround
==========

Set "$LOCKPATH = '/var/run/policyd-weight/'" manually in
"/etc/policyd-weight.conf".

Resolution
==========

All policyd-weight users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=mail-filter/policyd-weight-0.1.14.17"

This version changes the default path for sockets to
"/var/run/policyd-weight", which is only writable by a privileged user.
Users need to restart policyd-weight immediately after the upgrade due
to this change.
