I'm calling for John Cartwright to drop Secunia as a sponsor and make
the list be funded by public donations.

If we don't, this whole e-commerce thing with this list is going to
get worse and worse every year.

There are tons of open source projects that manage to run off public
donations, I'm calling for this to happen.

We don't need Secunia or e-commerce to run and host Full-Disclosure...
we can run it ourselves.

This e-mail is being sent to John Cartwright directly, because we've
got to stop profiteering on the list in every way possible.
