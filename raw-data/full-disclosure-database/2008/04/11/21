What an incredibly Lame-0 quote.  I guess it's just me that is busy today,
but there must not be a whole lot going on in the security world.  It's
amazing that you sit there and rail about trolling when you fuel this
pointless thread for days on end.

Even comedy looses its value to tedium eventually.  Kinda like coming down
from a profound high.

I could not make it through the day without reflecting....
