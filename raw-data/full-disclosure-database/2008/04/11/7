You know n3td3v, conferences are a lot of fun to go to.  I've sat by on FD
and watched you hijack numerous threads, blast out emails that lead to
ridiculous amounts of wated time and resources, and I've never once said
anything against you.  Why?  FD is and always has been an unmoderated list.
That's the point, freedom of speech.

Do the conferences make money?  Obviously, but guess what, so do the
vulnerability research companies like Tipping Point's ZDI and iDefense.
Would you contest that they shouldn't post here either?  How about me?  I've
sold a vulnerability before.  Should I not post here?  Your argument and
gripe is ridiculous and wasting time.  Seriously, for the two emails we get
a month about conferences, you'd think you'd just not worry about it... even
if people making money really is so evil.

Nate

P.S., if you don't like it, find another list.  I doubt many will mind if
you stop reading and posting here.
