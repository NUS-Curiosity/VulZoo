That's pretty funny.

I used to get a kick out of your BS but, I must say, you are getting 
very monotonous with your over inflated self-worth.

You have admitted that all you do is scrape other sites and post their 
knowledge to your "agenda" group.

Basically, you're saying you are a journalist wanna-be. A wanna-be 
newspaper with a google-group page.

How does that make you a mover or shaker in the sec industry?
Grow up.
