It looks as if your ulterior motive is simply to make this list in capable of achieving it's objective.  For month's now, we've subjected to your vapid rantings, and the original focus & purpose has become secondary to the focused bile towards you.  It would be hard to quantify how many researchers have left and issues have not been posted due to your juvenile behavior.  Hopefully, Mr. Cartwright will follows his guidelines and simply block you, and then perhaps we can get back to real business.

I'm calling for John Cartwright to drop Secunia as a sponsor and make
the list be funded by public donations.

If we don't, this whole e-commerce thing with this list is going to
get worse and worse every year.

There are tons of open source projects that manage to run off public
donations, I'm calling for this to happen.

We don't need Secunia or e-commerce to run and host Full-Disclosure...
we can run it ourselves.

This e-mail is being sent to John Cartwright directly, because we've
got to stop profiteering on the list in every way possible.
