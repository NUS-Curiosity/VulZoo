How about everyone just STFU. You are killing me with these damn emails. I've not been reading them but I do glance over the subject, sender, and sometime a bit of the body, so I don't really know what's going on, but what I do know is that I am really tired of the same email subject spam my inbox because you guys have to compare E-dicks.
STICK to the topic!

 Razi Shaban, why are you on the list? All you've been doing is
 trolling me like Ureleet has and causing threads to go into 60+
 e-mails for no reason.
