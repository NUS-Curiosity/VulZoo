Holy sheepshit, internets! Blanket-Man[1] has wrung out his loin cloth 
and is ready to fly-tackle more heavy metal t-shirt wearing nerds with 
large egos and irc handles. Yes, it's time to open up your ~/haxing 
folder and get your talk together for Kiwicon 2k8! We've put out the 
black t-shirts, and deflated some satellite radomes, so where, as our 
more criminal yet fetchingly bikini clad cousins might say, the bloody 
hell are you?

The Kiwicon Crüe is proud to announce the initial call for presenters 
for the second installment of New Zealand's very own security 
conference: Kiwicon 2k8.

[About]

Kiwicon2k8 is intended to be an informal conference, drawing on the 
wider security community of Australia and New Zealand. It will be held 
in Wellington, New Zealand, on the weekend of the 27th and 28th of 
September, 2008.

Kiwicon's focus is on sharing information; ideas, code, and good whisky, 
in a rabelaisan carnival of security, nerdery, and *nix beards.

Last year, the inaugural Kiwicon ended up being kind of a big deal: 
highlights included tmasky's mighty Crackstation, the debut of Beau 
Butler as an "ethical hacker" making Microsoft "look like turkeys", and 
of course the Kiwicon Hax0r Quiz, with the winner taking the grand prize 
of An Illustrated Guide to the Commoner Skin Diseases. Hope it came in 
handy for the post-con diagnosis phase, dude.

This year, Kiwicon's own Bogan is already making anti-virus vendors 
quake in their little signature-laden booties at Defcon's Race to Zero, 
and the cauldron of 0h-0h-0hday in Brett Moore's secret Insomnia lair is 
bubbling over with pernicious brew. If you missed last Kiwicon (not 
"professional enough"? couldn't convince your boss it wasn't a hoax?) 
then find one of the 230+ people who were there and ask them if they're 
just-not-gonna-bother this year.

[Venue]

Our hosts for the weekend will, once again, be Victoria University of 
Wellington. If you have any memory of last year's Kiwicon, then it'll 
look disturbingly familiar.

The campus has the advantage of being close to the center of the city 
and its' various amenities. This includes cheap accommodation, good 
coffee, and, more importantly, several good pubs serving good, 
non-Australian, beer.

[Costs]

Kiwicon2k8 is a non-profit, non-commercial, non-corporate-funded event.

Attendance for the entire weekend will cost $50 for employed individuals 
(self-employed and salaried). There is a discounted rate of $30 for 
students and the unemployed. GST receipts can be issued upon request. If 
your management can't be convinced of the value of something that only 
costs $50, we're happy to issue you with some kind of personalised 
limited edition invitation in crayon, glitter pen, and macaroni 
(spray-painted gold for that luxe look) for the low enterprise-only 
price of $500.

Suggested topics include but are not limited to:

      - Crowd Control Techniques and Panic Modeling
      - Information Warfare / Industrial Espionage
      - Malware (Viruses, Spam, Phishing, Botnets)

There is no pre-determined talk length but we ask that speakers limit 
their presentation to an hour, including some question time.

Since Kiwicon is a non-profit organisation, there is no funding 
available for travel and/or accomodation, even for IT rockstars. 
However, if your talk is accepted, a formal letter will be provided for 
employer leverage, and almost certainly, unless you're a complete 
jackoff, people will try and buy you beer.

To submit a presentation to Kiwicon2k8, send an email to cfp@...icon.org 
with the following information:

Greetz and thanks to all who helped make Kiwicon 2k7 the awesomeness it 
was, we'll see you fuckers again this year. Thick, meaty props to Pipes 
for stepping up and making 2k7 happen. We would miss you, but Sharrow's 
just as tall, and better looking. Sorry pal.
