Subject: Critical Vulnerability in SNMPc

=======
Summary
=======
Name: Unauthenticated Stack Overflow in SNMPc
Release Date: 30 April 2008
Reference: NGS00526
Discover: Wade Alcorn <wade@...software.com> and John Heasman
<john@...software.com>
Vendor: Castle Rock Computing
Systems Affected: SNMPc versions 7.1 and earlier
Risk: Critical
Status: Published

===========
Description
===========
Wade Alcorn and John Heasman of NGSSoftware have discovered a stack
overflow vulnerability in Castle Rock Computing SNMPc Network Manager.
SNMPc Network Manger is a distributed network management system that
allows monitoring of the network infrastructure. It employs a
distributed polling agent architecture which uses SNMP TRAPs to provide
a solution capable of monitoring networks with up to ten thousand
devices. An SNMP TRAP initiated by a network element is sent to the
SNMPc Network Manager to allow monitoring of the infrastructure.

=================
Technical Details
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited when an overly long community string
is sent in the SNMP TRAP packet. The packets format will be valid ASN.1,
including the length of the community string. An attacker can craft a
single UDP packet that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code in
the context of LocalSystem.

===============
Fix Information
===============
NGSSoftware wish to note that Castle Rock Computing were extremely
pro-active in addressing this issue.

The latest version (SNMPc 7.1.1) can be downloaded from the Castle Rock
Computing website: http://www.castlerock.com/.
