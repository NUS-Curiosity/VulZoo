I'd be more curious what the requirements are on the host machine.

Meaning if you disable autorun on all USB/Firewire/"hot-plug" devices
does it potentially eliminate this threat?

Yes, rebooting from the USB key will obviate any Windows
policies/settings but the goal seems to stem from getting "live" data
from the system while it's running.

It doesn't only read memory.  It does other things as well...

But not quite like a bootable CD either...
