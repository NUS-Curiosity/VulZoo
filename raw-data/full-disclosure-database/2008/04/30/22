Can't help but think of the Group Policy that disables
usbstor.sys.(http://www.petri.co.il/disable_usb_disks_with_gpo.htm for
some info)

Surely that driver could be replaced (with some windows file
protection workarounds as well, obviously) that would perhaps prompt
before allowing the device to be mounted?  Require a PW to allow it to
be mounted?

Just a thought.  I'd think something along those lines though, would
disable this tool.
