It needs Windows.  I'd assume 2000 and forward...  But that's an
assumption.  It just makes sense when I think of the security of the
OS's - that that's what it'd be...

I doubt it.  They probably have something coded into the device that
works with something "special" within Windows.  But again, just an
assumption.  I haven't gotten my paws on one of these yet.  Though I'm
sure that it you look hard enough, it can be found.

Yes, so from what I've read.  It sounds like, the box is running.  All
that you do, is plug this device in, it does the rest for you.  You
just sit there like a good little monkey and wait till it's done.

I am thinking that this device is going to be akin to the CD-rom that
you could use that had the autorun setup that would disable a password
protected screen saver in Windows 9x.  Basically, walk up to any
machine, pop in the disk, wait a minute and POOF, all done.

What is really baking my noodle though - how do we protect ourselves
from these?  Because, one pissed off employee with one of these things
could put an organization into some deep crap, real quick like...

We really need more information on these devices...
