And the top comment as I write this is:

http://www.news.com/5208-10784_3-0.html?forumID=1&threadID=37227&messageID=402998&start=-1

"'Phishing' is over 3 years old. Why bother with this post now, in 2008?"

And I have to agree here - if Google finally got on board after all this
time, which is more likely:

1) That somebody high up from the FBI or DHS or other TLA leaned on them to
get with the program already...
or
2) That they got (or were about to get) a whole pile of bad press in
ComputerWorld or InformationWeek or Bruce Schneier's blog or other information
source often read by other movers-and-shakers...
or
3) That they listened to some unemployed blogger with no public record of being
taken seriously from the other side of the big puddle.
