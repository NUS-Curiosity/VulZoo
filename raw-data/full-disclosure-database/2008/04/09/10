Good point regarding English grammar. I would definitely dissent with 
someone who proved to be inordinately picky regarding sentence construction 
or style.

Still, good grammar and judicious use of writing style has its uses. Here 
are two: professionalism and persuasiveness (yes, they're not mutually 
exclusive). Bad writing leads to--fairly or otherwise--a lacking in 
credibility. It looks unprofessional and leaves you with a smaller audience 
of people who will take your points seriously (again, right or wrong). 
You're left only with people who know you or are willing to overlook the 
frequent grammatical and stylistic faux pas. By reducing your audience, you 
reduce the effectiveness of your writing, needlessly.

Persuasiveness (related to professionalism, of course) also suffers when 
writing style is poor. It's hard to be persuasive if the reader finds the 
points confusing due to sentence construction, style, or other reasons. And, 
as mentioned, one is less persuasive if readers find the writing style 
unprofessional.

Bottom line: if being professional and persuasive aren't important, then 
writing style and attention to grammatical detail aren't that important. 
Otherwise, they are very important. Depends on your audience, motivations, 
and ambitions.
