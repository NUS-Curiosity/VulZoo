I really need to learn how to reply for the list and not just the person
posting, sorry for the duplicate, bud.

I applaud your contribution to the discussion of comptuer security.  But
really, posting a reply to a news blog isn't telling anyone anything, you're
just chiming in your own comments.  I would love to see CNet News publish
your wrods, but I don't think that will happen.  I could comment on a wide
number of things, but that doesn't make me an expert.  I see your point, but
you don't really offer a solution.  That's like standing on a corner with a
sign that says something like "you're going to hell," but not trying to save
us.  In the end, aside from being a comment on a news blog, and promoting
your name, what purpose did that comment have?  Any monkey with half a brain
could realize that computers that aren't on the internet are still
susceptible to attack.  It's just that your chances of attack are increased
(albeit minimally) with the volume of people who have access to it (more
people = people on the internet).  How do we protect against the threat you
were making everyone aware of?

I smell FUD...
