You know what's funny, look what just appeared in the last 30 minutes
on Cnet News after I post that stuff:

Hewlett-Packard has released a batch of USB keys for numerous Proliant
server models which contain malware that could allow an attacker to
take over an infected system.

The worms contained on the 256KB and 1GB USB drives have been
identified as W32.Fakerecy and W32.SillyFDC. The worms spread by
copying themselves to removable or mapped drives and affect systems
running Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows XP, Windows Me, Windows NT and
Windows 2000, according to AusCERT.

HP's Software Security Response Team issued a warning to AusCERT this
week after discovering the worms on the USB drives and has also
provided a list of affected servers to the security response
organization.

To find out whether a drive is infected, HP recommends inserting it
into a system with up-to-date antivirus software. Systems with
up-to-date antivirus should be protected from the threat, according to
HP.

John Bambenek, a researcher at the security organization Sans Internet
Storm Center, has said that because the infected USBs only affect
Proliant servers, a targeted attack cannot be ruled out.

It kind of backs up what I said last night, who says n3td3v has no
credibility? ;)
