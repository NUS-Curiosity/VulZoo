Patching your offline systems is important, but I wouldn't recommed  
doing it just as fast as your offline ones.

If you have a choice between patching all systems within a month of  
patching online systems within a week, definitely patch the online  
ones faster.

Much like triage in a medical emergency, you should assess your  
patching based on risk.
