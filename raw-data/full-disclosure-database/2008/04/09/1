Fact is, n3td3v, we're all out to get you. I apologize for not mentioning 
that earlier.

Oh, the NSA is after you as well and is actively involved in the smear 
campaign. Why? Because, due to your extensive security research, you are a 
potential threat. At some point you'll be abducted, but I don't think 
they've set a date yet.

In related news, I suspect many of us have already subscribed to your blog's 
RSS feed, so pls keep us updated...
