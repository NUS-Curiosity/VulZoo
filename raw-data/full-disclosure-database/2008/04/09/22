The security report includes details of the findings, the impact of the issue 
and recommendations on how to mitigate the problem.

Nipper currently supports the following device types:

  * Cisco IOS-based routers
  * Cisco IOS-based catalysts
  * Cisco NMP-based catalysts
  * Cisco CatOS-based catalysts
