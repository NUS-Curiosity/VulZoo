Dude, since you've decided to babble at the security community, I'd suggest you
learn something about it before trying to re-work it. Calling, me, (heh) a big
company, and starting quixotic "revolutions" isn't a good use of this space.
Not that I don't love you plastering my conference name all over your rantings,
but even *I* am getting bored of this thread now.

cheers,

I see Full-Disclosure as the peoples mailing list, its not a clone of
Securityfocus and we shouldn't let it turn into such.

Keep the uniqueness of Full-Disclosure and have it run by public donations.

Reject profiteering.

I remember back in the day when Full-Disclosure was underground and
wasn't e-commerce oriented, its time to move it back to the peoples
mailing list funded by the people.

The industry think Full-Disclosure is a soft touch, unmoderated clone
of Securityfocus, think again.

People outcry on this list when we don't agree with something and
thats whats happening now.

Its time for a revolution to happen.
