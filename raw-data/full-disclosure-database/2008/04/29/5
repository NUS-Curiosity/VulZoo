Description:
    Previous versions of the firefox package are vulnerable to several
    types of attacks, some of which are understood to allow compromised
    or malicious sites to run arbitrary code as the user running firefox.
    
    29 April 2008 Update: updated to address a stability problem during
    JavaScript garbage collection that was introduced by the previous
    update.  It has not been determined that this stability problem is a
    security vulnerability.
