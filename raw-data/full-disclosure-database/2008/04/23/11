Well I expect to start the indulgence of the bank holiday early; no 
"real" work, no email == nada.  (or: many ciggy breaks, work you benefit 
from doing/learning, ignore you're line mangers requests and the pub at 
lunch time;.

Don't do Jack.

Well it's May Day coming you gotta indulge! It is the socialist day, or 
have I got that wrong?



Cheers,

Dan.
