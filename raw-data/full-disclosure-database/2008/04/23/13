Subject: Researcher programmer

We had "security researcher", we had "vulnerability researcher". now
we have "researcher programmer".

"I would say this is the next evolutionary step in the malware
development cycle," said John C. Bambenek, a handler at the Internet
Storm Center, a network-monitoring group, and researcher programmer at
the University of Illinois."

Hackers are now a researcher programmer!!!! Can you tell Securityfocus
has a pro white house agenda?

I'm not hacker, i'm a security researcher, vulnerability researcher,
no I mean a "researcher programmer".

Are you sure its Robert Lemos writing this stuff, its something Bush
would come up with!!!

Is that the new cotton wool phrase they give to the Sans guys, so not
to dress them up as HD Moore's or hackers...

HD Moore is gonna be pissed next time if he isn't classed as a
researcher programmer, he doesn't want to be in with the security
researcher crowd, thats just lamecore.

All the best,
