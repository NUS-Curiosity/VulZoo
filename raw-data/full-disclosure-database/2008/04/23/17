If you office workers / security industry fucks think are going to be
having a lazy time in the pub on May 1st you have got another thing
coming, the XSS boys are going to make sure your bleeper is bleeping
right in the middle of your finest beer to get you the fuck back to
your desk and reading FD, fucker!

The security community decide when you get to goto the pub to have a
beer and decide which day offs you get, dickwad.

Web Application Security Awareness Day is coming, and you think you're
just going to sit back casually in a pub and drink a beer? You are
going to be fucked mother fucker.
