Synopsis
========

NX uses code from the X.org X11 server which is prone to multiple
vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

NoMachine's NX establishes remote connections to X11 desktops over
small bandwidth links. NX and NX Node are the compression core
libraries, whereas NX is used by FreeNX and NX Node by the binary-only
NX servers.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/nxnode     < 3.1.0-r2                        >= 3.1.0-r2
  2  net-misc/nx         < 3.1.0-r1                        >= 3.1.0-r1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Multiple integer overflow and buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been
discovered in the X.Org X server as shipped by NX and NX Node
(vulnerabilities 1-4 in GLSA 200801-09).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities via unspecified
vectors, leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user on the machine running the NX server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All NX Node users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/nxnode-3.1.0-r2"

All NX users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/nx-3.1.0-r1"
