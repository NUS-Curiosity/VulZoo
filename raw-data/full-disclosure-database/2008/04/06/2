Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in MySQL might lead to privilege escalation
and Denial of Service.

Background
==========

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/mysql      < 5.0.54                              >= 5.0.54

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in MySQL:

* Mattias Jonsson reported that a "RENAME TABLE" command against a
  table with explicit "DATA DIRECTORY" and "INDEX DIRECTORY" options
  would overwrite the file to which the symlink points (CVE-2007-5969).

* Martin Friebe discovered that MySQL does not update the DEFINER
  value of a view when the view is altered (CVE-2007-6303).

* Philip Stoev discovered that the federated engine expects the
  response of a remote MySQL server to contain a minimum number of
  columns in query replies (CVE-2007-6304).

Impact
======

An authenticated remote attacker could exploit the first vulnerability
to overwrite MySQL system tables and escalate privileges, or use the
second vulnerability to gain privileges via an "ALTER VIEW" statement.
Remote federated MySQL servers could cause a Denial of Service in the
local MySQL server by exploiting the third vulnerability.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-5.0.54"
