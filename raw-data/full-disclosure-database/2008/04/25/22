You are a wonderful, wonderful, horrible, wonderful person.

XSSWORM will make a comeback especially for may1 WebAppSecurityDay
(WASD) with release of plenty of 0day XSRF persistant reverse
injection vulnerability exploitation frameworks.

Never change *hugs*

Actual Hacker.

Some guy has sent me this unsolicited message, obviously he didn't read:

"All submissions must be legal and above board, I do not want things
compromised."

All the best,
