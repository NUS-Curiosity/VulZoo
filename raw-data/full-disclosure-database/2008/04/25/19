Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Comix may lead to execution of arbitrary
commands and a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Comix is a GTK comic book viewer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/comix     < 3.6.4-r1                        >= 3.6.4-r1

Description
===========

Comix does not properly sanitize filenames containing shell
metacharacters when they are passed to the rar, unrar, or jpegtran
programs (CVE-2008-1568). Comix also creates directories with
predictable names (CVE-2008-1796).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit the first vulnerability by enticing a
user to use Comix to open a file with a specially crafted filename,
resulting in the execution of arbitrary commands. The second
vulnerability could be exploited by a local attacker to cause a Denial
of Service by creating a file or directory with the same filename as
the predictable filename used by Comix.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Comix users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/comix-3.6.4-r1"
