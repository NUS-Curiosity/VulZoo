Subject:  Researcher programmer

Hi folks, 

 

Let's stop the low level of this discussion because it don't takes to any
place besides generate more flames.

What do you think to change the matter of this discussion to a more
constructive theme, like exploits, for example ? ;-)

 

Have a nice day,

 

Richard
