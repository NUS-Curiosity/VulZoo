            FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - APR 1, 200(2<<2)

    METASPLOIT CORPORATION ANNOUNCES VERSION 4.0 
OF THE METASPLOIT FRAMEWORK WITH EXCITING FEATURES
       AND A CLOSED SOURCE LICENSE AGREEMENT.  

After over a year and a half in stealth-mode, Metasploit Corporation has announced
the 4.0 release of their flag-ship product, The Metasploit Framework.  The new
release comes jam-packed with exciting features that are sure to please even
the German legal system.  The following brief list includes some of the more
fantastic changes.

PWNCRAFT!

Tired of fighting the good fight with the tried and true user interfaces you've
come to expect from exploitation frameworks?  Seeing a command shell for the
5000th time got you down?  Well, you're in luck.  Metasploit has decided to
return to its rootz in '08 and focus on the exploitation-as-a-game model.
PwnCraft brings the worlds of ownage and pwnage together for the first time in
a revolutionary Real Time Strategy (RTS) world.  Don't be fooled by the
game-like interface, though!  The actions you take in PwnCraft have a real
effect on the world around you!  Here's just a taste of some of the absolutely
insane features you can look forward to:

  - Glide through enemy networks with a squadron of elegant winged pwnies
  - Launch devastating attacks against enemy ports in an all-out IPS-evading
    TCP/IP assault
  - Use the fuzzy Burrowing Badger unit to discover 0day flaws in enemy
    defenses
  - Conqueer cities and installing agents who can sabotage and smuggle other
    units to new Vistas
  - An entirely in-game interface to the vulnerability sharing market to
    improve your arsenal on the fly!
  - AND MORE!

Beta testing of PwnCraft is currently underway and we are hoping to begin
releasing it in stores at a retail price of $49.99 in Q3 2009.  More details
about the game can be found on the Metasploit website:

CLOSED SOURCE LICENSE

After years of struggling to define Metasploit's licensing position a final
decision has been made to "screw it" and move the framework to a closed source
license agreement.  The decision was made to sell out for a number of reasons,
not the least of which has to do with the benjamins.  Metasploit 2.x and 3.x
will no longer be available for public download.
