I never once mentioned anything about the zero day initiative? Can you
find where I mentioned about the zero day initiative.
They have nothing to do with this, they don't spam the mailing lists
to make money. All i've seen them do is disclose vulnerabilities,
which is fair play e-mail. I'm a big fan of the zero day initiative, I
have no gripes with them whatsoever.
