Whether or not the vulnerability exists as described this email is
laughable. Addressing it to "world leaders" shows everyone you're a
self-deceiving egomaniac. Complaining that the NSA, CIA, and FBI didn't
respond to your ravings makes perfect sense for 3 reasons: first, nobody
takes such poorly written rants seriously. Second, those agencies don't to
collect vulnerability data, that's the job of DHS and NIST with their NVD
and US-CERT projects. Third, I've worked with a lot of federal agencies and
none of them use this software, why would they when a perfectly usable
remote assistance technology is already built into Windows? Oh, and by the
way, employees at those agencies can't install the software themselves
because their desktops are locked down and they don't have admin privileges.

      ====================================

 Solid Information Security State Release #0012a

MARKING: RESTRICTIONS APPLY.
FAO: WORLD LEADERS

== Introduction ==
Serious high-risk ultra critical vulnerability has
been identified in Remote Help application that maybe
used by CIA, NSA and FBI employees when helping
colleagues on anti-terror campaigns.RemoteHelp is a
minimal http server that allows to view and control a
remote pc running a 32-bits version of Microsoft
Windows.
current version is 0.0.6 and runs stand-alone or
installs as a service.

== URL ==
http://sourceforge.net/projects/remotehelp/ 

== HISTORY ==
After n3td3v agenda emailed the NSA, SANS and all
information security groups and was found not to be
taken seriously. High risk proof of concept exploit
code has been authored for severe vulnerability in
Remote Help application which maybe used by any number
of Yahoo!, Google!, Ebay! or NSA employees. This
vulnerability gives rise to serious national
infrastructure risk and should not be under estimated!

== Proof of Concept ==
I found a vulnerability in the pages.c file which
generates the login page dialog and authenticates a
user after it checks if your "user" and "pass"
parameter match the defaults
(user/default) it does this:

   strncpy(cookie,"user=default; path=/; expires=Sun,
11-May-2030 22:11:40 GMT",1024);

for a valid login and for an invalid login it sets an
expired cookie like so;
   strncpy(cookie,"user=default; path=/; expires=Sun,
11-May-1970 22:11:40 GMT",1024);

all you have to do is add "Cookie: user=default;
path=/; expires=Sun, 11-May-2030 22:11:40 GMT" to your
HTTP request and you can bypass
authentication to the Remote Help server and access
the filesystem/exec commands/view the webcam of the
hosts running it.
