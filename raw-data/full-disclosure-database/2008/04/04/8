This is an unmoderated list. Unmoderated:

What's an unmoderated list?
An unmoderated list is one where your messages are automatically sent to 
all the other list subscribers, without human intervention.

Unmoderated.

 From seclists.org:

Full Disclosure -- An unmoderated high-traffic forum for disclosure of 
security information. Fresh vulnerabilities sometimes hit this list many 
hours before they pass through the Bugtraq moderation queue. The relaxed 
atmosphere of this quirky list provides some comic relief and certain 
industry gossip. Unfortunately 80% of the posts are worthless drivel, so 
finding the gems takes patience.

Truer words never spoken. =-)
