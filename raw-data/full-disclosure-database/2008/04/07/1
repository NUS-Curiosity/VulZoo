What does n3td3v do? I read uk/world news and cyber security news
articles and post them to my news group that I think people want to
read.

If you're not happy with that and it doesn't meet your leet enough
standards then too bad, because that's all I am and all I want to be.

I don't know what you were expecting from me and what your leet
expectation were of me but oh well.

Take care with whatever area of cyber security you're interested in,
friend. Weather that be the code scene or the political scene of cyber
security. I'm only into the political scene, I leave the hacking and
releasing vulnerabilities to the young ones who have something to
prove to the world.

I *do* admire people who do code and want to prove themselves on the
world stage as an elite hacker. I take an interest in the code scene,
but I have no plans to participate in it.

I hope I have clarified my position on what leetness I am enough for
you to understand.

People change, interests change. Maybe one day a long time ago I
thought I was a hacker, but these days I couldn't care less about
leetness and hacker credability.
