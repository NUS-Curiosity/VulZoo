I'm not a kid, i'm born 1981...

If Gadi Evron stays off FD with his political agenda, i'll stay off it
as well, otherwise its full steam ahead with the political agenda as
is Gadi Evron.

I'm not staying off FD now or in the future, if there is something I
want to bring up, i'll bring it up. I talk with John Cartwright via
e-mail all the time, he is OK with me being on FD, he is the list
administrator.

n3td3v the group was started in 2004 and Funsec was started in 2005...

I have the right to free speech as does Gadi Evron, its what
Full-Disclosure believes in.

All the best,

n3td3v
