Subject: Re: n3td3v has a fan

Razi, at this point you've pretty much gone over the line.  I'd consider
calling him a lot of things, but spammer isn't one of them.

You're definition of spam is not a generally accepted one, and shouldn't
be used to describe what n3td3v does.  His emails are hardly bulk, and
are directed at a list of users who have *subscribed* to FD.  If you
aren't willing to tolerate or at least deal with the noise level, you
should find a moderated list.

So long as FD is unmoderated, there will be wide range of topics posted,
not all of which are immediately pertinent to a disclosure of a
vulnerability in code/applications/sites.

If you don't want to see the noise, filter it out and stop responding to
it.
