i dont know why you feel that way.  you tell me how you feel.  how am i
supposed to know how you feel?  im not taking you on, i dont care.

no, no one is 'challenging' you.  i am just sharing my views, as is everyone
else on the list about you.  it seems pretty negative at this point.

and?  i havent seen any major corporations (or anything) step up to support
you either.  all i see is that you are full of
hotair/wind/talk/noise/repostings.

how do you know that you are ahead of me?  assumption?  or cockiness?

who says i am trying to win anything?  i'm just sharing my opinion, the same
as you shuld be doing, but instead you are trying to have a pissing contest
with the community.  i read dr krawetz's paper, i thought it was
interesting, and i did observe some interesting things about you.
 especially in terms of your writing style.  some times its correct,
sometimes its not.  i think dr krawetz's paper is interesting, i am not sure
if its correct.  nor do i care.

you assume i am nothing, and i have no need to form a group, again, i dont
care.  just sharing my opinion, and trying to understand why no one (that i
have seen on here) believes or listens to you.  im not saying that someone
doesn't listen to you, somewhere, but i havent seen it here.  no, i am not
going to ask you for proof, because im not participating in the pissing
contest you are presently having with everyone else. and a ureleet group is
just absurd.  laughable at best.  sad that n3td3v is a group, and can't be
just a person.

im not going to ask you to define noob, because that then would elicit a
response from you...  i have no need to join a group. i participate in the
things i find interesting.  you, presently, are interesting.  simply because
you are so...  i don't know.. i can't think of the word

know why you want me to be.
