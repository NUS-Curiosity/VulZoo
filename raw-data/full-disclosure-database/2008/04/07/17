I came on the list with on-topic stuff on what the description of the
list is about.

I never came on with *let's have a chat about n3td3v.*

This list isn't about n3td3v, so stop talking about me.

All I wanted to talk about was the cyber security topics I brought up,
not a personal argument about n3td3v. So if you've got nothing to add
about the original cyber security topics I brought up, then stop
replying and turning this into a list about n3td3v.
