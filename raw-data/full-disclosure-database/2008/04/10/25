Allow me to posit the following: "netdev" wants attention, even if its 
negative attention. I.e., he is intentionally saying things that are 
inflammatory/unintelligent/provocative so as to arouse a reaction.

To say that this is out of stupidity (or that netdev is unintelligent) is a 
conclusion that--while possible--is far from certain (other list subscribers 
might know him better than I do and therefore be in a better position to 
judge). There are intelligent people who might engage in this behavior as a 
form of stress relief, due to personality aberrations, or simply because 
they derive euphoria from the reaction. Absent of data on correlations to 
intelligence, it would be irresponsible to gauge intelligence from netdev's 
behavior. (Though, one could use aggregated information based on behavioral 
patterns, articles he's written, etc, to form a more comprehensive analysis. 
But, doing so would feed into his desire for attention, and thus would be 
ill-advised if my conjecture is correct.)
