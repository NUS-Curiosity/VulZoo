Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.09.08: EMC
 DiskXtender Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.09.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 09, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

EMC DiskXtender is a data backup and migration suite. It consists of
several applications that are used to manage storing large quantities
of files across multiple storage devices. The main components of the
product suite are the File System Manager, the MediaStor and the
License Server. These components all create RPC endpoints that can be
accessed remotely. For more information see the vendor's website at the
following URL.

http://software.emc.com/products/product_family/diskxtender_family.htm

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an authentication bypass vulnerability in EMC
Corp.'s DiskXtender could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Each of the main components of the DiskXtender suite is vulnerable to an
authentication bypass vulnerability. Specifically, the authentication
code contains a hard-coded login and password. By connecting to the RPC
interface, and logging on with these credentials, it is possible to
bypass the normal authentication process.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in an unauthenticated
attacker gaining administrative access to the DiskXtender server. This
allows an attacker to create and delete files on the backup server, and
run other DiskXtender commands. This could potentially lead to the
execution of arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in DiskXtender
version 6.20.060 for Windows. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.
