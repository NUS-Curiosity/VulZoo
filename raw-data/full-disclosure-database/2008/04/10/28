Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.09.08: EMC
 DiskXtender File System Manager Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.09.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 09, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

EMC DiskXtender is a data backup and migration suite. It consists of
several applications that are used to manage storing large quantities
of files across multiple storage devices. One of the components of
DiskXtender is the File System Manager, which is used to create and
manage backups. For more information see the vendor's website at the
following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in EMC Corp.'s
DiskXtender could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the affected service.

The File System Manager is prone to a stack-based buffer overflow
vulnerability. When handling requests on the RPC interface with UUID
b157b800-aef5-11d3-ae49-00600834c15f, the service does not properly
validate the length of a string in the request. By making a specially
crafted request, a stack based buffer overflow occurs.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the affected service, usually SYSTEM. In
order to exploit this vulnerability, authentication is required.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in DiskXtender
version 6.20.060 for Windows. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.
