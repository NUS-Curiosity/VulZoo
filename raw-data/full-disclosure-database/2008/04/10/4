Subject: Open proxy scanner experience

So yesterday a network that I do work for had it¹s mail server scanned.  I
reported the scan (snort reported nmap ­F scan) to the offending netblock
owner, thinking that they had a compromised machine.  I was surprised to
receive an email this morning stating ³Oh that¹s just our open proxy
scanner².  Now....I¹ve dealt with some open proxy scanners and seeing the
activity before, but GOOD GANDHI...they scanned the ENTIRE port range of the
machine..it took almost 3 hours from start to finish.  Has anyone else seen
such aggressive ³open proxy² scanning like that?
