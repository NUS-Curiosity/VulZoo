If Keith read Neal's analysis as saying you were a troll, he totally misread it.
Neal was analyzing the text and drawing conclusions regarding age, education,
and location.  Trollhood wasn't one of the things measured, because it usually
takes a bit more than simple text analysis to detect (other than intentionally
stupid/humorous trolling styles like the all-caps B1FF).

In other words, Neal was testing for things you can measure with a program, and
not need 2 neurons to rub together.  However, those readers that have some
functional neurons can draw their own conclusions regarding trollhood.
