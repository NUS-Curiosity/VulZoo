I did a filter for n3td3v in the subject line to filter out that 63 email conversation.

What laws are they breaking?  How hard is it for you to create a filter on your mail account for the same message to be removed?

 I'm calling for a security conference mailing list to be setup, this
 is getting beyond a joke now all this unlawful commercial spam.
 If you want to make money, then go buy ads and page impressions on
 websites the legitimate way. Please someone setup a security
 conference and training mailing list for those who want to spam, then
 the rest of us can get back to talking cyber security.
 
 I've seen this same message multiple times from various mailing lists
 on my inbox, i'm not too happy about it to be honest we need to get
 this issue sorted because the number of security conferences is
 increasing every year.

 "EuSecWest 2008 Conference, May 21-22 - GBP £1000 (CAD $2000.000)"
 
 These people are making big money and they shouldn't be allowed free
 way to spam.
 
 They have the money to buy ads on websites, so off and do it like
 every other_big_ company.
 
 I'm calling for a major clamp down on commercial spam on the mailing
 lists who aren't disclosing vulnerabilities.
 
 I have no problems with big companies who spam who are disclosing a
 vulnerability, but just an advert for sake of making money is out of
 order.
