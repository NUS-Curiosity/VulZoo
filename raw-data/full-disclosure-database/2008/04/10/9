Hate to burst your bubble, but insider threats have been understood as an
issue since well before you were born.

The Gospel of Luke, Chapter 16:

1 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had
a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee?
give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.
3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh
away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.
4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they
may receive me into their houses.
5 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the
first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
6 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill,
and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred
measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
