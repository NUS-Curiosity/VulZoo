I almost missed this little jewel, having the inestimable Mr. "n3td3v" 
in my junk list (anyone else think it odd he always refers to himself in 
the third party?)

I want to see if I can follow the logic here. May 1st is a common day 
for ANTI-capitalism protests. Web applications are tied to e-commerce. 
Therefore, the day you *protest* commerce is the perfect day to hold a 
contest that conceivably you wish to help make commerce more *secure*?  
These threads never  fail to provide some comic relief just when I need it.
