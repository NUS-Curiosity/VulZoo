Perhaps the public belief that security conferences are monitored, and
the public admission by the government that security conferences are
monitored, has killed the original idealology of security conferences?

And thats why these conferences have turn into--not a useful tool for
the security communty to meet and greet, but a commercial tool for the
security industry and an reconnaissance tool for the government...
which overscores what security conferences were originally built for.

For the humble hacker, the pros and cons of going are outweighed...
