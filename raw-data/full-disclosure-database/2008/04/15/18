Subject: Re: Why do the URLs of the post keep changing in
 lists.grok.org.uk?



: I usually keep the links of some interesting vulnerabilities posted in 
: this mailing list. But when I try to access them after 6 months or so, I 
: find that some of the links are invalid and some of them are pointing to 
: different posts? Why does this happen?

When the list administrators recieve a takedown notice or request to 
remove something, they delete the post. This causes the archive to 
re-index and renumber, causing the entire archive to change.

This was noticed by several vulnerability databases that reference posts 
and the above was the explanation received. I suggested that instead of 
deleting the entire message, they should just remove the body of the post 
instead, and replace it with a brief note explaining the content was 
removed at the request of X.
