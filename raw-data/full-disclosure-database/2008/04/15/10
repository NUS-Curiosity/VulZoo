Subject: Why do the URLs of the post keep changing in
	lists.grok.org.uk?

I usually keep the links of some interesting vulnerabilities posted in
this mailing list. But when I try to access them after 6 months or so,
I find that some of the links are invalid and some of them are
pointing to different posts? Why does this happen?

It seems, the URLs are shuffled every few months. Why is it done? And
if it is so, how do other websites link to certain vulnerability posts
in full-disclosure?
