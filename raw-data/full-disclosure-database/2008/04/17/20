I can't stress enough to people taking part, your entry is only valid
on May 1, if you post on May 2, May 3, April 30 your research papers,
and bugs won't be counted, and your name won't appear on the n3td3v
website.

Valdis is trying to confuse everyone and derail it, we must ignore
what Valdis says.
