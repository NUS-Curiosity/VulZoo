I don't want to rain on your parade as you actually seem to be trying to do
something positive here but I don't get it.  You're trying to attract guys
who are sitting on web app bugs and haven't published them to publish them
on "web application security day".  You're incentive program is:

1. We wont call you lame/weak if you disclose on this day.
2. You'll get a mention on netdev's mailing list/website

Maybe it's just me but I'm not seeing the attraction?
