   --[ Chat Krew / Full-Disclosure Records Presents Catalog Release 002 ]--

NOTES:

  Welcome to the second release by CKFDR.  ISO9000 is a veteran on the hard 
chatting circuit and a dear friend who is returning to the scene with this
release. This was originally written for Mr. Aitel to sing himself, but on 
his turning down that opportunity, a spoken word interlude was used instead.
Enjoy!
