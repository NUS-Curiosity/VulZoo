   --[ Chat Krew / Full-Disclosure Records Presents Catalog Release 002 ]--

NOTES:

  Welsome to the second release by CKFDR.  ISO9000 is another young musician
  that has a lot of great potentional.  His most recent track is just a sample
  of a greater epic work about the misadventures of a fictional hacker.  This
  track was inspired by the recent Phrack Profile on The Unix Terrorist and
  by some drunken comments made by either Rocky or Gobbles, not sure which one
  though.  Anyhow, we hope you enjoy it and be on the lookout for some more
  upcoming releases this month.
