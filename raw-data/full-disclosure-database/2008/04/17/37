 Vendor OpenOffice OLE DocumentSummaryInformation Heap Overflow
 Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.17.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 17, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

OpenOffice is an open-source desktop office suite for many of today's
popular operating systems. Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is a
proprietary binary file format developed by Microsoft. OLE is used for
Office files such as PowerPoint (PPT), Excel (XLS), and Word (DOC).
More information is available from the following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap based buffer overflow vulnerability in
OpenOffice.org's OpenOffice, as included in various vendors' operating
system distributions, could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability exists within the importer for files stored using the
OLE format. When parsing the "DocumentSummaryInformation" stream, the
vulnerable code does not correctly verify the size of a destination
buffer before copying data from the file into it. This results in an
exploitable heap overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user opening the file. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker must persuade a user to open a malicious
file.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in OpenOffice
version 2.3.1. Other versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
