Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in rsync might lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code when extended attributes are being used.

Background
==========

rsync is a file transfer program to keep remote directories
synchronized.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/rsync     < 2.6.9-r6                         >= 2.6.9-r6

Description
===========

Sebastian Krahmer of SUSE reported an integer overflow in the
expand_item_list() function in the file util.c which might lead to a
heap-based buffer overflow when extended attribute (xattr) support is
enabled.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a file containing specially crafted
extended attributes to an rsync deamon, or entice a user to sync from
an rsync server containing specially crafted files, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code.

Please note that extended attributes are only enabled when USE="acl" is
enabled, which is the default setting.

Workaround
==========

Disable extended attributes in the rsync daemon by setting "refuse
options = xattrs" in the file "/etc/rsyncd.conf" (or append "xattrs" to
an existing "refuse" statement). When synchronizing to a server, do not
provide the "-X" parameter to rsync. You can also disable the "acl" USE
flag for rsync and recompile the package.

Resolution
==========

All rsync users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/rsync-2.6.9-r6"
