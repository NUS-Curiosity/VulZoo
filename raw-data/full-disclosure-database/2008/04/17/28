FYI - my previous email was entirely facetious. To my knowledge, a list 
entitled "List of Enemies To Be Smitten" does not exist (yet?) and the 
referenced Wikipedia page is merely a fabrication.

All *I* did was point out that people with actual exploits might be enemies
of "the n3td3v agenda", whatever the heck that is. If n3td3v wants to get
mad at anybody, it should be *them*.  I don't have any exploits worth 
posting,
so I *cant* diss n3td3v by posting them some day other than May 1.

information.
