Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.17.08: Multiple
 Vendor OpenOffice EMF EMR_BITBLT Record Integer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.17.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 17, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

OpenOffice is an open-source desktop office suite for many of today's
popular operating systems. One of the file formats that OpenOffice
supports is Windows Enhanced Metafile (EMF). EMF files are used to
render images. More information is available from the following URL.

http://www.openoffice.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in OpenOffice,
as included in various vendors' operating system distributions, allows
attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged
in user.

The vulnerability exists within the code responsible for parsing the
EMR_STRETCHBLT record in an EMF file. This code reads in two 32-bit
integers from the file, and then uses them in an arithmetic operation
that calculates the number of bytes to allocate for a dynamic buffer.
This calculation can overflow, resulting in an insufficiently sized
buffer being allocated. Subsequently, this buffer is overflowed with
data from the file.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user opening the file. In order to
exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must persuade a user to open a
malicious file.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in OpenOffice
version 2.3. Other versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
