Subject: Announcement - DeepSec Conference 2008,
	Nov 11-14 2008

== Announcement and 1st Call for Papers  ==

We are happy to invite you to the second DeepSec In-Depth Security
Conference from November 11th to 14th at the Imperial Riding School
Renaissance Hotel in Vienna.

Pre-registration for conference guests and the call for papers website will
be open from April 16th 2008 on https://deepsec.net/.

The In-Depth security conference will include two days of security talks
during the conference and two days of trainings, covering the latest topics
in network and IT security. There will be also a comprehensive social
program around the event.

We're inviting you to submit proposals for trainings and conference talks.
All proposals received before July 15th 2008, 23:59 CET will be considered
by the program committee.

== Topics ==

We are interested in bleeding edge security research directly from leading
researchers, professionals, academics, industry, government and the
underground security community. Please do not submit specific single
expoits (which might be fixed by the time of the conference) and
"yet-another-PHP-hack" or the like. Exploit frameworks, general approaches,
"defective by design" resp. "defective by implementation" and high impact
exploits have a much higher chance ;)

Topics of special interest include:

  * OS Security (XP, Vista, GNU/Linux, OS X, ...)
  * E/I-Voting Case-Studies, Attacks, Weaknesses
  * Mobile and PAN Security
  * Network Protocol Analysis
  * AJAX/Web2.0/Javascript Security
  * Secure Software Development
  * VoIP
  * Perimeter Defense / Firewall Technology
  * Digital Forensics
  * WLAN/WiFi, GPRS and 3G Security
  * IPv6
  * Smart Card Security
  * Cryptography
  * Intrusion Detection
  * Incident Response
  * Rootkit Detection, Techniques, and Defense
  * Security Properties of Web-Frameworks
  * Malicious Code Analysis
  * Secure Framework Design
  * .NET and Java Security
  * Security Management

Please note, that we are a non-product, non-vendor biased security
conference and do not welcome vendor pitches in the conference talks or
trainings. We will provide an opportunity for vendor self presentation
through sponsorship and vendor booths in the conference lounge, where
coffee and snacks will be served during the breaks.
