Subject: Re: Secunia Research: Lotus Notes Folio Flat File
 Parsing Buffer Overflows

When examining advisory SA28209
http://secunia.com/advisories/28209/
it points to reports listing vulnerabilities in several products and versions (Verity KeyView Viewer SDK 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x) etc.

Secunia's Web site lists advisories by a specific product too, see
http://secunia.com/product/5570/?task=advisories

I believe this is the reason of several advisories.
