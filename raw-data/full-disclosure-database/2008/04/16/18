The hits just keep coming...
Quoting n3td3v:

"Back in the day when I had relations with him I was a humble script
kid who didn't realise the full extent of what was going on, a little
like when you're a kid you might not realise your uncle is touching
you up because you don't realise what's going on because you're naive,"

How long ago was this?  You know, when you were humble and naive?

"n3td3v has no intelligence anymore"


Dude, if you're going to refer to yourself in the third person, at least
keep it consistent.  Other than that, gotta give you major props for the
gut-busting laughs you give me.  Dwight Schrute ain't got nothing on you,
pal.
