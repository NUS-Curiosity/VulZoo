Title: CA DSM gui_cm_ctrls ActiveX Control Vulnerability


CA Advisory Date: 2008-04-15


Reported By: Greg Linares of eEye Digital Security


Impact: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code or cause a 
denial of service condition.


Summary: CA products that implement the DSM gui_cm_ctrls ActiveX 
control contain a vulnerability that can allow a remote attacker 
to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. The 
vulnerability, CVE-2008-1786, is due to insufficient verification 
of function arguments by the gui_cm_ctrls control. An attacker can 
execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the 
web browser.


Mitigating Factors: For BrightStor ARCserve Backup for Laptops & 
Desktops, only the server installation is affected. Client 
installations are not affected. For CA Desktop Management Suite, 
Unicenter Desktop Management Bundle, Unicenter Asset Management, 
Unicenter Software Delivery and Unicenter Remote Control, only the 
Managers and DSM Explorers are affected. Scalability Servers and 
Agents are not affected.


Severity: CA has given this vulnerability a maximum risk rating 
of High.

   directory.
2. Right click on the file and select Properties.
3. Select the Version tab.
4. If the file version is earlier than indicated in the list 
   below, the installation is vulnerable.

Workaround: As a temporary workaround solution, disable the 
gui_cm_ctrls ActiveX control in the registry by setting the kill 
bit on CLSID {E6239EB3-E0B0-46DA-A215-CFA9B3B740C5}. Disabling the 
control may prevent the GUI from functioning correctly. Refer to 
Microsoft KB article 240797 
<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797> for information on how to 
disable an ActiveX control.
