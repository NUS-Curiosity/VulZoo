We are pleased to announce the annual T2Â´08 conference, which will take
place in Helsinki, Finland, from October 16 to 17, 2008.

We are looking for original technical presentations in the fields of
information security. Presentations should last a minimum of 60 minutes
and a maximum of two hours and be presented in English.

We will be accepting talk proposals until July 1, 2008. All submitted
presentations will be reviewed by the T2 Advisory Board.

We suggest strongly that you submit earlier rather than later, since we
will close the CFP early once we receive enough quality submissions to
fill the slots.

Please include the following with your submission:

~   1. Speaker name(s) and/or handle
~   2. Contact information (email and cell phone)
~   3. Brief biography
~   4. Motivations for presentation (500 words max)
~   5. Presentation abstract (500 words max)
~   6. If your presentation references a paper or piece
~      of software that you have published, please provide
~      us with either a copy of the said paper or software,
~      or an URL where we can obtain it.

Please send the above information to cfp (at) t2.fi

Cheers,

~   T
