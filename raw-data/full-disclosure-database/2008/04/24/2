Subject: a song about me? :P [was: Vulnerability Release:
	CKFD001-CHATX]

At first I thought having a fan blog of someone who hates me was cool.

Then I thought the comic strip was cool, but man...

I like the guitar, even if the guy does like Hitler.
I am sending this to all my friends who are not profanity sensitive.

P.S. rapidshare sucks. It's too painful to download.
