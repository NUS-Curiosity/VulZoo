I wouldn't use such harsh language as Malix, but he's correct. David has
done a lot of ground-breaking research over the past decade and he's had a
major impact on how Microsoft and Oracle create, test, and patch their

groups on your CV. Sarcastically whining at David only reaffirms what we all
think of you.
