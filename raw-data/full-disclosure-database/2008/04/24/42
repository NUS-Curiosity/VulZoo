The more important you think you are, the less others are inclined 
to.  Inciting you to anger was the primary objective, not because 
we care but because you have become entertainment.

Acknowledgement is the first step.

The sooner you realize no one cares if you or anyone else shines, 
the better off you will be.  Fascinating how the word-wrap ended up 
emphasizing the same words you would have.


Listen carefully.  Hear that silence?  That's nobody in the real 
world caring.  Nobody except your little circle of touchy-feely 
friends wants to gather behind you.  You are not a special 
snowflake.  Get over it and grow up - in spite of your claim to be 
26-7, you have the emotional age of a 15 year old.
