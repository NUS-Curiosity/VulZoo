Oh noes!  The great and powerful Richard Golodner (that none of us 
have ever heard of but he makes fascinating vague claims about 
being shot and threats to cause your detractors bodily harm and 
teach us a lesson but no one would ever approach him because by 
publicly aligning himself with you would make people avoid him 
simply because he wouldnt be worth the stigma of proxy association) 
is going to get us!


classy - just like n0td3v.
