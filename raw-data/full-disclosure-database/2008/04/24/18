Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in BEA JRockit.

Background
==========

JRockit is BEA WebLogic's J2SE Development Kit.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin     < 1.5.0.14              *>= 1.4.2.16
                                                           >= 1.5.0.14

Description
===========

Because of sharing the same codebase, JRockit is affected by the
vulnerabilities mentioned in GLSA 200804-20.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All JRockit 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin-1.4.2.16"

All JRockit 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin-1.5.0.14"
