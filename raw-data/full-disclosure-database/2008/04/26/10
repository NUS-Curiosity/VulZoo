Don't play coy to me and don't give me no sass. I told you once and
I'll tell you again, don't fuck with me cause i'm bad. You don't want
to know the world of pain you're stepping into you autistic dracula

Stealing my motherfucking CFP? Guess what, asshole. I was one of the
earliest hackers in the 1980s. I KNEW Kevin Mitnick. Phone Phreaking
is as secondary to me as skullfucking your daughter. I'm going to keep
calling your house, OVER AND OVER, and the phone company will NEVER be
able to trace the call.

You're going down.
