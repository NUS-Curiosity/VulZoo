David, your research was responsible for the SQL Slammer Worm... but
that makes you elite doesn't it, not a black hat.

No wonder the UK security service is interested in you, but I wouldn't
call it an achievement, that calls you irresponsible in my view.

"He is a regular speaker at a number of computer security conferences
and has delivered lectures to the National Security Agency, the UK's
Security Service, GCHQ and the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der
Informationstechnik in Germany. David is a CHECK team leader and holds
SC clearance."
