Not reading the post below, I can tell you the numbers are based on real 
research, but it is so old my memory fails me. It is a case of a number 
being repeated and copied so many times over it gains credibility and 
immortality.

There are some decent numbers from the CSI/FBI annual survey.

Also, when counting incidents, it really matters what types of incidents 
are included.
