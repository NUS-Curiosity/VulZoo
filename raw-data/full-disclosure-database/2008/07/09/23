Subject: Zone Alarm Firewall users without Internet after
	MS patch (MS08-037)

Hi folks,

"It appears that the Microsoft patch for this DNS vulnerability
(KB951748/MS08-037) is already creating problems for some Zone Alarm
Firewall users. ZoneAlarm advises users who are experiencing problems
after installing the update to uninstall the Microsoft patch for the
time being."

"Not just Zone Alarm users. It is causing problems for Ashampoo users too"

I post this just in case you might have the same problem as i did. I
hope it helps a bit to some of you because I went crazy trying to
guess why the internet was not working in my laptop.
