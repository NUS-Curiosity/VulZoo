hi,

James, last time I checked there were several online resources
where such scans can be submitted - and those people that
use those resources are able to take action - eg get alerts
about systems on your own nets etc - whilst an email to this
list is informative, its not quite the best way, human resource-wise,
to get on top of these damn scanners :-|
