2. Vulnerability Summary

   There exists an SQL injection vulnerability in Adobe RoboHelp Server that allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary SQL 
   statements. The SQL would run against the RoboHelp back-end database within the security context of the application's database 
   connection.

   Assurent has confirmed that execution of arbitrary SQL statements is possible. The SQL in such a case would execute within the 
   security context of the application's database connection.
