Subject: DNS flaw fixing causes surge in DNS traffic

Hi,

I noticed an interesting side-effect of the co-ordinated DNS patching after the news broke out on Tues July 8th. Some DNS servers started seeing more than normal amount of query traffic, most likely due to the fact that the patched DNS clients and resolvers had their caches reset and hence had to resolve new domains. More interestingly, all these clients began their new DNS resolutions around the same time. For more details please read the blog article at:

Thanks,
Soups Ranjan
