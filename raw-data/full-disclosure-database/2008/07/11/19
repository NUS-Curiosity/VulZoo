Subject: How should Full-Disclosure be funded?

I'm still calling for Secunia to be dropped as a sponsor of
Full-Disclosure mailing list and it to be funded by public donations
instead.

If someone like SANS Internet Storm Center took over Full-Disclosure
mailing list that would make a lot of sense actually.

Full-Disclosure should be non-profit, free from the industry that makes money!

I'm calling for John Cartwright and SANS Internet Storm Center to
knock their heads together so we can come up with a solution and a
final end to the much hated Secunia as the mailing list sponsor.

All the best,

n3td3v

It http://www.secpod.org/index.html looks like a http://secunia.com/
spoof off. Remember nobody uses secunia and are still wondering why
John Cartwright keeps them as a sponsor of Full-Disclosure mailing
list.

All the best,
