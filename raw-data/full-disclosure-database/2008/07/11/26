n3td3v is just mad he can't match the scope of Dan's announcement, and
who they had to get onboard for the coordinated release:

"I'm pretty proud of what we accomplished here. We got Windows. We got Cisco

Yahoo, the biggest BIND 8 deployment we knew of, to publicly commit to
abandoning it entirely."
