Subject: Nominate Dan Kaminsky for Most Overhyped Bug
	Pwnie Award

Please nominate Mr.DNS aka Dan Kaminsky for Most Overhyped Bug on the
Pwnie Awards 2008.

I have heard about the vulnerability and have concluded its just
clever marketing PR work to keep the profits rolling in for the
Blackhat conference.

Infact, the vulnerability is old, and has been around for a long
time... I suspect the exploit will be appearing on Full-Disclosure in
the next few days to steal Dan Kaminsky's thunder.

He told researchers who work out the "lame" bug to tell him in
private, and that he would full credit you in advisories and invite
you to come up on stage with him.

People should ignore this and post the exploit to Full-Disclosure
before Blackhat conference to fuck up the Blackhat profits and show
everyone how lame the exploit actually is.

All the best,
