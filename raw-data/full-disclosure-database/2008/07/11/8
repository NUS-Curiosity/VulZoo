Subject: IBM MRO MAXIMO INFORMATION DISCLOSURE AND XSS
	VULNERABILITIES

Affected Software/Device: IBM MRO MAXIMO

 

Tested Version: 4.1 , 5.2

 

Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting & Information Disclosure

 

Risk: Low / Medium

 

Description: MRO Maximo is a strategic asset and service management
system that runs on a number of databases including Oracle, SQL Server
and IBM DB2. It is used by a wide variety of organizations ranging from
municipal and county governments, to corporations to government
contractors. We identified several security problems which are not
reported before during our pen-tests.

 

1- Maximo contains publicly accessible application named debug.jsp. This
application discloses useful information for attackers such as installed
OS type and version, full installation path of application. A Remote
attacker can use this information for further attacks.

 

http://maximo/jsp/common/system/debug.jsp

 

2 - Debug.jsp is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper
validation of values in HTTP Header such as User-Agent, Cookie, etc. A
remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious
script into a Web page which would be executed in a victim's Web browser
within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the page is
viewed. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's
cookie-based authentication credentials.

 

Sample Request:

 

GET /jsp/common/system/debug.jsp HTTP/1.1

Accept: <script>alert('XSS');</script>

Accept-Language: <script>alert('XSS');</script>

UA-CPU: <script>alert('XSS');</script>

Accept-Encoding: <script>alert('XSS');</script>

User-Agent: <script>alert('XSS');</script>

Host: maximo

Connection: Keep-Alive

Cookie: <script>alert('XSS');</script>
