Subject: help: I need to crack my box

Believe it or not, I have a linux box (mine, yes it's mine) I need to own...
the problem is that it phisically resides a few 100km from here and someone
else has changed the root password... I can still log in as luser and I
wonder if I have a chance to become root again. It's a more or less current
debian lenny i386 with gnome. Have you got anything for me?

Thanks in advance,
Lucio.
