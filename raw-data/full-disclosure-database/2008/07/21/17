Ask the hosting company if they have an ipkvm they can connect to the box.  If 
they do, you can reboot and go into single user mode and reset the root 
password.  I would then take down the net interfaces until you clean the box. 
Otherwise your info might be disclosed while you're working on it.

If you can't reboot it remotely, have their staff reboot it for you while 
you're logged in to the ipkvm.  Then get into single user mode and regain 
control of the box.
