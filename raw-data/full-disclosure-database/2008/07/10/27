Subject: Re: Multiple Vendor DNS Cache Poisoning issue

BIND users should check their configs to make sure they aren't
restricting the source port.

Any lines like

query-source port 53;
query-source-v6 port 53;

need to be commented out or deleted so that forwarded DNS queries come
from random ports.

RedHat have re-released their 5.x packages:

  http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0533.html 

"[Updated 10th July 2008]
We have updated the Enterprise Linux 5 packages in this advisory. The
default and sample caching-nameserver configuration files have been
updated
so that they do not specify a fixed query-source port. Administrators
wishing to take advantage of randomized UDP source ports should check
their
configuration file to ensure they have not specified fixed query-source
ports."

Cheers,

Phil
