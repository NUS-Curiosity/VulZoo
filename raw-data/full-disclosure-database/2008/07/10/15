Subject: Nessus plugins for recent MS Bulletins

We have released Nessus plugins for the recently published Microsoft
Bulletins. The same can be downloaded from
http://www.secpod.org/nessus-plugins/. These have been tested with Nessus
2.2.4 and released under GPL. We'll continue to release plugins under GPL
for the upcoming threats.

Thanks,
Chandra.
