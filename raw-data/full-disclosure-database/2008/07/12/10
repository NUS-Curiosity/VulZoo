Subject: Re: DNS flaw fixing causes surge in DNS traffic

The kind of thing being talked about should be perhaps viewed in terms of
other work Dan has done. An exploit that alters DNS and is combined with
turning corporate browsers into gateways is perfectly feasible and would
in effect make most corporate gateways into pieces of wire. All the pieces
are pretty much out there already, available to any of us who have grabbed
them over the years. An exploit that also combines research into being
able to scan loads of systems at once could be useful, even where the chance
of success on a single site got down in the few percent range, in compromising
substantial numbers of systems. Since DNS resolution is distributed, this could
mean substantial sections of DNS resolution might be compromised at once,
so that for example if you wanted to resolve mumble.foo.com, whereas perhaps
the root DNS systems might get foo.com right, the foo.com resolver would give
out evil-cracker.something's IP address instead of the real mumble.foo.com.

Let this happen widely enough and chaos ensues. It need not only be for
the denizens of foo.com, but could affect many others. 

Three orders of magnitude (or more) speedup of common processors makes quite
a difference here. Remember we are using protocols designed when 56KB was the
arpanet BACKBONE speed and was considered blindingly fast, and when computers
with cycle times of 1 megahertz were common and considered reasonable performers.

Back then, guessing 65K of something was not as trivial as now...and I rather suspect
with a few recursive routing tricks enough sensing can be devised to cut that
down, possibly with the birthday paradox, even attacking one site. But when
was the last time Dan K. did an app that attacked only one? Attack 65000 at a
time and the birthday paradox wins for the attacker bigtime.

Mind I have no inside information about Dan's plans, but I read now and then.. :-)

Stop adding to the media over hype FFS, its a gay bug being used to
market Blackhat security conference, think about the timing of the
announcement and media over hype carnage and say to yourself "Why
now?".

All the best,
