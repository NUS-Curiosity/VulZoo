Linux is a community which means that it needs people helping out when they 
see something that no one else is doing. The community is not divided into 
people inside and outside the community. Everyone can help. Also, security 
reviews do not have to be confrontational in nature. 

Instead of following each dot release with something written in a 
condescending tone, why not start doing this in a more calm tone for each 
kernel release with a little more explaination that not so technically savvy 
people understand? Then take the step of submitting the bugs for CVE numbers. 
Over time I think it would be a valuable reference for admins.

IOW, turn the negative that you see into something positive for the community.
