Subject: Stop The 70% Lie

http://70percenters.googlepages.com/

"The FBI estimates that about 70 percent of all computer security
breaches are perpetrated by insiders."

For years this lie and variations on the same theme have been
spreading through the Internet and the industry press.

Year after year journalists, security marketers, bloggers, and other
media types continue to publish this nonsense as though it were the
Gospel Truth when the truth is the FBI has never published any survey,
study, or statistical analysis that supports this claim.
