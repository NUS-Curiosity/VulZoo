Quote from Brad:

I hope you don't expect me to take you or your reply seriously.  You're
the village idiot of the full-disclosure list; you talk a lot and
provide a lot of great entertainment for many of us at the beginning of
our workday, but don't really contribute anything useful.
- -- end --

Good grief. Is maturity a lot to ask? Learn to disagree (even passionately)
without offending/annoying others.

(I guess "flame away" is implied. So have at it, if that's your thing.)
