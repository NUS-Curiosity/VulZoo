http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/

the whole source code for Linux kernel available for _anyone_
to download, scan through, run tools against etc etc.

they have a policy of non-disclosure?  Wierd. Last time I checked
I couldnt get the source code for Windows, IOS, OSX Intel from
a repository open to anyone.  and yet those companies have
a good disclosure policy?  I dont get your point. You want them
to specifically state how a vulnerability might actually
WORK and even give you some example code to make your life easier?
