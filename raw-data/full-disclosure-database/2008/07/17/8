Subject: Re: 
	[Dailydave] Linux's unofficial	security-through-coverup policy

I could understand why Linus is against classifying a commit 
comment in his branch or in a any unstable branch for that 
matter...then again, the repositories are open, and anyone with 
half a brain might be able to discern what has security 
ramifications or not. On the other hand classifying commit comments 
in stable branch(es) is a must, and the lack of CVE identifiers is 
very troublesome. 

Well, if they aren't going to do it, its up to the community to 
point it out, get the issues tracked in SecurityFocus and the like 
so that people know that its out there and the distros along with 
the general public don't have to rely on "HIGHLY SUGGESTED THAT YOU 
UPGRADE" announcements from the kernel maintainers without knowing 
why.
