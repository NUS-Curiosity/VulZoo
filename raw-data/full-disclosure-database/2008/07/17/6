You're a bit of a hypocrite bro, lol. The list has been fagged up for
years to be honest!!! lol. Its shit, it always has been, people use me
as a scape goat for full-disclosure being shit. If I wasn't here it
would be as shit as its always been, you fags would just move onto
someone else to blame for the list and your life being so shit. Just
grow up dude and get off the list if you don't like it, lol.

All the best,
