What is ekoparty?

It's a one of a kind event in South America; an annual security conference held in Buenos Aires
where security specialists from all over Latin America (and beyond) have the chance to get
involved with state-of-art techniques, vulnerabilities and tools in a relaxed environment the
like of which has not been seen before.

This event was born from the IT underground, where Consultants, Security Officers,
Researchers, Programmers, Technicians, Sys-admins, Geeks, Ninjas, Pirates and technology enthusiasts get
together and enjoy two days of the most important security researches of the year - as well as
enjoying some of the best weather on the continent.
