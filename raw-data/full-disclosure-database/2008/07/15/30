renaming of arbitrary files.

Background

Mercurial is a distributed Source Control Management system.

Affected packages

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected

  1  dev-util/mercurial     < 1.0.1-r2                     >= 1.0.1-r2

Description
===========

Jakub Wilk discovered a directory traversal vulnerabilty in the
applydiff() function in the mercurial/patch.py file.

Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to import a specially crafted
patch, possibly resulting in the renaming of arbitrary files, even
outside the repository.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mercurial users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/mercurial-1.0.1-r2"
