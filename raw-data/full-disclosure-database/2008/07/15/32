Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 07.15.08: Oracle
 Database Local Untrusted Library Path Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.15.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 15, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Oracle Database Server is a family of database products that range from
personal databases to enterprise solutions. Further information is
available at the following URL.

http://www.oracle.com/database/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an untrusted library path vulnerability in Oracle
Corp.'s Oracle Database product allows attackers to gain elevated
privileges.

This vulnerability specifically exists in a set-uid root program
distributed with Oracle Database for Linux and Unix platforms. By
replacing a module owned by the oracle user, which is loaded by this
program, an attacker can execute arbitrary code as root.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows the attacker to gain root privilege. In order to
exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must have access to database
owner account, typically "oracle", or be a member of oracle
installation group, typically "oinstall".

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Oracle 11g R1
version 11.1.0.6.0 on 32-bit Linux platform. Previous versions may also
be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

In order to prevent exploitation, administrators can remove the set-uid
bit from the vulnerable program. However, doing so could impair the
functionality of the DBMS_SCHEDULER package.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Oracle Corp. has addressed this vulnerability with the release of their
July 2008 Critical Patch Update. For more information, visit the
