I think they mean that some patches make obvious what the flaw is and possibly 
how to exploit it. These patches fix a known weakness - not using randomized 
origin ports and dns query ids (and in some cases improving the horribly 
non-random randomizing routines). The patches don't expose much information 
about the exploit, thus fueling the righteous indignation of those complaining 
about the hype.

If he is wrong, then the only real downside is that large numbers of dns 
servers were upgraded to a less sucky version of BIND.

Dan is sworn to secrecy until his talk, so we have to wait till then.
