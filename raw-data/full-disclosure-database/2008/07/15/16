	Have you actually tried to sign a zone?
	Have you actually tried to re-sign a zone?

	Just use the defaults and don't try to control every aspect.

	It really is not that difficult and yes it is getting easier
	still.  If you can manage a zone, you can manage a signed
	zone.

	If you are writing a nameserver there is a lot you need to
	know but to administer a signed zone there is very little
	you need to know.
