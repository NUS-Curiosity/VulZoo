Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 07.15.08: Oracle
 Database DBMS_AQELM Package Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.15.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 15, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Oracle Database Server is a family of database products that range from
personal databases to enterprise solutions. Further information is
available at the following URL.

http://www.oracle.com/database/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the DBMS_AQELM
package in Oracle Corp.'s Oracle Database product allows attackers to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the database user.

This vulnerability exists due to improper input validation when handling
a parameter passed to a procedure within the DBMS_AQELM package. Since
the parameter is not properly validated, providing a long string can
cause a buffer overflow to occur. This results in corruption of the
database and could allow for the execution of arbitrary code as the
database user.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in database corruption and
possibly arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the oracle
user on Unix, and the "SYSTEM" user on Windows. This grants an attacker
full reign over the database.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to
a database account with privilege to execute the DBMS_AQELM package. In
a default install, users with the Advanced Queue Administrator Role
(AQ_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE) have this privilege.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Oracle
Database version 10.2.0.3 and 11.1.0.6 with the October 2007 CPU
applied. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Oracle Corp. has addressed this vulnerability with the release of their
July 2008 Critical Patch Update. For more information, visit the

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2008-2607 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
security problems.
