Except that DNSSEC is going to have to improve dramatically to achieve 
widespread adoption.  Right now it's a PITA to understand and implement and 
then 30 days later you have to do it all over again.  Frankly, it's not worth 
the effort until the technology improves enough to make it easier to implement 
and maintain.

I know you don't want to hear that, but that's the truth.
