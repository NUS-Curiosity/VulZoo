Subject: Kon-Boot v.1.0 - booting-time ultimate linux
	hacking utility ; )




 Hello,


 Kon-Boot is an prototype piece of software which allows to change contents
 of a linux kernel on the fly (while booting). In the current compilation
 state it allows to log into a linux system as 'root' user without typing 
the
 correct password or to elevate privileges from current user to root. It was
 acctually started as silly project of mine, which was born from my
 never-ending memory problems :) Secondly it was mainly created for Ubuntu,
 later i have made few add-ons to cover some other linux distributions.

 All datas and infos available at project page:

 best regards,
Piotr Bania
