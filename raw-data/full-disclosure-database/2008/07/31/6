Description:
    Previous versions of the legacy openssl compatibility package are
    vulnerable to a buffer overflow, possibly enabling remote attackers 
    to execute arbitrary code through applications that use the openssl
    libraries.
    
    This compatibility library was provided solely for transient
    compatibility with applications built for alpha releases of rPath
    Linux, to make it easier for alpha testers to upgrade their systems
    to rPath Linux 1.  rPath is not aware of any applications that
    currently use these libraries, and so it is unlikely that any
    systems will actually be vulnerable to these attacks.
