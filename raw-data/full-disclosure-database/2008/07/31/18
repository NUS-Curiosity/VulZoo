And worldwide, probably the hundreds of thousands (or at least 100K),
since that leaves us only having to find 85K banks on the rest of the planet.
So if we're *really* being pedantic, the original assertion of "hundreds of
thousands" is almost certainly correct...

Phishing isn't a US-only phenomenon - I regularly see phishes for British
and Canadian banks, and the occasional looks-kinda-like-a-phish in non-English.
