does it really matter?  It's certainly not 500.
 
 BTW, just credit unions in the states amount to 8,130
 
We'll let the original poster worry about keeping his black list or
whitelist up to date, while the rest of us go on with our lives....

 Not to mention all the FDIC insured "savings institutions" that are worth
less than $100 million....

No time to comment on most, but just to throw this in there:
   Here in the states we have a few hundred thousand different banks at 
least.  500 is WAY too small of a number.  Credit Unions are banks, small 
banks, and almost every city has at least one credit union.  The city I grew

up in has 12 or so different credit unions, along with all the major bank 
branches....



FDIC says:

 4,893 banks or savings institutions have more than $100 million in assets;
3,517 have $100 to $500 million; 859 have $500 million to $5 billion; 150
have $5 to $50 billion; and 22 have more than $50 billion.


Circa 2003.
