4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in K9 Web Protection,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's
system.

The vulnerability is caused by a boundary error in the filter service
(k9filter.exe) during processing of "Referer" headers when the 
web-based K9 Web Protection Administration interface is accessed. This
can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly
long "Referer:" header.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a user
e.g. visits a malicious web site.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

The vendor is reportedly working on a fixed version, which may be
available shortly.

             Vendor also states that customer impact is considered
             minimal as exploitation requires access to the user's
             system.
19/05/2008 - Vendor contacted, clarifying remote attack vector of the
             vulnerability, which only requires convincing the user to
             visit a malicious web site that redirects to the local
             interface.
17/07/2008 - Status update requested. Vendor informed that disclosure
             date will not be pushed again as coordination now has 
             taken more than a year from initial vulnerability report.
31/07/2008 - Public disclosure.
