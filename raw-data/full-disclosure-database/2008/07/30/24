INTRUDERS TIGER TEAM SECURITY - SECURITY ADVISORY

ADVISORY/1907 - Citrix MetaFrame Privilege Escalation


PRIORITY: Low


I - INTRUDERS:
----------------



Intruders Tiger Team Security (http://www.intruders.com.br/) is a
SecurityLabs (http://www.security.org.br) division.

The Intruders Tiger Team Security (ITTS) is a group of researchers
with more than 10 years of experience, specialized in the development
of penetration tests.


All the penetration tests realized until the moment by the Intruders
Tiger Team Security had 100% of success.


II - INTRODUCTION:
------------------



Citrix Presentation Server formerly know as Citrix MetaFrame Server is
a remote application publishing product that allows people to connect
to applications available from central servers.

One advantage of publishing applications using Presentation Server is
that lets people connect to those applications remotely, from their
homes, airport Internet kiosks, smart phones, and other devices
outside of their corporate networks.

>>From an end-user perspective, users can log in to their corporate
network from, for example, an airport kiosk, see all of the
applications they would see everyday at work, including Outlook email
and any internal applications and access them from the kiosk in a
secure environment.


III - DESCRIPTION:
------------------



Intruders Tiger Team Security identified an unknown vulnerability in
Citrix Metaframe Presentation Server and Citrix Metaframe XP.

The icabar.exe file which is designed to startup the Citrix MetaFrame
administration toolbar allows an attacker to escalate privilege in
Windows 2000 and below in the default configuration and in Windows
2003 in some special circumstances.


IV - ANALISYS:
---------------



The icabar.exe file does launch during an administrator logon to the
desktop via RUN registry key. Unfortunately the IcaBar key value
doesn't have a full binary path, which allows an attacker to escalate
privilege in Windows NT, 2000 in the default configuration and in
Windows 2003 in some circumstances.

This causes several instances of Windows PATH trolling, where Windows
tries to locate the icabar.exe file in the directories listed in its
PATH environment variable. If the attacker is able to write in any of
this directories listed in its PATH before the Citrix Metaframe PATH
entry, so the attacker can escalate privilege.

The standard file ACL (Access Control List) of Windows NT and 2000
Operating Systems is weak and allow any user to create files in the
SystemDrive (in general c:\) and in many directorys listed in its
PATH, which allow an attacker to create a fake icabar.exe and
consequently escalate privilege.

However, the exploitation  dependends from others softwares or
administrators whom added new PATH entrys, for example the common
"%SystemDrive%\Program Files\SomeDirectory", where the directory is
set to Everyone/Full Control (default in Windows 2000) or directorys
which allows the creation and modification of new files by local Users
group (special permissions set by Windows 2003).

As described in the document CTX106052
(http://support.citrix.com/kb/entry.jspa?entryID=6032), the Citrix
company created a Hotfix for MetaFrame Presentation Server 3.0 and a
workaround for MetaFrame XP, because Windows 2003 SP1 doesn't allow
anymore the startup via RUN registry key without full path.

However this patch from Citrix company doesn't enquote the binary full
path stored in the RUN registry key, an attacker can abuse of the old
8.3 notation in the binary search and consequently can be used to
escalate privilege in some circumstances.



V. DETECTION:
-------------



Intruders Tiger Team Security confirmed the existence of this
vulnerability in the following Citrix Metaframe versions:

- Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server 3.0 and below.
- Citrix MetaFrame XP 1.0 and below.


Possibly new(s) version(s) can be vulnerable also.


VI. SUGESTION:
--------------



There is no manufacture patch.

WORKAROUND: Use full path binary and enquote the IcaBar key stored in
the RUN registry key.
