A British man who hacked into computers at the Pentagon will face
trial in the US after the law lords ruled that he should be
extradited.

At the House of Lords this morning, Gary McKinnon, 42, was told that
his appeal against extradition would not be granted.

McKinnon, an unemployed computer systems administrator from north
London, invaded computer systems belonging to the US military in 2001
– shortly after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.

He said he was merely searching for evidence of extraterrestrial life,
but American officials labelled him the world's most dangerous hacker
and accused him of deleting important files and causing hundreds of
thousands of dollars' worth of damage.

According to prosecutors, McKinnon scanned more than 73,000 US
government computers and hacked into 97 machines belonging to the US
army, navy, air force and Nasa.

His lawyers have fought vigorously against the extradition, arguing
that McKinnon could face up to 60 years in prison as a result of his
actions, and could even be classed as an "enemy combatant" and
interned at Guantánamo Bay. Instead they argued that he should face
prosecution under Britain's more lenient computer crime laws because
he carried out the hacking from his bedroom in London.

But the law lords today rejected that argument. "The difference
between the American system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the
appellant's argument suggests," said Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood
in his ruling.

"It is difficult to think of anything other than the threat of
unlawful action which could fairly be said so to imperil the integrity
of the extradition process as to require the accused to be discharged
irrespective of the strength of the case against him."

In a statement, McKinnon's legal team said it would be taking the
appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.

"Gary McKinnon is neither a terrorist nor a terrorist sympathiser,"
the statement said. "His case could have been properly dealt with by
our own prosecuting authorities. Instead, we believe that the British
government declined to prosecute him to enable the US government to
make an example of him.

"American officials involved in this case have stated that they want
to see him 'fry'. The consequences he faces if extradited are both
disproportionate and intolerable and we will be making an immediate
application to the European Court to prevent his removal."
