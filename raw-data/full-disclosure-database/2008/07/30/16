Subject: Cisco IOS shellcode explanation - additional

Anyone spot the typo? It's also in a comment in the exploit source,
but doesn't affect how the code works:

"addi    7,7,233" should read "addi    7,7,2330"

The first offset (requirement to authenticate) is at 0x174 and the
second (privilege level) is at 0xde4

Its worth noting that at some stage around IOS 12.4 this structure
changed slightly and therfore if you were planning on exploiting
12.4(7a) which is also vulnerable to the FTP stack overflow, the
offsets are 0x17c and 0xdec

Cheers,

Andy
