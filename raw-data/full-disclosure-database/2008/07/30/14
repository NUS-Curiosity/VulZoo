The simple fact that you said, put all banks on the list except the
one you actually use, really demonstrates how poorly some of this has
been thought out.

Because then, phish emails get through, and the end user is at greater
risk.  Perhaps even more so with the false sense of security you gave
them by setting up "filters".

Your smart move would be to acknowledge some of the glaring holes in
the statements you have made.  However, to continue to defend some of
the really bad ideas you've proposed bolsters the recently stated
opinion that you're simply trolling.

I think it's always great to toss an idea out there to see its
reception.  That doesn't mean you have to defend it to the death, but
only to the point that it's been proven to be unviable.

That point has been made, as you have not addressed some of the
glaring weaknesses in your statements.
