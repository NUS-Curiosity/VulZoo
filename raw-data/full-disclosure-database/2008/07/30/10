Subject: Tool: PorkBind Nameserver Security Scanner

In light of the new DNS cache poisoning issue and now that everyone has 
had plenty of time to apply patches, I've decided to release a new version 
of my nameserver security scanner called porkbind. It is a multi-threaded 
nameserver scanner that can recursively query nameservers of subdomains
for version strings. (i.e. sub.host.dom's nameservers then host.dom's 
nameservers) After acquiring the version strings it tests them against 
version numbers from CERT advisories and reports back to the user. Zone 
transfer capability is also tested for. It is available for download at:
