|)ruid and CAU have been around for a while. |)ruid and other CAU 
members have presented at most of the major cons and have released 
advisories, POC exploit code and tools.  You could read and do a little 
research, but you have proven you just spout off bull shit rather than 
put any due diligence into anything you say.  Sad really.

I had sent you the original message to you privately just as a nicety 
and not to the list, but for some reason you decided to take a simple 
private comment to a public list.  You look more like a douche than 
ever.  This is what I get for giving you the benefit of the doubt that 
you were not as much of an idiot as people say.  Boy was I wrong.

Thanks
HAND.
