Subject: Comments on: DNS exploit code is in the wild

I guess HD Moore doesn't like Dan Kaminsky very much since he told
people like HD Moore not to release such code until after the Blackhat
Conference.

Where does this leave HD Moore on the world stage as responsible
security researcher? Oh wait, he isn't one and never was a responsible
security researcher.

Metasploit frame work is used primarily by the bad guys, so we can see
what HD Moore's intentions are.

In other news, why isn't HD Moore in jail yet?
