I don't think that gets HD Moore out of jail though, and who is this
|)ruid character, and why is he using an anonymous alias for releasing
such a serious piece of exploit code? I thought the standard procedure
was to use your real name and a bio about yourself for releasing code
as a legitimate security researcher.

We need to find out more about |)ruid, then get the pair banged up in jail.

This whole HD Moore savior of info sec thing has gone on long enough,
its time to see him for what he is and get him slammed up in jail
along with his counterpart |)ruid.

All the best,
