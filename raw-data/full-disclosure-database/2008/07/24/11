Hi people, just to let other forum/blog/wiki admins out there that some people from tobesecurity.com
is spamming.

I own a forum with .com.ar domain, and I got spam from an individual called "juan B." (no lastname
other than the B). According to tobesecurity.com, it's the manager for Argentina:

Address: Nicaragua 5949 "B" Buenos Aires (1414)
Capital Federal
Telephone: (54-11) 50967618, (54-11) 47709165

http://www.tobesecurity.com/contact_us.html

He did the spamming from this IP: 190.55.79.96 (cpe-190-55-79-96.telecentro.com.ar).


I had a small telephone conversation with the alleged individual, and asked him to remove the posts
or I'd post the details to this list.

Aren't you just sick of this shit?
