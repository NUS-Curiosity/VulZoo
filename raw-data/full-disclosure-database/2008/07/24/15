Subject: Kaminsky corroborates the DNS vuln. discovered
	and published by Flake

In a webcast today, security researcher Dan Kaminsky corroborated the discovery made and published by Halvar Flake [1] . Kudos to Halvar for envisaging such a critical vulnerability and for his subsequent publication which made the Interwebs a much safer place. Other researchers should get their fingers out too.
