Spoofing one's IP is trivial; there is no - NO - source address checking at the major transit providers; good thing too, it would break lots of things (it's possible - and common - to send packets out to a transit provider with a source IP address that you have *not* announced to them).

Good ISPs tend to check the source address of single-homed customers; plenty of ISPs don't.
