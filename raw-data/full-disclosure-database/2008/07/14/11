Subject: Flaw in eMule 0.49: it exposes the OS user
	account name when it sends the shared files list

eMule 0.49 and previous versions could expose the OS user account name
when it sends the shared files list.
When an user asks for the shared files list of another user, the full
path of folders are sent and they're fully visible into the emule log.
example:
Requesting shared files from 'yohan'
User yohan (1507...) shares directory 'C:\Documents and
Settings\Jean-Denis\My documents\...'

OS user account name Jean-Denis is visible and could be used in further attacks.
