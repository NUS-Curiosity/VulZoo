Precisely.  You query the actual nameserver that you would expect to query and 
you get a response that says www.foo.bar is x.x.x.x when in fact it *should* be 
y.y.y.y.  But you can't tell that, because the nameserver's cache has been 
poisoned and it is responding, as expected, with a "genuine" answer that 
reverses and resolves precisely as you would expect it to - and it's coming 
from the authoritative name server for that host.

The end result is that you get taken to a site that you *think* is legitimate, 
and, if the attacker has done his job, *looks* legitimate in every way but has 
malicious content buried in the returned pages.  And you are none the wiser. 
The only way you could *know* you're being fooled is if you knew in advance 
what the "real" IP was.  Even then you couldn't be certain, because IPs *do* 
change from time to time.

It's extremely insidious and, if "properly" exploited, would destroy all trust 
on the internet.  You could never know for certain whether the hosts you were 
contacting were the real hosts or not.
