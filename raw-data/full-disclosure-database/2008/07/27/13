Stop trying to stifle the freedom of researchers, free thinkers and 
white hat hackers! You who would give the decisions of such things 
to an arbitrary authority who knows little of the issues involved. 
Whether or not you like how close a specific individual dances to 
the line of acceptability or not, to criminalize the research, the 
code and the discussion of such things is a slippery slope all the 
way to failtown.

It is the USE of such things for unethical or unlawful purposes 
that is the problem. It would be nice to say how terrible and evil 
it is to aide an attacker in any way, but to do so is to live in a 
lollipop house on gumdrop lane where the awkward complexities of 
real life are conveniently ignored. Many things can consequentially 
aide an attacker, but that doesn't automatically tip the balance of 
whether something does more good than it does bad.

The narrow mindedness that cannot see the far reaching consequences 
of a sweeping conclusion drawn from highly specific example could 
be the ruin of us all. Your reasoning ignores the wide ranging 
positions and priorities of all those who need to be protected.

Huzzah!
