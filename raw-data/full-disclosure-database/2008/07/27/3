	Good ISP's will check multi-homed customers as well.
	Multi-homed customers should be able to tell you what
	prefixes they are using or atleast the enclosing prefixes
	their alternate ISP assigns from.  No multi-homed customer
	should be able to spoof the entire world.

	They will also check their NOC and anywhere else that spoofed
	traffic shouldn't be coming from.

	We all should be checking that we are not emitting spoofed
	traffic.  It catches configuration errors if nothing else.
