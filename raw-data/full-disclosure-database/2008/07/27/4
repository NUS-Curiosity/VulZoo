Subject: simple phishing fix

Soo y'all know not to click on those emails from your bank, or from 
any other bank, in your inbox and now you just delete them ... why 
not automate this process?  It's easy, just filter a whole bunch of 
banking names straight to your deleted items.  

All you do is create a rule for each bank, which deletes any mail  
from that bank, automatically.

The rule should read something like "if the FROM field contains the  
string XXXXX then DELETE message".

Here's a list of strings to enter into your rules...

Royal Bank of Scotland
HSBC
NatWest
halifax.co.uk
abbeynational.co.uk
@abbey.co.uk
@abbey.com
barclays.co.uk
barclays.com
CitiBusiness
@citi.com
equifax.com
commercebank.com
bankofamerica.com
wachovia.com
capitalone.com
@nationalcity.com
.chase.com
@chase.com

The funny part is that because phish are trying to look as legitimate 
as possible, you can bet that they will use the correct domainname 
for the bank.  Which means they are extremely easy to filter... end 
of problem....
