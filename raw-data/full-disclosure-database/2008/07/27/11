1% per hour for each target. Lots of targets.

The need for something more like ssl certs in there remains. (Also needed for
bgp I suspect). By extension, some "web of trust" variation of CERTs would
make much of this easier for those not interested in or able to pay for
certs from commercial suppliers.

Paul, don't make me take you out back and smack you around. :)

First off - SBC probably doesn't run Windows on the server(s) that they do the
external for RandallMan's site, so the Microsoft patches are going to do
squat-all for that side of the problem.  And RandallMan most certainly *DOES*
need to worry about SBC getting patched - that's the *biggest* threat now, is
mass poisoning of an ISP's DNS servers affecting *all* their customers.

Paul Vixie already pointed out that on an unpatched system, the DNS can get
poisoned in about 11 seconds. And we *also* know that by iteratively trying new bogus
names, the attacker can keep trying over and over till it works or they get
bored. And all the current patches do is make it *harder* to hit.

The attack isn't "impossible", it's more like "1% chance *per hour* that your
IDS doesn't notice and stop the attempts".  Big difference...
