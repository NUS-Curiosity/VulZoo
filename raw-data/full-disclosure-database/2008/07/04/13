Subject: zonedit.com e dns zone transfer

For it domain, nic.it do not act as default secondary dns, so anyone 
have a .it domain have to buy a secondary dns service if hasn't one.

zoneedit.com sell this kind of service

By default if you leave blank on permit zone forward box anyone on 
internet could make a zonetransfer.

So You con have set an acl on your primary dns server, but thi is 
bypassed if you use secondary dns server it it is on zonedit.com with 
defalut configuration parameter.
