...the funny thing is how little we disagree about.

I did need Black Hat, and indeed the noise, to get the vendors to do
this big synchronized patch.  Really, it wouldn't have happened
otherwise.  But there's alot of what you say above that I don't
disagree with.

I was thinking it'd be cool to do a podcast with you after my talk.
You can criticize me as directly as you like, and I will post a link
to the interview on my home page.  I'd like to be able to talk
completely openly about what I did, why, and what now, to someone as
... disenchanted ... as you've become.

Let me know.

--Dan
