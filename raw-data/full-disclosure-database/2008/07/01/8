Wordtrans-web Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
Scanit R&D Labs Security Advisory

Jun 30, 2008

SCANIT ID: SCANIT-2008-003

I. Summary

Wordtrans is a free front-end graphical application that allows you to
look for
words in several dictionaries. It can also translate the word that the
user
selects with his mouse.

The latest Wordtrans version could allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary
code in the server, caused by an input validation error in the
wordtrans-web
package, which is a PHP-based Web interface for Wordtrans.

II. Affected Products

This vulnerability affects the wordtrans 1.1pre15 and probably previous
versions.

III. Details

When sending a request without the variable "command" or with an
undefined
command and any word in the variable "word", the variable "link_options"
receives one argument from the user, passed with the "advanced" variable
using
the POST method. Then, the variable "link_options" is concatenated with
the
variable "exec_wordtrans". Since "exec_wordtrans" is passed to the
function
"passthru" without checking for special characters, we can send shell
characters
like | or ; to execute commands in the machine with privileges of the
Web server
process when the URL is submitted. This is part of vulnerable script
from
wordtrans 1.1pre15:

...
$exec_wordtrans = $wordtrans . "-d \"$dict\" ";

switch ($_GET['command']) {
...
default:
if ($_POST['word'] != "") {
if ($_POST['fullwords']) $exec_wordtrans .= " +w "; else
$exec_wordtrans .= " -w ";
if ($_POST['casesensitive']) $exec_wordtrans .= " +c "; else
$exec_wordtrans .= " -c ";
if ($_POST['invertir']) $exec_wordtrans .= " +i "; else
$exec_wordtrans .= " -i ";
if ($_POST['noacentos']) $exec_wordtrans .= " +g "; else
$exec_wordtrans .= " -g ";

$link_options = "--html-link-options \"?lang=
$lang_case&amp;advanced=".$_POST['advanced']."&amp;\" ";
$exec_wordtrans .= $link_options;

$exec_wordtrans .= "\"".$_POST['word']."\"";

passthru($exec_wordtrans);
...

To exploit this vulnerability, the "Magic Quotes" option needs to be
unset.
But since this option was removed from PHP since version 6.0.0, this is
a
critical vulnerability.

IV. Solution

No vendor response.
