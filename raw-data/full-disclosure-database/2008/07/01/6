Subject: CFP 25C3 - The 25th Chaos Communication Congress
	2008

The 25th Chaos Communication Congress (25C3)
============================================

is the annual four-day conference organized by the Chaos Computer Club  
(CCC)
in Berlin, Germany. First held in 1984, it since has established  
itself as
"The European Hacker Conference", attracting a diverse audience of  
thousands
of hackers, scientists, artists, and utopists from all around the world.

We want you to join and be a part of this unique event which serves as a
public platform for cross-culture inspiration and borderless  
networking. 25C3
is fun!



Topics
======

The 25C3 conference program is roughly divided into six general  
categories.
These categories serve as guidelines for your submissions (and later  
as a
means of orientation for your prospective audience). However, it is not
mandatory for your talk to exactly match the descriptions below.  
Anything that
is interesting and/or funny will be taken into consideration.


Hacking
-------
The "Hacking" category addresses topics dealing with technology,  
concentrating
on current research with high technical merit. Traditionally, the  
majority of
all lectures at 25C3 revolve around hacking. Topics in this domain  
include but
are in no way limited to: programming, hardware hacking, cryptography,  
network
and system security, security exploits, and creative use of technology.


Making
------
The "Making" category is all about making and breaking things and the
wonderful stuff you can build in your basement or garage. Most welcome  
are
submissions dealing with the latest in electronics,  3D-fabbing,
climate-change survival technology, robots and drones, steam machines,
alternative transportation tools and guerilla-style knitting.


Science
-------
The "Science" category covers current or future objects of scientific  
research
that have the potential to radically change our lives, be it basic  
research or
projects conducted for the industry. We are looking for talks and  
papers on
the state of the art in this domain, covering subjects such as nano
technology, quantum computing, high frequency physics, bio-technology,
brain-computer interfaces, automated analysis of surveillance cctv, etc.


Society
-------
Technology development causes great changes in society and will  
determine our
future. This category is for all talks on subjects like hacker tools  
and the
law, surveillance practices, censorship, intellectual property and  
copyright
issues, data retention, software patents, effects of technology on  
kids, and
the impact of technology on society in general.


Culture
-------
Shaping the world we live in means making it more interesting,  
entertaining
and beautiful. The hacker culture has many facets ranging from  
electronic art
objects, stand-up comedy, geek entertainment, video game and board game
culture, music, 3D art to e-text literature and beyond. If you like to  
show
your art and teach others how to make their lives more enjoyable, this
category is for you.


Community
---------
In addition to individual speakers the Chaos Communication Congress is  
also
inviting groups such as developer teams, projects and activists to  
present
themselves and their topics. Developer groups are also encouraged to  
ask for
support to hold smaller on-site developer conferences and meetings in  
the
course of the Congress.



Further Information
===================

The Chaos Communication Congress is a non-profit oriented event and  
speakers
are not paid. However, financial help on travel expenses and  
accommodation is
possible. It needs to be agreed upon after acceptance of the submission,
though. Don't be shy and state your requirements in the application when
submitting your lecture and we'll work something out!

You can find the preliminary agenda and additional information on our  
25C3
website at http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/.

For further information and questions please feel free to contact
25c3-content@...v.de



Submissions
===========

All proposals must be submitted online using our online lecture  
submission
system at https://cccv.pentabarf.org/submission/25C3. Please follow the
instructions given there. If you have any  questions regarding your
submission, feel free to contact us at 25c3-content@...v.de but do NOT  
submit
your lecture via e-mail.



Language
========

25C3 is an international event and we want to have a lot of  
interesting talks
in English for the benefit of our growing number of international  
guests. So
ideally we are looking for speakers who can give lectures and/or  
workshops in
either English or German. But while we are interested in maximizing the
quality of presentations, the topic and its relevance to our community  
are our
main concern. So don't worry about your English skills: the language  
of a
submission is not a criteria for accepting or rejecting it!

If you feel insecure talking in English, have received criticism on your
language skills from your audience before, or if you just fear that  
the value
and understandability of your lecture might suffer, please offer your  
talk in
German. Please tell us if you are a native speaker of English or have  
similar
skills, when submitting your lecture.



Papers
======

Accepted speakers can optionally hand in a paper which will be  
published with
an ISBN in the 25C3 Proceedings. Papers will be accepted in Portable  
Document
Format (PDF) only and should be around 5 pages. The PDF file must not be
password-protected or contain other restrictions. Paper size should be  
DIN A4
in portrait orientation. All margins must be set to at least 2 cm (0.78
inches). Pictures should be greyscale and up to 300dpi. Apart from  
that, you
are free to use any layout you want.



Slides
======

Accepted speakers are asked to hand in slides used in their talks.  
Please use
a well-known format for your slides.



Publication
===========

Audio and video recordings of the lectures will be published online in  
various
formats. The Chaos Communication Congress Proceedings are published on  
paper
and online. Only reviewed and accepted talks and presentations will be
published.
