Subject: Alphanumeric shellcode improvements

Hi all,

I've not had as much opportunity in the last three years to contribute, but
I do have some new stuff: I've decided to pre-release some parts of ALPHA3,
the upcoming new version of my alphanumeric shellcode encoder:
* I've reduced the size of the mixedcase ascii decoder:
http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php?title=Mixedcase_ASCII_alphanumeric_code_decoder_for_x86
* I've created a lowercase ascii decoder:
http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lowercase_ASCII_alphanumeric_code_decoder_for_x86
* I've created a mixedcase ascii decoder for x64:
http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php?title=Mixedcase_ASCII_alphanumeric_code_decoder_for_x64
See http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php?title=ALPHA3 for a complete list and
some documentation.

Cheers,
SkyLined
