Subject: Full-Disclosure? introducing lul-disclosure.

Are you ready for a site that isn't full of fagottry? Where Gadi cant steal
your money or eat your lunches? Where you can freely submit lulz to be
published? Where Theo's defeat and denial are brought to light? Wait no
more!

WhiteHat? BlackHat? We are lulzhat.
Fuck you and your hats.
