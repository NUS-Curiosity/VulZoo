Please note that the idea behind full-disclosure and bugtraq is quite a
bit different, so you cannot really compare the two. Basically it boils
down to: on bugtraq, someone is filtering for you while on f-d, you are
responsible to do it yourself.

You should consider the constant trolling as "line noise". I have found
that an IMAP folder specific bayesian SPAM filter serves quite well to
filter out the discussions on this list not worth reading. But of
course then you're basically down to advisories and occasional
interesting discussions taking place every other month.

However, with the appropriate amount of recipient-side filtering,
full-disclosure is actually quite readable.

Like Wau Holland used to say, the world usually gets better when you
learn to adjust your filters.
