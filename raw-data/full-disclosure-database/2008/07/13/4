	Discussion)

Hi Paul,

I think maybe you misinterpreted.

If the patch is there, and it is (ar x leads you right to
libisccfg.so.1 - the shared lib used by bind that has been patched)
then obviously there isn't a need to wait for Dan.

So on that note I'll be more direct. Has anyone actually preemptively
written any code or reversed this issue on their own? Or just, you
know, attempted to understand the vulnerability in detail instead of
relying on these intentionally vague advisories (dan)?

(PS - Why would I ask you if a patch fixes a vulnerability? It's a
security mailing list...)
