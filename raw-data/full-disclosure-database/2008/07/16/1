The real problem isn't signing or resigning zones, or even successfully 
completing the original configuration (although those are not trivial for 
the average person trying to setup their own dns).  It's the trust 
anchors.  Until the root is signed, trust anchors are a PITA.  And until 
the root is signed, why should anyone believe that DNSSEC will achieve 
wide adoption?
