	Well there are a number of ccTLD's that are already signed.
	RIPE sign their part of the reverse space.  ORG is in the
	process of getting signed.  It's happening.

	There are existing solutions to dealing with lack of support
	in the infrastructure zones (includes the root).  You let
	someone you trust collect the trust anchors for you then
	incorporate them on a regular basis.

	We effectively do this everyday with https but for some
	reason people are scared to do the same thing with dns
	despite private parts of the keys never being available to
	the entity doing the certification.  With https the certifying
	authority can spoof any site they certify.
