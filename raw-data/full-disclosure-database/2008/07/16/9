	And a signed root changes that how?  You either add your
	trust anchor to a reposititory or to the parent zone.  You
	still need to re-sign regularly.  You still have the same
	amount of communication to do when you roll over your keys.

	B.T.W. DNSSEC problems are easier to chase down than a
	broken delegation.  I've done both.  Neither requires more
	than "dig" and "date".

	If you are really worried about validation failing you can
	always disable it but please sign the zones so that those
	of us who would like to be able to use DNSSEC to validate
	DNS data have something to work with.
