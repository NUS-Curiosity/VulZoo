n3td3v,

Dino's beyond well respected in the security community.  Also, you
won't know if it is an overhyped bug until Black Hat, and you might
have to reverse your opinion and statements after the details are
released.  Although I will say this, it could still qualify as the
most overhyped bug, even if it also wins the most awesome bug, because
the hype on this has been amazingly huge.

Finally n3td3v, I've agreed with some of your posts, but I don't
understand why you are against people making money in the security
industry.  I mean, what's wrong with making money?  Gotta pay the
bills somehow, better then being a janitor.

-Nate
