	You might also want to listen to me.  I've got a long history
	with DNS and DNSSEC.  A little googling will show this.  My
	historty with DNS pre-dates my affiliation with ISC.

	I've also been signing zones for years.  Please don't just
	dismiss my comments before you investigate.  I like simple
	tools.

	Mark
