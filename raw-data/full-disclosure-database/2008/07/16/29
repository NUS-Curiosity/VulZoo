Hi Brad,

Your comments are kind of misguided. Linus can be quoted as saying: "my
responsibility is to do a good job. And not pander to the people who want to
turn security into a media circus." He was referring to individuals such as
yourself when making the circus comment, as your message was slightly
alarmist and dramatized.

Security is important, of course - but Linus'
opinions<http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2008/7/15/2497674>are
completely correct in terms of development of the Linux kernel. I
would
agree with you if security bugs were actually being hidden, but they aren't.
They just aren't given special treatment.
