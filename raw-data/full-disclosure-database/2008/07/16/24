Vendor communication:

2008/01/22    initial notification to FRISK
2008/01/22    FRISK Response
2008/01/22    PGP public keys exchange
2008/01/23    n.runs has problems importing FRISK's provided public 
              key, so proceed to search on the key servers and import 
              the available ones and informs FRISK about it
2008/01/23    FRISK replies that the keys on the key server are fine to 
              be used.
2008/01/23    PoC files sent to FRISK
2008/01/26    FRISK acknowledges the PoC files and informs about having
              some problem reproducing them and requests exact version 
              and configuration used to trigger the vulnerability
2008/01/28    FRISK communicates to n.runs that they were able to
              reproduce one of the issues that they had just fixed
              and that the update will be included in the upcoming
              update
2008/01/28    n.runs thanks FRISK for such a quick response, provides 
              the exact version used while bug hunting and informs that
              the issues were found about a year before; the reason of 
              the late report is because it was overseen until now.
2008/01/29    FRISK replies that the version used in the test is quite 
              old (4.3.1 against actual 4.4.3) and that during that 
              time many bugs had been fixed
2008/03/16    n.runs realizes that FRISK has released the update 
              because of a post on 27.Feb.2008 at the following link:
      http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showpost.php?p=1191859&postcount=98
              n.runs decides to not launch the advisory because 
              couldn't find an official post.
2008/07/10    n.runs finds the official announcement:

world's leading companies in antivirus research and product 
development.

Description:

A remotely exploitable vulnerability has been found in the files' 
parsing engine.

In detail, the following flaw was determined:

- DoS caused by an Out-of-Bound Memory Access while parsing CHM file's
header: if the nb_dir field (Chunk number of root index chunk) value is
set to 0xffffffff pointers math takes place and ends up in an 
out-of-bound read attempt.


Impact:

This problem can lead to remote denial of service if an attacker 
carefully crafts a file that exploits the aforementioned vulnerability.
The vulnerability is present in FRISK Anti-virus software mentioned 
above, in all platforms supported by the affected products prior to the
engine Version 4.4.4. 

Solution:

The vulnerability was reported on 22.Jan.2008 and the engine 4.4.4 has 
been issued to solve this vulnerability. For detailed information about
the fixes follow the link in References [1] section of this document.

n.runs AG wants to highlight the excellent and fluent communication
with FRISK and its very quick response to validate and fix the issue.
