Subject: Traversing Dan's directory - DNS statistics right
	from the source

Hi,

if you want to see some graphs on how many DNS servers are fixed at
the moment (or rather, how many are not) based on statistics I got
right from the source - a directory traversal on Dan's DNS checker
tool ;-) - head on over to http://shiftordie.de

Cheers,
  Alex
