After performing this several times or by searching through the "Accounts" tab within the CUA Module an attacker can gather a list of all users. With this list an attacker can select an administrator account and log in with this by simply entering the user name followed by "--".

Vendor Status:
Vendor was informed of the problem, and was very cooperative in getting a patch developed for the problem. However, contact was broken off by the vendor after the relevant patch was released. The vendor has not yet published an advisory stating the reason for the latest patch or the discovered vulnerability in previous versions. This vulnerability was brought to the attention of the vendor on May 20, 2008 under the policy of responsible disclosure as documented at http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html. After cooperating on a patch the vendor did not respond to requests to release a public advisory. Therefore we have taken the initiative to alert the public through various security publications.
