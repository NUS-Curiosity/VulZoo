I am not a troll, I was sending you an e-mail Dan Kaminsky sent me about the
podcast after the blackhat conference that he wants to do with me together.

If you read about n3td3v a troll on Securityfocus by Robert Lemos it was a
smear campaign against n3td3v after a personal grudge with Robert Lemos and
n3td3v.

All the best,
