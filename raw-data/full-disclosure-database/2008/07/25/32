Subject: Re: how to request a cve id?

Would you like just a normal CVE or a custom one. Either way submit
payment over paypal to fdiggle@...il.com, regular linear CVEs cost
$15.99.. For a custom CVE it would be $59.99 and please specify the
number you would like in your submission.

Also please make sure the number you want is not taken before
submitting payment. Requests for existing CVEs can not be refunded.
