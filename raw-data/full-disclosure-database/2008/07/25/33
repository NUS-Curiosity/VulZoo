Subject: Real Networks RealPlayer ActiveX Heap Use After
	Free Vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Who:
Real Networks

What:
RealPlayer 11 (11.0.0 - 11.0.2  builds 6.0.14.738 - 6.0.14.802)
RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1040-6.0.12.1663, 6.0.12.1698, 6.0.12.1741)
RealPlayer 10
RealPlayer Enterprise

How:
The WindowName and Controls properties of rmoc3260.dll do not
manage heap memory properly resulting in a use after free condition
which can overwrite heap management structures resulting in code
execution. Note that this is the same issue that affected the
Console property(which was fixed in Real Player 11.0.2/rmoc3260.dll
version 6.0.10.50, however these were not).

Fix:
Real Networks has released fixes for this issue, please see
http://service.real.com/realplayer/security/07252008_player/en/
