Mrfetch (Paul Carnes) is a homosexual that believes the internet is his
personal army. In a video online, MrFetch attempts to rally the "you-tubers"
together and fight the Anonymous Internet. While completely impossible, Mr
Fetch vlogs as if everything on the internets were "serious business". Even
while stating the phrase "stand down" eleven times and claiming anon is
burning down trailers, he still persisting that he is "just getting started,
baby." He is spreading lies about anon, as flattering as they are, this can
not continue to happen.
