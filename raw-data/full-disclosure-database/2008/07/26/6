Hi bro,

I just had too high an expectation of HD Moore, I thought he had
turned good into a responsible and respected security researcher,
although he still is a gangster in the gangsters paradise. At least
behind a keyboard :) He will grow up one day and become a role model
for the younger generation, he's not at that stage yet. One day he
will be a Bruce Schneier who blogs away about shit, right now HD Moore
is hell bent on being an exploit code gangster.

We gotta do something bout them exploit code gangsters, they got no
head about them, they just go free styling and releasing code all over
the town, they don't care bout shit accept street cred, cash and
chicks... the cops, they're chasing their tails, but them the exploit
code gangsters, they always one step ahead of the game, jumping and
diving hoops and loops through the laws, to get away with the shit
they do, they are the exploit code gangsters... we gotta do something
bout those exploit code gangsters, like tighten the grip on the law
and get them mofo's off our mailing list, raining on peoples parade
and shit. The F.B.I they ain't impressed, they sit and grin it, they
can't do nothin' bout those exploit code gangsters, cos they are
within the law to do their shit, and gain the credibility and gloat
bout their exploit code crimes, while surfing the law. What we gonna
do bout those exploit code gangsters? We can't do shit, they're within
the law to do their shit, we just need to grin and bear it like the
mother foookin F, B to the mother fuckin' I. The exploit code
gangsters, they get away with it, cause they are the exploit code
gangsters, they know that, we know that, who doesn't know that?

All the best,

n3td3v
