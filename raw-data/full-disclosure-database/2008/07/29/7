You mention phising, but I think quite a few points from the
why-your-spam-solution-wont-work-list are relevant:

"(x) Mailing lists and other legitimate email uses would be affected
(x) It will stop spam for two weeks and then we'll be stuck with it
(x) Users of email will not put up with it

Specifically, your plan fails to account for

(x) Eternal arms race involved in all filtering approaches

and the following philosophical objections may also apply:

(x) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever
been shown practical
(x) Blacklists suck
(x) Whitelists suck"

1. Your filter will never be complete, there are too many
banks/institutions (with ever-changing domains etc).
2. Banks/institutions actually sends legitimate mail.
3. Phishers will find ways to get around the filters, either by
registering similar domain-names or by numerous browser/MTA tricks.
4. Users likely to fall for a phish is not very likely to even know
what a filter is.
