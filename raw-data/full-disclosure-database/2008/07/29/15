Another possible fix for this is to copy the RemoveCtrl.cab from 
8.0(you can download it from here 
http://www.trendmicro.com/download/product.asp?productid=5, as 
stated above, 8.x is not vulnerable since the control uses *_s 
functions as opposed to the standard C functions). The 8.0 critical 
patch B1242 has a copy of this CAB so you don't need to download 
the entire 8.0 package, and replace the one located in the 
ClientInstall folder on the OfficeScan server. I have not tested to 
see if this breaks web deployment or not.
