"simple" -- yes.

"DENY ALL" -- nope...

the domains of ALL financial institutions, so your block list could be

As no such oracle exists, a "deny all" approach along the lines you 
suggest is _practically_ impossible.

Which is actually what your suggested approach does, even if it could be 
practically implemented -- it accepts all Email (or at least all incoming 
Email delivery connections) then tries to find a reason to block it (From 
address domain on block list).

...for some interesting and unknowably odd value of "all".

Thereby letting through the phish for the target(s) of most danger to you 
-- get suckered by a Foo Bank phish as a Foo Bank customer and you may be 
in trouble, but getting suckered by a Bar Bank phish when you are only a 
Foo Bank customer and no harm is done.

Also, your preferred approach entirely fails to deal with "close but not 
quite" domain "spoofing" -- info@...chovia.com rather than 
info@...hovia.com, suport@..._bank.com rather than support@...-bank.com 
(the real Foo Bank domain), etc, etc, etc.

In short, as is commonly the case in such matters, the quick'n'dirty, I-
just-thought-of-the-ultimate-solution-to-the-phishing-problem-AND-it's-
REALLY-SIMPLE solution is so far from complete that it's all but 
useless...
