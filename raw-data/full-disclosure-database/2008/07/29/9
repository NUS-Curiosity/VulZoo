CVE's are not a mark of "coolness" or interestingness, or valuable 
research. They are identifiers. They identify bits of information 
about vulnerabilities. XSS is indeed boring if its all you can 
churn out but that doesn't mean they shouldn't have an identifier 
to help exchange information among affected parties and track when 
different advisories may relate to the same underlying 
vulnerability. You don't have to care about the vulnerability, but 
people running the software probably do. So chill out.

Huzzah!
