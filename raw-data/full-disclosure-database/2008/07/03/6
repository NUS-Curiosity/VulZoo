Vulnerability Description

-------------------------

ServerView is a server management suite.  Several buffer overflow
conditions exist in remotely-accessible portions of the suite.
Authenticated users (by default, all users) can cause a stack overflow
by sending a specially-crafted URL to the ServerView web interface.

 

Successful exploitation results in the execution of arbitrary code.

 

Solution Description

--------------------

Authenticate remote users who use the web interface to minimize
potential malicious users.

 

As of yet, a patch has not been issued by the vendor.

 

Tested Systems / Software (with versions)

------------------------------------------

ServerView 04.60.07 was tested on Windows XP.  Other versions are
assumed to be vulnerable.
