Subject: WinMagic HDE encryption

Anyone know if the page file (pagefile.sys) is encrypted when this product is installed and the hard drive encrypted.

Also - using backtrack - can the hardrive (NTFS - 1 volume) be mounted after encryption.  I have been successful on one machine and failed on another.  In both cases "fdisk" reported exactly the same layout but mounting failed on 1 machine and succeeded on an identical machine.  I did not have time to review the page file on the machine that  I was able to mount the HD. 

??
