Subject: Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmailâ€™s CAPTCHA broken by spammers

Hello,

Breaking Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail's CAPTCHAs, has been an urban legend
for over two years now, with do-it-yourself CAPTCHA breaking services,
and proprietary underground tools assisting spammers, phishers and
malware authors into registering hundreds of thousands of bogus
accounts for spamming and fraudulent purposes. This post intends to
make this official, by covering an underground service offering
thousands of already registered Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail accounts for
sale, with new ones registered every second clearly indicating the
success rate of their CAPTCHA breaking capabilities at these services
