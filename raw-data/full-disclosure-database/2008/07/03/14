Now that's paranoia! Full background checks were done on me by the
Home Office when I went on the Ethical Hacking course at Abertay
Dundee. Remember viva end of n3td3v group and the Robert Lemos news
article after that? That's when I fucked off to the course, that was
advertised in the media to be monitored by the Home Office of the
British Government.

If I was a terrorist i'd of been arrested by now!!! Unless they're
keeping me sweet to see if my web behaviour esculates.

But yeah, i've been on the radar for years, If I was a cyber crook or
terrorist I wouldn't be able to send this message to you just now
because I would be incarcerated.

Think about it for a second...

Infact, I think I said at one point I was applying for a position at
MI5, so do I really seem like Ureleet to you?

All the best,

n3td3v
