Subject: Re: simple phishing fix

Post my mail filter strings? LOL. That just proves how insignificant you and
your ideas are. I do real security research work like write exploits and
patches. Do you know how to mmap @ 0x00000000 on current kernels? Do you
even know why that would be useful?

How does this fix the problem? If it were that black and white ISP's would
implement it at their MX's.. on top of that what about all the LEGITIMATE
emails banks send out?

Anyone who knows how to set up mail filters would have already done so
without your "message". Maybe you should stop posting trying to puff up your
image on a mailing list and go back to your "research". Who knows maybe one
day you can graduate to XSS... lmao.

Leave security work to the experts you untalented, fame seeking, peice of
shit...
