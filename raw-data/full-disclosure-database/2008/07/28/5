Subject: Re: simple phishing fix

Please post the list of strings you use in your phishing filter.

Or don't you have one?

Seriously dude, if phishing was so simple to fix then why is it "on 
the rise" according to recent news articles?

I mean, if all the admins out there in the world are blocking them, 
when why are they still being sent out by scammers?

Either the admins don't know how to block them, or the scammers don't 
know they are being blocked.

My message can solve both problems.

I seem to recall a time when email-borne viruses were a problem, once 
it was pointed out they were simple to block, they rapidly dropped 
out of fashion.

I would indeed like to repeat that success and save the associated 
electricity, bandwidth and CPU time for something more important, 
such as replying to bone-headed posts in fd, for a start.
