Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 07.28.08:
 Hewlett-Packard OVIS Probe Builder Arbitrary Process Termination
 Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.28.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 28, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Hewlett-Packard's Internet Services provides end-user emulation of major
business applications and a single integrated view of the Internet
infrastructure. For more information, please visit following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service vulnerability in
Hewlett-Packard's Internet Services Probe Builder product allows an
unauthenticated attacker the ability to terminate any process.

The Probe Builder Service, PBOVISServer.exe, listens by default on TCP
port 32968. This process has a specific opcode that allows a remote
unauthenticated user to terminate any process on the system by
supplying a process ID number.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to kill any process, including critical
system processes like services.exe, lsass.exe, csrss.exe. Killing a
system process usually results in a blue screen or a mandatory reboot
message. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must know the
process ID to terminate. For a remote attacker, it can brute force
process ID and cause the system to crash.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in HP's Internet Services
Probe Builder 2.2 for Windows with all updates applied.

V. WORKAROUND

Employing firewalls to limit access to the affected service will
mitigate exposure to this vulnerability.
