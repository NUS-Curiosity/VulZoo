Every single post you've ever made is nothing more than drivel suited
for a blog.

The reason you don't setup a blog for your FUD is because you know
you'd have 0 visitors, so instead you post to a mailing list.

Kudos, I think i'm going to start doing the same.

p.s.
 I'm going to break your legs.
