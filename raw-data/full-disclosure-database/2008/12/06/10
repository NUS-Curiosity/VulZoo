'British intelligence service'!?

According to this:
<http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html>
...Full Disclosure is run by secunia. And administered by one man.

Does the 'British Intelligence Service' doesn't even exist?
There's:
"The Security Service" AKA "MI5".
and "SIS" AKA the "Secret Intelligence Service".

Also any one who thinks FD is/should be something read the info in the
link above.
