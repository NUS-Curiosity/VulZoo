Subject: Re: Microsoft issues out-of-band patch

1) Are you running low on meds this late in the month? If so, do we need to
start a collection so you can afford them in time before you subject us with
further ranting, raving, and lunacy? Actually, I wouldn't mind ranting,
raving, and lunacy if it came from someone who wasn't also stupid and
completely oblivious to their own plight...

2) Further comments are inline although I expect you won't bother to
adequetely address them, ever.

Do you have anything to back this claim?

 Fact? Now you're really needing to cite some sources or backing, otherwise
this is, in fact, not fact.

You are not technically inclined. You have said it yourself and have
demonstrated such for years on this list. So I'm not surprised you don't
understand patching and vulnerability research. Maybe they have their own
mitigations and workarounds, but that is a certainly different ballgame.

The only thing impressive is how oblivious, delusional, and incompetent you
are.
