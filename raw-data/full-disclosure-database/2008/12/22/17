Oh my, you both seem to have emailed your conversation to the full
disclosure mailing list by accident.

How embarrassing. Every body who is subscribed has received emails of
you two talking about something that ONLY CONCERNS YOU TWO.

Maybe next time when you send emails to each other you should double
check that you're not sending them to a mailing list about
vulnerability disclosure.
