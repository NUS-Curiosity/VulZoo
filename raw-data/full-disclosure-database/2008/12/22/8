robert lemos said his piece about you, in what?  2006? almost 3 years ago now?

when did dr krawetz do his?  2006?  again, almost 3 years ago.  get over it.

im not founding my basis for u on expectations set by them, i m
founding my basis for u on ur lies.

u say u r a badass hacker and a ethical hacker, yet u publicly threaten ppl.

u say u r a whitehat, yet u threaten ppl.

u claim to b at the forfront of the "scene" yet no 1 except ppl on
cnet and fd have heard of you.  most every1 dumps u 2 the deleted bin.
 i know i was 4 awhile.

in dr krawetz's paper, u were compared to gobbles, which at this
point, u should b glad u were.  at least gobbles has released
something.  hell even gobbles came out from behind the curtain and
told krawetz to fuck off.  even gobbles doesnt want 2 b associated w/
u.

u swore to b leaving the scene in 2006, and again in 2007, and again
in 2008.  in 2006 because u were moving into the "professional scene".
 yet, u havent actually moved anywhere.  u r still here pestering us
all.  u liar.

now u just sit back in ur moms house and shout lies and wild
accusations of which u have no proof whatsoever.. ripping off ppls
articles and passing them off as ur own news.

fuck u
