Subject: This list has run its course

Real researchers who should be taken seriously aren't taken seriously anymore.

I'm leaving full-disclosure because of the abuse.

It's just turned into flames to spin people up, I don't get a chance
to talk about security or my skill set.

It's abuse after abuse after abuse.

Sorry, I can't take it anymore.

Got to go, bye.
