What have I lied about? It's Robert Lemos and Neal Krawetz who lied,
but then people had an expectation of me because they believed the
lies that they told. Then I get some idiot on full-disclosure called
Ureleet complaining because I didn't live upto the expectations talked
about in the Robert Lemos and Neal Krawetz smear campaign.

You believe what you read in the media, it's a sad day for you Ureleet
that I don't live upto your expectation of me, just because Robert
Lemos and Neal Krawetz say something doesn't mean it's true. Maybe
your anger that I don't meet your expectations of me should be focused
at Robert Lemos and Neal Krawetz and not me.

This is what it's all about with you on full-disclosure, an
expectation you have of me because of Robert Lemos and Neal Krawetz.

Please vent your anger to those parties who smear campaigned me and
not I who has never lied about anything.
