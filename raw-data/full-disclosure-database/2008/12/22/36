If only you knew t34ch_m3_h0w_t0_h4ck is a Yahoo! employee and I was
making fun of it while trying to get intelligence on folks from that
forum.

We used to collect intelligence together and information share about hackers.

You can contact t34ch_m3_h0w_t0_h4ck here: http://metal.hurlant.com/blog/

Or email him here: henri_torgemane@...oo.com

Or his corporate email at henrit@...oo-inc.com if you don't believe me.

I have never told a lie...
