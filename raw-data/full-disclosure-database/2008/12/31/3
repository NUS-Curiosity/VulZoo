They give a hint that it's *highly* parallel code:

"This part is not suited for the PS3s SPU cores due to the large memory demands
and the high number of branches in the software execution flow."

Presumably, if the hit that a lot of branches create is bad, the *huge*
hit of even an Infiniband interconnect would be fatal...
