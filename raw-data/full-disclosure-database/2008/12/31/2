The viability of that approach depends on how much the code depends on
the systems being clustered together over low-latency interconnects.
4000 machines spread all across the internet separated by 300ms of
latency is not the same thing as 4000 machines in the same room
running a cluster OS.

Yes, given enough machines you could do the computations even with
each system acting fairly autonomously, but it could require a
drastically different approach.  As a disclaimer, I do not know the
details of how the PlayStation Lab was utilized for this particular
task, so they may well have been used as discrete units.
