Ah, you're nit-picking on the fact that I mistakenly mentioned the
actual collision rather than the birthday attack, so yes my bad for
being careless with my terminology.

The more time-consuming part of the computation was the birthday
attack, which is what the PS3s _are_ good at.  You're right that the
collision blocks worked better on machines with more RAM and
instruction sets/pipelines designed for more branching.

In any case, we don't disagree that it's possible to conduct the
attack with a moderate-sized botnet.  We also agree that nutd0rk has
no idea what he's talking about (not that he ever does), so this
discussion seems to be heading no where.
