Subject: Re: Microsoft issues out-of-band patch

stop putting so much of attention to 0-day and possible use of it by
government to get into a terrorist pc.

if breaking into someones pc was a matter of national security
importance 0-day may provide a easy leverage but you really dont need
a 0-day to get into someones pc, neither you'd need a already
existing/known backdoor, neither you'd need to bruteforce into the
advisory or a physical access to it.

all they need to do is poison a unsigned executable/plugin/update with
a backdoor instead, that is being downloaded to the advisory computer
over an unencrypted connection if you can control the network gateway
or have isp level access. such attacks "could" work regardless of the
OS or patch level.
