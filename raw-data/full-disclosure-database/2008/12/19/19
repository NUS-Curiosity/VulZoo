Subject: Re: Urgent Google Contact

I've been hearing about, FD is getting boring with similar postings
but so less "disclosures".

Anyone want to participate to make this thread exciting? :)

<xyberpix@...erpix.com> dropped in FD asking for security contact of
google without making some disclosures on the info-sec issue for what
he wanted to contact google. So, anyone wants to do some "intelligence
analysis" about this, some background checking and find the technical
capabilities of the identities behind the email address and guess for
what security related topic he could have likely contacted google!

Maltego is the tool to use.

who is in ?    ;)
