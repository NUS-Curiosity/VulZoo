"MI5 have their systems patched against
flaws that are not known about by other entities"

Yeah, of course they do. because writing your own patches will definitely
make sure that your enterprise is properly supported and secured, and all
your mission-critical apps will continue to function. I remember someone
writing their own patch for an exploitable vulnerability a few years ago and
MS were quick to warn everyone thinking of using it that it would invalidate
their support agreements. Of course I am sure MI5 have their own versions of
their core operating systems, a support staff that can rewrite the entire NT
kernel, and aren't just part of the UK government's hugely-outsourced IT
function.

Incidentally save your flames, I was doing my Friday spam clearout when I
saw this.

Cheers,

JJ
