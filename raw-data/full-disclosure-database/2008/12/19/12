Subject: Re: Microsoft issues out-of-band patch

Here's an article explaining why Microsoft delays their patching:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday>

Specifically this bit:
"In order to reduce the costs related to the deployment of patches,
Microsoft introduced the concept of Patch Tuesday. The idea is that
security patches are accumulated over a period of one month, and then
dispatched all at once on an anticipated date which system
administrators can prepare for."
