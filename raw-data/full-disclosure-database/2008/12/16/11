@ Bill Reyor <opticfiber@...il.com>

Is that comment for me?

I WILL NOT do like N3td3v does in keep the talk on an on. I WILL NOT
discuse politics or whatever subject may appear here in the mailing
list. Aside from this msg & disclosures that i do my presence in FD IS
almost invisible and i am watching it for sometime. If you can do
better show yourself, publish original content.

That's what's internet was made for since no phisical barriers are
imposed and nor the big media can hide you.
