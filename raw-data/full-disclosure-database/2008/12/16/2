	Episode 133

It appears from the gratuitous posts on the n3td3v mailing list, sir, that
you think you are just as, or more importantly, more important than Mr.
Ranum.
Obviously it appears that neither one of you are aware of who each other
are.  I suggest some research before taking it upon yourself to say that Mr.
Ranum was compared to you.  Whilst it appears more accurate that you were
compared to Mr. Ranum.

No offense, just what it appears to be from the outside.
