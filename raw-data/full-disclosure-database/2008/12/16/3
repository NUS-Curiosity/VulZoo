Subject: "Index Of" redirection malware attack?


Hello fellow FD,

I recently came across an interesting website redirecting and delivering malware and I'd like to ask a few questions

An "Index of" that checks your referrer to see if you've found the site through a Google search. The index.php script is made to look just like a real 'Index of', except...it is a PHP script. If you are, it redirects you to http://us-euro.biz/in.cgi?4&parameter=htac and that site serves you pop-ups and other spyware. Use refspoof and TamperData and check http://vtes.vega.id.au/%3Fp=67/wp-login.php/wp-includes/?p=67/wp-login.php/wp-includes

They're looking for any Google referrer like this: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=something&btnG=Search&meta=

Not only that, but http://site.com/? would use index.php and http://site.com would give index.html
Am I correct?

They're really crafty I reckon, and it's the first time I've seen where they've used a fake index of AND checked your referrer.
Can someone confirm my thoughts and theories here?
