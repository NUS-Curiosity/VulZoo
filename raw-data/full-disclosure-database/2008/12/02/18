If you are taking a proactive approach to security, maybe you should always
remind the user to be careful with their data.
How about 'all desktops have an icon or widget (say at the right hand
corner)' that flashes red every five minutes and says 'be careful with the
data you share.' This solution removes the overhead of all that pesky
monitoring and data mining.

The internet is a dangerous place, and will continue to be. My 'noob'
grandmother doesn't need a 1-5 Danger Scale to keep her from being scammed
when she buys holiday gifts online. [Grandmother Voice] 'Ohh dear we are at
Internet Danger Level: Tangerine, guess I can't order those knit socks for
Johnny today.' [End Grandmother Voice]
