*Sorry for my double posting to you Chris.

All this solution does is take up their resources and piss off the users who
then find ways to get rid of it or circumvent the useless thing. In the case
of Mike C this means they'll be disabling whatever security software is in
place that uses it.

Bravo folks, you've saved the tubes.

If you are taking a proactive approach to security, maybe you should always
remind the user to be careful with their data.
How about 'all desktops have an icon or widget (say at the right hand
corner)' that flashes red every five minutes and says 'be careful with the
data you share.' This solution removes the overhead of all that pesky
monitoring and data mining.
