Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mantis, the most
severe of which leading to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Mantis is a PHP/MySQL/Web based bugtracking system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/mantisbt     < 1.1.4-r1                      >= 1.1.4-r1

Description
===========

Multiple issues have been reported in Mantis:

* EgiX reported that manage_proj_page.php does not correctly sanitize
  the sort parameter before passing it to create_function() in
  core/utility_api.php (CVE-2008-4687).

* Privileges of viewers are not sufficiently checked before composing
  a link with issue data in the source anchor (CVE-2008-4688).

* Mantis does not unset the session cookie during logout
  (CVE-2008-4689).

* Mantis does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an
  HTTPS session (CVE-2008-3102).

Impact
======

Remote unauthenticated attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to
execute arbitrary PHP commands, disclose sensitive issue data, or
hijack a user's sessions.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mantis users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/mantisbt-1.1.4-r1"
