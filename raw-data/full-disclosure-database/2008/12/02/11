	probably backdoored

u arent getting it.

it has nothing 2 do w/ backdoors.  they r talking about actual
backdoors in the code.  so that anyone who knows the backdoor can
acess any windows system regarless.  they r saying that microsoft has
coded backdoors into the system so that the govt can get into any
system, patched or not.  pay attention.
