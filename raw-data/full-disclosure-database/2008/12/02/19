Synopsis
========

IPsec-Tools' racoon is affected by a remote Denial of Service
vulnerability.

Background
==========

IPsec-Tools is a port of KAME's implementation of the IPsec utilities.
It contains a collection of network monitoring tools, including racoon,
ping, and ping6.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-firewall/ipsec-tools       < 0.7.1                   >= 0.7.1

Description
===========

Two Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been reported in racoon:

* The vendor reported a memory leak in racoon/proposal.c that can be
  triggered via invalid proposals (CVE-2008-3651).

* Krzysztof Piotr Oledzk reported that src/racoon/handler.c does not
  remove an "orphaned ph1" (phase 1) handle when it has been initiated
  remotely (CVE-2008-3652).

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All IPsec-Tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=net-firewall/ipsec-tools-0.7.1"
