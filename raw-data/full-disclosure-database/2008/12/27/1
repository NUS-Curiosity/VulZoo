All,

I've posted the source code to STAR on http://www.socialnetworkwhore.com  I've also made sure it works under Linux as well as Windows.  If anyone has any problems please contact me off list and we'll get them solved.  Also feature ideas would be awesome :)

Have a great day,
Ben

>While bored at work this past week I decided to throw together a front end for the Rough Auditing Tool for Security (RATS).  It supports most features of RATS and runs on both win32 and nix systems.  Development was in Python (PyQt4) and the app has been packaged using py2exe.  See http://www.socialnetworkwhore.com/ for screen shots and downloads.
