"we" implying, u, me, and n3td3v.  1st of all, u didnt do shit but
send 2 emails.  the talks between me n n3td3v have always been an open
line of communication, ur just some "douche" who is obvouisly trying
to take credit 4 stuff.

moderate the n3td3v/ureleet discussion?  yes, that was mike c, the
cockswallower.

o, and hes the lead of project chroma.  even n3td3v said ur project is
fucking pointless.  go rot u cocksucker.  u obviously have no
contribution 2 life other than breathing my air.  choke on a cock.
