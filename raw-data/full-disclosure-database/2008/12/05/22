This is a cyber security list not Yahoo Finance, how im I supposed to
answer that question? And why would you expect anyone to be able to
answer that on this list? A sweeping guess would be red for danger,
meaning everyone should buy Symantec products and that people should
sign up for doofus SANS courses? Enlighten me Valdis, because i've got
a sneaky suspicion you've already got the answer lined up.
