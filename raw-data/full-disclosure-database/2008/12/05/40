Subject: Fredrick Diggle Security - New Hire Announcement

Fredrick Diggle security is proud to announce that an offer has been
made to the established internet security expert and ethical hacker
Valdis Kletniek's Mustache. Fredrick Diggle was confused at first when
the application was received as Fredrick was under the impression that
the mustache was actually a part of Valdis. However, the mustache
explained that it was in fact the sentient being and Valdis was simply
the host it had been using for mobility.

Late last week the mustache (formerly attached to Valdis Kletnieks)
accepted Fredrick Diggle's offer and will begin work in it's new
position with Fredrick Diggle Security effective immediately. The
mustache has given up it's former host in favor of more nubile
transport here in Brazilia. Please join Fredrick Diggle in welcoming
the mustache to the Fredrick Diggle Security team.

In the future please refrain from calling the Mustache "Validis
Kletniek's Mustache" and instead refer to it as simply Mr. Mustache or
TMFATVK (The Mustache Formerly Attached to Valdis Kletnieks) for
short.
