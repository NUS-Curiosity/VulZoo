The basic problem is that you've *been* either a blithering idiot or a
troll for so long, that even if something sensible *does* get posted from
n3td3v, people will tend to label it as "oh, his trolling has just gotten
a bit better".

Your best bet is to just toss that e-mail address, go pursue an outdoor
hobby for 4 to 6 months, and use a different persona when you return.
