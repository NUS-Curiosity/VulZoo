	ofcyber security

A colour scheme will save the world huh? So theyll be more dangerous
when its red? Wont it always be red? why not just cut out the color
scheme and emboss "THE INTERNET IS DANGEROUS, SERIOUS BUSINESS!" on
every monitor. It will do the exact same thing your suggesting.
without taking up my screen space.
