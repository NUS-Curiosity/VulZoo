-- Vulnerability Details:
These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to bypass sandbox
restrictions on vulnerable installations of Sun Java Web Start. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page.

The first vulnerability results in a cache location and a user name
information disclosure. By accessing the SI_FILEDIR property of a
SingleInstanceImpl class, the location of the temporary single instance
files can be parsed to discover the user name and cache location.

The second vulnerability allows applets to read any file on a victim's
filesystem, outside of the restricted path of the applet. The specific
flaw exists in the handling of the file: protocol assigned to an applet
codebase. If the codebase points to the local filesystem, any file is
then readable by the malicious applet.

The third vulnerability allows JNLP files to bypass socket restrictions.
By loading a secondary JNLP with an href attribute containing a
wildcard. When this object is instantiated, all hosts are eligible for
socket connect and accept.

-- Vendor Response:
Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More

The ZDI is unique in how the acquired vulnerability information is
used. TippingPoint does not re-sell the vulnerability details or any
exploit code. Instead, upon notifying the affected product vendor,
TippingPoint provides its customers with zero day protection through
its intrusion prevention technology. Explicit details regarding the
specifics of the vulnerability are not exposed to any parties until
an official vendor patch is publicly available. Furthermore, with the
altruistic aim of helping to secure a broader user base, TippingPoint
provides this vulnerability information confidentially to security
vendors (including competitors) who have a vulnerability protection or
mitigation product.
