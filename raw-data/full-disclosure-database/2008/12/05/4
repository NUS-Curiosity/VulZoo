ZDI-08-079: Trillian AIM Plugin Malformed XML Tag Heap Overflow 
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-08-079
December 4, 2008

-- Affected Vendors:
Cerulean Studios

-- Affected Products:
Cerulean Studios Trillian

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Cerulean Studios Trillian. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the XML processing code for Trillian.
When parsing a malformed XML tag, the application does not allocate
enough space for it's contents. During copying of this to the newly
allocated buffer, the application will overwrite heap structures with
attacker-supplied data that can then be leveraged to achieve code
execution with the privileges of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Cerulean Studios has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
