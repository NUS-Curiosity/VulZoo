Subject: Security predictions for 2009

We here at n3td3v would like to hear your security predictions for 2009.

Last time Paul Ferguson said 2008 would be the year of web 2.0 bugs
and web 2.0 worms, that turned out to be utter rubbish (He does work
for Trend Micro afterall), but in true tradition, let's here some of
your predictions that might turn out to be bullshit as well.
