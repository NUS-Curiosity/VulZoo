i think that color rating is pretty much retarded w/out sumthing 2
back it up.  if there is a reason to raise it, then fine, but keeping
the color at 2 (iss) or yellow (symantec) all the time doesnt do
anything.  its like the homeland security colors in teh united states.
 if its at yellow all the time, yellow becomes teh new green.
