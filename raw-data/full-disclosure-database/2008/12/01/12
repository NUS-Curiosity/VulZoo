Yes,

We do have a working framework for color code generation. The inputs
to this function include

*exploits released in the past week
  - The severity of the exploit
  - The application it was in
  - The language
  - estimated users of the software

*The previous week's color

*Localized nature of exploits.

We cannot comment more on this until it is refined and standardized.
If you are (or know) an antivirus vendor, please contact me offline to
move ahead.
