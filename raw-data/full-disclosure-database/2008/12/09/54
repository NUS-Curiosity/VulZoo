    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5300

Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package contain multiple
    vulnerabilities.  The inotify functionality may allow local
    users to gain privileges via unknown vectors related to race
    conditions in inotify watch removal and umount.  Additionally,
    there are two Denial of Services vulnerabilities, including one 
    in which a local user may cause a "soft" system lock-up.
    
    This update requires a system reboot to implement the fixes.
