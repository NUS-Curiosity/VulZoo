Subject: Re: 21 Million German bank accounts stolen

Contact your bank and ask them how they protect you against fraud. Get
everything in writing. Then to be safe change everything (hoping that these
people don't have continual access to the banks server so they pick up new
accounts) Place a credit watch on your SCHUFA score and hope that the BND
catches them.
