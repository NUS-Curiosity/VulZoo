They are trying to get the government to do something about it. But unless
they see the danger not just hear about it nothing will happen.

Consider remarks before Congress last year by O. Sami Saydjari, CEO of Cyber
Defense Agency <http://www.cyberdefenseagency.com/>, a security research and
consulting firm, and a former official at the Defense Dept.'s research arm,
DARPA. Following a major cyber-attack, he told legislators, electricity,
banking, and communications could all go dead, leaving Americans scrounging
for food, water, gasolineâ€”even hunks of firewood traded on the black market.
