They say the enemy is the intelligence services of other nations, but
if they want to be taken seriously, they need to start releasing proof
to the mailing lists and name specific intelligence agency's who are
conducting the Cyberwar. I don't think there is a cyberwar, there will
be intelligencers probing the networks for secrets, thats not a
cyberwar. Cyberwar is something completely different... yet to be seen
and hasn't appeared yet. We had the U.S get twitchy about
intelligencers probing their networks for secrets, that led to the U.S
conducting Estonia and Georgia to get their politicians to notice
Cyberwar *could* be real, *look at this*. Although the truth is, we
haven't seen a Cyberwar yet, it's still in the imaginary dream book
stage.
