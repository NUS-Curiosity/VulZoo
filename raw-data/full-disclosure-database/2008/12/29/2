Wow... with all this Merry Christmas stuff... I have to ask where the political correctness has gone?  What about those who don't believe in the meaning of Christmas, and Christ being born?  What about all those "atheists" who refuse to acknowledge?  Anyway... thank you for saying "fuck politically correct" and wishing people Merry Christmas... Happy New year to you!
