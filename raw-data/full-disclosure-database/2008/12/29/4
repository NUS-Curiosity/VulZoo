Subject: ANNOUNCE - Zerowine Sandbox

Hi,

I'm pleased to announce the first release of the project Zero Wine, a
behavioral based malware analysis.

Zero wine is a sandbox created with WINE and QEmu to (automatically)
analyze malware.

It's behavioral based: Just upload your malware to the zerowine's web
server and let it analyze the malware's behavior by running it (in a
isolated environment).

The very first release consist in a prebuilt QEmu virtual machine (the
recommended way) or the python source code (see the file INSTALL for
details).
