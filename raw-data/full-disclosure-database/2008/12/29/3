Subject: Inguma 0.1.0 R1 Released

Hi!

I'm pleased to announce the new version of Inguma (version 0.1.0 R1). In
this version 2 major interesting tools were added:

* OpenDis Binary Navigator. A navigator for executables. See the
following screenshots:

https://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=188246&ssid=96684

To run the binary navigator, download the new version, unpack it and
execute the following commands: 

$ cd $INGUMA_DIR/dis
$ ./pycgiserver

* PCAP Fuzzer: Another interesting tool (well, a library and a tool) is
this, the PCAP based fuzzer. Record a session in one PCAP format file
and use it in your scripts to automatically fuzz every token (or every
byte) of the communication. It's good, in example, to audit propietary
network protocols.

Another thing that might by of interest for you is the library
libinformix. It's a library to communicate with Informix in a native
way. It isn't finished, however, you can communicate (to execute queries
and so on) with recent Informix versions without any problem.

And the following is the (almost) complete ChangeLog for this new
version: 

* Added a POC for the Sun Java Web Proxy Server heap overflow (fixed).
* Added library libinformix. Supports connection establishment and
command execution. Pure python code.
* Added OpenDis Binary Navigator.
* Added a brute force module for Informix databases (bruteifx).
* Fixed bugs in the Sybase's brute force module.
* Added an Informix SQLEXEC protocol fuzzer.
* Added liboracleinternals.py. Currently it just work for creating
oracle password files (from version 8 to 11).
* Added module db2discover to discover IBM DB2 database servers.
* Added an information gather module for Informix database servers.
* Very (basic) initial support for RDP protocol format.
* Added support for fuzzing based on PCAP packets.
* Distributed Nikto database updated.
* Added basic support for Bluetooth and Wifi (Hugo).
* Added a frontend for Nmap (Hugo).
* Added libhexdump (Hugo).
* Added modules tcpproxy, hexdump and simple web server (Hugo).
* Changed format of OpenDis databases to SQLite format (use
-sdb=file.sqlite).
