Subject: [Tool] sqlmap 0.6.3 released

Hi,

I am glad to release sqlmap version 0.6.3.

Introduction
============

sqlmap is an automatic SQL injection tool developed in Python. Its goal
is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities on web
applications. Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the target
host, the user can choose among a variety of options to perform an
extensive back end database management system fingerprint, retrieve DBMS
session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes, privileges,
databases, dump entire or user's specific DBMS tables/columns, run his
own SQL SELECT statement, read specific files on the file system and
much more.


Changes
=======

Some of the new features include:

* Major enhancement to get list of targets to test from Burp proxy
(http://portswigger.net/suite/) requests log file path or WebScarab
proxy (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project)
'conversations/' folder path by providing option -l <filepath>;
* Major enhancement to support Partial UNION query SQL injection
technique too;
* Major enhancement to test if the web application technology supports
stacked queries (multiple statements) by providing option --stacked-test
which will be then used someday also by takeover functionality;
* Major enhancement to test if the injectable parameter is affected by a
time based blind SQL injection technique by providing option --time-test;
* Major bug fix to correctly enumerate columns on Microsoft SQL Server;
* Major bug fix so that when the user provide a SELECT statement to be
processed with an asterisk as columns, now it also work if in the FROM
there is no database name specified;
