FD is an *un*moderated list.

FD is an *un*moderated list.

Per the list charter, which link is posted at the bottom of every message:

**********************************

Moderation & Management

The [Full-Disclosure] list is unmoderated. Typically posting will be restricted 
to members only, however the administrators may choose to accept submissions 
from non-members based on individual merit and relevance.

It is expected that the list will be largely self-policing, however in special 
circumstances (eg spamming, misappropriation) then offending members may be 
removed from the list by the management.

*********************************

FD is an *un*moderated list.

Hopefully that clears the matter up for you.
