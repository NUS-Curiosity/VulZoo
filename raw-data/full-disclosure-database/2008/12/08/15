Subject: Solaris 10 Auditing

Hello

I am looking for a free audit script / tool to audit host level security for Solaris 10 machines. Does any one know of any such scripts / tools around?

Thanks

It's pretty hilarious that you went and asked John to moderate those who don't like you n3td3v and then turned around and criticized people for wanting the same thing, except on a more unbiased level. I'm pretty positive Cartwright doesn't give a shit about the quality of the list as I'm guessing he unsubbed himself a looong time ago.
