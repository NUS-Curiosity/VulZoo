n3td3v see this is the problem. Your are bringing your personal ego to
FD. You speak loose and leave lots of room for everyone (not just
Ureleet) to comment! When someone does that you get offended and cant
resist top-posting.

You fight, you put your opinions but post your email like one
chance-knockout. How about you focus on "security". How good is that
to waste yours and everyone's 1 whole year chasing your ego to see
Ureleet get tired and quit. That will not happen. Or least if he quits
there will be another to comment on you.

You dont speak loose. Dont give others room to comment on you by
thinking before you speak and all other will fall in place.

I dare you try the suggestion for once and help us to like you more!
