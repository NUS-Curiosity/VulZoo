And if n3td3v suddenly happen to keep noise low Ureleet, you promise
to keep noise low with him and treat him with respect? :) Give him
some grounds to negotiate upon!

n3td3v should really consider doing some certification like CCNA,
RHCE, MCSE ed-all to start with. Lets all respect his enthusiasm but
currently its enthusiasm without a right direction.

visit those websites. get along in the forum. If someone makes fun
take it with a smile... Dont be afraid to put up ideas, like your
ideas to stop bad guys from getting metasploit but good guys can have
it for penetration testing. But first draft your ideas/discoveries.
post it on those forums. get it read and approved by a few first. take
feedback from around. Ask what others think about it. optimize it and
if all looks good post it in FD. We would love to hear from you.
