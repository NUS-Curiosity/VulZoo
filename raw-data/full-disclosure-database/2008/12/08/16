Hello

 

I am looking for a free audit script / tool to audit host level security
for Solaris 10 machines. Does any one know of any such scripts / tools
around?

 

Thanks

It's pretty hilarious that you went and asked John to moderate those who
don't like you n3td3v and then turned around and criticized people for
wanting the same thing, except on a more unbiased level. I'm pretty

I'm guessing he unsubbed himself a looong time ago.
