This is quite simple to do on Gmail. All you need to do is open any full-disclosure email. Then click on show details and select filter messages from this mailing list.

Nytrokiss, are you really suggesting, as a general rule, to use a *web-browser* on an unmoderated
security forum that occasionally includes live exploit code....that runs in said browser?    Call me old 
fashioned, but man, I don't think that's a good idea.  I don't want to read it with Lynx, either.  I've got 
some damn good SMTP clients, like Pine v.01a, OK?

(Slapping-Self, 'cause the G5 no workie, again...!  Do as I say, not as I do, hah!  Slap!)

Getting back to the org. premise, some of you here don't think the org. ID's are getting a little
out of hand in their length?  I meekly submit the notion that this practice may have something to 
do with Ego/Promo...I dunno, really, what is the requirement for an extra space/length "[ blah-blah1371117 ]" 
between the characters....if only to center the eye on the author?

Indeed, instead of "[Full-disclosure]" wouldn't "[FD]" work just the same for filtering?  And give us 
more space?  Yeah, I think it would.

...and it's a ton of emails, especially if you run a few flavors of 'Nix and do your best not to become a 
bad Netizen.  Or if someone posts, ranting they've been Fed-Poizoned...?  Think how many wage-drones 
you've worked with that have no care of exploits on FD, and suffered the consequences because of it? 

I stand by my suggestions.
