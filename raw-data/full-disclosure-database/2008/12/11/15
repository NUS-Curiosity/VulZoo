Are they worse than linux-kernel, which is averaging some 500+ messages
a day?

"Note that nobody reads every post in linux-kernel. In fact, nobody who expects
to have time left over to actually do any real kernel work will read even half.
Except Alan Cox, but he's actually not human, but about a thousand gnomes
working in under-ground caves in Swansea. None of the individual gnomes read
all the postings either, they just work together really well." -- Linus Torvalds (2000-05-02)
