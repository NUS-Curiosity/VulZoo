Full Disclosure peeps, some new content to consume.

NEW FREE WEBCAST - Oracle Database Forensics

Black Hat's webcast series continues with another powerful presentation from
a popular Black Hat speaker. This month's presenter is David Litchfield of
NGS software, speaking on Oracle database forensics, and he will be
releasing a new tool called orablock which he describes this way:

"Orablock allows a forensic investigator to dump data from a "cold" Oracle
data file - i.e. there's no need to load up the data file in the database
which would cause the data file to be modified, so using orablock preserves
the evidence. Orablock can also be used to locate "stale" data - i.e. data
that has been deleted or updated. It can also be used to dump SCNs for data
blocks which can be useful during the examination of a compromised Oracle
box."

Please join us to learn about Oracle DB forensics from one of the innovators
of the field, as well as learn about his new tool and to get your questions
answered. The webcast will be held on December 18 at 1pm PST. The URL for
registration is:

UPCOMING BLACK HAT EVENTS

The next big Black Hat event is Black Hat DC, scheduled for February 16-19
at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City in Arlington Virginia. The event is divide
into two sections with two days of intense, hands-on Training Sessions
followed by a two-day, four-track Briefings portion with a wide variety of
exciting speakers and presentations. Black Hat DC is a unique information
security event that places a special emphasis on the needs of security
professionals who work in government service and infrastructure. And we
think this one will be our best DC event yet. Even though the Black Hat DC
Call for Papers doesn't close until January 1, but we've already confirmed
some exciting Briefings presentations.

- Crowd favorite Adam Laurie will return with a satellite-hacking
presentation that is sure to be popular.
- Database guru David Litchfield will present a powerful new database
forensics tool.
- Andrew Lindell's contribution is entitled  "Making Privacy-Preserving data
Mining Practical with Smartcards."
- In the hardware hacking area we have a very interesting presentation from
Travis Goodspeed on reverse engineering and exploiting wireless sensors.

Our lineup of brand new training sessions includes a physical security
training by Zac Franken and Adam Laurie entitled "RFID, Access Control and
Biometric Systems", a Metasploit course called "Tactical Exploitation" by
Metasploit creator HD Moore and a course on "Understanding and Deploying
DNNSEC" by Paul Wouters and Patrick Nauber.

As always, it's best to register early for the training of your choice to
make sure there's a place for you - seats are limited. To learn more about
all of our training courses, follow this link:
