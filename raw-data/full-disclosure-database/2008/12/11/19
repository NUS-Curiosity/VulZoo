Actually, this seems fine to me. Yes, it's manipulating some heap
construct for the purpose of executing injected code.. but, what
I think this statement is trying to relay is that the author isn't
sure exactly what in the XML parser is being exploited. Obviously,
there are 1,000,000 ways to get to Detroit, so to speak. It could
be a specific XML module, or it could be something in the core
language parser. It might be related to a non XML library that is
loaded as a result of parsing XML data in a certain way, etc. I
think, in this case, we can give the author a break.
