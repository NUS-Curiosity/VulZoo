Although the domain is 2.channel15.facebook.com, all the significant
Facebook cookies appear to be .facebook.com domain cookies so wouldn't
the more significant attack involve those, rather than some elaborate
phishing scheme?

This is not a significant aspect of this vulnerability.
You could go and register http://www.facebook-secure.com/ (or similar)
and that would leave users more than happy to believe & trust it is
Facebook.
Things can be different if the XSS is on an https-supporting login
domain, but that does not seem to be the case here.
