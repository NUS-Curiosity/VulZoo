Subject: Two windows exploits in the wild

One IE exploit and One Wordpad

http://it.slashdot.org/it/08/12/10/206216.shtml

On a more interesting note i feel that slashdot should screen there writers
better Here is a quote that i saw "*The exploit is a typical heap overflow
that appears to be exploiting something in the XML parser.'" *Try to have
someone that knows what a heap overflow look over the article next time. If
it's a heap overflow we know it's exploiting a heap within the program.
