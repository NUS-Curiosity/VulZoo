And to think that you paid a very good amount of money for that level of
service.

We all know that there is no level of DRM that can protect anything.
Where there is a will, there is a way.  Your statement of affecting only
legitimate customers is dead on the money.

Time to start voting with dollars and holding companies accountable.
This state of eating whatever they spoon feed to us needs to end.  We
all allowed this to happen.
