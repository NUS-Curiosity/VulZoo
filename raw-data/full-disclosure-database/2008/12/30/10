>>From Microsoft: 
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/961509.mspx

"Microsoft is not aware of specific attacks against MD5, so previously
issued certificates that were signed using MD5 are not affected and do not
need to be revoked. This issue only affects certificates being signed
using MD5 after the publication of the attack method."

I take it the above is incorrect?
