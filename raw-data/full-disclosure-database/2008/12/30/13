You lied about leaving.

Take your pathetic drivel somewhere else.  Your "research" consists of
regurgitating main-stream media articles and your ideas are so
half-baked they make children with easy-bake ovens look like gourmet
chefs.

It's clear you have absolutely zero practical experience in the
security field and you're far too stupid for anything theoretical.
You think you're contributing to some grand discourse, when in fact
you're the least-respected person (and I use the term loosely) sending
things to this list.  There are spam generators who command more
respect than you do.

You want someone to pay attention to you (that's rhetorical, of course
you do)?  Go back to school, learn something, then get a job and
_really_ learn something.  In five years you might actually be able to
ask questions that make sense.  In another 5 years you might even
begin to form valid opinions.

If you insist on continuing to vomit fast-food security news all over
the Internet, at least try to contain it to your own room and out of
the public.  In other words:  Quit lying and make good on your promise
to leave this list.
