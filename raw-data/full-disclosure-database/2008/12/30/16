Subject: [Tool Announcement] FSpy - linux filesystem
	activity monitoring

Dear List,

FSpy is an easy to use linux filesystem activity monitoring tool which
is meant to be small, fast and to handle system resources
conservative.
you can apply filters, use diffing and your own output format in order
to get the best results.

The release talk was just today at the 25c3 in Berlin, Germany. The
slides are also available...
