Dear Idiot:

Mossad is the *intelligence* branch.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad

The current attacks are by the *military* branch.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces

You seem to be able to keep your MI5/MI6 obsession straight and not confuse

respect, especially when basic fact like these are readily available online.
