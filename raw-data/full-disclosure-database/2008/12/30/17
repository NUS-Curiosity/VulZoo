While I'm not going to outright say you are lying, you generally don't
cite sources and spout your *opinions* as if they are fact.

These together cause many people to look at you as, if not a lame
wannabe, at least not professional.

I have been a lurker on and off here for a while and while I don't post
much at least I choose not to post inaccurate statements and opinions.
