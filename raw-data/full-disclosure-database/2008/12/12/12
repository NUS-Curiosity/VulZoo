Blogs are not edible. You want to eat, blogging probably won't cut it.

Sure, looking at starting a new company *may* be an option for *some* of these
people, but those are the ones that would already have been called "flight
risks" at their previous company.  The situation is at least somewhat similar
to the .com bubble burst a few years back - a *lot* of techies found themselves
unemployed, and the same exact market forces that made them unemployed also
meant that starting a new venture will be difficult.

What do you use for start-up capital?  Where does the money for your groceries
come from while you wait for your new business to start generating revenue? And
what are you using as a revenue stream (in other words, what are you selling
that people want to buy)? These are the sort of things that are tough enough in
a growing market segment, and damned near impossible when it's shrinking.
