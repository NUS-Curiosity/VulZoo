Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenOffice.org might allow for
user-assisted execution of arbitrary code or symlink attacks.

Background
==========

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

Affected packages
=================

       -------------------------------------------------------------------
        Package                    /  Vulnerable  /            Unaffected
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
     1  app-office/openoffice           < 3.0.0                  >= 3.0.0
     2  app-office/openoffice-bin       < 3.0.0                  >= 3.0.0
       -------------------------------------------------------------------
        2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Two heap-based buffer overflows when processing WMF files
(CVE-2008-2237) and EMF files (CVE-2008-2238) were discovered. Dmitry
E. Oboukhov also reported an insecure temporary file usage within the
senddoc script (CVE-2008-4937).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code. A local
attacker could perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary files on
the system. Both cases happen with the privileges of the user running
the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

   # emerge --sync
   # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-3.0.0"

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

   # emerge --sync
   # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-3.0.0"
