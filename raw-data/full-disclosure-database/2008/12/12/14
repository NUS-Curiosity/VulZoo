This alert is an excellent example of what I've been ranting about,  
e.g.:

Re: [Full-disclosure] [SECURITY] [DSA 1685-1] New uw-imap packages fix  
multiple vulnerabilities
-------------------------> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

24-25 characters that could have been appended to the end of the  
subject line instead of
the beginning.

In a perfect world, the message would read like this, with "[Full- 
disclosure]" abbreviated to "[FD]":

"Re: [FD] New uw-imap packages fix multiple vulnerabilities [SECURITY]  
[DSA 1685-1]"

Oi, I know this makes too much sense, sorry.
