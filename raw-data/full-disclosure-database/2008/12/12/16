You're new to this whole scene, right?

You don't think that malware authors often, usually or any other way 
reliably come up with most of the ideas in their code do you?

It _is_ a fairly awesome idea.

But you'd better start crying anyway bitch as you've just reinvented a 
(rather limited form of) HTML fuzzing.

In various forms, fuzz testing has been around for about 20 years, so I 
guess it's understandable you'd have missed discovering that this 
approach has already been discovered...

See what Wikipedia has to say about it:

and soak up the history from the original (??) fuzz site:
