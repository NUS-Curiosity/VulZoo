Hey Martin!

Yep, in case of such card readers, it's safe and secure...for now, until the bad guys think of something more sophisticated like Simon described earlier this morning.
Unfortunatelly in our district we haven't seen anything alike for now - only plain smart-cards, but I hope we'll see this in the near future. :)

What concerns SMS autentification and payment confirms - in our district the system is being still tested on authentification, no payment confirms are available.
But you know the story...first cases we'll see in our small Estonia - and our banks will difently start thinking on this.

Regards,
vik

Dear vik,

Nice to see that people from all over the world read and answer
full-disclosure. :-)

Yes, you're right. Those trojans that log and intercept data on the fly
are really a pain for most online banking customers. Fortunately some
banks are already technically prepared to resist those trojans.

Some banks already demand a class 3 smart card reader, which means the
reader itself must be equipped with a separate display and keyboard.
(costing roughly 100 â‚¬ in total). Such devices look alike the credit
card machines at a checkout.

The amount of every single transaction must be displayed and
acknowledged on the separate card reader, which has its own OS/firmware.

This means, any PC trojan would completely fail intercepting, as any
alteration would be visible on the display or would invalidate the RSA
signature. A successful trojan would need to breach two security zones:
the PC OS plus the super hardened card reader OS.

The crucial point is to use separate smart card readers that have an own
OS/firmware. (not Windows for sure) Fancy card readers, aren't they? ;-)

Best regards,
	Martin Salfer
