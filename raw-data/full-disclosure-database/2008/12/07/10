I'm here to talk about security, so are you, so let's talk about it
instead of talking about each other. Ureleet has damaged this list
over the past year for bitching about me, I haven't been able to talk
about as much as I wanted to about security because i've had to tackle
Ureleet to push him off the list and burn his ego to get the list back
to normal. He is starting to give up, i'm looking forward to the day
he isn't here and we can focus on security again. I'm sorry that my
enemies are ruining the list... they will tire of bitching one day.
