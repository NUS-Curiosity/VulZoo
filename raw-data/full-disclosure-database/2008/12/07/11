Subject: Re: Fwd: FD culture!?

You dont know shit about security, that's why your a troll.
If anyone has damaged this mailing list, it's you.
Because of you, we have ureleet, if you wasn't there saying shit everytime
ureleet wouldn't be here.
Also mr crackhead, you should know something, this mailing list is not a
news relay, we allready have RSS reader setted for what we consider
interresting.
So unless, you have some l33t code, 0days to show, please shut the fuck up.
Then this mailing list will be pleasant.
