I agree with Bipin here.  I've almost quit this list a number of times 
due to the garbage that comes out of a selected few people here, however 
I've settled on letting my DEL key be my best friend here.  I 
respectfully ask that others do the same and don't fuel the fires.

If the firemakers get ignored long enough they may not find it fun here 
anymore.

Thank you for listening.
