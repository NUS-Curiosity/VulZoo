People with multiple personalities! Split personality problem?

Or is all this all an intentional activity and looks like (in
practice) the owners of FD are ok with where FD is heading to! How can
someone act ignorant for so long?

Yelling, "this is the drawback of a unmoderated mailing list" isnt the
answer nor the solution. We joined FD because we thought umoderated
doesnt mean untamed and definitely... having to tolerate so much of
noise and nonsense for so long. We all know all these has a easy fix.
Its really time for the owners of the list to send a clear message.
Whats going on? How do you see all this? Whats your prospective? Where
is FD heading? We all really want to have a CLEAR answer in
words/action.

I am really willing to hear about all this from the prospective of Mr.
John Cartwright or the answer to just 1 question. So Mr John, how does
all of this fit into the scope of FD-character,
