Subject: Re: ZDI-08-088: Oracle E-Business Suite
	Self-Service Web Applications SQL Injection Vulnerability

The Zero Day Initiative advisory ZDI-08-088 has several inaccuracies.
Oracle actually fixed this vulnerability as part of the April 2007 Critical
Patch Update and subsequently in ATG_PF.H RUP5 and later. The vulnerability
is a serious SQL injection bug in a Self-Service Web Application database
package that is called and accessible through mod_plsql.  Mod_plsql is an
Apache module and part of an Oracle web framework which allows database
packages to dynamically generate web pages. The vulnerable
schema.package.procedure name is APPS.ICXSUPWF.DISPLAYCONTACTS and all
versions 115.6 and prior are vulnerable.  When creating intrusion
detection/prevention rules for this vulnerability, the URL will normally
only include the package/procedure name ICXSUPWF.DISPLAYCONTACTS and
mod_plsql URLs are case-insensitive. This URL is normally blocked by the
Oracle E-Business Suite 11i URL Firewall and should not be externally
accessible.

Original Oracle Advisory:
Oracle Critical Patch Update April 2007 - APPS01

CVE Name:
CVE-2007-2126

Affected Product and Versions:
Oracle E-Business Suite 11.5.1 through 11.5.10.2 (CU2)

Affected Oracle E-Business Suite Modules:
Application Object Library (FND)/Self-Service Web Applications (ICX)

Patch Availability:
11.5.1 - 11.5.6 - No patches are available for unsupported versions of the
Oracle E-Business Suite
11.5.7 - 11.5.10.2 with ATG_PF.H RUP4 or prior - 5893391
11.5.9 - 11.5.10.2 with ATG_PF.H RUP5 or higher - No patch required as this
fix was included in RUP5 and higher

Additional information on the Oracle Critical Patch Update April 2007 and
the impact on the Oracle E-Business Suite 11i is available at -

Vulnerability "anthropologists" may be interested in the fact that this
vulnerability has existed since at least September 1999 and likely was
introduced several years earlier with the release of Oracle Applications
11.0.  Oracle fixed this bug in less than 2 months by simply stubbing the
procedure - clearly this was old code not used anymore by the application.
I wonder how much first generation web application code exists in the world
that is still accessible but automated scanning tools miss since it is not
directly accessible through a link?

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL on
vulnerable installations of Oracle E-Business Suite Business
Intelligence. Authentication is not required to exploit this
vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the APPS.ICXSUPWF.DisplayContacts package.
The procedure fails to validate the contents of a WHERE clause
containing user-suppled input. This allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary SQL statements in the context of the APPS user.
