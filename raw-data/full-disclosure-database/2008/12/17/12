Subject: Re: List of security teams contact information


: I've created a list with contact information for various security teams:
: 
: http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php?title=List_of_security_teams_contact_information 
: I hope this makes informing vendors about security issues easier. If you 
: have any additional information or spot an error, let me know.

This project was created a while back to do the same. Please consider 
contributing to it.
