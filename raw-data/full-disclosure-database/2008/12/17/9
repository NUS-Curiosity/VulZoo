Subject: List of security teams contact information

Hey all,

I've created a list with contact information for various security teams:

http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php?title=List_of_security_teams_contact_information
I hope this makes informing vendors about security issues easier. If you
have any additional information or spot an error, let me know.

Cheers,

SkyLined
