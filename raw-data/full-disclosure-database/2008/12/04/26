I can't believe people are still using Estonia as an example of a
cyber attack, it was a false flag on an epic scale and so obvious to
I.T security experts. The government have got to try harder if they
want to convince the industry that cyber terrorism is a real threat.
But the fact is Estonia and Georgia just weren't convincing enough at
least for me, I don't know what others think.

And the shutting down of a turbine and posting the video to CNN was
just a joke, there was no actual evidence of how the turbine shut
down, it could just be a man in the corner flicking a switch, there
was no evidence of someone using a computer to shut it down, we were
told it was a cyber attack doing it, but no proof or evidence was
given to prove it. They didn't even have a guy with a laptop standing
beside it or anything like that, really the government are clueless
with it comes to cyber security and creating a convincing false flag.

When it comes to power stations being shut down through computerised
attack, I don't see the threat coming from cyber terrorism, what I see
the threat is more is accidental infection, like the three hospitals
in London that got shut down last month because of the MyTob worm/
virus, the industry sit up and listen to that kind of thing and take
it seriously (or at least I did), but they shouldn't take seriously
Estonia, Georgia, DHS turbine videos.

Cyber terrorism isn't a real threat in the climate we're in right now,
what we should fear is accidental infection like the three hospitals
in London. That got my attention more than Estonia, Georgia, DHS
turbine video put together, because it was so obvious that the three
hospitals in London was a genuine incident and not set up by the
powers of be.

We should worry more about staff competence being the main threat, not
cyber terrorism, but mistakes made by I.T departments and accidental
infection onto networks that are sensitive like the three hospitals in
London.

Please it just makes me cringe when I see people using Estonia as a
way to pave political policy and setting up things. There is no cyber
terrorism guys, there is staff incompetence and accidental infection
that is the biggest worry for me right now, than some people in a cave
wanting to carry out an electronic jihad.

Money is wasted setting up cyber commands and other stuff, the money
should really be spent on making sure the private and public sector
and academia is trained to a specific standard so that the three
hospitals incident can't happen again.

As for the color code thing, thats just a load of wash and bollocks
thats not needed, its good for businesses like Symantec and SANS to
have alert levels, because fear is part of what they play on to make
the money that they do.

All the best,
