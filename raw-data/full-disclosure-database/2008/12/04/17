The most useful aspect of the SANS color meter is the fact that when it
changes, they *also* publish an in-depth article about the threat that made
them change the level.  So you as a security professional can say "Wow, the
meter just flickered, I better go read the latest and act on it..."

Note the last 4 words there. That's the distinction between a useful service
and a color-du-jour marker - actionable information.

Or you can just point your favorite RSS reader at the article feed:

http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?rss

and have *it* chirp at you when there's a new article.
