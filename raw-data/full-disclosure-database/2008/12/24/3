Subject: ANNOUNCE - eCL0WN released: clone ePassports with
	your phone

Hi,

I'm pleased to announce the release of eCL0WN.

Introduction
============
eCL0WN is an ePassport utility for Nokia NFC phones that allows you to read
and clone your ePassport's chip content. The following functionality is
implemented in the current release (build 20081216):

* Read passport data using a given authentication key.
* View passport details including the JPEG picture.
* Write passport data to an emulator chip.
* Write passport data to a microSD card (= insecure!).

Supported devices
=================
eCL0WN is tested on the Nokia 6131 NFC and Nokia 6212 NFC.

Download
========
You can download eCL0WN - including pointers to other relevant information -
at <http://www.dexlab.nl/>.

Details
=======
eCL0WN reads BAC-protected ePassport files EF.COM, EF.SOD, EF.DG1 and
EF.DG2. If present, the optional files EF.DG11, EF.DG12, EF.DG13 and EF.DG15
will also be read. Retrieved data can be written to an ePassport emulator.
Before writing files to the emulator all Active Authentication (AA) related,
Extended Access Control (EAC) related and unknown files (if any) are removed
from index EF.COM. This allows one to bypass AA and EAC checks of inspection
systems vulnerable to downgrade-attacks.

Note that eCL0WN does not comply with ICAO Doc 9303 at all. Please do not
use it to check authenticity or integrity of machine readable travel
documents.

Future work
===========
* Add support for viewing JPEG-2000 pictures, used in e.g. German and Dutch
ePassports.


Happy cl0wning!
