Subject: Announcing "Session Destroyer" -- Invalidate your
	webapp logins with ease!

The art of Crowd SuRFing the massess.  This proof-of-concept handles
most of the Alexa Top 100 websites that require logins.  Mainly just
US sites for now, but more will be added later.  If you pull this into
an IFRAME on your site, you can mess with lots of people.  Nothing
new.  Just something fun for the season.  Cheers and happy holidays
:-)
