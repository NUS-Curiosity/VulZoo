Hi,

This is to correct our previous advisory IVIZ-08-016 published on
December 10, 2008.

The advisory mentions F-Secure by mistake instead of just F-Prot.
F-Secure product is not affected by the vulnerability mentioned in the
advisory.

The updated advisory reflecting the changes is available at:
