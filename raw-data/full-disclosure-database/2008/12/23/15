Subject: STAR - A frontend to RATS

All,

While bored at work this past week I decided to throw together a front end for the Rough Auditing Tool for Security (RATS).  It supports most features of RATS and runs on both win32 and nix systems.  Development was in Python (PyQt4) and the app has been packaged using py2exe.  See http://www.socialnetworkwhore.com/ for screen shots and downloads.

Any cool feature ideas would be appreciated :)

Have a great day,
Ben

P.S. Source code coming soon :)
