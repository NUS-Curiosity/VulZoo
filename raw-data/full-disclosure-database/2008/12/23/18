Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities in ClamAV may allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus is a free anti-virus toolkit for UNIX, designed
especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.94.2                      >= 0.94.2

Description
===========

Moritz Jodeit reported an off-by-one error within the
get_unicode_name() function in libclamav/vba_extract.c when processing
VBA project files (CVE-2008-5050). Ilja van Sprundel reported an
infinite recursion error within the cli_check_jpeg_exploit() function
in libclamav/special.c when processing JPEG files (CVE-2008-5314).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted VBA or JPEG file to
the clamd daemon, possibly resulting in the remote execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application
or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.94.2"
