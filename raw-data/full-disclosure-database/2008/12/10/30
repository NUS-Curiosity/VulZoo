Hrm,
Are you talking about linux AV by F-Secure or linux AV by F-Prot.

These are different companies. Also, a short glance on both company
websites tells pretty much that neither have 4.X strain as the latest.

Usually when posting vulns on software it's recommended to use the latest
and greatest versions.
