The OP seemed to think that there was no competence in financial IT.  I
know firsthand that  are some smart people, but, like everywhere else,
there must be more than enough morons too -- especially given what I've

But, hey, I work in academia, not the financial industry and I should
better than to post to FD -- so, whatever.  *shrug*
