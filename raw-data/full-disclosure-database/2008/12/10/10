Subject: ISOI 6, Dallas, TX - January 29, 30

Hi all. ISOI is once again happening, and back to the States.

Almost final agenda: http://isotf.org/isoi6.html

As usual, while attendance is limited to the folks who are busy "saving the 
Internet"/"fighting crime", it is free of charge.

Once again we offer the public at-large the opportunity to attend without such 
membership. The process is: you submit a relevant talk, get vetted and get 
accepted. We have two slots reserved for such a purpose.

Subjects of interest: case studies, attacks, botnets, fraud, ...
To submit email your talk idea to contact@...tf.org.

Is it time to say merry Xmas yet?

 	Gadi.
