Subject: [FULL DISCLOSURE] Facebook Non Persistant XSS

Found in August, I tried to alert facebook as quickly as was possible
- however I received no further correspondence to my communications.
At time of writing, it was possible to exploit both Firefox 3 and IE 7
- by simply using an IFRAME or even an object tag. (Dependant on the
browser target)

This allows you to overwrite the whole page with your choice of script/embed.

Vulnerability was found by accident when I was routing my web traffic
via WebScarab with an advanced list of strings to use with the
in-built XSS/CSRF tool.

http://2.channel15.facebook.com/iframe/7/?pv=49&rev="></script><title>Google</title></head></body><IFRAME
src="http://www.google.com/" type="text/html" width="100%"
height="100%"></IFRAME>

Naturally that rather obvious URL could be encoded, or cut down to
prevent the obvious anomaly. However, I feel the facebook domain name
itself would be enough to fool most users.

*Similar vulnerabilities had been spoken about on a credit card fraud
(carding) forum prior to my discovery of this. Possibly for the use of
phisihing.*
