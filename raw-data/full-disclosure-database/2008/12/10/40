Synopsis
========

Several remotely exploitable bugs have been found in CUPS, which allow
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

CUPS is the Common Unix Printing System.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  net-print/cups     < 1.3.9-r1                         >= 1.3.9-r1

Description
===========

Several buffer overflows were found in:

* The read_rle16 function in imagetops (CVE-2008-3639, found by
    regenrecht, reported via ZDI)

* The WriteProlog function in texttops (CVE-2008-3640, found by
    regenrecht, reported via ZDI)

* The Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language (HPGL) filter (CVE-2008-3641,
    found by regenrecht, reported via iDefense)

* The _cupsImageReadPNG function (CVE-2008-5286, reported by iljavs)

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted input to a vulnerable
server, resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the server.

Workaround
==========

None this time.

Resolution
==========

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version.

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.3.9-r1"
