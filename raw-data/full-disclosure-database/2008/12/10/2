Subject: Re: We're letting the bad guys win

ok this is what this whole thing looks like to me:

To n3td3v:
You often post ideas and express your opinion to this list. The  some
(often the more liberal) of us often disagree with you and others mock
you for your adventurousness. Actually sometimes it looks childish,
almost as if you're desperately trying to propose the big new thing
that changes the world.
The thing is your posting to a list where really, all that happens is
people (mostly sec companies) post information on vulnerabilities in
software and news in the sec field.
You say you came here for information, then LEACH like the rest of us
- just shut up. If you want a mailing list for proposed security
project ideas then make one.
You're enthusiastic and a dreamer who's obviously very forward and
ambitious with that excellence. Just think before you talk, and maybe
do something, like sit down and think:
I want to be $A(as in what you're going to do with your LIFE!). To be
that I need to get $B done. To do that I have to do $C[]/*<-that's a
list(:s)*/.

To all that oppose n3td3v:
Some of you (UreLeet + others) get a little too excited and flame. If
you don't like how someone acts, what they have to say, who they are:
then shut up! You don't need to bully something into submission just
because you don't like it. If you get some angry rush feeling when you
see a some stupid fat kid majorly embarrass himself by attempting to
be funny with his freinds and just looking like that annoying retard
kid the don't bully him! Be gentle and point out the problem
(privately) (of course first think are you really of a knowledge and
responsibility to instruct this child how to change his life) OR, much
better: shut up, and go take your (own) anger out somewhere else, PC
games do it for me, <www.thepcmanwebsite.com/media/pacman_flash/> -
even that's good enough.
btw  n3td3v - I don't think you're a retarded fat child (ur not right?).

Come to think about it: We're being listened to by a bunch of other
people, mostly geeks who think FD is the shitz where all the l33t sec
companies go for their patches and sec news (it isn't!). But are we
all just doing this crap for the benefit of out audience. I mean I
could have written these things to the individuals they where intended
for. Hell I could have taken my own advice and shut up, blocked the
troublesome email addresses, and carried on with my life (I'm a
hobbiest). Are You All Just Doing This For The Benefit Of The Sec Gods
We Wish We Where?  THINK ABOUT IT

Oh also I don't care about me - I'm a leach, I'll should probably not
post on this list unless I have something decent to say too.
