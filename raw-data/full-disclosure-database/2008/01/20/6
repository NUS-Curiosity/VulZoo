Subject: sqlninja 0.2.2 released

Hello security enthusiasts,

a new version of sqlninja is out at Sourceforge !

Introduction
============
Sqlninja is a tool to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities on a web
application that uses Microsoft SQL Server as its back-end. Its main
goal is to provide a remote shell on the vulnerable DB server, even in a
very hostile environment. It should be used by penetration testers to
help and automate the process of taking over a DB Server when a SQL
Injection vulnerability has been discovered. It is written in Perl, it 
is released under the GPLv2 and so far has been successfully tested on:
- Linux
- FreeBSD
- Mac OS X
You can find it, together with a flash demo of its features, at the
address http://sqlninja.sourceforge.net

What's new
==========
# Evasion techniques, in order to obfuscate the injected code and 
confuse/bypass signature-based IPS and application firewalls
# A more sophisticated upload module
# A new 'blind execution' attack mode, useful to issue commands and 
performs diagnostics when other modes fail
# Automatic URL-encoding now is performed only on sqlninja generated SQL 
code, giving the user a more granular control on the exploit strings
# Several other minor improvements

What's not so new
=================
# Fingerprint of the remote SQL Server (version, user performing the
queries, user privileges, xp_cmdshell availability, authentication mode)
# Bruteforce of 'sa' password, both dictionary-based and incremental
# Privilege escalation to 'sa' if its password has been found
# Creation of a custom xp_cmdshell if the original one has been disabled
# Upload of netcat.exe (or any other executable) using only 100% ASCII
GET/POST requests, so no need for FTP connections
# TCP/UDP portscan from the target SQL Server to the attacking machine,
in order to find a port that is allowed by the firewall of the target
network and use it for a reverse shell
# Direct and reverse bindshell, both TCP and UDP
# DNS-tunneled pseudo-shell, when no TCP/UDP ports are available for a
direct/reverse shell, but the DB server can resolve external hostnames

Happy hacking !
