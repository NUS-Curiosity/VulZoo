it appears hackers are exploiting high traffic social media sites
right now by submitting sql query links as news stories pointing
towards websites such as rhe RIAA.

reports are already blaming digg and reddit for this act of crime, and
i've noticed in the "upcoming" sections the malicious links.

we should contact digg and reddit to get these links pulled, and to
get digg and reddit's system to automatically identify these kind of
links from getting past the submission stage.

i want action taken about this issue of social media sites doing this
to websites... this case is very serious and should be highlighted, we
can't continue to allow sites like reddit and digg to do
"legitimate" ddos and other exploitation attacks.

the users have been posting links in the main anti riaa thread today
thats currently on the frontpage and there are loads of other
malicious links in the upcoming section.

contact digg, and reddit and demand these links are removed from the
main thread, and from the submitted links in the upcoming sections.

someone like sans should be making sure this kind of thing is
criminalized, and to get the message out to the security news
wires to stop this crap and make sure people know this is socially
unexceptable and illegal.

im serious, this has been happening too many times on social media
sites, but this si the most serious case so far.

i'm asking for the security industry to clamp down on social media
sites like digg and reddit and call for the owners to take rapid
response to individuals and thread, links appearing on your site that
are calling for social media site users to visit a link to exploit
servers, and bring down websites and change site content.

i want this kind of act finally made illegal and i want legal action
taken if social media sites are not doing enough to remove threads,
and upcoming links, that call for "legitmate attacks" of high profile
websites such as the RIAA.

i want publicity from the normal media sites to bring attention to
this increasingly growing threat where malicious users area attacking
sites for political purposes through reddit and Digg.

I want the RIAA thread removed and I want all the malicious sql query
and other links removed, i want the users posting the links banned
from the site, and i want rapid response proactive measures taken by
social media sites in the future to remove threads and users
supporting website exploitation, by encouraging social media users to
visit a site via carefully crafted web link.

this issue cannot be shrugged off anymore, something has to be done
and done right now by the site owners, the security industry and law
enforcement agencies to get tighter controls of what can be left up on
social media sites, even if a story is "popular" on the frontpage of
these sites doesn't mean there is nothing wrong with leaving it there.

this isn't the end of this matter, i'm e-mailing various people as i
type this to bring attention to this case where the RIAA site was
taken over because of digg and reddit's lack of caring or response
that it was there users who are doing illegal acts for a poltical
agenda, and everyone laughing thinking its funny and just thinking
there is nothing illegal going on.

just because your a social media site and people have voted for an
article and made it popular doesn't mean its all right. expect this
issue to addressed by the security industry very shortly via news
articles,blogs and on mailing lists.
