Subject: Re: Javascript

Hello,

fyi: I found the sitecatalyst software running on paypal.com to be
vulnerable to xss in the past. (unfiltered referer url was used as a
javascript value). Omniture/paypal didn't respond to my emails, paypal
fixed the issue after public disclosure.

Regards,
Thomas Pollet
