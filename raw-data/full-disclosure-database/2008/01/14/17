Subject: Macrovision FlexNet Connect DownloadManager
	Insecure Methods

Who:
Macrovision

What:
Macrovision FlexNext Connect is a software package that allows 
ISV's to update their software products. It is generally used in 
conjunction with the InstallShield software deploymnet framework.

FlexNet uses a number of ActiveX controls, some of which are marked 
safe for scripting, in this case, the DownloadManager object:

ISDM.exe version 6.1.100.61372
MVSNClientDownloadManager61Lib.DownloadManager
{FCED4482-7CCB-4E6F-86C9-DCB22B52843C}
 IObjectSafety:
 IO. Safe for scripting (IDispatch)

How:
This control contains several methods which can be used to silently 
download arbitrary files to the system and possibly overwrite files

Workaround:
Set the killbit for this control and the Basket control(see Notes), 
see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797

Fix:
None

isusweb.dll can be used in a similar manner to download and execute

does so visibly.

I understand that some of this functionality is by design, however, 
there should be some validation in place to verify that the files 
that are being downloaded are indeed from a trusted source and are

updates to packages that are actually installed on the system.
