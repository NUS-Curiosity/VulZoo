-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Express.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw resides in the TSM Express Backup Server service,
dsmsvc.exe, which listens by default on TCP port 1500. The process
trusts a user-supplied length value. By supplying a large number, an
attacker can overflow a static heap buffer leading to arbitrary code
execution in the context of the SYSTEM user.
