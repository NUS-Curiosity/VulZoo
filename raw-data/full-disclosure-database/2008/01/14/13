te file you sent here contains a bunch of embeded nulls (every other 
character is 00). stripping those out reveals ...

that it's a collection of browser exploits. by the looks of it it's MPack 
and uses the heapspray slide stuff.

the goal is to download hxxp://techicorner.com/bcuoixqf (which looks dead) 
as a local file c:\\mosvs8.exe and then run it.


very common exploit scenario these days (but they usually have some form 
of js obfuscation going on).

i hope this helps.
