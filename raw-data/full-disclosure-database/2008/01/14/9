Omniture is one of (many) sites that do tracking for companies .. like 
what your mouse moves over, how long it stays there, how long you view 
each page, etc. etc.

This is why you should disable javascript for any site you don't 
explicitly trust (FYI: by default, NoScript for Firefox allows *msn.com 
*google.com, and a bunch of other stuff you probably don't want).
