For a comp.sec.guru, you apparently didn't learn to look at e-mail headers,
where you would find the following in *every single posting to the list*:

List-post: <mailto:full-disclosure@...ts.grok.org.uk>
List-subscribe: <https://lists.grok.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/full-disclosure>, 	<mailto:full-disclosure-request@...ts.grok.org.uk?subject=subscribe>
List-unsubscribe: <https://lists.grok.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/full-disclosure>, 	<mailto:full-disclosure-request@...ts.grok.org.uk?subject=unsubscribe>
List-archive: <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure>
List-help: <mailto:full-disclosure-request@...ts.grok.org.uk?subject=help>
List-id: An unmoderated mailing list for the discussion of security issues 	<full-disclosure.lists.grok.org.uk>

RFC2919 List-Id: A Structured Field and Namespace for the Identification
     of Mailing Lists. R. Chandhok, G. Wenger. March 2001. (Format:
     TXT=18480 bytes) (Status: PROPOSED STANDARD)

If the software you use to read e-mail doesn't support it, complain to your
vendor.  It's not rocket science.

Plus, you should have seen the instructions in the mail you should have gotten
when you subscribed, or in the monthly reminder that Mailman sends you.

(Posted to the list because there's probably *other* people subscribed who have
enough kloo to subscribe but not enough to escape....)
