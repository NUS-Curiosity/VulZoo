I did not look at the malware, but it is pretty obvious you have been 
compromised.

Defacements today (unless for specific reason of being "seen") are about 
leaving the site the same way you find it, and infecteing its user 
base/visitors.

A second option is that you are secure but a "partner" such as ad sites 
has been compromised and infects your users.

Naturally, a compromise can come from anywhere, but in most cases it is 
something like RFI... Taosecurity linked to three great papers on the 
subject of web botnets / cross-platform web malware:
