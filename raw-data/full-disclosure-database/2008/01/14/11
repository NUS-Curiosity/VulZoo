Subject: Re: what is this?

Apologies I should clarify.

In this attack legitimate pages on a site are first populated with
html tags embedding Javascript like so

<script language='JavaScript' type='text/javascript' src='{random
name}.js'></script>

these all point to the page you sent on. All the Mp3, quicktime, etc
stuff are expoits that are launched against the browser of the victim
who browses to the site.

The full descriptions of the various exploits are linked off
