Subject: Re: Macrovision FlexNet Connect DownloadManager
	Insecure Methods

Forget downloading files to the startup directory, it looks like 
Macrovision still hasn't fixed the DownloadAndExecute() method of 
isusweb.dll. I believe that this issue is similar to this one: 
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26280(maybe someone from iDefense 
could confirm that?), just that this is a different classid and a 
newer version of isusweb(different framework too?).

isusweb.dll version 6.1.100.61372,Macrovision FLEXnet Connect Web 
Agent
Digitally signed March 29th, 2007

Exploit code is(will be) on Milw0rm, exploiting this is pretty self 
explanatory though...
