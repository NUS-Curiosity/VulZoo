Subject: Re: what is this?

nick,
ur not getting my point,the url is techicorner.com/{random string
here},i have already mentioned it in previous posts.
i have read the link sent by denis,and i would have to conclude that:
1)The problem does not occurs always,instead it occurs randomly based
on IP or something like tht.
2)if u look at the pages on techicorner.com u will not find any
malicious code,so its possible that the server is compromised and its
an LKM
please refer to these links:

Thanks again everyone for your valuable suggestion,i posted here to
share this stuff with everyone and may be u can learn from it.

regards,
_CF
