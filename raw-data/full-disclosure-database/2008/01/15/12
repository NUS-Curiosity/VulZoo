Subject: MS07-069 DHTML Objects Memory Corruption - has
 anybody seen it in the wild?

Microsoft security bulletin says: "When the security bulletin was
released, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was
being exploited." However I haven't found any references to an exploit
in the wild. Checked a few anti-virus databases, but nothing there either.

Has anybody seen it in the wild? When did it appear?
