Subject: Another free MacWorld Platinum Pass? Did they not
	learn anything?

The MacWorld keynote is over. Steve Jobs has amazed his fans with the
new MacBook Air, a wireless NAS for Time Capsule, and some piddly
software updates for those iPhone/iTouch users. People stand in long lines
just to be there when these things are announced! Others pay big money
($1,895). For those of you who paid for priority seating (and the rest
of the conference), how would you feel if the person next to you didn't
pay a dime?

Last year I disclosed a method of obtaining a free Platinum Pass. I
told the vendor, things were changed, lessons were learned. Right? Errr,
not really. This year the same mistake was made but in a slightly different 
way.
