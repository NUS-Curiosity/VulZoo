Note that the mentioned exploit may not show up in an anti-virus database
because it's not in anything that the A/V actually checks (think about why
you rarely see browser exploits in an A/V database - what the A/V lists is
the stuff dumped on the end user's box after the exploit gets things started).

I'd look for things like bleeding-edge Snort signatures and the like.
