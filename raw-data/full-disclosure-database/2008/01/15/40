That's great that Norfolk design is charitable, but what does that have
to do with Full Disclosure?  Is there a breach of data or something?
What?

	Norfolk Design has a proven track record for excellence in its
area.  Our clients' testimonials reflect this.

	 

	Working alongside Norfolk Design, we have seen many small and
struggling charities, grow and flourish.  We believe having a
web-presence is very important for any charity to get their message
across and drum-up as much support as possible.  Having a web-presence
means charities have the potential to reach a global audience.

	 

	Norfolk Design understands that charities are often on a very
tight budget and so we continually ensure we provide offer the best
possible value for money - often going that extra mile at no extra cost
to the client.

	Kindest regards

	Ronnie Zahdeh

	Limits are in the mind, not on the web.
