Subject: NorfolkDesign.com proven track of excellence

Norfolk Design has a proven track record for excellence in its area.  Our
clients' testimonials reflect this.

 

Working alongside Norfolk Design, we have seen many small and struggling
charities, grow and flourish.  We believe having a web-presence is very
important for any charity to get their message across and drum-up as much
support as possible.  Having a web-presence means charities have the
potential to reach a global audience.

 

Norfolk Design understands that charities are often on a very tight budget
and so we continually ensure we provide offer the best possible value for
money - often going that extra mile at no extra cost to the client.

Kindest regards

Ronnie Zahdeh
