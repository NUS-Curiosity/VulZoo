Subject: Re: Hacking The Interwebs

So ... pdp is an emotionally immature kid who hacks JS because it's
easy and likes to pretend that he knows something.  So what ...
nothing to see here, folks, move on...

The more complex the system, the more holes people will find ... why
is that such a big revelation for folks?  Why pat yourself on the back
for finding yet another exploit for a system that is impossible to
prove correct, instead of spending your time on writing provably
correct systems?

The emotional, intellectual, and professional immaturity of most
crackers and script kiddies and "security researchers" never ceases to
amaze me.
