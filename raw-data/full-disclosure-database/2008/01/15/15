Umm... Paul?  Hate to tell you this, but Nick replied with a fairly long and
cogent description.  The quoted person "I did not look at the malware"
was actually Gadi.

Doesn't change the fact that Gadi was right - at some point in the description,
the facts add up to 'pwned', and actually looking at the malware only serves
to show *how* you got pwned. ;)
