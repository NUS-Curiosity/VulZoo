===============
1) Introduction
===============

Fredrick Diggle Security Services is probably the best application
security researchers on the scene this month. They have identified
several hundred thousand vulnerabilities this week for which Priv8
0dayz have been developed. Fredrick Diggle Security Team has decided
to release several of these vulnerabilities to the community at large
(Pre Vendor Release!!!!). Fred Diggle would like to ensure that you
understand this is 0DAY!!!. The vendors are completely unaware of this
vulnerabilities.

2) Bugs

OpenSSL 0.9.7j
  openssl-0.9.7j/fips-1.0/aes/fips_aesavs.c 973: User supplied data
copied into fixed length buffer on the stack with no length
verification.

SSH 3.2.9.1
  ssh-3.2.9.1/lib/zlib/contrib/minizip/minizip.c 187: User supplied
data copied into fixed length buffer on the stack with no length
verification.

Apache 1.3.37
  src/regex/split.c 164: User supplied data copied into fixed length
buffer on the stack with no length verification.

Samba 3.0.25b
  samba-3.0.25b/source/popt/poptparse.c 27: Integer overflow in size_t
which is later used in heap allocation. Buffer then copied into this
memory resulting in heap overflow.


Fredrick Diggle would like you to note that this is very small subset
of the 0dayz that Fredrick Diggle Security Team has available. If you
are rich and would like to buy our Exploit codez Fredrick Diggle would
very much like to hear from you.
