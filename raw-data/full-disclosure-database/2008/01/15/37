Subject: IN RESPONSE TO "Norfolkdesign.com theft and
	deceit"

Norfolk Design wishes to formally state that the 'Norfolk Design
Accessibility Engine', which provides a user-configurable text-only version
of web-page is not a rebranding of the BBC's BETSIE text-only engine.
Furthermore, Norfolk Design's code does not contain any source code from the
BBC BETSIE engine.

 

The 'Norfolk Design Accessibility Engine' was written, and is continually
developed in-house by Norfolk Design.  Unlike BETSIE, the 'Norfolk Design
Accessibility Engine' is written in ASP and runs on our Windows IIS servers.

 

In addition, Norfolk Design would like inform anyone reading the false
claims to the contrary of the above statement, that it has a signed, written
declaration, from the BBC Litigation Department stating, 

 

"...we are happy to confirm that the BBC does not consider the Norfolk
Design Code to infringe the BBC's copyright in the BETSIE source code." 

 

Finally, Norfolk Design realises this is a clear case of defamation of
character and is fully prepared to take further action in a UK court of law
if necessary.

Kindest regards

Ronnie Zahdeh
Managing Director
