Anyone one done any poking around with DNP3, ICCP, OPC, Ethernet/IP, etc.?

OK, some more results are in.

The Digiboard 'Connect ME' module has MAC prefix 00:40:9D and what 
appears to be P/N: (1P) 50000878-03 M. At heart specs say it's an ARM 
NS7520 MCU.

The iBoard is the most configurable device of the bunch so far and the 
web interface is quite substantial. A very cool little box.

Stuff open on 21, 23, 80, 161, 502. sysDescr indicates "Control 
Solutions i.CanDoIt BAS-700 ReMOTE I/O". HTTP is 
Allegro-Software-RomPager/4.01, FTP says NET+OS 6.3.

Same basic tests on hammering 502 gave up nothing. Days pounding this 
thing with crud and it never drops a connection or chokes. Can't wait to 
start poking around inside of the modbus protocol instead of this cheese.

> - ADAM-4572 (http://www.ucs.co.uk/index.php?pid=948)

MAC prefix 00:D0:C9 "Advantech Co.".

Now this is an interesting box. The only thing open on it is 502. It's 
not as robust as the iBoard, as hammering the ADAM-4572 on 502 with crud 
caused it to stop responding within seconds. However, it came back 
online within 10 seconds. It feels like this thing has a watchdog 
built-in so when something throws an exception it reloads itself.

Opening it up, it's built of a great deal more discrete parts than the 
other devices. The main parts are a couple QFPs (ARM MCU 
S3C4510B01-QE80, Cortina Systems ethernet EGLXT970) and a PLCC 
(am29f040b flash). I like the PLCC, that's easy to yank out, drop in a 
programmer (I always liked the Needhams Electronics stuff) and dump.

-----------------------------

Handy utility in the same vein (but this one can perform writes) as the 
modpoll utility mentioned earlier in the thread, is the mbread utility 
contained in the following:

Commercial SCADA security testing platfom/service which looks to be 
setting itself up as some kind of standard:
