Addendum to my ealier post:

Since php and perl and etc etc are all vulnerable, and php files can  
have many file suffixes beside (.php), perhaps the better <Files>  
statement would just allow images and deny everything else:

  <Files ~ "\.(gif|jpe?g|png)$">

or maybe

  <FilesMatch "\.(gif|jpe?g|png)$">

You get the idea.
