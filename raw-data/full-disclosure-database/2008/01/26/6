So tell me, who is this n3td3v group that you speak of? A 
challenger to Anonymous? You should choose your words more wisely 
since you have no knowledge of us, or of anything else for that 
matter. Looking back at your history of posting you are clearly a 
troll and therefor are of no significance to Anonymous.

Enjoy your failure.
