Subject: HP Virtual Rooms WebHPVCInstall Control Multiple
	Buffer Overflows

Who:
Hewlett-Packard

What:
HP Virtual Rooms is a suite of online collaboration, training and 
support tools.

How:
HP uses an ActiveX control to install the Virtual Rooms client. 
Several properties including AuthenticationURL, PortalAPIURL, 
cabroot are vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

hpvirtualrooms14.dll version 1.0.0.100
HP Virtual Rooms Install
{00000014-9593-4264-8B29-930B3E4EDCCD}
Implements IObjectSafety

Workaround:
It appears that this control is only used during the installation 
process on the Virtual Rooms client. Set the killbit for this 
control, see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797.

Fix:
None
