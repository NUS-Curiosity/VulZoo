Very nice, and no, I will not resort to German. I think the point was made
in my original post.
How silly of me to overlook such common and simple (yes, albeit old)
technologies.

For those of you out there that are a bit lost and want to follow along at
home:
Make a simple file called uu.txt, enter the following into it:

begin 644 temp.txt
> C+BXN9&\@=V4@...E;B!N965D('1O(&=O('1O($=E<FUA;C\
> `
> end
>

and then run that through uudecode (You can google for that one!) and open
the resulting temp.txt
