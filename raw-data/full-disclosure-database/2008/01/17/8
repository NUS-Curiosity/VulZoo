Subject: Gadi Bashing, enough already....

	I have been friends with Gadi through email for many years now and
he needs to have someone represent for him. He is a good guy, signs his own
email instead of the hushmail or Gmail mask.
	 On top of all that he is also a knowledgeable and friendly guy. He
does a great job exploring and reporting the areas of interest to him and
has helped many people remove bot-net problems from their own nets. Give the
guy a break, he is a good dude.
	P.S. Punks do not know what federal agencies read these dumb ass
lists but should be aware that email threats can be taken very far in courts
these days. Ask old Kevin!
