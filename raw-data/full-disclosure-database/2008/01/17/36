@Richard,

Sorry for top posting, but I'm tired and lazy right now.

Just think of it like this.  Consider the source...let the kiddiez
play.  If they want to talk smack about someone that we know is good
at what they do, let them.  Again, consider the source.

I haven't personally seen the posts of Gadi bashing, but he strikes me
as being a great guy and definately seems to know his stuff.  I'll
have to go through and do a little looking later to read the bashing
posts.  I could use a good laugh...  ;p

They are only showing their own ignorance.  ***cough - Ethereal - cough***
