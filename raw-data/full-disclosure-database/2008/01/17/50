I'm not worried about being unemployed - there's literally a quarter acre of
raised-floor server room across the hallway, and plenty to keep our crew of
sysadmins busy for years to come.  If I end up spending less time doing
security, that just means I'll have more time to work on other things like
performance monitoring and tuning, backups (when you have enough disk that your
*incremental* backups run to several terabytes a night, it's decidedly
non-trivial), network storage, and other fun stuff...
