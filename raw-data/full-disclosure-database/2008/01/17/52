One of my co-workers has a rubber stamp that says "I told you about this in 19__",
which is still seeing use.

Quite frankly, many of us in the security industry get *tired* of always
talking about the "same blah blah shit".  It's why I stopped contributing
to the SANS/FBI Top 20 list every year - industry-wide, the *same exact
problems* were still the biggest issues.  But it's very much the lose-lose
proposition - if we keep talking about the *same* issues, we're flamed about
it, and when we try to raise awareness of an actual *new* issue, we're accused
of grandstanding.

Also, you have to remember that in many cases, we need to get the attention
of Corporate Suits - and unless it gets said forty-leven times, they don't
notice.
