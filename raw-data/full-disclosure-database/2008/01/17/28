Hi Frank,

If it's to protect against computer loss or theft, FDE offers zero protection when the theif boots the computer.  The disk is unencrypted as far as the filesystem drivers are concerned.  Some vendors offer a pre-boot password, then the protection is as strong as the password.  FDE is of value if you throw a disk away and it also prevents CD bootable password clearing tools from editing the SAM.

Volume or container encryption will protect data, and is also useful to hide tools from an AV file scan.  Cryptainer is one example, available in both free and commercial versions.  Volume encryption won't encrypt temp directories, there are many temp directory locations depending on from what source you opened a file (email, browser, filesystem, word, etc).  Volume encryption products like Credant solve this problem by encrypting temp files.

Can any one recommend such system ?
 
What are the Pros and Cons and from which vendor(s) do you know that they already integrated it with which security model ?
