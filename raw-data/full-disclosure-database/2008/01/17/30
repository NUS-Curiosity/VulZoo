Subject: Re: [FDSA] Notepad Highly Critical
	Cross-Site	Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

Thats a really funny security risk. I dont agree with you, because
otherwise every editor, which is able to save HTML Files, is a security
problem. So vi, Dreamweaver, emacs are all unsecure? It is your decision,
to open a HTML file or not. And (if here are some MS guys) please dont fix
this issue, because sometimes, if you havent a professional tool at the
moment, the Windows editor can be useful, too.  Also, if you need to edit
some small Scripts.

Yours, 
SR

===============
1) Introduction
===============

Fredrick Diggle Security Services is probably the best application
security researchers on the scene this month. They have identified
several hundred thousand vulnerabilities this week for which Priv8
0dayz have been developed. Fredrick Diggle Security Team periodically
releases several of these vulnerabilities to the community at large
(Pre Vendor Release!!!!). Fred Diggle would like to ensure that you
understand this is 0DAY!!!. The vendors are completely unaware of this
vulnerabilities.

=======
2) Bug
=======

Notepad is a utility which is built into all current versions of
Microsoft Windows. Notepad contains a highly exploitable stored
cross-site scripting vulnerability when files are saved with the
following extensions:

htm
html

Other extensions may also be vulnerable in your environment depending
on configuration. When arbitrary javascript code is entered into the
notepad text window and saved using one of the vulnerable extensions a
payload file is created. When an innocent user opens this payload file
cross-site scripting occurs.

#######################################################################

=======
3) Proof of Concept
=======

1. Open Notepad
2. Enter the following text
<script>alert("xss");</script>
3. Save file as "exploit.html"
4. double click the payload file

#######################################################################

======
4) Fix
======

Notepad should be rewritten to filter potentially dangerous
characters. Characters can be converted to their html encoded
equivalents.
