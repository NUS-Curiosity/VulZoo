Subject: Corporations and Institutes to target for attack
	& exploitation

I have been doing some thinking, and it seems to me upon surveying the
'scene' (excluding the profiteering criminal element) that too many
people resemble anti-globalization protesters. I do not mean that in a
positive way; I'm talking about the fools who smash the windows of small
businesses in the course of protesting large multinational corporations.

There does seems to be a sense of rage, certainly disappointment, in a
number of people regarding their ability to effect change... but it's
poorly articulated. Someone elsewhere the other day reflected back on
the LA Riots, expressing disappointment that the rioters violated their
own neighbourhoods instead of tearing up mansions in Beverley Hills. An
apt metaphor.

While there isn't enough aggression directed at pop culture noise sites
like myspace, youtube, or facebook and others, we risk getting
distracted by focusing on that sort instead of laying a beating on
entities that deserve a stronger brand of justice. I'm not sure how to
strike a balance in that regard anymore.

Might I suggest, or even plead, that you bend your talents towards
giving these folks the hardest time possible? Penetrate their networks
and those of their partners and make secrets known, their employees
uncomfortable - you lie down with dogs, you get fleas - and make the
price of doing dirty business as high as possible.

Expect complications due to use of fronts, renamings, holding companies,
etc.

Names come from a mix of sites and are ranked in no particular order of
importance. I'd lay the boots to Monsanto and the Church Of Scientology
first, but à chacun son goût.
