Subject: Secreview re-review of quietmove ( F ---)

Andre is a friend but not an employee or representative of the  
business- HOWEVER - There were a number of innacuracies in his  
statements about me. A selection of corrections to statements are below.

- I never ran UPT
- all the speculation about our methodology and pricing was wrong.
- the quantity ofautomated vs hands on testing we perform are based on  
what the customer is willing to pay for. Novel concept. We explain  
carefully what can and can't be found. The customer select their  
apporpriate level of risk acceptce based on the value of the target of  
evaluation and their budget. We always try to go above and beyond.
- our overhead is low-no giant headquarters - we are virtual mostly  
except for a rack cage. We don't have to support a giant marketing  
team and don't do $20k trade show booths. As a result that isn't built  
into our pricing.
- I was never a 'uNIX admin' but did engineer one of the early  
commercially avail Beowulf clusters - in 1998 - and have run some unix  
boxes, meaning it took all of 3 hours a month of my time, but i was  
not a 'unix admin' by any stretch of the imagination. The opennsd  
posts were from what,10 years ago?
More evidence of your poor arithmetic skills from the initial post.
- the website wasn't updated because I am taking a vacation to NYC and  
would rather enjoy myself than meet some 12 hour unmentioned timetable  
to edit the website by an anonymous coward pfy.
- they weren't insults, they were sarcastic though accurate  
representations of you'd subpar ( at best) review capabilities
- others but really, who cares? You are not interested in facts as I  
will prove below.

Your analysis is worthless. Several weeks ago you posted your alleged  
methodology. It included contacting the vendor PRIOR to review, which  
you didnt do. You also didnt notify us of the review. I read it on fd  
myself.

You sent a list of questions on new years day, after you posted the  
review, and half a day later posted your re review without again  
contacting me directly except with a monster list of questions - not  
so much as a phone call. You alleged review was based on list noise,  
not speaking with me.

You still have yet to post your scoring methodology as promised. You  
fail.

Frankly I find the drama and anonymous weenie-waving on this list to  
be tedious. FD is more a running joke than a productive mailing list.  
Save the drama fo yo mama.

On my timetable I'll respond to your questions.... To the list, not to  
you directly. Frankly I don't trust you to represent them accurately.  
Right now I'm going to visit the metropolitan museum of art, and  
tonight go party - not answer your essay test. Sorry to dissapoint.

As a number of list members commented privately to me - you don't  
deserve the attention.

That said, if you can prove you will follow your own previously stated  
methodology, I'll re review your review system. Following your  
methodology I will post a f----------- score in 6-12 hours or maybe  
sooner if you don't respond.

That's a joke, son. ;)

Sorry for typos - sent from my 31337 jailbroken iPhone. It runs unix.  
I guess that makes me a unix admin!
