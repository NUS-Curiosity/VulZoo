Subject: Re: Secreview re-review of quietmove ( F ---)

Just to be clear the corrections to secreview reepex and Andre were  
intermingled.

The ones I mentioned were the ones secreview and reepex, the anonymous  
cowards too embarrassed by their own ignorant commentary to stand  
behind them, called out.

Dre thx for pointing out the ha.ckers.org posts. More evidence of  
secreview selective quotation and/or ability to 'research'

He can't even spell the name of the company he reviews correctly.
