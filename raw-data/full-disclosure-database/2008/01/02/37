Subject: Re: Critical Vulnerability in 

So you included me in here because my name has something to do with farm
equipment? Did your message have a point?

You wrote a bunch of nonsense flattering your favorite security stars and
then attempted to flame us with one liners that did not make sense.. It
seems you are caught in between the serious posters ( since you have no
skill, you cannot post anything useful), and the trolls ( because you are
not funny or convincing ).

My version of full disclosure is calling out idiots with Cissps and Phds who
post here and think their XSS and earth shattering barragess of 0x41's makes
them security experts.
