Hi Adam, 
   
We've said this before and will say this again, this time to 
everyone. 

We would be more than happy to give your company (QuietMove) a 
"better" review if you'd enable us to do that. So far you haven't 
helped us to effectively review you at all. We tried to call you 
before our initial review, but never got hold of anyone. We also 
sent you an email before writing our second review, and you never 
responded to any of the questions in that email. If you'd like us 
to do a better review then provide us with the information that you 
think we will need to get the job done. 

Our current review is the product of your website, emails that 
you've posted to this and other forums, and your reaction to our 
first review. We haven't been able to find anything related to 
major accomplishments by you or by QuietMove, we haven't seen any 
sample reports, and we haven't received any answers to any 
questions about your methodologies for service execution and 
delivery. We even think that our current review might be too harsh, 
but can't change anything without more information. 

If you want us to change our review, we can do that again and we 
can do it in a non-biased way (regardless of all the rants and 
noise). We need you to tell us about your service delivery 
methodologies, your reporting methodologies, how you define 
specific service offerings, what markets you play in, and if 
possible sanitized sample reports. We won't publish any of that 
information directly, but we would use that to produce your next 
review. 

We want our reviews to accurately and truthfully reflect the 
quality and professionalism of the providers that we study. (In 
fact, if anyone has any suggestions as to how we could better 
"rank" security companies we'd be more than happy to listen and 
consider those suggestions.) 

Hope this helps. This will be our last email about QuietMove unless 
you request a redo of the current review. We will only redo the 
review if you are able to provide us with accurate information to 
help us get it done. We think that you should do it, because we 
think that you can score much better than an F+. (You're clearly 
not an idiot and you do have at least some experience.)

-the end.
