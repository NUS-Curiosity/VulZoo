Readers (and haters)

Just so we're clear, we've offered QuietMove a second shot at being 
reviewed. As a result we're going to remove our existing review and 
release a new review in short time. As usual, we'll do our best to 
make sure that the reviews are truthful and honest. To date, 
QuietMove has not provided us with any information that contradicts 
anything that we've written in our origional post. We're still 
waiting for answers back from them.
