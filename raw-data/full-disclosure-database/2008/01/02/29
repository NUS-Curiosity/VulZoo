Actually, I was merely pointing out to a reader of the list that if you *can*
get x'41414141' into the appropriate register, you can probably abuse it into a
full exploit, and gave an example of an off-by-one-byte that produced such an
exploit.  Maybe in that reader's world, they can get away with asking "how is
that exploitable?", but some of us have to classify that as "should be
considered exploitable until proved otherwise".

Failure to learn from the lessons of the past is a good way to shoot yourself
in the foot exactly the same way.  Yes - WANK was back in 1989.  However, even
now, almost 2 decades later, we're *still* seeing a lot of systems getting
exploited for the *exact same* base cause.

Additionally, it's proof that anybody who is just *now* waking up to the
concept of "cyber-warfare" is 20 years behind:

It's also a good idea to keep in mind that not everybody in the security
industry measures "productivity" by "number of exploits published".  For some
of us who run production networkds, "no incidents happened, and none of the
users noticed a damned thing we did to ensure it" is the rarely attained
Nirvana.
