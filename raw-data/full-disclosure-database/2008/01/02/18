OpenVMS is less than 40% Blissful... though I'm not familiar with the original source (wasn't it written on stone tablets?). About 50% is C, with a healthy mix of obsoletes making the difference. How something so elegant could be spawned from such chaos is beyond me.

Mostly, the VMS basic OS utilities are Bliss-based (think: GNU). 

I really wish HP would open OpenVMS before they kill it.

Security relevance: UNHACKABLE! <grin>
