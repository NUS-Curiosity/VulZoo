Anonymous reviews by people who have not used the services of the company
they are reviewing aren't worth the virtual paper they are written on. (even
the name on the site indicates the goal of companies 'exposed' not
'reviewed'.) I am no security expert and would depend on using an external
company for certain security services.  All I have gained from this
discussion is to completely ignore secreview content in making any
determination of companies to call upon for things like penetration testing.

 

I don't know you from . well. Adam.  Your concern is probably that actual
potential clients may read such content and not realize it is drivel. How
about a blog post or something commenting that 'don't be fooled by company
reviews by people who have never tried our services.'? Just curious.

It was a reply to the larry suto review of web app scanners rsnake posted. I
commented on his blog post. The review was totally worthless.

Dre thx for pointing out the ha.ckers.org posts. More evidence of secreview
selective quotation and/or ability to 'research'
