And for those who couldn't figure it out, the "green card" is an IBM S/360
Reference Card, the "Yellow Card" is the S/370 refcard (actually a 24-page
booklet), and the "Salmon Card" is the XA refcard from the 3090 and S/390.

The "dead giveaway" is that 7E is the EBCDIC codepoint for the '=' sign.
And if you *still* can't figure it out after that, I have to quote HHGTTG:

"And for the rest of you, the secret is to keep banging the rocks together..."
