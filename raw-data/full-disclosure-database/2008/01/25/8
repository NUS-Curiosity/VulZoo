OMG, CHAN Enterprises, what an utter cockmuncher.

I guess Bart really pissed you off then, what did he do, troll one
of your oh-so-interesting posts or just dump your sister after she
gobbled him in the back seat?

I'm with PI on this one, the trouble with full disclosure is
numpties feel the need (and the right) to fully disclose their
every fevered imagining. Lord save us from acne-ridden teenagers
with no better way to make a point than polluting the net with this
tosh.
