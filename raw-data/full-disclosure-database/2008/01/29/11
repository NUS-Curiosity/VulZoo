Especially since Ubuntu didn't exist five years ago. ;)

On a more serious note, it was almost five years ago to the day that I finally 
figured out how to get my home server to run Samba on Linux and have the 
other Windows machines talk to it. Indeed, the Windows clients noticed no 
difference in the network they were connected to. 

The server had been a dual boot system, and ran Windows 2000 Pro while the 
kids did their homework. I had switched my own computer to Linux the previous 
fall. Now the server switched full time to Linux, and the process of 
converting the kids' machines began.

The one constant from then to now is the use of "Windows" networking. :)
