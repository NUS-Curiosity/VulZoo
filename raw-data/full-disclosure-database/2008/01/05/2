Subject: Re: Was secreview crap - now OpenVMS!!

Once a so-called security expert was pen-testing my VMS shop. We were 
having a nice chat while his eval version of GFI LANguard finished the 
scan, and got to talk about VMS. He didn't believe in the robust 
security of VMS and told me to do a search for vms on bugtraq, and see 
how many results came up.
So I did, and was horrified when I saw thousands of results... Until I 
noticed that the matched string in all the (barring perhaps 1 in 10000) 
results was "VMs"; not "VMS" or "vms".

(This was some years ago. The bugtraq search function's improved now.)
