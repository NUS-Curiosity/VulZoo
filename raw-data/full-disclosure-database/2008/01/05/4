How clever are you---master of disguise.

I didn't know the gmail addresses that are garbbled and don't make up
anyones real name or organisation are the feds.

I expected them all to be on their official addresses for their
government departments if they signed up, how naive of me to think
that I thought we were fed free on n3td3v group.

I should assume in future that one random garbbled gmail address can
feed a whole security operations center of staff, so 4000+ gmail
addresses can feed a whole universe of world governments and
organisations.

Thanks for the tip off.

Valdis can you confirm this...
