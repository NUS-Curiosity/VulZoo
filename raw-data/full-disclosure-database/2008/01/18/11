"This is the Jewish mentality. These are a criminal people. They 
torture their prisoners in the worst way. It's even illegal! They 
don't even deny it hardly. Jews were always bastards throughout 
history. They are liars, they are the worst pieces of shit in the 
world. They mutilate their own children." - Bobby Fischer
