So the following proof of concept causes the Windows Calculator to be executed?

C:\>calc

Fredrick Diggle apologizes, he always forgets that exploitation is IMPOSSIBLE if there is no how-to in phrack. Racing your own buffer is hard Lombard so he feels your pain :(

Also how dare you accuse Diggle Sec of releasing fake vulnerabilities.
Continue down that train of thought and you are likely to find yourself in a lawsuit sir.

Also we noted your comment about pipes and performed further analysis.
What we discovered was shocking! You are indeed correct that the published proof of concept inadvertently exploits a previously unpublished vulnerability it the windows command line utility. This vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution and is really quite severe. We will be happy to credit you with its discovery.
