This is actually confirmed on Windows 2000 and XP.

There I don't agree however, it is a simple memory reading
vulnerability.

That's not very surprising since you pipe into the calculator so it is
spawned by the shell.

There I don't agree. In theory, there should not be anything important
in the memory of the sort process which is not already known to the
user executing it anyway. It is clearly a bug though, and wants to be
fixed. So congratulations to a working, though overdramatizised,
discovered format string vulnerability.
