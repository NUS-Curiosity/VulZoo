Stop the madness!

I'm going to conduct an expirament... I'm going to send an email to the list
with several stupid comments, three comments that have nothing to do with
what FD was created for, and several points as to why Cross-Site Scripting
is the most dangerous security vulnerability ever and see how many responses
I can get.  Then I'm going to respond to each of them with every email in
the chain, but I won't stop there, I will repeat my original statement with
slightly different linguistic differences, thereby getting myself to the top
of a search engine list.

See Ronnie, you jacked it all up, you should have talked about Cross-Site
Scripting and made several terribly stupid points in addition to your
completely irelevant email, then you would've owned all the search engines.

Seriously, is there a moderator/administrator for this list?  If so, is your
name John like Ronnie says?  If so, hello John, can we get some
moderation/administration please?  Every once in a blue moon there's an
email I get from Full Disclosure that keeps me on the list... could we at
least try to cut down on the crap in between?

Thanks!
