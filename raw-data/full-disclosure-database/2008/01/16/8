I (loosely) understand your grievance.

I disagree with your choice of methods to "correct" it.

Sending the same message to this list at least three times, and now 
largely repeating that message but not in the pseudo-legalistic mumbo-
jumbo some cheap lawyer scribbled on the back of an envelope in the bar 
the night before last does not help make you look like a victim.

Pairing it with a totally nonsensical pseudo-legalistic "disclaimer", 
probably programmatically attached to all Email sent out from your 
company Email server beyond your control, just make you look even 
sillier.

_That_ is what I was pointing out.  I don't give a rat's arse about 
your perceived slandering or even the (initial) steps you've taken to 
"correct" it (as, it seems, you see this farce).  I start to care when 
you needlessly repeat yourself _especially_ when you couple all that 
with your nonsensical, legally meaningless and uneforceable, 
"disclaimers"

Rather than wasting your and our time trying to further justify your 
increasing nonsense, go spend a few quid on a _competent_ IT lawyer and 
ask him why folk are making fun of your Email "disclaimers"...

(I suspect you'll have trouble deciding if any given lawyer you choose 
to consult about this is "competent" to provide such advice, but as a 
rough rule of thumb, if they don't suggest drastic changes to 
(generally, blanket removal of) your current "disclaimer", their 
opinion is not worth paying for.)


Regards,

Nick FitzGerald
