Dear Paul,
sorry for the delay in answering to your e-mail but Hermione and I
were attending an important class here at Hogwarts. Anyway, now I’m
completely at your disposal.

I wanna believe in your words and I had an idea, I shall trust you.
You and your friend Gadi have one day to prove what you are
asserting (yes, you can help him, if you want).
Write a 60-words technical analysis about this malware and send it
to the list.  In case you can also use the technical comments
already spreaded to the list or in teh internet (well, excepted the
one from our great ph.d. at monkey.org or 3APA3A will own him
again, kthx).

Show that you aren’t just drones, who spend the days downloading e-
mails and posting shit everywhere, to everyone’s boredom.

This is your chance, the last one.

Regards,
Harry Potter
