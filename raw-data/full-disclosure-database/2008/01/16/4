Yeah, we kinda guessed...

No sh*t superman?

You'd be stupid enough to address something so potentially important 
(you think) to unintended recipients?

Ohhh, but wait -- you sent it to a large, subscriber-list-withheld, 
public mailing list, so you clearly can have NO IDEA who the actual 
recipients will be....

> ...  The content is confidential and

Hmmmm -- now doesn't that raise some serious problems for you?

You deliberately sent your message to a mailing list that you know you 
cannot know all the recipients of, _yet_ your message contains 
"confidential and privileged" information?

You and/or your legal advisers are clearly stark raving bonkers.

Or maybe that's the point?  You're trying to establish insanity as a 
defence for whatever you may be, or have been, charged with/accused of?

> ...  If you are not the intended recipient ...

In one sense, of course I am (one of the) intended recipient(s) as I 
subscribe to the mailing list you addressed the message to.

And, if you didn't intend to address your message to this list but did 
so anyway (out of incompetence, say?) how am _I_ supposed to be able to 
tell that I am NOT an intended recipient?  Am I, along with every other 
list member address owner/user supposed to have intimate knowledge of 
_your_ intentions?  Pray tell us how...

Darn -- I've got copies on my machine, there are partial copies of 
trace headers all over the Internet, there are multitudinous archives 
of the mailing list you chose to address this message to, there will 
still be many copies "in process" waiting for mail relays, servers, 
content scanners, etc, etc to "catch up" and so on.

This request is thus nonsensical...

As already described, how would I possibly know?  (Yes, there are some 
circumstances where that could be more or less certain, but this 
clearly is NOT such a case.)

It may or may not be in error, but regardless of what you now say, I'll 
NOT delete it even if you do claim you sent it in error.  What will you 
do about that?  This pompous piece of less-than-pseudo-legalistic BS 
neither intimidates me nor impresses me -- it's meaningless piffle 
created by a moron with no understanding of WTF s/he was doing.

No sh*t superman?

It's a pity you don't also scan all Email sent from Norfolk Design for 
meaninglessly bombastic, pseudo-quasi-legalistic nonsense, but never 
fear -- some of us apply our own scanners for such content...
