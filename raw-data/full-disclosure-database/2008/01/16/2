Hi Thomas,

 

We have been full permission and support of the list administrator John to
do this. We would never try to spam, all we are trying to do is rectify the
malicious spammer that has plastered false accusations about our company and
has caused us many hours of lost time.

 

I hope people understand our position and many thanks for your support.

 

This is not an ideal situation, but it's the best we have been advised to
do.

 

Many thanks for your understanding.

Kindest regards

Ronnie Zahdeh
Managing Director

That's great that Norfolk design is charitable, but what does that have to
do with Full Disclosure?  Is there a breach of data or something?  What?

Norfolk Design has a proven track record for excellence in its area.  Our
clients' testimonials reflect this.

 

Working alongside Norfolk Design, we have seen many small and struggling
charities, grow and flourish.  We believe having a web-presence is very
important for any charity to get their message across and drum-up as much
support as possible.  Having a web-presence means charities have the
potential to reach a global audience.

 

Norfolk Design understands that charities are often on a very tight budget
and so we continually ensure we provide offer the best possible value for
money - often going that extra mile at no extra cost to the client.

Kindest regards
