Cisco Security Advisory: Default Passwords in the Application Velocity
System

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20080123-avs

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080123-avs.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2008 January 23 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Versions of the Cisco Application Velocity System (AVS) prior to
software version AVS 5.1.0 do not prompt users to modify system account
passwords during the initial configuration process. Because there is no
requirement to change these credentials during the initial configuration
process, an attacker may be able to leverage the accounts that have
default credentials, some of which have root privileges, to take full
administrative control of the AVS system.

After upgrading to software version AVS 5.1.0, users will be prompted to
modify these credentials.

Cisco will make free upgrade software available to address this
vulnerability for affected customers. The software upgrade will
be applicable only for the AVS 3120, 3180, and 3180A systems. The
workaround identified in this document describes how to change the
passwords in current releases of software for the AVS 3110.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2008-0029 has
been assigned to this vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080123-avs.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

This vulnerability affects the Cisco AVS 3110, 3120, 3180, and 3180A
Management Station appliances that are running software versions prior
to AVS 5.1.0. Administrators can determine the software version of the
AVS appliances by logging in to the Management Station web-based user
interface or from the command-line interface (CLI) of the appliance
operating system.

Customers who use the AVS 3180 or 3180A Management Station can determine
their node software versions by navigating to the Cluster Information
Page. Each registered node will display the corresponding software
version when the node is selected.

The AVS appliance version can also be determined from the host operating
system by using the "Show Version" command.

The following example shows "Show Version" output for an AVS 3120
appliance that is running version 5.1.0:

    velocity>Show Version

    ****************************************
    Cisco Application Velocity System,(AVS)
    ----------------------------------------
    AVS 3120-K9 005.001(000.034)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco AVS 3110 and 3120 are enterprise data center appliances for
improving web application performance, measuring end-user response
time, and managing application security. The Cisco AVS 3120 enforces
application security with an integrated web application firewall. The
Cisco AVS 3180 and 3180A Management Stations provide web-based tools for
the configuration and application performance monitoring for a cluster
of AVS 3110s and 3120s or individual nodes.

The Cisco AVS 3110, 3120, 3180, and 3180A Management Stations use some
system accounts that are initially configured with default passwords.
Vulnerable versions of the AVS software do not prompt the administrator
to change the passwords for these accounts, including accounts with root
privileges, during the initial configuration process. Non-vulnerable
versions of AVS software will now prompt administrators to change these
accounts after installation.

Note: If the passwords for the AVS 3110 or 3120 are changed on the
device itself and it has previously been registered with an AVS 3180
or 3180A Management Station, the node must be re-registered with the
Management Station console. Otherwise, communication between the AVS
3180 or 3180A Management Station and AVS 3110 or 3120 node will be lost.

For additional details about the AVS node registration process, refer to
the "Register Node" section of the Cisco AVS User's Guide.

After upgrading the appliance software to version AVS 5.1.0 and logging
in for the first time, the administrator will now be prompted to change
the system account passwords.

The following example shows the new password change prompts and the
subsequent password change dialog for the AVS 3120 after upgrade:

    velocity login: fgn
    Password:
    **WARNING** System wide secrets are in factory default state.
    Would you like to change these now? [y/n] y changing root password
    enter password:
    enter password again:
    changing fgn password
    enter password:
    enter password again:
    changing DB password
    enter password:
    enter password again:

    Please wait...The DB password change will take a few minutes.
    changing node manager password
    enter password:
    enter password again:
    changing condenser password
    enter password:
    enter password again:
    changing console password
    enter password:
    enter password again:

The following example shows the new password change prompts and the
subsequent password change dialog for the AVS 3180 and 3180A after
upgrade:

devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

AVS software version 5.1.0 contains the fix for the vulnerability
described in this document.

AVS software is available for download from the following locations on
cisco.com:

  * AVS 3120 5.1.0 (http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/AVS3120-5.1)
  * AVS 3180 5.1.0 (http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/AVS3180-5.1)

Workarounds
===========

The following workarounds are applicable only for the AVS 3110 and are
performed on the system shell. The AVS 3110 does not have a CLI. The use
of strong passwords is encouraged.

Changing the Root Password
+-------------------------

Complete these steps:

 1. Change the root password by using the following command:

        shell# passwd


 2. Reboot to activate the new settings by using the following command:

        shell# reboot

Changing the Management Console Username and Password
+----------------------------------------------------

Complete these steps:

 1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    $AVS_HOME/console/jboss-3.0.1_tomcat-4.0.4/server/default/deploy/
    fgconsole.war/users.properties

    Use the line admin=admin to set the username and password. The
    username appears before the equal sign (=) and the password appears
    after the equal sign (=). For example, to change the username to
    Cisco and the password to accelerate, change the admin=admin line
    to Cisco=accelerate.

 2. If you change the username, you must also change this file:

    $AVS_HOME/console/jboss-3.0.1_tomcat-4.0.4/server/default/deploy/
    fgconsole.war/roles.properties

    The username is set by the line that contains admin=. The username
    appears before the equal sign (=). For example, to change the user
    name to Cisco, change the admin= line to Cisco=. Do not change the
    text after the equal sign (=) in this file; this field specifies
    the account privileges. The username that you enter here must match
    the one in the users.properties file in the preceding step.

Changing the Database Username and Password
+------------------------------------------

There are two steps required to change the database password:

 1. First change the database password.
 2. Then update the Management Console configuration file with the new
    database password.

Complete these steps:

 1. Log in to the database using the old password, and then use the
    alter SQL command to change to the new password.

        /usr/local/fineground/console/postgres/bin/psql
                         -U fineground -p 5432 fgnlog Password : <old password>
        Welcome to psql 7.3.4, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

        Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
               \h for help with SQL commands
               \? for help on internal slash commands
               \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
               \q to quit
        fgnlog=# alter user fineground password '<new password>'; \q

 2. The username and password to access the Management Console database
    are set during the Management Console installation process. If you
    want to change these later, you can modify an XML configuration
    file that the Management Console server reads at start-up.

     a. Open the following file in a text editor:

        $AVS_HOME/console/jboss-3.0.1_tomcat-4.0.4/server/default/
        deploy/postgres-service.xml

        Look for the following section in this file:

            <!--set these only if you want only default logins,
                               not through JAAS -->
            <config-property name="UserName" type="java.lang.String">fineground</config-property>
            <config-property name="Password" type="java.lang.String">condenser</config-property>

     b. To change the username, change the value for the UserName
        configuration property (fineground in this example).

     c. To change the password, change the value for the Password
        configuration property (condenser in this example).

     d. Save and close the file.

Changing the Node Manager Password
+---------------------------------

Complete these steps:

 1. Log in as fgn, and then use the su command to switch to the
    superuser.

 2. Stop the Condenser and Node Manager:

        /etc/init.d/fgnpn<Tab> stop

    Press Tab to have the interface complete the command.

 3. Go to the $AVS_HOME/perfnode/node_manager/conf directory.

 4. Back up the file named passwords.

 5. Change the password with the following command:

        $AVS_HOME/perfnode/bin/htpasswd -bcm passwords.new admin <password>

    In the preceding command, passwords.new is the name of the file in
    which the passwords are stored. Currently only the user admin is
    supported.

 6. Install the file with the following command:

        install -m 400 -o nobody -g nobody passwords.new  passwords

 7. Restart the appliance with the reboot command.

 8. Re-register the node from the Management Console for which the node
    manager password was changed.

Changing the Condenser Password
+------------------------------

Complete these steps:

 1. Log in as fgn, and then use the su command to switch to the
    superuser.

 2. Stop the Condenser and Node Manager:

        /etc/init.d/fgnpn<TAB> stop

    Press Tab to have the interface complete the command.

 3. Go to the $AVS_HOME/perfnode/passwd directory.

 4. Backup the file named .htpasswd.

 5. Change the password with the following command:

        $AVS_HOME/perfnode/bin/htpasswd -bcm passwords.new fineground <password>

    In the preceding command, passwords.new is the name of the file in
    which the passwords are stored. Currently only the user fineground
    is supported.

 6. Install the file with the following command:

        install -m 400 -o nobody -g nobody passwords.new  .htpasswd

 7. Restart the appliance with the reboot command.

 8. Re-register the node from the Management Console for which the
    Condenser password was changed.
