Subject: THIS IS NOT A SCAM: REAL TRUECRYPT FOR MACOS IS
	HERE!

Mac OS X OSXCrypt, opensource file based disk encryption software, 
compatible with truecrypt file format, is out!

http://www.osxcrypt.org

Ok guys, some accused us of cheating, scamming, phishing, terrorism and 
even stolen candies but at the end of it we’re OUT with the First 
OpenSource Platform for Volume Encryption on MacOs X (aka ‘Look, mom! 
Truecrypt on my Macbook!’).

Having the opportunity to not trust FileVault has never been so sweet…

So, thanks to the Funders (hey guys, you Rock. Really.) and thanks to 
the Staff (being Orlando Bassotto, Matteo Flora and Fabio pietrosanti) 
now you can play with it. This is the REAL stuff.

Grab it in the Download page and if you wish look at the Tutorial.

Get ready and Happy Porn Secrets!

P.S.: Hey, OSS Community! After the source code release the OSX 
Framework will allow the implementation of a lot more file based 
encrypted formats (LoopAES, DMCrypt, Luks, PGP).

P.S.2: Hey, where is Truecrypt 5.0 released in January? And where are 
the Forums on Truecrypt site?
