Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco PIX and ASA Time-to-Live Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20080123-asa

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080123-asa.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2008 January 23 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A crafted IP packet vulnerability exists in the Cisco PIX 500 Series
Security Appliance (PIX) and the Cisco 5500 Series Adaptive Security
Appliance (ASA) that may result in a reload of the device. This
vulnerability is triggered during processing of a crafted IP packet when
the Time-to-Live (TTL) decrement feature is enabled.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2008-0028 has
been assigned to this vulnerability.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. A workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is
available.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080123-asa.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The TTL decrement feature was introduced in version 7.2(2) and it is
disabled by default. The Cisco PIX and ASA security appliances running
software versions prior to 7.2(3)006 or 8.0(3) and that have the TTL
decrement feature enabled are vulnerable.

By default the PIX and ASA security appliance software does not
decrement the TTL of transient packets. The ability to decrement the TTL
of transient packets can be enabled on a selective or global basis by
using the set connection decrement-ttl command in the policy-map class
configuration mode. To determine whether you are running this feature
use the show running-config command and search for the set connection
decrement-ttl command. Alternatively you can use the include argument to
search for this command as follows:

    ASA#show running-config  |  include decrement-ttl
    set connection decrement-ttl
    ASA#

The set connection decrement-ttl command is part of a configured
class-map. In order for this command to take effect it must be applied
using a policy-map (assigned globally or to an interface). For more
information about the Modular Policy Framework on the Cisco ASA and PIX
refer to the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa80/configuration/guide/mpc.html

To determine whether you are running a vulnerable version of Cisco PIX
or ASA software, issue the show version command-line interface (CLI)
command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA Security Appliance that
runs software release 7.2(3):

    ASA#show version

    Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 7.2(3)

    [...]

Customers who use the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to
manage their devices can find the version of the software displayed in
the table in the login window or in the upper left corner of the ASDM
window. The version notation is similar to the following:

    PIX Version 7.2(3)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco PIX and ASA security appliances which do not support the TTL
decrement feature or are not explicitly configured for it are not
vulnerable.

Note: The TTL decrement feature was introduced in version 7.2(2), and it
is disabled by default. The Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) is not
vulnerable.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.
