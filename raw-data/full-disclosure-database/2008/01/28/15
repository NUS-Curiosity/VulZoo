Subject: Re: asking about certificate


 
 
Actually.... the QSA is for the employee... the QSC & ASV is for the company. In order for a person to have/keep/maintain their QSA cert, they must work for QSC.
 
If a QSA quits working for a QSC, they no longer have their QSA certification.-Jeff WilderCISSP,QSA,CCE,C/EH-----BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK-----Version: 3.1GIT/CM/CS/O d- s:+ a C+++ UH++ P L++ E- w-- N+++ o-- K- w O- M--V-- PS+ PE- Y++ PGP++ t+ 5- X-- R* tv b++ DI++ D++G e* h--- r- y+++*------END GEEK CODE BLOCK------

Follow the links at https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/index.htm
Note - AVS applies to the company, not an individual.
 
QSA certification applies to both the company and the individual.
