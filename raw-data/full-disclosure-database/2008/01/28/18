Dude Van Wanker knows the pecking order around here...

In other news, Chanology Crew are running scared... the FBI a knocking a soon.

As for the "Anonymous" who jumped on the Chanology bandwagon, they are
as good as dead. The Digg/Reddit propaganda won't hold up for much
longer now that the bot net is out of action.

"Anonymous" who are seperate from Chanology called for world wide
protests outside Centre of Scientology's around the world on February
10th, but that will flop as a none starter I think.

"Anonymous" are just the propaganda arm of Chanology, which are random
members of the public for the most part.

Also rumor has it Chanology is Bantown, but this is not confirmed as
yet, but my informants are working overtime to find out more.

Chanology are no longer a threat to any other website because they
don't have a bot net now.

My main concern was the same people were going to use the bot net for
other things, but its in the industry's interest to track the bot net
so it can't be used for any other purposes/political agenda/or other
exploitation.
