Subject: Re: Metasploit Framework v3.1 Released

Mailing List,

I would like to apologize to the list, my citations have come out 
backwards. I suspect this to be due to my machine being compromised 
by a recent Borland InterBase exploit. Thanks for your patience.

Your Friend in Full Disclosure,

J
