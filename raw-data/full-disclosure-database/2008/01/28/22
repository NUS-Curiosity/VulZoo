Sorry Mr.Cilfone, This is the interweb and your laws mean nothing here. Go
try to spook someone else.

	Dear Full Disclosure,
	
	We are writing to you in behalf of Bart Cilfone. He has asked us to
contact you and see if you will consider removing the content about him at:
	
	http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Jan/0497.html
	
	Please allow us to introduce ourselves. We are ReputationDefender,
Inc., a company dedicated to helping our clients preserve their good name on
the Internet. Our founders and employees are all regular Internet users.
Like our clients, and perhaps like you, we think the Internet is sometimes
unnecessarily hurtful to the privacy and reputations of everyday people.
Even content that is meant to be informative can sometimes have a
significant and negative impact on someone's job prospects, student
applications, and personal life. We invite you to learn more about who we
are, at www.reputationdefender.com.
	
	When our clients sign up with our service, we undertake deep
research about them on the Internet to see what the Web is saying about
them. We find sites where they are discussed, and we ask our clients how
they feel about those sites. Sometimes our clients express strong
reservations about the content on particular websites. They may feel hurt,
ashamed, or "invaded" by the content about them on those sites.
	
	As you may know, more and more prospective employers, universities,
and newfound friends and romantic interests undertake Internet research, and
the material they find can strongly impact their impressions of the people
they are getting to know. When people apply for jobs, apply for college or
graduate school, apply for loans, begin dating, or seek to do any number of
other things with their lives, hurtful content about them on the Internet
can have a negative impact on their opportunities. At some point or another,
most of us say things about ourselves or our friends and acquaintances we
later regret. We're all human, and we all do it!
	
	We are writing to you today because our client, Bart Cilfone, has
told us that he would like the content about him on your website to be
removed as it is outdated and disturbing to him. Would you be willing to
remove or alter the content? It would mean so much to Mr. Cilfone, and to
us. Considerate actions such as these will go a long way to help make the
Internet a more civil place.
	
	Thank you very much for your consideration. We are mindful that
matters like these can be sensitive. We appreciate your time.
	
	Please let us know if you have removed or changed the content on
this site by sending an e-mail to: cilfone.law@...il.com.
	
	
	Yours sincerely,
	
	Donald Republic
	Reputation Defender Service Team
