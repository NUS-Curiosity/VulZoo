This whole exploit program is seemingly a massive obsfucation exercise.

Apart from the above, the prepare() function has "hidden" socket()  
and sendto() calls to send a 64 byte parameter block to 213.73.91.29  
port 864 (repeated 9 times).

The rest is repeated fork/wait/nice stuff that will probably have a  
DoS effect on the system it's run on, but no privilege elevation...

Regards,

Andrew.
