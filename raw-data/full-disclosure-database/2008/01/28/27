The hint du jour:  Getting a RH7.0 system to boot a 2.6 kernel is nontrivial
(among other things, you have to get udev working first).  The fact that
various RedHat systems are listed, but no Fedora releases are listed, should
be a clue that all is not what it seems. So you might want to decode those
hex strings before running it.. ;)
