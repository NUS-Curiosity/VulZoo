Subject: They got into the town, the enemies

They got into the town, the enemies,
they crushed the doors, the enemies,
and we laughed in the neighborhoods,
in the first day,
They got into the town, the enemies,
they took brothers, the enemies,
and we looked at the ladies,
the next day,
They got into the town, the enemies,
they burned us, the enemies,
and we screamed in the dark,
the third day,
They got into the town, the enemies,
they wear swords, the enemies,
and we took them as friends,
the next day,
They got into the town, the enemies,
they brought us sadness, the enemies,
and we laughed as children,
the fifth day,
They got into the town, the enemies,
they kept ruling, the enemies,
and we screamed cheers and cheerio,
and we screamed cheers and cheerio,
As every day
