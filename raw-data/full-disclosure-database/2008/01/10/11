Nope. It's just a more convenient way of doing things. I understand that
you can't imagine that someone could use this tool not as standalone
tool, but as a part of some script in bigger system. With GUI-only
programs it's very difficult. On the other side, writing for command
line tools a frontend in Tcl/Tk, Perl/Tk, PyGTK or anything else is very
easy.

Hey, wake up. Your small desktop is not a center of the world. There are
systems where command line is an essential.

Bullshit. I've never seen anybody who can point an icon and click it
in shorter time than the time that casual admin needs to write
a single-word command (you can write a script or alias for commonly used
commands).
