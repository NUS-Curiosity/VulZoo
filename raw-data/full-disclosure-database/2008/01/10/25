I don't think you get anyone's point. From reading this thread the CLI has the 
edge because:

1) It is more flexible.
2) You can more easily script it.
3) It works better with remote systems.

You mentioned DOS, that it is 20 years old, and that people should "upgrade." 
DOS is actually 26 years old, and most people here use some flavor of *nix, 
which can be run with a very nice GUI, yet they still use the CLI for certain 
tasks. Why? See above. 

Finally, even when DOS was king, the *nix users would speak about how crippled 
its CLI was compared to Unix. Now there is Linux and the MacOS, both with 
multiple, very powerfull CLI environments. I understand the MacOS has an 
adequate GUI as well, but the CLI plays a major role in the OS's 
attractiveness to the hard core geek.
