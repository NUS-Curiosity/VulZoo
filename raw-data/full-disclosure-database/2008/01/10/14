                             Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil


[ - Introduction - ]

   uCon will be a totally informal and non-profit conference (actually a
small gathering of friends, hackers, computer security enthusiasts and
idiots alike) taking place in Recife, Pernambuco, in 9th of February 2008
-- three days after the best street carnival in the world. The conference
aims to bring together academics, hackers and information security
enthusiasts to share cutting-edge ideas and thoughts about their latest
developments and techniques in the field.

PS1: uCon stands for "micro con", not "UFPE con"!
