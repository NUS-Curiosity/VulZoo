Subject: Tool Release: PortBunny 1.0

Hi,

Recurity Labs is proud to release the new TCP port scanner "PortBunny".
Out development goals were speed and reliability instead of higher
level features.

The source code, presentation slides from the 24th Chaos
Communication Congress as well as a link to the video recording can be
found at: http://www.recurity-labs.com/portbunny/

Enjoy,
FX
