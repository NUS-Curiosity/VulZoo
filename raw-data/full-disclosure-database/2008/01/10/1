Hello,

First of all, the tests you are doing sound very, very cool. Thank you for posting your results in a public forum. I am going through your other SCADA posts on full disclosure right now, and they are very informative.

What are the remaining 5 SCADA devices you have lined up for testing? Specifically, do you have any Telvent SAGE RTU's? I would like to see all the output you received from nmap, and possibly any logs of experiments you conducted on the Kohler Power Systems modbus/ethernet converter, as well as anything relating to future test. However, I am very new to this list (first post) and I understand that we can take this off list if you believe it would annoy people. Since I am thinking this, perhaps others have the same sentiments?

Mostly, I am interested in RTU's, but if you were able to purchase everything for under 1k, it seems to me that a complete RTU might be a bit more expensive. Since this is "full disclosure", would you mind posting the 6 items you purchased and what you paid for them? 

Thanks!
