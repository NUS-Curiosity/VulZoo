Subject: Re: scada/plc gear

There's a ton of information on the Internet for Schneider/Modicon's
modbus protocol, including modbus+., modbusrtu, and modbustcp...
Specs are freely available
http://www.modbus.org/docs/Modbus_Application_Protocol_V1_1b.pdf.  If
you spend 2 minutes with google you'll find more then you'll need.
For example: http://www.modbus.pl/download/zxy66/v19/modbus_perl_client.zip.
 Anyways, enjoy your research...
