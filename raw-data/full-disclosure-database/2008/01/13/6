Subject: Nipper 0.11.2 Released

Nipper is a network infrastructure parser. It processes configuration files 
from network devices and produces a report including a security audit of the 
device, configuration settings and other relevant information.

Nipper currently supports the following device types:

  * Cisco IOS-based routers
  * Cisco IOS-based switches
  * Cisco IOS-based catalysts
  * Cisco NMP-based catalysts
  * Cisco CatOS-based catalysts
  * Cisco PIX-based Firewalls
  * Cisco ASA-based Firewalls
  * Cisco FWSM-based Firewalls
  * Cisco Content Service Switches
  * Juniper ScreenOS-based Firewalls (NetScreen)
  * Nortel Passport devices
  * CheckPoint Firewall-1 Firewalls
  * Sonicwall SonicOS-based Firewalls

The security audit includes details of the findings, together with detailed 
recommendations. The security audit can be modified using command line 
parameters or an external configuration file.

Network filtering audits include the following, all of which can be modified:

  * Rule lists end with a deny all and log
  * Rules allowing access from any source
  * Rules allowing access from network sources
  * Rules allowing access from any source port
  * Rules allowing access to any destination
  * Rules allowing access to destination networks
  * Rules allowing access to any destination service
  * Rules that do not log
  * Deny rules that do not log
  * Rules that are disabled
  * Rules that reject rather than drop
  * No bypass rules exist
  * Default rules

Nipper is available for Linux, Windows and other platforms. It can be 
downloaded from the Source Forge project page 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/nipper).

If you have access to device configuration files for network devices, please 
consider sending them to me. I will be discrete, but you are welcome to 
sanitise them first. However, if you do sanitise them, please ensure that the 
structure of the config file is not modified.
