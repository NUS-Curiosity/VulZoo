Yes, I thought it was interesting. I really wish I didn't fry the thing 
as I'd like to have eliminated the possibility it was something funny on 
my end.

So far, not a great record - these things seems about as robust as 
network printers, which is to say, not very.

RS-485 to Ethernet.

I wish I had; but it was nothing unusual. I like to start out by 
scanning and hammering these devices with common tools, so I used nmap, 
nessus and amap. If I had to pick something, it would be setting amap on 
502/tcp overnight that did it.

Yes indeed, I can not wait to get my hands on some real PLCs, and not 
just these little converters or more modern pieces.

2 more devices arrived yesterday:

- i.Board i.CanDoIt embedded webserver 
(http://www.csimn.com/CSI_pages/iboard.html) which is built similar to 
the Kohler in that it uses an embedded ethernet module, but this time 
from Digi (http://www.digi.com/products/embeddedsolutions/digiconnectme.jsp)

- ADAM-4572 (http://www.ucs.co.uk/index.php?pid=948)

- Lantronix MSS485-T 
(http://www.lantronix.com/device-networking/external-device-servers/mss485-t.html)

- Phoenix Contact FL IL 24 BK-PAC (http://tinyurl.com/2c6x96)

- DLI Ethernet DIN Relay (http://www.digital-loggers.com/din.html)
