Dear phisher hunter phunt,

I think you are confused. Professional computer crackers, hackers, 
whitehats, fruithats, CISSPs, PHDs, etc. do not use the "CLI" for 
elitist purposes, but rather for pragmatism. Even the dumb guy that 
already responded to the post before pointed that out.

If you plan to post to mailing lists in the future, please refrain 
from outing yourself as a fraud. My father Karl once told me "son, 
if you need to start a sentence with 'not trying to be' you should 
consider just shutting the fuck up and not expressing the half-
assed idea." Of course he said this in German so this is a rough 
translation.

Please stick to what you know best. Based on my preliminary recon 
efforts, this seems to be hunting phishers and not posting to 
computer programming mailing lists, citing your qualifications as 
"i don't use kde lolol"
