Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 01.09.08: Novell
 NetWare Client nicm.sys Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.09.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jan 09, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

The Novell Client software provides a workstation with access to Novell
NetWare networks as well as Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES)
services. Novell Clients can access the full range of Novell services
such as authentication via Novell eDirectory, network browsing and
service resolution, and secure and reliable file system access. More
information about the Novel Client can be found on the vendor's web
site at the following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an input validation error vulnerability within
Novell Inc.'s NetWare Client allows attackers to execute arbitrary code
within the kernel.

When the Novell NetWare Client is installed on a Windows-based operating
system, the driver nicm.sys will be loaded at system startup. This
driver allows any user to open the device "\\.\nicm" and issue IOCTLs
with a buffering mode of METHOD_NEITHER.

Due to insufficient input validation, user mode software can pass kernel
addresses as arguments to the driver. By using specially constructed
input, a malicious user can use functionality within the driver to
patch kernel addresses and execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local attacker to execute
arbitrary code within the kernel. To exploit the vulnerability, the
attacker must be able execute a specially crafted executable on the
targeted computer.
