Dear Markus,
    I really am sorry, I really am sorry that you are so intellectually 
LAZY!

   most of us here who use the CLI are DEVELOPERS/EXPERTS/ETC we use CLI 
and GUI with equal fluency and
supply one or the other if lacking according to our favorite tools, the 
fact that you complain that the CLI you cant understand and that
you cant supply the GUI yourself means you are subscribed to a mailing 
list above your technical level, either UNSUBSCRIBE IMMEDIATELY(to avoid 
further frustrating yourself) or immediately enroll in the nearest 
community college/ Continuing education for Adults(Basic Unix 
Familiarity)/GED(with Computer literacy training included).
I am really trying to help here to help you avoid further frustration!



     warmest regards
     a bugtraq denizen
