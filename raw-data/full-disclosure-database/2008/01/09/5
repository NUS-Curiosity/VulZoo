Amen, brother. :)

I'll be happy with GUI interfaces when they finally evolve enough to
allow you to do things like:

net_groveller -s `cat starter_list` | egrep 'some expression' | sed -e 's/this/that/' -e 's/other \(.*\) thing/\1/' | xargs launch_probe

(Particularly interesting is that second sed expression - I've never seen a
GUI that allows backrefs in a regexp ;)
