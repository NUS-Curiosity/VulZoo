Subject: Gateway WebLaunch ActiveX Control Insecure Method

The DoWebLaunch() method of the Gateway WebLauncher ActiveX control 
allows for the execution or arbitrary application on a system, 
additionally this method is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the 
2nd and 4th parameters. Both weblaunch.ocx and weblaunch2.ocx allow 
the execution of arbitrary files, weblaunch.ocx is vulnerable to 
the above mentioned buffer overflow, I have not checked 
weblaunch2.ocx. Exploit: http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/4869
