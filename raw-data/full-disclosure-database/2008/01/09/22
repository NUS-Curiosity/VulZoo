Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in R could result in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

R is a GPL licensed implementation of S, a language and environment for
statistical computing and graphics. PCRE is a library providing
functions for Perl-compatible regular expressions.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package     /  Vulnerable  /                           Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/R     < 2.2.1-r1                             >= 2.2.1-r1

Description
===========

R includes a copy of PCRE which is vulnerable to multiple buffer
overflows and memory corruptions vulnerabilities (GLSA 200711-30).

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to process specially crafted regular
expressions with R, which could possibly lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, a Denial of Service or the disclosure of sensitive
information.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All R users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/R-2.2.1-r1"
