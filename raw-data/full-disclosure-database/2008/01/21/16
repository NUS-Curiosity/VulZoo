Hey all, I'd like to get into reviewing security companies as well.
Before I do though I'd appreciate it if someone could provide me
with information on the differences betweens statistical sampling
over judgmental sampling. I wouldn't want to write a review that
could affect someone's livelihood without knowing what the differences 
are between say change management and mitigation management.

And to the older security folks on the list keeping quiet (not those 
between the ages of tenteen and 19):
