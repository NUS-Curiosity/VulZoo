Pardon me, but who is this?  "secreview"?  Who is behind this email
address?  If you don't identify yourself then I assume that this
entire thread is some sort of vengeance play.

I can vouch for Adam's 14 years of experience and then some.  When I
met Adam in 1992, he already had a strong command of Unix security.
He was an administrator (1 of 4 total over 7 years) of Unphamiliar
Territories (UPT), a vulnerability research BBS that ran from 1989 -
1996.  It was a prominent place for information about vulnerability
research.  Many held it in higher regard than Phrack magazine or any
leading website/magazine during that time period.

Sites such as PullThePlug, HackThisSite, etc all borrowed ideas from
UPT, and the code was re-used and made available in Phrack magazine as
well as integrated into the Linux kernel or features thereof.  UPT was
about 5-6 years ahead of the NSA before they released SELinux and 7-8
years ahead of projects such as GRSecurity.  Anyone making such an
enormous contribution to this sort of project has certainly provided a
greater service to our industry than a "secreview"/company-bashing
organization such as yourself.

Well then you should read your email before you hit the "send" button.

Many small businesses such as QuietMove have a hard enough time
staying alive in this industry.  I suggest you "pick on someone your
own size" even if you have a legitimate problem with QuietMove or
Adam.

Compared to the other companies that you mentioned (Accuvant, IBM/ISS,
Pegasus), QuietMove will certainly provide a much more friendly
service environment for companies to work in.  I would put my
recommendation of quality on the work QuietMove does as A+.  There are
few PCI ASV's or penetration testing companies that I would find any
value in -- and QuietMove exceeds my expectations in this area.

Cheers,
Andre
