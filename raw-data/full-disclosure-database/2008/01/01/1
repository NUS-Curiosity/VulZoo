                        An Expose of Hal Turner, No. II


Keywords:
 white power, 1488, WPWW1488, Hal, Turner, Harold, Bill White, VNN


The Update:

 Hal Turner's http://www.halturnershow.com/ site has been compromised
 twice in the past week by an expert GAPP & goudatr0n security
 collaboration. Before both cracks Hal said that the site was
 "unhackable"; this has proven to be false.
 This is the first of Hal's many lies.

 ASIDE:
 Here's the results of a uname -a; id on Hal's server:

 Linux privatewebhosting.org 2.6.22.14-72.fc6 #1 SMP Wed
 Nov 21 13:44:07 EST 2007 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
 uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

 Hal's earlier claim that had server expenses of "over $5,000" is his
 2nd lie. GAPP-goudatr0n investigation has revealed that Hal has spent
 a mere $619 (charged to a now-unusable credit card) on the site.

 Hal paid FDCservers.net LCC the $619 on the first of December 2007,
 and the invoice reveals no prior charges. Let's see how well your
 fundraising goes after this little discovery, Hal!

 Other lies of Hal's: he has no Jewish ancestry (false); he has a
 happy relationship with his wife (false; he has a pending divorce);
 he has a paying job (false; Hal has attempted to go on disability
 benefits but couldn't due to being unemployed); and more!


Hal's address, just for good measure:
 1906 Paterson Plank Road
 North Bergen, New Jersey
 07047-1900
 United States
