Subject: Re: [Professional IT Security Providers -
	Exposed] QuietMove ( secreview review: D- )

Before secreview jumps on them, apologies for the typos. Hard to type  
long email on touchscreen, on the train!

No hard feelings secreview. I apreciate the review. There is no such  
thing as bad press, and I had fun writing my witty and clever rejoinder.
