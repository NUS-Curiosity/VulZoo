You are worthless.

http://www.tssci-security.com/bookshelf/

Is this list up to date?  It makes it seem as if you are learning basic
linux commands, sed, and basic perl. Also why are you reading operating
system design and implementation when you do not know C? ( Seeing as C books
are in your 'to-read' list ).  Do you understand any of the code in it or do
you just pick out buzz words to talk about at your 'local meet-ups'. Why
dont you explain the finer points of microkernel design to us?

You are headed even further down the path of complete lamer seeing as you
read books on XSS and all your blog posts revolve around it.

even more lulz in your 'plan to read' containing books on fuzzing,
metasploit, and writing rootkits. How can you write rootkits when you do not
know C and are learning basic unix commands?... lol

Hopefully one day you realize that you are just another security industry
kiddie and have no real knowledge, but probably not. Seeing as you have your
'bachelors' ( lol - has nothing to do with security ) - I am sure you are
well on your way to a cissp.

Also for good laugh speople should read:

http://www.tssci-security.com/projects/

how long did it take you to write all 40 lines of your 'labs' code? I shall
notify perl underground of your horrendous perl and you shalll be a source
of great lulz in their next production.

Just found this:
http://www.tssci-security.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/mwielgoszewski_resume.pdfSo
you worked 4 places and did nothing useful. Sounds like SImon may want
to
hire you. ( Hi simon , are your workers still inadequate and you need more
help? )

So basically you have worked 4 jobs, went to a community college that has
some sort of security program, you know basic perl and C, do not know how to
audit any real programs, and blog about XSS.   Does this summarize you
pretty well?
