Synopsis
========

xine-lib is vulnerable to multiple heap-based buffer overflows when
processing RTSP streams.

Background
==========

xine-lib is the core library package for the xine media player.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xine-lib      < 1.1.9.1                     >= 1.1.9.1

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma reported that xine-lib does not properly check
boundaries when processing SDP attributes of RTSP streams, leading to
heap-based buffer overflows.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to play specially crafted RTSP video
streams with a player using xine-lib, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
player.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.9.1"
