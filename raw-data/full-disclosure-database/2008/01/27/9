Synopsis
========

ngIRCd does not properly sanitize commands sent by users, allowing for
a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

ngIRCd is a free open source daemon for Internet Relay Chat (IRC).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-irc/ngircd      < 0.10.4                            >= 0.10.4

Description
===========

The IRC_PART() function in the file irc-channel.c does not properly
check the number of parameters, referencing an invalid pointer if no
channel is supplied.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash the ngIRCd
daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ngIRCd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/ngircd-0.10.4"
