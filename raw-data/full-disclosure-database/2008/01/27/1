Subject: Selling codes exploiting 0-days vulnerabilities

Hi All,

My name is Gerrit-Jan. I'm posting this message because I'm security
engineer which codes some "exploits" about 0-days vulnerabilities. Through
this mailing-list, I'm selling these codes. For the moment, I have
interesting exploits for Windows, UNIX and Linux.
Feel free to contact me by e-mail (only if you are interested).

Have nice day,

Cheers,

G.J.
