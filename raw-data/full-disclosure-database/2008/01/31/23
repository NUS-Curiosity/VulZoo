While Windows 98 SE was the best of the 9x series, I don't think anyone really 
mourned its passing (I still use it under Qemu). XP would have been hands 
down a better system except for its obnoxious copy protection. Even so, the 
stability advantages XP yielded made it a better system.

Windows 2000 and ME were released the same year (2000 first, if I remember). 
2000 was seen as an update to NT4, not 98. 2000 was the first NT OS to 
include plug and play, but the conversion from 98 to 2000 required a full 
reinstall. XP let you upgrade your Windows 9x system directly, although that 
was probably not a good idea.

If there is a "best" Windows candidate, I would vote for Windows 2000. It was 
relatively light weight, stable, and it offered minimal copy protection.
