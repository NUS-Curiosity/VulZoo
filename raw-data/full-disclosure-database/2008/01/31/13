Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in PeerCast.

Background
==========

PeerCast is a client and server for P2P-radio network

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/peercast      < 0.1218                      >= 0.1218

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma reported a heap-based buffer overflow within the
"handshakeHTTP()" function when processing HTTP requests.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request to the
vulnerable server, possibly resulting in the remote execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the PeerCast
server, usually "nobody".

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PeerCast users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/peercast-0.1218"
