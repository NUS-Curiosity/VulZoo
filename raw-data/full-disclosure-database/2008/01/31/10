Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in GOffice could result in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GOffice is a library of document-centric objects and utilities based on
GTK.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/goffice       < 0.6.1                           >= 0.6.1
                                                             *>= 0.4.3

Description
===========

GOffice includes a copy of PCRE which is vulnerable to multiple buffer
overflows and memory corruptions vulnerabilities (GLSA 200711-30).

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open specially crafted documents
with GOffice, which could possibly lead to the execution of arbitrary
code, a Denial of Service or the disclosure of sensitive information.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GOffice 0.4.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/goffice-0.4.3"

All GOffice 0.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/goffice-0.6.1"
