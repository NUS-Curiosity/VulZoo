Tyler, 

You're correct.

2009 Windows Se7en RTM http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7 

2012 Vista Basic EOL http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=11731
2014 XP Home xEOL http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=3221
2014  XP Pro xEOL http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=3223
2017 Vista Bus xEOL http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=11707
2017 Vista Ent xEOL http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=11737

Still, there's a big difference in lifecycle.  XP was introduced in 2001, and planned EOL is 2009 (eight year lifecycle).  Vista was introduced in 2007, and planned EOL is 2012 (five year lifecycle).  That's pretty short product lifecycle for a $10B* development effort.

Sometimes I'm reminded of why Full Disclosure amuses me and why I stay subscribed

Windows 2000 was out half a year ahead of Windows ME... so something tells me they didn't "quietly extend 98 for a few more years until they came out with 2000"... even if you were talking XP (which was Oct 2001) it would be a year, not a few years. 



Bill: You aren't being fair with our EOL dates. You are comparing XP Pro (Officially a business operating system) to Vista Home Premium (a Home operating System)... you have to compare XP Pro to a Business version of Vista and when you do that you get Vista Business with an EOL of 2017 ( http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=11707 ), 3 years after XP Pro.
