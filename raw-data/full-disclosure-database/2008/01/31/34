forgot to mention, they are definitely used for data, i just don't
know how much.  Mentat even provides a dedicated appliance with
modified TCP like reliable stream delivery over sat links to
accommodate the long, wide pipe characteristics of satellite
transport.

your typical TCP stack will severely under-utilize a sat link due to
the latencies involved.
