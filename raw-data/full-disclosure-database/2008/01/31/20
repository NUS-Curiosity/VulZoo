Windows ME Release Date: Sept. 14, 2000
Windows 2000 Release Date: Feb. 17, 2000

Windows 2000 was out half a year ahead of Windows ME... so something tells
me they didn't "quietly extend 98 for a few more years until they came out
with 2000"... even if you were talking XP (which was Oct 2001) it would be a
year, not a few years.


Bill: You aren't being fair with our EOL dates. You are comparing XP Pro
(Officially a business operating system) to Vista Home Premium (a Home
operating System)... you have to compare XP Pro to a Business version of
Vista and when you do that you get Vista Business with an EOL of 2017 (
http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=11707 ), 3 years after XP Pro.
