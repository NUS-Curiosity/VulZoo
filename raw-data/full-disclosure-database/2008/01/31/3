That's not a good alternative.
Windows has only a single reason to exist, and that is running games, since
wine cannot run everything.
My winxp partition is labeled "Playstation"...
Unfortunately, since i like to play, i'm forced to use win for it.
And since winxp is the only "decent" windows, making microsoft continue
their only useful operating system is indeed a good purpose.
I hope i've explained my PoV of why that petition is not so bad after all...
