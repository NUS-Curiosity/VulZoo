two cables:
FLAG Europe-Asia and SeaMeWe-4

you'd be surprised how often trawlers, boat anchors, cable scavengers
(yes, really!) and even marine life sever under sea cables... or maybe
you wouldn't.

no need to attribute to skilled malice (NSA taps from the undersea bay
of the Jimmy Carter sub fiber splicing deck) what is easily
accomplished via sheer stupidity or carelessness or simple bad luck.

rarely single points, but pairs or small groups.  the moment you get a
good pair of failures in a critical link, you often see cascading
failures, and it turns into a a cyclone of crap hitting fans.. whee

DWDM can get pretty fat.  the economic incentives to squeeze as much
bandwidth as possible through every single strand makes these the
phattest of the phat pipes, in general.

i don't know figures (anyone?) but this tends to be the case.  sats
are great for broadcast relay, but suck for low latency bi-directional
comms.  however, they do make useful backups.  how else are you going
to get data back and forth across the planet when those fibers get
sliced?
