Vista will be replaced by Windows 7, so for most corporations with a 3-year desktop lifecycle, it does not make sense to blend Vista with XP when Windows 7 will come out in two-three years.

I think Microsoft realizes this, and XP will be supported longer than Vista.  Vista end of life is 10/4/2012, and XP support was extended to 4/12/2014.

  XP EOL: http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?LN=en-gb&x=16&y=12&C2=1173

For all those who believe Vista is still not up to par,you can help stop 
MS from forcing us to go to Vista.

For those who don't know,MS is planning on stopping XP sales after June 
30,2008.There are a few options for enterprise users,but Joe XP user 
will not be able to go to any store and buy a copy of XP after that 
date.Or at least after the stores sell out of what they have on hand.

You can sign a petition at InfoWorld that may delay or stop MS from 
forcing us to use Vista.

Sign the petition here:

Maybe we can stop this.

Regards,
  Scott
