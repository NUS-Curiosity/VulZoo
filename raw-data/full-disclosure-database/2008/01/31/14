Subject: MySpace Uploader ActiveX Control Buffer Overflow

Who:
MySpace
http://www.myspace.com

What:
MySpace repackages Aurigma's ImageUploader ActiveX. This control 
enables MySpace users to upload images to their MySpace page(s).

How:
MySpaceUploader.ocx version 1.0.0.4
{48DD0448-9209-4F81-9F6D-D83562940134}

This control is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the Action 
property. 

I believe FaceBook also uses/repackages the Aurigma control, I 
don't know which version though.

Fix:
No official fix known
Vendor notified

Workaround:
Set the KillBit for this control, see 
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797
