Within limits - the replacement laser has to be something that works with
the regen units located every 30 to 50 miles or so along the cable (incidentally,
getting power to a regen unit that's 1,500 miles down the cable and under 4
miles of water is non-trivial - the usual solution for that is to pump a
high-voltage feed down a copper conductor in the cable.  Only one conductor
is needed, because salt water makes a *very* good ground. ;)
