Subject: dude vanwinkle turns against fergdawg, trendmicro

http://linuxbox.org/pipermail/funsec/2008-January/016043.html

explosive scenes have been witnessed by n3td3v group as VanWinkle
spreads attack on Fergdawg and Trendmicro!!!!

Fergdawg lusts up the chance to plug he works for the company "hand
jerk sound effects"


We don't know if the FIGHT/CONFLCIT/WAR will continue in the thread,
but signals of unrest between FUNSEC regulars is only just kicking
off.


get your ring side seats, only VanWinkle will survive.
