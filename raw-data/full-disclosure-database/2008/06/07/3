you had mental scars (scares?) long before that paper. youre just a 
retard looking for attention.

i think they answered this in the blog entry you cited. they wrote 
"Finally, I've been asked why I picked on n3td3v in the first 
place? My answer it pretty simple: it was the challenge asked of 
me. The targeted individual was not my selection"

you are also illiterate. nowhere does the doc say 'gobbles is 
n3td3v'. he only says that he could not rule gobbles out as a 
suspect. besides gobbles does a better n3td3v than n3td3v and he 
has been doing it for years.

this just shows how much of a liar you really are. kravetz did not 
start talking about bin laden until september 7 2007. that is a 
year after the n3td3v paper came out.

Waiting-for-Bin-Laden.html

you also were focused on mi5/mi6 long before then. or do you not 
remember talking about them back in 2006? five months before the 
kravetz paper.

i thought you said you dropped out. are you a drop out or a 
student? dont bother answering because i really dont care.

i can only hope you feel better in the future.

birthday gobbles.
