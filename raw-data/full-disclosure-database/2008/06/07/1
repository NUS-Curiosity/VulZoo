Subject: "I am who I am"...

I never wrote that on the SecurityFocus website, it was a member of
the general public.

The intelligence services can check up on that... I was in university
away from it all when Robert Lemos and Neal Krawetz wrote their shit
about me, and I deffo wasn't the person who wrote under the
SecurityFocus news article "I am who I am".

If you want to know I was away on the first UK ethical hacking
university degree of its kind at the time at the University of Abertay
Dundee, so why don't you fuck off and leave me alone?

The intelligence services MI5 were already tracking me because I was
on the first ethical hacking degree course of its kind in the UK, but
Robert Lemos and Neal Krawetz wouldn't let me leave the mailing lists
when I said http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2006-September/049217.html
"n3td3v: viva end of n3td3v----and security group"

They had to write shite about me, here
www.hackerfactor.com/papers/who_is_n3td3v.pdf
here http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11419
and here http://hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1-I-am-who-I-am....html

They are fucking lamers!!!

WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST LET ME GO AWAY AND LEAD A LIFE INSTEAD OF WRITING ABOUT ME?

All the best,

n3td3v
