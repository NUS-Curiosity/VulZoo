Subject: GSM Researcher stopped at Heathrow Airport by UK government officials
To: n3td3v <n3td3v@...glegroups.com>


I was leaving today from the United Kingdom/Heathrow airport. I am
about to speak at the HITB IT security conference about GSM security
and the USRP (gnu-radio project).

I was searched by the UK government while waiting at the Gate and
reading a newspaper. A UK Government employee flipped his badge and
said "Let's talk. Come over here".

They detained my USRP (Software Defined Radio), my mobile phone and my
personal SIM card.

They did their homework. They knew who I am, where i live, which day I
speak at the conference and who I work for.

I'm involved in the GSM software project where we also developed a new
attack against the GSM encryption A51. We published our research in
February at the Blackhat security conference in Washington DC.

I understand that the government wanted to make sure that I'm not
exporting any cryptanalytic device.

I did not. I will not. The USRP is a radio. My mobile phone is a
normal nokia 3310 phone and my SIM card is a sim card.

They said they do not know what the USRP is and that I can not take it
until they have checked it in the lab. This can take 14 days (1/2
month).

So be it. They have it for 14 days. Guys, enjoy the device! It's fun
playing around with it!

I'm uneasy that they took my mobile phone and my sim card. Having a
pregnant wife at home and not being reachable complicates my
situation.

Is this common practice? Are they allowed to do this?
Any tips how I can get my mobile phone and my sim card back quicker?

Our project: http://wiki.thc.org/gsm
The USRP is available from http://www.ettus.com
The GNU RADIO project: http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio


stunning,

Appendix: Surprisingly they did not detain my laptop or my paperwork
which would be the most likely place to store any information related
to cracking A51. They were also not interested in my 160GB harddrive
which would have been the obvious place for storing the rainbow
tables. Neither were they interested in the high performance FPGA
chip.

Instead they took all equipment that could have been used for
demonstrating that GSM signals can be received with publicly available
hardware for 700 USD.

It does not appear that they were after cryptanalytic information.

I received a yellow paper about my detained goods. They left the field
blank that reads
"The goods specified below are detained for the following reason:". What reason?

They also crossed out the field "Agent" of the officer who was in
charge of the operation.

UPDATE 2008-04-18
Arrived back at Heathrow. Airplane crew announced "All passengers
please have your passport ready. There is a passport check while
leaving the airplane. Passenger Steve Mueller please make yourself
noticeable to the crew. Steve Mueller please."

They told me at the gate that I can get my equipment back. I had a
chat with them and they answered many of my questions. They did not
answer who requested that I should be searched when I left the
country.

I'm happy that I got my equipment back and I appreciate that they had
it checked out quickly.

I'm still not sure why they took exactly the radio receiver parts. I
had to change my presentation for the conference and was not able to
demonstrate the USRP/gnu-radio.
