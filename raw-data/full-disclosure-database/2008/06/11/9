Subject: XSS Browser hijacking PoC?

Hi all,

Several months ago, there was a post about a proof of concept for complete
browser hijacking via XSS.  IIRC, the hijacked browser would periodically
query a management server, and the management server would track the
hijacked browsers in a database.  The person controlling the management
server could then instruct the hijacked browsers to do his bidding.

The thing is, I can't find the tool.  I'm wondering if anyone still knows
where it is.

Thanks in advance!
