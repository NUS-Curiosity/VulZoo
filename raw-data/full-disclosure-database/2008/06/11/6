Subject: Re: Mambo Cookie Authentication Bypass Exploit

My social skills are great when it comes to talking to rational, 
non-fame-seeking people. However when the XSS and not-a-real-bug 
fanboys start posting someone has to stand up.

As for you... I am sure you were that kid at school who told on the 
others just so the teacher would like you because no one else did. 
Why reference the charter? Its just a guideline, this is full 
disclosure -- aka, I can say what I want you fucking cunt. Case in 
point: Eat shit and die you nobody.

Thanks.
