... just saw this while browsing the archive. Belated apologies for the
annoyance. There had been a milter rule to block these from my account to
the internet, but was disabled at some point for debugging and (obviously)
never turned back on. 
 
Cheers

Folks, it is 2008. Like cell phones, e-mail autoresponders are no longer 
cool. Use a separate address for mailing lists (like a personal or 
disposable one) so we don't get bombarded with your junk. 

Did I mention the social engineering treasures sent around the world with 
each one? Do you really work in security? 

Gah!
