A union that represents thousands of Con Edison employees voted to go
on
strike at 12:01 AM on June 29. The union and Con Ed are currently in
negotiations. The strike would span all Con Ed commodities: gas,
electric,
and steam. The potential major consequence of the strike to the city
is
longer response times for repairs. The last Con Ed strike was in 1983
and
lasted for nine weeks.

Also, another union that represents some 15,000 New York City Verizon
employees may go on strike at 12:01 AM on August 3. The union and
Verizon
are currently in negotiations. The strike would include Verizon
telecom only
(i.e. landlines) and not Verizon wireless. Verizon may bring in
workers from
across the U.S. if needed, but all non-essential work will stop and
there
may be a delayed response time for repairs. The last Verizon strike
was in
2003 and lasted for three weeks.
