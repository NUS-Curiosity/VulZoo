Damn...its kind of out-dated since its a wiki, probably would of got 
updated a fair few more times, from the sounds of things it looks like 
you guys must of made some real progress.

Its blowing my mind reading the article, its very difficult to 
understand the A5 algo and what you guys are doing in order to break it.

I think in terms of Intercepting communications, It might just be easier 
trojaning phones to relay sent SMS to a 3rd party (invisibly), Chewing 
up peoples credit mysteriously hehe... Or wait till some badass releases 
a full blown all-in-one interception and decryption device (ohhh yeah 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$)
