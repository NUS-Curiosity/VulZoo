BA-Con 2008 CALL FOR PAPERS

    BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The first annual BA-Con applied
    technical security conference - where the eminent figures in the
    international and South American security industry will get together
    and share best practices and technology - will be held in Buenos
    Aires on September 30 and October 1st. 2008. The most
    significant new discoveries about computer network hack attacks
    and defenses, commercial security solutions, and pragmatic real
    world security experience will be presented in a series of
    informative tutorials.

    The BA-Con meeting provides local and international researchers
    a relaxed, comfortable environment to learn from informative
    tutorials on key developments in security technology, and
    collaborate and socialize with their peers in one of South
    America's largest metropolises. All material will be translated
    into both Spanish and English.  Evening social activities will be 
    planned to provide personal networking opportunities.

    The BA-Con conference will also feature the availability of
    the Security Masters Dojo expert network security sensei
    instructors, and their advanced, and intermediate, hands-on
    training courses - featuring small class sizes and practical
    application exercises to maximize information transfer.

    We would like to announce the opportunity to submit papers,
    lightning talk proposals for selection by the international BA-Con
    technical review committee.

    Please make your paper proposal submissions before July 11th,
    2008.

    Some invited papers have been confirmed, but a limited number
    of speaking slots are still available. The conference is
    responsible for travel and accommodations for the speakers. If
    you have a proposal for a tutorial session then please email a
    synopsis of the material and your biography, papers and,
    speaking background to secwest08 [at] ba-con.com.ar . Only
    slides will be needed for the September paper deadline, full text
    does not have to be submitted - but will be accepted and
    translated on a best effort basis if available.

    The BA-Con 2008 conference consists of tutorials on
    technical details about current issues, innovative techniques
    and best practices in the information security realm. The
    audiences are a multi-national mix of professionals involved on
    a daily basis with security work: security product vendors,
    programmers, security officers, and network administrators. We
    give preference to technical details and new education for a
    technical audience.

    The conference itself is a single track series of presentations
    in a lecture theater environment. The presentations offer
    speakers the opportunity to showcase on-going research and
    collaborate with peers while educating and highlighting
    advancements in security products and techniques. The focus is
    on innovation, tutorials, and education instead of product
    pitches. Some commercial content is tolerated, but it needs to
    be backed up by a technical presenter - either giving a
    valuable tutorial and best practices instruction or detailing
    significant new technology in the products.

    Paper proposals should consist of the following information:
     1. Presenter, and geographical location (country of
        origin/passport) and contact info (e-mail, postal address,
        phone, fax).
     2. Employer and/or affiliations.
     3. Brief biography, list of publications and papers.
     4. Any significant presentation and educational
        experience/background.
     5. Topic synopsis, Proposed paper title, and a one paragraph
        description.
     6. Reason why this material is innovative or significant or an
        important tutorial.
     7. Optionally, any samples of prepared material or outlines
        ready.
     8. Will you have full text available or only slides?
     9. Please list any other publications or conferences where
        this material has been or will be published/submitted.
     10. Do you have any special demo or network requirements
        for your presentation?

    Please include the plain text version of this information in
    your email as well as any file, pdf, sxw, ppt, or html
    attachments.

    Please forward the above information to secwest08 [at]
    ba-con.com.ar to be considered for placement on the speaker
    roster, have your lightning talk scheduled.

    We would like to extend a special thanks to our local partners
    at Core Security Technologies, and the gracious sponsorship
    of Microsoft, and Symantec for making this event possible and
    letting us keep the registration fee lower in local currency
    while letting us cover the costs of international speakers.
