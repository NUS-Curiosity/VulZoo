to subscribe to the list, and I can assure you that it has degraded at a steady 
pace over time.  It's not worth your time to hang around.

If you want a moderated version of FD, there are some out there.  But the list 
itself was, is and always will be unmoderated.  After all, that's its raison 
d'etre.
