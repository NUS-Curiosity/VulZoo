I agree with G. Blogs are the best.

I use google alerts for terms and items of interest. Set an auto filter and
fwd to a pvt group setup on google.  So now I have an list of Security/
hacks and stuff like that for personal mining and monitoring.. takes a
little time to setup and  maintain is easy for closed loop of this sort and
its all free :)-

hope this helps..
