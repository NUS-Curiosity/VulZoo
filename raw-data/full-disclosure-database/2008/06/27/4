Subject: ICANN and IANAâ€™s domains hijacked by Turkish hacking group

Hello,

The official domains of ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers, and IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
were hijacked earlier today, by the NetDevilz Turkish hacking group
which also hijacked Photobucket's domain on the 18th of June.
