  2007/07/26   n.runs asks for feedback and if the problem has been patched
  2007/07/26   Jscape replies "We do not have a release date yet for this
               task"
  2007/07/26   n.runs asks whether they can offer a estimate when the patch
               will be available
  2007/07/26   Jscape answers again "We do not have a release date yet for
this
               task"
  2008/02/19   n.runs requests a statement to be used in the advisory as
there
               seems to be no intention to patch and argues "you deem this 
               problem as low yet it renders the *secure connection*
insecure."
  2008/02/20   Jscape promises to "continue to look into this issue and
notify 
               you when a patch is available.      
  2008/02/25   n.runs notifies Jscape that an advisory will be released by
the 
               end of the week if they do not patch the flaw n.runs reported

               roughly 2 years ago.
               "Given the long time this has already been reported
(12/2006), 
               and the criticality of this issue, I would expect a patch to
be 
               ready by the end of the week. If the patch is not available
until
               the end of this week (29.02.2008) I'll proceed with the
advisory"  
  2008/02/29   Jscape notifies n.runs that the flaw has been patched
  2008/06/01   n.runs verifies the patch and confirms that Man in the Middle
is 
               not longer possible if the user does not accept the new key. 
               n.runs however recommends that Jscape warns the users of the 
               security implications of a new SSH Host key rather then
simply 
               displaying "New Host key".
