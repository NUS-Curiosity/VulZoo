I'm quite sure that if Gadi Evron had said it, it would *not* have made CNN,
and the intelligence agencies would *not* have him arrested, because they'd
understand it was a *joke*.  To actually get yourself arrested, you need to
say something like "I have a bomb" while actually standing *in an airport*.

There's 2 things you should do:

1) Go read Bruce Schneier's blog, especially the annual "Movie Plot Threat"
contest, and see what you're still allowed to joke and comment about without
getting hassled in the slightest.

2) Go get some treatment for whatever mental condition is causing your
obsession with intelligence agencies.
