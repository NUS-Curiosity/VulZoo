Oh, hm, right. But either way, the plausible deniability is provided
only by that mechanism, not through changing the keys after each
message. That's only the mechanism used to recover the security of the
algorithm after key disclosure. It's the typical cryptographic type of
proof if authenticity which is executed in a way which is only ever
trustworthy to the recipient, so the recipient cannot prove anything to
others with it.
