There's unmoderated on one hand and then your constant annoying tripe on
another. I could brush your stupid rantings off if they happened once or

never mind, you're going in the trash filter anyway, it's a waste of time
feeding you. If you're willing to meet up for a "face-to-face" as you put
it, then bring it on. Pick your date, and I'm sure it will be an interesting
discussion...
