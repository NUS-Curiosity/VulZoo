Absolutely. As Peter mentioned, that's called a scrambler, but you have different things to do on
that front: Encryption, reshaping (like, making your voice sound like a child/woman/etc), etc.

I'm pretty sure an alsa (sorry, no windows here) audio encryption/decryption plugin could be
written, and have that mic/speak interface be used by skype.
