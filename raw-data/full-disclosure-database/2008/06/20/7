Subject: How to encrypt voice skype calls?

That' s a very interesting point...

Would be possible, somehow, to make a software that encrypt skype calls 
"independently" from skype encryption?

Something like detecting the audio sample and enciphering it before are 
sent to the ip channel and decrypted before are received by the skype 
application?
