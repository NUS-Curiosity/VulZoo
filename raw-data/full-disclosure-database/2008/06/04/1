Subject: CSIS-RI-0003: Multiple buffer overflow
	vulnerabilities in HP ActiveX

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in HP Software

 

Hewlett-Packard (HP) is the world's largest PC dealer. According to IDC,
HP shipped 14.7 million units worldwide, a 23.3 percent year-over-year
growth and a 19 percent market share. 

 

PC's and laptops from HP are often shipped with preinstalled software
running on Microsoft Windows. The software is designed so the end-user
can keep drivers and HP software automatically updated. This is done
through a ActiveX plugin for Microsoft Internet Explorer.

 

CSIS have discovered multiple high-risk vulnerabilities in several parts
of that specific software. The affected component are found preinstalled
on a broad range of HP equipment but are also installed when a end user
visits HP webpage in order to access software updates such as
applications, drivers and firmware for multiple HP products.

 

We have discovered eight different vulnerabilities of which five should
be considered highly critical since they allow remote code execution.

 

At least five of these vulnerabilities have been confirmed to work in a
typical drive-by scenario. All it takes to exploit is to lure a user
into visiting a hostile and specifically crafted website. The attack
could also be done through SQL and HTML injection. This would allow, if
the system is found vulnerable, to run arbitrary code and take complete
control of the system or at least with the privileges of the logged on
user. In order for this scenario to work it would only require one of
the affected ActiveX objects to be installed and Active scripting to be
enabled in Microsoft Internet Explorer, which it is by default.

 

The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Dennis Rand from CSIS
Security Group.

 

HP has released an advisory and update to address these vulnerabilities.
