*sigh* I can't take it anymore...

1. Answering to Spam just makes it worse for the list. Flame the troll on
his mail-address if you feel like, but please take the mailing list out of
the recp. or at least mark the answer as offtopic.
2. Just block xploitable@...il.com and everything is well...
3. Just let the troll have it's fun, eventually it will get bored someday
and stop spamming.
4. Don't feed the trolls.

Thanks
