======================
Vulnerability details: 
======================

The kernel of Solaris contains a vulnerability in the code that handles
SIOCSIPMSFILTER IOCTL requests. Exploitation of this vulnerability can
result in:

1) local denial of service attacks (system crash due to a kernel panic), or

   [ As all Solaris Zones (Containers) share the same kernel it is possible
   to crash the whole system (all Zones) even if the vulnerability is
   triggered in an unprivileged non-global zone. ]

2) local execution of arbitrary code at the kernel level (complete system 
   compromise)

   [ As all Solaris Zones (Containers) share the same kernel it is possible
   to escape from unprivileged non-global zones and compromise other non-
   global zones or the global zone. ]

The issue can be triggered by sending a specially crafted IOCTL request.


======================
Technical description:
======================

The following source code references are based on the kernel source code
available from http://www.opensolaris.org.

http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/
inet/ip/ip_multi.c:

static int
ip_set_srcfilter(conn_t *connp, struct group_filter *gf,
   struct ip_msfilter *imsf, ipaddr_t grp, ipif_t *ipif, 
   boolean_t isv4mapped)
{
[...]
 int i, err, insrcs, infmode, new_fmode;   <-- [1]
[...]
 insrcs = imsf->imsf_numsrc;   <-- [2]
[...]
 /* Make sure we can handle the source list */
 if (insrcs > MAX_FILTER_SIZE)   <-- [3] 
   return (ENOBUFS);
[...]
 fp->sl_numsrc = insrcs;		<-- [4]
 ilg->ilg_filter = fp;		<-- [5]
[...]
 l_copy(ilg->ilg_filter, new_filter);   <-- [6]
[...]
   
At [2] the user supplied value of "imsf->imsf_numsrc" gets assigned to 
"insrcs". The "imsf->imsf_numsrc" variable is of the type unsigned int 
(see [7] below) and "insrcs" is of the type signed int (see [1]). If 
the user supplied value of "imsf->imsf_numsrc" is a large integer 
"insrcs" gets a negative value.

http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/
netinet/in.h:

struct ip_msfilter {
 struct in_addr imsf_multiaddr;	   
 struct in_addr imsf_interface;	   
 uint32_t imsf_fmode;              
 uint32_t imsf_numsrc;  <-- [7]   
 struct in_addr imsf_slist[1];    
 };

If "insrcs" is negative the check at [3] can be bypassed. Later on the user
supplied data is used as a value for "ilg->ilg_filter" (see [4] and [5]). 
This "ilg->ilg_filter" value is then used as an argument for "l_copy" (see
[6]). This leads to a kernel memory corruption vulnerability because of an 
out-of-bounds write in "l_copy".
