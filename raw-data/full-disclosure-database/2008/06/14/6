Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in rdesktop may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

rdesktop is an open source Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/rdesktop       < 1.6.0                          >= 1.6.0

Description
===========

An anonymous researcher reported multiple vulnerabilities in rdesktop
via iDefense Labs:

* An integer underflow error exists in the function iso_recv_msg() in
  the file iso.c which can be triggered via a specially crafted RDP
  request, causing a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1801).

* An input validation error exists in the function
  process_redirect_pdu() in the file rdp.c which can be triggered via a
  specially crafted RDP redirect request, causing a BSS-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2008-1802).

* An integer signedness error exists in the function xrealloc() in
  the file rdesktop.c which can be be exploited to cause a heap-based
  buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1803).

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by enticing a user to
connect to a malicious RDP server thereby allowing the attacker to
execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All rdesktop users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/rdesktop-1.6.0"
