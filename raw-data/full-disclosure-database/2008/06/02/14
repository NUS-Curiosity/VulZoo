And what happens if it turns out the hackers wrote it in *English*? (so that
the average non-multilingual American can read it, presumably)

Or what if it's in Chinese or Arabic, but only to create a red herring
because the hackers are unemployed gits from an unfashionable section
of England?

And it's hardly the *biggest* scandal in infosec - if you think it is, you
haven't paid attention for the last few decades. There's been *lots* bigger
scandals.

Do you have any *hard* evidence that it's anything *other* than the usual
"refusal to comment on an ongoing investigation"?
