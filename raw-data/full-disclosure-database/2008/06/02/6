Immunity, Inc. proudly presents: IMMUNITY DEBUGGER 1.6

This release we are introducing the most requested feature since the
release of ID 1.0 in the form of automatic symbol downloading.

In the script department we included two awesome new scripts: tredll and
findloop. Yes, you read that correctly, we have implemented dominator
trees for your coverage analysis pleasure and you are now able to detect
loops inside functions.

Immunity Debugger 1.6 delivers more stability and fixes a lot of known
issues. For example the old AddKnowledge/PostAnalysis bug is gone and
the land of hooking is all happiness. Check the Changelog below for more
details.

For the next release we are working on variables and structure, so stay
tuned!
