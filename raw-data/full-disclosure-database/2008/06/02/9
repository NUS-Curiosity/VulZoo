Subject: Re: Metasploit - Hack ?

Looks like someone is doing ARP poisoning at the ISP level. The actual 
metasploit.com server(s) are untouched, but someone is still managing to 
MITM a large portion of the incoming traffic. To make things even more 
fun, its cooinciding with a DoS attack (syn floods) on most of the open 
services.

If you are worried about the the Metasploit Framework source code being 
MITM'd during SVN checkouts, use the SSL version of the SVN tree:

$ svn co https://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/
