I want to know the language of the attackers, the world is waiting.

This is the biggest scandal in infosec that the language of the attackers
hasn't been publically released.

All the best,

You guys leave yourself open to verbal attacks with your stupidity of
not caring what language the attackers used. I think the key part of
the story is what the language and country is of the attackers. Wait,
it'll be the chinese, and china... since thats America's number one
scape goat cyber enemy. The secret service told University of Arizona
not to release the language of the attackers, until its been OK'd by
bush etc that they can fabricate that china done it, to further the
U.S's cyber political agenda.
