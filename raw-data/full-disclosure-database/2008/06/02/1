n3td3v Troll,
 
What's $80 to a high-caliber security researcher like yourself?
 
I bet it gets a lot of hits and has the potential to be at the top of the 60,000 google results for n3td3v.
 
How about n3td3vtrolling.com?
 
What about n3td3v.net -- is that your site?
 
All the best,
 
ghsec

No one is going to pay $80 for it, you may as well give it to me for free ;)
