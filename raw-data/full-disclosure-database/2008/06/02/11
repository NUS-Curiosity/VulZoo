Subject: Re: Metasploit - Hack ?

Problem solved. Someone is ARP poisoning the IP address of the router on which the www.metasploit.com server resides. 
I hardcoded an ARP entry for the real router and that seems to solve the MITM issue. It doesn't help the other 250 servers 
on that network, but thats an issue for the ISP to resolve. I included a traffic sample of the ARP poisoning below, if anyone
is interested:
