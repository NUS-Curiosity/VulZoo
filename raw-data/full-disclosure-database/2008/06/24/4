4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Motion, which can
be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within
the "read_client()" function in webhttpd.c. This can be exploited to
cause a stack-based buffer overflow by sending a specially crafted
request to the HTTP control interface.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but 
requires that the Motion HTTP control interface is enabled.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 3.2.10.1.
