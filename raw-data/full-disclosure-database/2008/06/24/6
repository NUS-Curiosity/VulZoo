Subject: Re: The Extended HTML Form attack revisited

Updated the paper with a table of ports that are blocked for each browser:
http://tinyurl.com/5d88ll

The results show that Firefox and Safari block exactly the same ports,
while Opera makes use of its list of ports.
Internet Explorer blocks only 6 ports.

The blog post describes how I did this in detail:
http://enablesecurity.com/2008/06/23/which-ports-do-web-browsers-block/
or http://tinyurl.com/3oltlq

Involves javascript and a packet capture.
