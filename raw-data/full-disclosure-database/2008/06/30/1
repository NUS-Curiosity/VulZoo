Subject: Save Gary Mckinnon

Gary Mckinnon is going to be locked away for 64 years for doing a default
password scan of the U.S military.

We need to save this guys life, yes he was stupid, yes he was dumb, yes he
shouldn't have done it.

He is a weirdo who tried to find out about UFO research within military
ranks, should we send Gary Mckinnon away the same as a suicide bomber
terrorist?

The U.S military are going to make an example of this man, an example that
is unjust, we need to save Gary, save Gary... save Gary!

All the best,

n3td3v
