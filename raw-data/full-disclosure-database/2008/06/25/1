Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IBM Java Development Kit
(JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE), resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The IBM Java Development Kit (JDK) and the IBM Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the IBM Java platform.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin      < 1.5.0.7                    >= 1.5.0.7
                                                          *>= 1.4.2.11
  2  dev-java/ibm-jre-bin      < 1.5.0.7                    >= 1.5.0.7
                                                          *>= 1.4.2.11
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Because of sharing the same codebase, IBM JDK and JRE are affected by
the vulnerabilities mentioned in GLSA 200804-20.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All IBM JDK 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.5.0.7"

All IBM JDK 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.4.2.11"

All IBM JRE 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jre-bin-1.5.0.7"

All IBM JRE 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jre-bin-1.4.2.11"
