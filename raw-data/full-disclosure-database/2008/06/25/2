Subject: [BMSA 2008-07] Format string vulnerability in 5th
	street

BLUE MOON SECURITY ADVISORY 2008-07
===================================


:Title: Format string vulnerability in 5th street (Hot Step, High Street 5)
:Severity: Critical
:Reporter: Blue Moon Consulting, superkhung
:Products: 5th street and derived clients
:Fixed in: --


Description
-----------

5th street is a massively multiplayer online dance game produced by
Snail Game and distributed in countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and
Vietnam under different names High Street 5, Hot Step.

5th street contains a format string vulnerability in its
``dx8render.dll`` module. Before a chat message is rendered in a
balloon, this message is used as a format string in a call to
``vsnwprintf`` function.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely and instantly crash
other players' clients. If carefully exploited, this will also lead to
arbitrary code execution on the target machine.

Workaround
----------

There is no workaround.

Fix
---

Customers are advised to contact your local game distributor in order to
obtain a proper fix.
