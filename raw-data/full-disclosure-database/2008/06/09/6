Subject: Full Disclosure - GSC Privilege / Authentication
	Bypass Exploit

Discovered Exploit: 06-05-2008

Vulnerable Software Title: GSC
Vulnerable Version: <= 2067
Severity: CRITICAL
Website: http://www.getgsc.com
Reported to vendor: Yes
Actively exploited: Yes

Exploit Discovery
------------------

I was analyzing packets for an application of my own to figure out an 
issue with my own protocol when I noticed I was receiving packets that 
looked similar to that of IRC, so I decided to take a break from my own 
project and figure out what application it was. I noticed it was the 
voice communication and chat program called GSC. Since I was bored I 
figured I would poke around at some of these packets.

First I logged on to my own channel as an administrator and kicked a 
friend of mine from the chat channel while recording packets. After 
capturing that packet I sent him an application to send raw packets over 
a specific socket and told him to send that to the server while he did 
not have administrator rights. Immediately after sending the packet he 
was disconnected from the channel because he was kicked. We discovered 
that the administration system's authentication is done completely 
client side and the server only sends a message to the client saying if 
the client has administrator rights to the channel, but the server 
doesn't check these rights if any administrator command is received.

The Exploit
------------

1.) Log on to GSC with a valid user account
2.) Join your own channel
3.) Record packets that are sent/received to/from GSC
4.) Kick a kind friend from your channel
5.) Stop capturing packets
6.) Modify this packet to reflect who you want to kick

The packet for kicking a user looks something like this:

NOTICE <user> :KICK <channel id> :<kick message>

The user is the name of the user
The channel ID is the same number used in a gsc://join:1 link
The kick message is a string <= 15 characters

Software Implementation
------------------------

Write a program that simply requests you to type in a user, a channel 
ID, and a kick message. Format the text to reflect the above example for 
the way the kick command is and encode it using UTF-8. Append the packet 
with 0x0A to show where the end of the command is. Hook your application 
to GSC and determine the socket ID of it's current connection and 
forward your packet through it's socket to the server.

Additional Information
-----------------------

The above information may be adapted to fit any administrator command 
including those used to completely kick and ban users from GSC as a 
whole, rather than just in a single channel. As is currently happening, 
users will use social engineering to get users to give out account 
information and personal information by impersonating a GSC staff member 
and claiming they will shut down the channel unless this information is 
released.

A C# implementation of the way packets are constructed and how to 
properly format them can be found here: http://pastebin.se/194837 or can 
be received by requesting it via email from moose@...erarium.net
