I'm still wondering if it was illegal for Robert Lemos and Neal
Krawetz to do what they did?

Was it legal?

I dropped out of university because of what was written, I still
suffer mental scares and I still haven't recovered.

I hadn't done anything illegal, but they used me as a guinea pig for
human research? Why didn't you test on animals instead of a real
persons life?

Do I have a legal case against Robert Lemos and Neal Krawetz?

Why haven't both of them even come on the mailing list to say sorry
now that its known everything they said was unfounded?

I'm just a young person with no money, I don't have it in me to take
big people to court to claim money.

Everyone i've spoke to said what they did was illegal, but I don't
know for sure.

If I wasn't a pissy young student with no money i'd prolly of sued them by now.

I don't know who Gobbles is and never did... yet they both wrote shit
about me and now its been proven how much shit is was.

All the best,

n3td3v
