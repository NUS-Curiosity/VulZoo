Hi netdev,

Plz to stop the mail list pollution. At first we agreed with your 
trolling cause theres nothing like working up the whitehat, but it 
has grown old.. and you just arent a good troll.

If you want to keep playing the game, you will certainly get 
publicly burned. You are not Andrew Wallace. We know who you are, 
where you live and in-turn, where your family resides.

If you want _those_ instant messenger convos published, your real 
location dropped and various other details spilled all over the 
public domain -- by all means keep posting.

>>From Russia with love,

crunkD!
