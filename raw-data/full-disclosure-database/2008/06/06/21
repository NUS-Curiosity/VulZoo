n3td3v is a serious security researcher not a troll.  n3td3v is a
whitehat and you should not say n3td3v is sitting on vulnerabilities.

Just because n3td3v had to drop out of school due to the many

n3td3v lives with parents?

Don't threaten n3td3v.  n3td3v already said "For the sake of the list,
shut the fuck up!"

Random bullshit n3td3v probably doesn't have time to reply to.

All the best with your misguided belief that people care who n3td3v is.

All the best,
