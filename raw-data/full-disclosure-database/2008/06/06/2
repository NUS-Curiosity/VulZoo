Subject: Microsoft RT Audio Codec, anyone has reversed it?

Hi all,

has anyone reversed the new Microsoft RT Audio Codec used by Microsoft 
Live Messenger and Office Communication Server?

It seems that in a world where free narrowband and wideband codec such 
as Speex are now available Microsoft preferred to reinvent the wheel and 
provide their own proprietary, closed source audio codec.

It's time to reverse engineer it!

I am sure that's plenty of nice bugs ;)
