4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in the Red Swoosh
client which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct
cross-site request forgery attacks and compromise a user's system.

The Red Swoosh client implements a web server listening on port
9421/TCP on the loopback interface for management commands.
Authorisation is restricted based on the HTTP "referer" header.
Requests with a "referer" header containing one of a number of
domains or no "referer" are fully authorised. By manipulating
the HTTP "referer", a malicious web page can cause files from
arbitrary URLs to be downloaded and executed.

The Red Swoosh client can be installed manually by visiting the
Akamai website. However, more interestingly, it can also be silently
installed by the Akamai Download Manager if a download requests Red
Swoosh should be used. Once installed, the service or application
will run on startup.

The malicious file to be downloaded and executed can potentially be
served by the Red Swoosh network alleviating any bandwidth issues on
the web server.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 3333.
