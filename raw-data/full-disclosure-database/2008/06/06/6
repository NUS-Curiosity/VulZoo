Robert Lemos doesn't give a fuck who I am.
I'm a lawful white hat who has broken no laws and I had absolutely
nothing to do with his website getting hacked.
When are you fools going to realise there is no interest in who n3td3v
is, the reason Robert Lemos wrote a news article about me was because
it had an interesting focus on keyboard typing forensics, I was just
the guinea pig for Neal Krawetz's experiment.

No I haven't been asked for an interview from any journalist, for the
simple fact there is no public interest.

I've never been to a security conference and probably never will,
everything is available to me already.
Going to a security conference isn't mission critical for me to stay
in the social cyber security loop.
