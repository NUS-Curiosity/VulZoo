Subject: MOCA 2008: a dream come true


Many hoped, few believed, the rumors conflicting, the souls aflame,  
cats and dogs sleeping together, but in the end we made it!

Four years after the celebration of the 10th birthday of Metro  
Olografix, at fans' request, the summer camp will come back to let us  
spend a few hot August days together again, among arrosticini and  
glasses of wine and swims and talks - oh my! - in neat little Pescara.

"Ardetec li cannilicchie!"

The second edition of the Metro Olografix Camp will take place August  
21st to 24th 2008, at the "ex Caserma Di Cocco" Park. MOCA is a hacker  
camp in north-European style, free admittance, open to all, to meet  
and have fun sharing information and knowledge.

Just like four years ago, it will be a chance to meet old and new  
friends, all those who populated the computer underground so far since  
that infamous 1994, ready to live it in the coming years, together  
with those who have only just begun peeking into a telematic world  
made increasingly more worrisome by technologic and legal implications.

See you in Pescara, you, your tent, your computer: to hack,  
experiment, play, chat, do whatever will ultimately send us thinking  
"once again, it was really worth it!" all the way back home.

The Call For Papers deadline is August 1st 2008: propose your thematic  
area, your activity, your talk. We'll be happy to help you do  
something for the event and, especially, for all who'll spend together  
four - we hope - unforgettable days of their lives.

Everyone's invited, see you in Pescara, to share experiences and  
knowledge in the spirit of pure hacker ethics.

Information wants to be free!
