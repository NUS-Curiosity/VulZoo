Hoi,
but in fact their businessmodel will fail,
if one would resell the decryptor.
alternatively (if got to much money) buy it and allow free download.

Hello,

The following is an OSINT analysis aiming to assist in tracking down
the malware authors behind GPcode who seem be to be building custom
decryptors, next to issuing a universal one which can be used to
decrypt anything ever encrypted by them.

Who's behind the GPcode ransomware? It's Russian teens with pimples,
using E-gold and Liberty Reserve accounts, running three different
GPcode campaigns, two of which request either $100 or $200 for the
decryptor, and communicating from Chinese IPs. Here are all the
details regarding the emails they use, the email responses they sent
back, the currency accounts, as well their most recent IPs used in the
communication.
