Although I agree with you in that it looks like the flaw really isn't
one, the raw credentials are still getting sent over the Internet over
HTTP, rather than HTTPS. Given an insecure network (wifi, anybody?),
it shouldn't be difficult to grab the authentication credentials if
you know someone is logging in. Or is logged in.

Bonus points for you if the user has a weak password which can be
looked up in a rainbow table.
