Subject: Checkinterface for weak SSL and SSH-Keys

For i still don't know any public check for weak SSL-Certs and
SSH-Keys, i set up two checks for weak ssh- and ssl-keys, implementing
the most common blacklists.

http://serversniff.net/sslcert.php and http://serversniff.net/sshreport.php

Maybe this is helping those not able to cope with the currently
available shellscripts to check their infrastructure for the flaw.
