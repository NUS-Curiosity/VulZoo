hey all,

it's that time of the month again!

so we present to you : DC4420 June @ the Glassblower:

- Wargames!

    The Winning team will be presenting 'how they did it' - 
(note:everyone should buy them Guinness. Schwag will be awarded as well)

- Last-minute hastily-put-together presentation on locks.
   autom8ton - bring your locks/picks and we'll have a workshop afterwards.

-  New speaker! Alex talking about Social engineering

- 5 minute slot - a demo by Richard. (demo is such a lovely term for a 
talk, could be anything!)

- MM will be calling for participation in an "art" project. If you have 
camera equipment, film making skills, editing skills, music/dubbing 
skills, please step forward! This is going to be fun, and to do with 
RFID. It's entitled "PARFID: Passive Aggressive RFID. RFIDIOts fight back!".

Also, please get in touch with me or alien if you would like to talk at 
the July meeting, June is now full :-)

There will be workshops after the talks - please bring locks + picks if 
you have them (and are legally entitled to carry them!) :P
