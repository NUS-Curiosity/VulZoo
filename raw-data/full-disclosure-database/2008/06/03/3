DEFCON 16 Updates!

As DEFCON 16 gets closer its awesome powers, much like a kraken summoned by
Dethklok, continues to grow.

How do you become friends with a kraken? You get to know it. Have a beer.
Below are various way you can get involved with DEFCON 16 contests and
events. The Call for Papers is closed, and selections are being announced
all this week, so it is a bit too late to speak, but not too late to get
involved.

New for DEFCON 16

Buzzword Survivor:
New Contest for DEFCON 16.  Check out discussion of this contest as it
develops at https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=352

Hardware Hacking Village:
To state it most simply, it's a way to give all the Defcon attendees that
like electronics a place to play. It's also intended to be a place for
everyone that thinks "Wow! That looks cool! I wish I knew how to do that!".
It's also going to be the headquarters for Joe Grand (kingpin) so he can
talk about hacking past badges and such. It should be a great place to hang
out. Find more info on the forums at
https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=9295.

The Race to Zero:
This one is generating a whole lot of buzz in the press. The Race to Zero
involves contestants being given a sample set of viruses and malcode to
modify and upload through the contest portal. The portal passes the modified
samples through a number of antivirus engines and determines if the sample
is a known threat. The first team or individual to pass their sample past
all antivirus engines undetected wins that round. Each round increases in
complexity as the contest progresses. Further details are available here:
http://www.racetozero.net/

And let's not forget the Gringo Challenge, DEF CON B0TS, Lockpick village, a
new Hardware Hacking Village, and more. Check it all out at:
