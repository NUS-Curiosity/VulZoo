Subject: Anyone had ever got in contact with Symbian and
	Nokia security?

I was looking for security contacts at Symbian and Nokia but was not 
able to quickly identify to which report security issue related to their 
platform.

Does anyone already established a relationship with their security 
vulnerability representative and have the right contacts?

Bye,
