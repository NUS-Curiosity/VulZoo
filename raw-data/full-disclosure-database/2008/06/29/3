Subject: Mobile phone agenda time for security community

Its time to shift to mobile security, i'm sick of everything else, its just
repeats of everything on the mailing list.

We need a new focus guys, let's look at mobile, radio frequency, chip,
hardware hack technologies.

That's the biggest prime concern for the government that hack vectors are
going to move into the mobile, radio frequency, chip, hardware side of
things, because its what the government and the intelligence services rely
on to bug people and / or to communicate with each other.

Don't make it a vulnerability for just say for the iPhone, its got to be a
hack thats compatible on multi networks, model devices to make it hardcore.

Nobody gives a fuck about iPhone jailbreaks like c0ntex did, thats gay.

All the best,
