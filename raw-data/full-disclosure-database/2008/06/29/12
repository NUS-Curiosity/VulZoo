BA-Con 2008 CALL FOR PAPERS

   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The first annual BA-Con applied
   technical security conference - where the eminent figures in the
   international and South American security industry will get together
   and share best practices and technology - will be held in Buenos
   Aires on September 30 and October 1st. 2008. The most
   significant new discoveries about computer network hack attacks
   and defenses, commercial security solutions, and pragmatic real
   world security experience will be presented in a series of
   informative tutorials.

   The BA-Con meeting provides local and international researchers
   a relaxed, comfortable environment to learn from informative
   tutorials on key developments in security technology, and
   collaborate and socialize with their peers in one of South
   America's largest metropolises. All material will be translated
   into both Spanish and English.  Evening social activities will be
   planned to provide personal networking opportunities.

   The BA-Con conference will also feature the availability of
   the Security Masters Dojo expert network security sensei
   instructors, and their advanced, and intermediate, hands-on
   training courses - featuring small class sizes and practical
   application exercises to maximize information transfer.

   We would like to announce the opportunity to submit papers,
   lightning talk proposals for selection by the international BA-Con
   technical review committee.

   Please make your paper proposal submissions before July 11th,
   2008.

   Some invited papers have been confirmed, but a limited number
   of speaking slots are still available. The conference is
   responsible for travel and accommodations for the speakers. If
   you have a proposal for a tutorial session then please email a
   synopsis of the material and your biography, papers and,
   speaking background to secwest08 [at] ba-con.com.ar . Only
   slides will be needed for the September paper deadline, full text
   does not have to be submitted - but will be accepted and
   translated on a best effort basis if available.

   The BA-Con 2008 conference consists of tutorials on
   technical details about current issues, innovative techniques
   and best practices in the information security realm. The
   audiences are a multi-national mix of professionals involved on
   a daily basis with security work: security product vendors,
   programmers, security officers, and network administrators. We
   give preference to technical details and new education for a
   technical audience.

   The conference itself is a single track series of presentations
   in a lecture theater environment. The presentations offer
   speakers the opportunity to showcase on-going research and
   collaborate with peers while educating and highlighting
   advancements in security products and techniques. The focus is
   on innovation, tutorials, and education instead of product
   pitches. Some commercial content is tolerated, but it needs to
   be backed up by a technical presenter - either giving a
   valuable tutorial and best practices instruction or detailing
   significant new technology in the products.

   Paper proposals should consist of the following information:
    1. Presenter, and geographical location (country of
       origin/passport) and contact info (e-mail, postal address,
       phone, fax).
    2. Employer and/or affiliations.
    3. Brief biography, list of publications and papers.
    4. Any significant presentation and educational
       experience/background.
    5. Topic synopsis, Proposed paper title, and a one paragraph
       description.
    6. Reason why this material is innovative or significant or an
       important tutorial.
    7. Optionally, any samples of prepared material or outlines
       ready.
    8. Will you have full text available or only slides?
    9. Please list any other publications or conferences where
       this material has been or will be published/submitted.
    10. Do you have any special demo or network requirements
       for your presentation?

   Please include the plain text version of this information in
   your email as well as any file, pdf, sxw, ppt, or html
   attachments.

   Please forward the above information to secwest08 [at]
   ba-con.com.ar to be considered for placement on the speaker
   roster, have your lightning talk scheduled.

   We would like to extend a special thanks to our local partners
   at Core Security Technologies, and the gracious sponsorship
   of Microsoft, and Symantec for making this event possible and
   letting us keep the registration fee lower in local currency
   while letting us cover the costs of international speakers.

cheers,
