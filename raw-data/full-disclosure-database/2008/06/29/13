Classic Gadi Evron Gayness! He's currently trolling the I.S.P community via
NANOG mailing list.

"Because the Internet is not governemned, common misbelief aside. It's a
mess of capitalism and anarchism. In fact, The Internet is the only
functioning anarchu."

Hilarious TROLLING effort by Gadi, keep up the good work.

All the best,
