Synopsis
========

Insecure filename usage in cbrPager may allow for the remote execution
of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

cbrPager is a comic book pager.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-misc/cbrpager      < 0.9.17                         >= 0.9.17

Description
===========

Mamoru Tasaka discovered that filenames of the image archives are not
properly sanitized before being passed to decompression utilities like
unrar and unzip, which use the system() libc library call.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open an archive with a
specially crafted filename, resulting in arbitrary code execution with
the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All cbrPager users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-misc/cbrpager-0.9.17"

References
==========
