Yay! I get a landy! Or perhaps I'll just stick to spending a few hours a
month shoving leaflets through doors and getting chased down garden
paths by small yappy dogs; which is how I seem to get the most contact
to my constituents.

Perhaps I can try and get these mysterious brutes to help Mrs Nuggins at
number 42 who's having no end of trouble with her bins, instead of doing
the incredibly important job of monitoring FD twenty four hours a day,
just in case someone trips up and accidentally reveals their location,
or that they're a duly elected councillor for the King's Hedges ward for
Cambridge City Council. Oh, damn. I think I hear the sound of the
helicopters overhead now, my political career is over.

Seriously though, can I keep the land rover?
