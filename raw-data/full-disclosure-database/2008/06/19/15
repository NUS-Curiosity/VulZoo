That state is now saved elsewhere and managed through the "Applications" 
tab of the preferences dialog (URI schemes are mixed in with content types, 
ugly). If there's no entry in the Applications tab it should be asking you 
what to do; when it asks you can tell it not to ask any more, after which 
you'll have to use the preferences dialog to change it.
