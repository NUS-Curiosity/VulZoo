Subject: Re: Skype chat encryption with OTR

Are you willing to trust skype encryption for your own confidential 
material?

It obviously depend on the risk context and trust scenario.

I would never send any confidential material over a skype chat but only 
over a channel where i have independent control over the information 
encryption.

Would be nice to analyze some approach to make even "voice" of skype 
end-to-end encrypted with an independent encryption module (applying 
zrtp or other crypto technologies), even if this one could be much more 
difficult to be achieved.

Cheers
