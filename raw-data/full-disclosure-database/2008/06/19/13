mmm yes but respect STU-III (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STU-III) to 
talk to the Whitehouse would be better to use a SCIP compatible device 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIP).

In both case the keys are owned but NSA, better than skype? :)

Or we could use some terrorist-oriented technology like steganography 
with RTP!

Even if at the end of the story zrtp (zfoneproject.com) it's the best 
choice cause Zimmermann have done a great work and he's a very hard 
crypto guys with political motivation!

And be careful, do not trust the Cisco proposed DTLS-SRTP for voice 
encryption, it's a crap standard plenty of vulnerability and 
implementation complexity (http://zfoneproject.com/faq.html#ZRTP-vs-DTLS) .

We should all sustain ZRTP as a standard for voice encryption, it's like 
the past fight between PGP-OpenPGP/MIME and X509- S/MIME !
