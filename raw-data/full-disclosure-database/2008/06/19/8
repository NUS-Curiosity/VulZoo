Subject: Re: Skype chat encryption with OTR

Yeah its encrypted, Public AND Private keys are stored on Skype's server.
Although this is great, and provides the user with an encrypted 
conversation (voice or text) wherever he/she is in the world - it means 
all the keys are stored in 1 location and can be intercepted by either 
Skype or the feds heh...

 >> /end-to-end deniable encryption for Skype chat messages.

/There is no denying that an OTR Conversation has been encrypted.. Its 
because the private keys change ultra-frequently, and the keys are short 
lived that it provides the 'plausible deniability'

Even with OTR, theres no need to send your private conversations through 
skype's servers. You should use OTR with a trusted jabber server.
