You started it!!! I come on the full-disclosure mailing list with
serious topics about security and you or others twist it into a
personal attack or some other random bullshit about my integrity.

This was ment to be a thread about aviation security and
full-disclosure mailing list never fails to turn it into a flame fest
of pre pubescent comment bashing each other instead of saying
something constructive about security.

Btw, I run the biggest google security group of its kind what have you got?
