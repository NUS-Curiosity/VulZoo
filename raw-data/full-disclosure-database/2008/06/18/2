Subject: Skype chat encryption with OTR

For all you OS X guys that like skype because of it's usability but are 
concerned about the lacks of and end-to-end message encryption system (a 
plug-in for skype).

Today i tried:

#1 Get and install Adium (I suggest portable adium in a separated 
filevault volume)
    http://www.freesmug.org/portableapps/adium/

#2 Get and install Skype plug-in for Adium

#3 Enable OTR encryption on Skype chat (trough Adium client)
     http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/

Et voilà, end-to-end deniable encryption for Skype chat messages.

The funny thing is that you can see the encrypted chat and key exchange 
on standard Skype messaging window, so you can verify yourself that all 
stuff are enciphered.

Now i feel myself more comfortable and will sleep +10minutes each night.

Cheers

Fabio/naif
