First of all, I said "before I got the iPhone with the 'airplane'  
mode"  I'd forget to turn off my phone alot, i'd throw it in my  
briefcase when I'd go through security, and forget it's in there.   
Heck I've seen people actually been able to receive calls on their  
crackberries while in mid flight.  Not that they answered them.  But  
I've seen the phones ring.  I have an iPhone now, I place it in  
airplane mode when I get on a flight.

There are actually studies going on RIGHT NOW to see if phones can be  
allowed to be used during flights by the FCC/FAA, and in other  
countries as well.

Personally I hope this doesn't go through, as I don't want to be  
sitting next to some dude during my 100,000+ miles I fly a year to  
hear yacking the whole flight.

yes, It was a joke.  Sorry if it was in bad taste.
