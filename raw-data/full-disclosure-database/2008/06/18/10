Subject: Joel Esler comment on Sans ISC podcast

Joel Esler said he doesn't switch his phone off on flights and that
anyone who is on a plane with him should watch out.

Is this some kind of dry american humour that i'm missing here or is
that not even funny?

I'm asking the TSA to listen to his comments made in audio format and
decide if this individual should be banned from flying.

All the best,
