several european carriers now allow mobiles to be used in flight. - i'm
bothered more by the person inanely chatting during the flight than
security issues - hopefully the hold luggage has been properly scanned
anyway - or a dumb timer would do just as well as a mobile.

PS lots of people dont turn their phones off. lots of people talk
on their phones before going through customs etc.
