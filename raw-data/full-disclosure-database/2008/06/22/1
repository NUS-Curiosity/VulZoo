I'm looking at the truth of the situation here, Joel Esler is a white
American so he gets to crack jokes about keeping his phone on during
flights and that people should watch out when being on a flight with
him, if it was someone from another country who said the same thing,
by now they'd be arrested by now.

Trust me, if someone of Middle East origin had a security pod cast and
had said the same thing it would probably be on CNN, and the CIA, MI6
would have them arrested by now, or at least have operational officers
keeping close tabs on him.

Since its Joel Esler and he is a white American, let's just call it a
joke, let's giggle along with it!!!

All the best,
