Good for you, but you do realize that the bug was reported to 
the vendor in May 2007.  You were just 8 months too late... 

But since you seem so eager to get some attention, I give you 
the credit of dropping a POC for an unpatched vuln into FD without 
even trying to contact the vendor... Well done !
