i dont need a group to prove myself, as apparently you do.  are you
the kid that stands with a big group on the playground and picks a
fight with the small kid?  except you are the insignificant one.

no one cares about either one of us, and especially about you.  if i
didnt believe in privacy, as you apparently dont, i'd fwd all the
emails that people send me about "n3td3v is an idiot, you are SO
right!"

but i value pplz privacy.  go fuck yourself child.

i again, wash my hands of you.  im done with you.  you will never
learn.  i recommend everyone be done.  if i am hanging it up, all of
you should too.

please no one respond to him ever.
