NETDOVE, 
Obviously you have no idea how a rootkit works much less how to defend
against them, your rants make no sense.

Bullshit.

There is nothing to patch.

It needs to be presented at conferences, exactly because people will
play ostrich and stick their heads in the sand and pretend it can't
happen to them, and do nothing about it until someone shows them, "yes
it can happen" and here is how....

Which is exactly why we've accepted this talk. We've all known this is
a possibility for years, but I haven't seen significant motion forward
on this until we announced this talk. So in a fashion, this has
already helped make people more realistic about their infrastructure
devices. And the discussions, and idea interchange that will happen
between the smart folks at the conference will undoubtedly usher forth
other related issues and creative solutions.  Problems don't get fixed
until you talk about them.

Shut up you fucking fag, you just want this presentation given so you
can sell more tickets and become rich you complete dick head, you
don't care about "related issues and creative solutions" all you care
about is people buying a £1100 ticket to line your pocket with to go
sit on a yacht for the rest of the year, and to hell with national
security or the consequences.

What you've done is very clever, you're exploiting the security scene
to become a rich fat bastard, and you've researched the facts into
"idea interchange that will happen between the smart folks at the
conference will undoubtedly usher forth
other related issues and creative solutions.  Problems don't get fixed
until you talk about them." to defend your money making scheming endeavors.

I wouldn't say this presentation is blackmail, but its as close to
blackmail as you're gonna get without breaking the law.

You are one son of a bitch, who I don't respect for making money while
our national security suffers.

By the way i'm pretty confident the British authorities are pulling
the presentation, so have that cake and eat it mother fucker.

I'm sorry for the bad language but this is just frustrating at how
stupid you are just so you can become a rich man.

All the best,

n3td3v
