Funnily enough, I noticed this yesterday when looking for some info on
Virtual Server. Google has ~ 45,000 hits for wowyeye.cn/m.js but only
a small minority are marked as malicious sites..

Other pages on redmondmag.com - for example
http://redmondmag.com/columns/article.asp?EditorialsID=1166&page=3 -
reference www.qiqigm.com which is currently alive and attempting MDAC
and RealPlayer exploits
