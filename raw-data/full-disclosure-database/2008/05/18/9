Subject: Boycott EUSecWest 2008

Everyone should boycott EUSecWest until they pull the Cisco IOS
rootkit presentation from the programme.

Its likely the UK government will step in and stop the presentation
anyway, but if EUSecWest want to have any respect or dignity they will
pull the presentation before the government need to step up on stage
and pull the plug from the projector.

The UK government will embarrass you if they need to, but it would be
good to stop the presentation of your own accord and prove you're not
just in it for the money and that you actually give a damn about
security.

All the best,

n3td3v
