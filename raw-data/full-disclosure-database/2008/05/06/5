These sorts of emails, while perhaps very accurate, only encourage a
barrage of emails concerning our apparent involvement in a large
governmental conspiracy and/or our "script kiddiness." I think ignoring
such emails from netdev are in order, tempting as they are to respond to.

More importantly than any of this is how great it is for vulnerability
research.  Makes it much easier to encode shell code, etc.  Plus the
msfpescan features are bad assery.  Of course, n3td3v has no ideas what
these features are for so he thinks it's a script kiddy tool.

Andrew, you're so predictably boring... is there not something you have
expertise on that you can talk about?

Obviously you're not in the right place on this list.

There's 2 really great uses for metasploit for white hat security guys:

1) When you're handed a /16 or two during a pen test, and need a quick way
to poke a whole bunch of machines for a vulnerability, it's hard to
roll-your-own
exploit tester as fast as you can chinese-menu one in metasploit.

2) It's a *great* tool for impressing on a PHB just how easy it is to
launch
an exploit for something at one of the unsecured systems he's responsible
for.
