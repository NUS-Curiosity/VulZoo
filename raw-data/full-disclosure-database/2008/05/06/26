Christ, this is ridiculous

You have certainly got some serious issues. Are there not some idiots down
your local pub you can go and pretend you're hard to? I am sick of my
working day being wasted with your constant inane tripe. You're about to be
filtered, and that takes a lot for me, so don't bother firing back your
usual brand of crap cos I won't get it.
