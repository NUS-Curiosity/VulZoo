Hello,

I don't care who's right or wrong, neither I have any side in your PERSONAL
exchange of emails, but I have the following filters:

from: n3td3v
to: n3td3v
contains: n3td3v

all this is going to trash.

I would really appreciate that all emails like this could include the word
"n3td3v" in the end, its too time consuming to be adding new filters
everyday.

Thanks in advance,
AA
