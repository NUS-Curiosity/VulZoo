n3td3v,

Blogging for ZDNet is a part time job that pays the bills, unlike yourself,
some of us have the need to have jobs... you know, families to support,
respectable things like that?

My full time job is as a security analyst/researcher.  I've presented at the
last three Black Hats, ToorCon, all over.  I'd say I have a good deal more
respect than you do.  So, I'm not media, I just get paid on the side for
it.  I doubt that HD thinks I'm a moron.

I know you've got some ridiculous hate for the security conferences, and you
can think whatever you want, but you make yourself out to be a moron every
single day on FD, so whatever you say about me, I'm sure will not be held in
high regard.

Nate
