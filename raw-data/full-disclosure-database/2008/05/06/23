Subject: Re: Microsot DID DISCLOSE potential Backdoor


more importantly-- 
this is just another symptom that 'Microsoft makes Windows run slower over time' to force us to buy a new version'.
 
If the software is doing things-- that it wasn't designed (advertised) to do-- that by definition is called BLOATWARE.
 
It's time for MS to make performance _JUST_ as important as security.
Performance is important-- I'm hoping that Microsoft wakes up one of these days and starts talking about the 'Software Performance Lifecycle'.
 
Personally; I'm sick and tired of MS forcing crapware / bloatware down our throats.
This software that you're talking about-- is just another symptom that MS doesn't give a crap about it's users.
