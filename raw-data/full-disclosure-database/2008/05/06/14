LOL. This is great. n3td3v is a douche, and his pseudo-trolls will probably
be over now as he again retracts into nothingness but thats not the best
part.

It proves netdev is not gobbles. LOLOL to all those expertz who presented
all those reasons why they were the same person. HAHA! You are wrong, you
faggots. Pages and pages of "research" that was "proving" they were the
same.

Wow.

Think of what you could have done with those hours you put in to that shit
you fucking nerd.. you could have seen a movie, gone on a date, seen what
the sun looks like.. but no. You hunched back, oil secreting,
too-close-of-a-hair-cut, know-nothing cock magnets are too busy worrying
about some technically inept teenager on some mailing list that you went all
sherlock holmes on his ass in order to discover who he was. You all fail at
life. I hope you die in a fire.
