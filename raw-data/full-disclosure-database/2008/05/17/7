Full-Disclosure,

I fully believe British Intelligence are the best in the world and
that they will pull the plug on this presentation without hesitation
before it gets to go ahead.

I don't see anyone disagreeing how wrong it is for this presentation
to go ahead as a business decision.

I know the national security boys at MI5 are listening, so I suggest
this gets priority and this presentation doesn't go ahead.

What I want is a high profile pulling the plug of this presentation to
act as a deterrent to any other security conferences across the world
who think they are going to capitalise through high risk
vulnerabilities as this one is.

I want UK government officials to walk on stage as this presnetation
is about to start, infront of the media, infront of everybody,
including the money makers who thought they were going to use this
presentation as a way to sell tickets and make money and put UK
national security at risk.

I don't want a behind the scenes pulling the plug of this
presentation, I want it to be high profile, infront of the worlds
media to show that in Britian we don't fuck about with crappy security
conferences trying to become rich by getting high risk talkers to come
to their security conference to guarantee a sell out and thousands of
pounds made, at a cost to UK national security.

I will be talking with my private contacts to try and get this to
happen, as many of you know I already had a grudge with EUSecWest
spamming the mailing lists, instead of buying advertisement banners on
websites, so the announcement of a IOS rootkit presentation is the
final insult to injury, and the UK national security boys are likely
to pull the plug on this without hesitation to make an example to
these security conference owners to say that national security becomes
before profit and how dare you try to profit and not giving a shit
about the consequences of this presentation.

Trust me and mark my words EUSecWest, you upset a lot of people
spamming the mailing lists, this is just the worst possible thing you
could have done to keep people on side, you've lost any respect I may
have had for your conference and I guarantee UK government officials
will pull the plug on your business venture of a security conference.

Blackhat conference with Michael Lynn was under the control of the
American authorities and they were light weight in response to what
was going on, trust me, the British authorities will be coming down a
lot tougher and won't be thinking twice about pulling this
presentation, but will do it on a grand scale infront of the media, to
send a clear signal that these security conferences and their money
making agenda isn't going to get in the way of our national security.

This is a subject I feel strongly and passionate about because if this
presentation went ahead it would fuck up a lot of ISPs and would put
national security at risk.

If the British authorites don't pull the plug on this presentation you
will have let your country down and let your British taxpayers down
who fund MI5 in the first place.

And its not just me saying this, ISPs are calling for this
presentation to be pulled as well.

All the best,

n3td3v
