Subject: Redmond Magazine SQL Injected by Chinese
	Hacktivists

Hello,

It appears that Redmond - The Independent Voice of the Microsoft IT
Community, formerly known as Microsoft Certified Professional Magazine
is currently flagged as a badware site, and third-party exploit
detection tools are also detecting internal pages as exploit hosting
ones, in this particular case Mal/Badsrc-A. Redmond Developer News and
Redmond Channel Partner Online are also affected.
