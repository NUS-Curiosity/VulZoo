Agreed,

You've got to remember though that a security conference is a
commercial venture, it makes business sense for this to be publically
announced at this security conference.

I think security conferences have become something that sucks as its
all become money making oriented and the people who run these things
don't really have security in mind, just the Â£ signs reflecting on
their eye balls.
