Just keep in mind, that *sometimes* you *do* want to give people a key to
the house/office/etc - for instance, if you're going on vacation, you'll
likely want to give a key to whoever is petsitting for you.

The important question is *why* is said person getting access, what the
risks and benefits are, and if there's other ways to achieve the goal (for
instance, you may not need to have somebody stop by to feed your fish if
one of those 7-day feeder blocks will work)...

When I suggested "Ask him if he'd give people keys to the office", the
*expected* response is "But the cleaning crews have keys.." or similar - which
lets you get the *discussion* going of who has what access and why...
