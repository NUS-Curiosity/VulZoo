"MoocherHunter Tool helps hunt down Wireless Moochers in Real Time

Singapore, May 20, 2008 -- ThinkSECURE Pte Ltd 
(www.securitystartshere.org) today announced the official public 
release of MoocherHunter, ThinkSECURE's free-for-end-user-use real-
time WiFi moocher/hacker tracking tool.

"We developed MoocherHunter with two key purposes in mind: first, to 
assist law-enforcement officers in hunting down unauthorized WiFi 
users in real time, and second, to enable any owner of an 802.11-
based wireless access point to identify whether an unauthorized 
person is using their access point and give them that same capability 
to hunt down those unauthorized users," said Mr. Julian Ho, 
ThinkSECURE's co-founder.

Completely designed from the ground up with purely in-house code, 
MoocherHunter was first demonstrated to SouthEast Asian law-
enforcement officials at a closed-door event in early 2008.

During developmental field tests in March 2008, a single ThinkSECURE 
employee armed with MoocherHunter and a directional antenna was able 
to isolate and geographically locate the physical location of a 
wireless moocher who was using a test access point.  The tests were 
done across different multi-storied-multi-tenanted residential and 
office environments and the results were obtained within an average 
of 30 minutes of initial detection and with a positional accuracy of 
as close as 2 meters.

"With MoocherHunter, the physical disconnect between the wireless 
network infrastructure and the wireless moocher or hacker, which has 
been used by various individuals as a shield to mask illicit 
activities involving wireless networks such as warez-downloading, 
illegal-file-sharing, seditious forum postings and so on, is no 
longer a defence," said Mr. Ho.

Because it is not based on fixed or statically-positioned hardware, 
MoocherHunter allows the user to move freely and walk towards the 
actual geographical location of the moocher/hacker. And of course, as 
part of the free OSWA-Assistant wireless auditing LiveCD toolkit, 
MoocherHunter is also FREE for end-users to use on their existing 
laptops with off-the-shelf supported wireless cards."
