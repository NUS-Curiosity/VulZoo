Appeal to them with language that they understand. Since they don't seem to
be as technical as you are, appeal to them with a financial and/or legal
liability argument. Managers understand liability and the bottom line.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Need some help with management


My management here wants to put a server on our LAN, not administered by us
(the IT department) and use a share on it to serve files and data to our
workstations.  They do not understand why having a server with a file share
that is NOT part of our secure infrastructure represents a threat to the
computers accessing it. Keep in mind this is an all Windows network. Sooo,
if you guys can succinctly explain why having a trusted computer trust an
untrusted computer is a problem, that would be helpful. Keep in mind we are
talking to management here. It's kind of like trying to explain why, when
you are in the United States, it's a bad idea to drive on the left hand
side of the road. It's just so basic it's not documented anywhere. So,
please help me explain why netbios and file shares on machines not within
your network are bad ideas.

 

Thanks,
