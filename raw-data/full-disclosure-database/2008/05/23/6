Why don't you sell them on a RedHat based SMB filesharing solution and
install a copy of Security Blanket.  (http://www.trustedcs.com)  RedHat
provides regular updates that keep it pretty secure and with Security
Blanket on there it will stay secure.  Additionally the presence of a non
windows fileserver will help to provide fault tolerance for your network.
Use this box to host back up services for your network.  Having a linux box
to play with will also allow you to set up inexpensive IDS/IPS threat
monitoring solutions.  Instead of netbies transfers you could do it over SSH
with WinSCP. Feel free to give me a ring if you want some help putting
something together for management.
cheers,
