This is a little bit oversimplified. I know some business solutions
where the software is bundled together with the server hardware and the
complete package is administered by the manufacturer via vpn.

Ok, if the management decided to buy such a solution they should have
asked th IT guys first. But we all know that this is wishful thinking...
