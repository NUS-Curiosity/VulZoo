Typical scenario - professor runs Windows XP with Skpe and Google Toolbar and a 
host of other "helpful" desktop applications - oh, but that's his "server" too 
- running IIS and mysql - default installs, mind you - replete with cross-site 
scripting and sql injection problems - and all his research with no backups - 
and then gets irate because his computer gets blocked at the switch port for 
policy violations.

I could go on, but you get the idea.

Why do they do it?  Because they can - at least until we catch them.

How many mysql installs do you think there are worldwide, listening on the 
default port, with "root@...alhost", "root@...N", "@localhost" and "@FQHN" all 
in the default state with no password?
