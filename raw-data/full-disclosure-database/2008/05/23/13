Subject: Thank you for help with management.

Thank you to all who responded to my request for how to deal with a non
secure server. Responses ranged from lol witty to incisive. I will
definitely be asking the general manager for a  key to  his house and I
will be requiring a release from liability in writing.  It was very
helpful, thank you all again.
