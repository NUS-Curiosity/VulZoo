Hi Daniel,

There are a great many reasons why this is a bad idea, and I'm sure you
actually know most of them.  If your management isn't buying the
rationale behind not allowing untrusted systems on the network, my
suggestion would be to put them on the spot and ask them to absolve you,
and your team, of any responsibility for that system and resulting
security/regulatory incidents that arise from it being unmanaged.

In writing.


Then place any/all ACL's necessary to prevent domain systems from
connecting to, or being connected to, by that system.  


Of course, I'm rather dying of curiosity as to why they feel a simple
file server shouldn't be managed and secured by the IT group.  That's
just... odd.

Cheers,
