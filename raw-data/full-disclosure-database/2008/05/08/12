And that relates to the MSRT how?

Now you're being silly.  You're claiming that *realtime connection 
information* is included in the data that is sent but without any grounds 
to do so and despite Microsoft's claims to the contrary.  And without any 
proof.

You might try it some time.  Getting the facts beats wild speculation and 
hyperbole every time.  I just installed MSRT on my laptop and ran it while 
Wireshark was monitoring all external communications.  It sent exactly 
*zero* information to MS.

I'm no Microsoft fan by any stretch of the imagination (my preferred 
platforms are FreeBSD and Mac OS X), but I'm also not a paranoid fool.

Not all of us are consumed by paranoia and unfounded fears.  Some of us 
actually approach security from a rational, intelligent perspective and 
attempt to mitigate risks to the best of our abilities while accepting the 
fact that we can't stop every attack.

Again, this has *what* to do with the MSRT?

I don't consider fantasizing about bogeymen "thinking outside the box".
