Note: "this tool" != MSRT.  "This tool" == botnet hunter.

You're comparing apples with oranges.  The is precisely the muddying of the 
waters that J. Oquendo is seeking to stir up emotions.

It clearly says that on the download page.  It's not Microsoft's fault if you 
don't bother to read it.

Yes, their web page (I don't see any EULA) states that they don't collect 
personally identifiable information.  Furthermore, the botnet tool is a 
separate tool.  The page also states that after the tool is run, it deletes 
itself.  So, when you are infected with something, the tool will detect and 
clean it *and* send some information about the infection back to M$.

I'm willing to bet they still won't know your pants size or where you bank.
