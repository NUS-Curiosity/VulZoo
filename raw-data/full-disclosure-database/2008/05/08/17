Subject: Re: Vulnerability Note VU#12345 (Security Group)

im a newcomer on this list , and im a little disgusted to see
"Professionals" acting as Kids .

i was expecting to get a really professional list, with correct content,
instead of that i can see only insults, racisms, and kiddies writtings. Is
there not a Moderator, because i feel this is really annoying.

PS: your Vuln Note was hilarious, making me piss of laugh , really. well
done !

PS 2 : I want to excuse for my Bad English, it's not my native language.

THX all, hope this shitty things don't happen all the time . WhiteHatly
yours, Sh@m@...rtuel
