Relates to MSRT sending your information. It only sends information
when it finds something. I never stated it sends all your information
all the time.

Pick up a dev machine load it with malware, run MSRT, and sniff it. You'll
see what it sends and remember LEA uses IP as an identifier bottom line.

It sent zero information because it did not detect anything malicious.
As for paranoia, has nothing to do with paranoia. Facts. Fact 1) Is MS
sending information from your machine to them ... Yes Fact 2) If something
malicious is detected on your machine will it go to MS. Yes. Fact 3) Will
they share information obtained from YOUR machine via YOUR IP address
will they share that information with LEA? According to the MS spokesman
they will. Fact 4) Can LEA correlate the information sent from your machine
to an IP address... Yes.

Go back and look at the information MS is obtaining it's in the log file.
So looking at Sasser, lets fiddle with this:

(from there website).

Now according to their article and common logic, in their article they stated
they obtained samples of the infection to track the CNC of a botnet. How did
they get this is up in the air, but with their forced update history, its
possible on detection they can actually send avserve.exe right back to themselves.

Anyhow, so I create something crafted to implicate you - using my previous
analogy of being a botnet CNC owner, my program implicates your network
you take the fall. People pull Joe Jobs all the time.

A Joe Job is an unfounded fear? How about poisoning the well. What happens
if someone reading this decides to put it to the tests nullifying any
verifiable, concrete snapshots with garbage. Then what will be of the
tool? e-Garbage truck?

Fantasizing has nothing to do with reality. People are paying top dollars
in life to screw someone all the time whether its online or not. This is
another stupid mechanism someone can use. Its a flawed concept albeit nice
idea.
