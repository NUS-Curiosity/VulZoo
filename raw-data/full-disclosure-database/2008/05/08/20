Although your message appears to be _about_ the Full-Disclosure list, 
it seems you have misunderstood the role of the various "security" 
mailing lists -- your post would be much more "on topic" had you 
posted it to the "funsec" list.

Regardless -- other lists may be even more appropriate -- your post 
is clearly sadly misplaced in F-D itself.

As a self-acknowledged newbie here, you should lurk a while longer 
before posting to F-D again (personally, I'd suggest about 18-24 
months).
