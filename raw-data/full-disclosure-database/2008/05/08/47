Andrew A.:

I have read your bullshit rants in the past, and it is clear that you have
some serious problems and are completely delusional.  You must see yourself
as being a deity of some type.  What is your purpose anyway?

You fit in well with the other Andrew idiot.  Another testament to the
profound level of stupidity that has availed itself on this list lately.

I would like, however, to point out that your comments are nothing more than
a reflection of your own inadequacies.  It seems your membership in the
human race has been invalidated by your need to threaten others with nuclear
annihilation.  I hope you find solace in your efforts to bring terror to
others.  You certainly surpass the standard model of the idiot in
unparalleled magnitude.

I wish peace in the self-limiting and pathetic world you live in.  Maybe one
day you will see who you really are, and apologize to the people you have
hurt.  But then, some people never come clean.

MAZEL TOV !
