Â– Classic Troll Tactic Number 5: When all else fails, claim to be leaving
forever. Trolls who claim they are leaving never do, of course; you can
bet that anyone who proclaims, "I'm never coming back here," will most
certainly at least check back for responses, and probably will not be able
to resist posting again.
