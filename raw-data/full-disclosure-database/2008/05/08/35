And you know me this well to infer it's stirring up emotions. I call it
raising awareness. You have your interpretation of what you read, I have
mine. Is yours wrong Paul. You state "waa waa waa I ran the tool it did
nothing therefore you are wrong J. Oquendo I'm Paul Schmehl!" Did you
run it on an infected machine Mr. Schmehl. No so please explain how you
yourself did not "muddy this water."

Please give us your professional correlation of the article. Information

Can you please find this page. I showed you mine show me yours or just STFU
