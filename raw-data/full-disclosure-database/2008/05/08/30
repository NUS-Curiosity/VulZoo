Again, Microsoft states that no information of a personally identifiable 
nature, either for the individual or for the computer, is sent by the tool.  If 
you can prove that it includes the IP address, then you have proven that 
Microsoft is committing fraud.  Call your local LE and notify them of it, or 
contact the FBI.

Otherwise, this is pure speculation, and you know it.

Your fact 4 is unproven.  It's pure speculation on your part.

OK.  It's certainly possible.

To implicate me, you have to find a way to include personally identifiable 
information in the packets sent from MSRT.  That would be a neat trick.

You haven't proven this is even possible, much less routinely done.  The only 
Joe job going on here is in your brain.

Please describe, in detail, one possible way this can be done using the MSRT 
only.  Vague gesticulations won't get it.  Show packet captures that prove your 
theory.
