Subject: Happy Birthday Israel!

Today we are celebrating, here in Israel, 60
<http://israel60.gov.il/englishnews/categoryList.aspx>  years of being an
independent country. As part of the celebration, I'm releasing a new 0day
vulnerability. 
One of our customs in Independence day is to play a "treasure hunt
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_hunt> " game. In this game there is a
treasure hidden somewhere in our beautiful country, and we get mysterious
clues that help us find this treasure by traveling to
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee>  many
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights>  great
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev>  sites
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judean_Desert>  all over Israel.
In the spirit of this day, I've decided not to release full details about
this vulnerability yet, but rather play a little "treasure hunt" game. 
Somewhere in my blog <http://aviv.raffon.net/> , I embedded a
proof-of-concept code which exploits this 0day vulnerability.

Clues for finding the 0day treasure can be found here:
