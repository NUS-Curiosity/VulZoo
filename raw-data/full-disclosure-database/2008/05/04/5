If Metasploit is some way of keeping tabs on script kids then i'm all
for it, if its just a sheer evil hacking tool for shits and giggles
then I stand by my words.

I see no evidence that there is any government connection, so I stand
by my words.

If its a covert government project then I will retract the comments
when evidence is forecoming.

To me this is just a private project that HD Moore created when he was immature.

He should grow out of Metasploit now and focus on something else...
like a theme day on the mailing lists.

All the best,
