You are a laughable prepubescent troll. As if you, who are currently jobless
and never have had a job in info-security, could offer anyone on this list
useful professional advice. Every post you send to this list leaves me
rolling painfully on the floor in uncontrollable fits of guffaws and
chortles. Makes me wonder which is lower: your IQ or your age. Your petty,
whining posts attacking researchers who could not care less about your theme
day illustrate perfectly why it was entirely appropriate for them to ignore
it and for us to mock you. By all means, keep us entertained by continuing
to post your pointless, prattling claptrap. 

Don't forget to have my buddies at CESG come after me and everyone else.
That is, if you know what the hell CESG actually is over there. You drop the
names of secretive government agencies but you probably have no idea which
one is actually responsible for protecting the information systems in your
country. 

With all due sincerity and respect,

Mr. Dillard

If Metasploit is some way of keeping tabs on script kids then i'm all
for it, if its just a sheer evil hacking tool for shits and giggles
then I stand by my words.

I see no evidence that there is any government connection, so I stand
by my words.

If its a covert government project then I will retract the comments
when evidence is forecoming.

To me this is just a private project that HD Moore created when he was
immature.

He should grow out of Metasploit now and focus on something else...
like a theme day on the mailing lists.

All the best,

n3td3v
