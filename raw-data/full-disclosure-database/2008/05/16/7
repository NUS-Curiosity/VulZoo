No, but 2.6.26-rc2-mm1 just came out, so expect more soon. :)

The config can't be *too* retarded - it's been a *long* time since I managed to
crash the kernel that *didn't* result in a fix being committed.  So apparently,
people like Linus Torvalds and Andrew Morton think that the stuff I trip over
are legitimate bugs that need fixing. And if you actually paid attention to the
linux-kernel list, you'd already know that the vast majority of "retarded"
configurations result in either Kconfig breakage or compile-time errors about
undefined variables or functions.  Runtime breakage is usually indicative of
actual bugs.

For example, the *last* oops that I reported was a totally legitimate bug - it
was possible to force SELinux to re-enter some filesystem code it didn't belong
in if there was memory pressure.

I suspect you're just jealous of my ability to find ways to DoS the kernel :)
