yes fredrick is very jealous :> your ability to accidentally crash
software is astounding, almost as astounding as your inability to
determine the actual problem beyond the debug output. You sir are a
genius and Fredrick wishes he was you.

Actually in all seriousness I am jealous of you but it's your
mustache. Is it real or did you glue a squirrel to your face?
