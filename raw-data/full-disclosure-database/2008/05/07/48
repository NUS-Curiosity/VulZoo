Mr Alias,

This Mr.Wallace stuff is getting old, I am the same person, you don't
suddenly need to re-address me as Mr.Wallace and re-post everything
i've ever said on the mailing lists since 2004 and ask if it was true,
false, a joke, a wind up or not.

That would take another 4 years to complete and is boring and
pointless... even though it is hysterically funny to look back on.

Its your judgement to decide if what i've said since whenever I
started posting on the mailing lists are true, false, a joke, a wind
up or not, hell I can't even remember half the shit I wrote last
month, never mind any other time.

All the best,

n3td3v
