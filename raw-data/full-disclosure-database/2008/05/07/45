Please find the EULA to begin with.  :-)

Here's what Microsoft's information page on the MSRT says:
<http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830>

"The Malicious Software Removal Tool will send basic information to Microsoft 
if the tool detects malicious software or finds an error. This information will 
be used for tracking virus prevalence. No identifiable personal information 
that is related to you or to the computer is sent together with this report."

Please point to the part where they are "relying on IP" when they explicitly 
state "No identifiable personal information that is related to you ***or to the 
computer*** is sent...."

You're making huge assumptions and over-generalizations about something you 
know little or nothing about.  What reporters report is often the same thing 
based upon their lack of understanding of the subject matter and their natural 
tendency to distrust everyone they interview.

Note that, even in the quote you cite, they do not say that the Quebecois 
police (Mounties?) used the MSFT but the "botnet-buster".  Are you claiming 
that the botnet buster *is* the MSRT?  If so, on what basis?

Have you even bothered to do a network trace to see what information the tool 
sends?
