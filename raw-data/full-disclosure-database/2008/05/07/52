Mr. D3v,

I find it strange that you can't remember the threats that you have
made in the last week.  Based upon the currency of your threats, I
find it troublesome that you call those threats hysterically funny and
that you dismiss them as having occurred at extended periods in the
past.

I reposted some of the items that you wrote in the last week.

Actually, it is the judgement and function of my local police department.
