Subject: n3td3v's agenda

Mr. Wallace,

Would you dilucidate the following for me?

1.  The n3td3v agenda
2.  The n3td3v group
3.  n3td3v's level of affiliation with industry leaders (regarding
computer security)
       e.g. Do they instigate communications with you or are you the
one who instigates communications?
4.  the lack of vulnerabilities posted under the n3td3v alias to full disclosure

If my question is too boring for you, or if you believe I am lame and
cannot think up my own lines, feel free to state that.

I seek your reply so as to possibly align myself with the n3td3v
agenda, but I need to understand it first.

Thank you for your time,

Dr. Swift
