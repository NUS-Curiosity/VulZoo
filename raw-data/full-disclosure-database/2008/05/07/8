Actually, as Mr Wallace suffers from / is the poster child for
borderline personality disorder

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder>

and taking into account his drug/alcohol use he would probably benefit
from some a decent dose of quetiapine

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine>

About a fifth of my 1200+ patients have this combo of pathologies and
seem to do very well on this treatment. I am considering spiking the
local water supply with it.

Main drawback is that it can make some folk fat and aggressive or for
those of you who know where i work, fatter and more aggressive.
