You find these credentials funny? What exactly are your credentials 
other than your expert level milk shake consumption skills and 
internet 2.0 hacking nonsense?

Have you ever even hacked on the internet? On an intranet? Have you

different types of integers in computer programming? Probably not...

PhD, CISSP
