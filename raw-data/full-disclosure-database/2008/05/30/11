Subject: n3td3v franchise only worth $80

I'm humbled that the expectation of the sale is $80, anymore than that
and i'd be calling my lawyers. ;)

An $80 troll, who woulda thunk it! I'm sure hookers get paid less for
a blow job. Hookers are evil!

Disclaimer: I'm not a troll i'm a serious security researcher, however
since "n3td3v" has been misrepresented in the media by SecurityFocus
Robert Lemos, then I thought i'd play along with the public conception
of "troll".

Thank you Mr.Lemos for trashing me big time!,

When the n3td3v corporation hits its first million i'll be back to rub
salt in the wound!

No one is going to pay $80 for it, you may as well give it to me for free ;)
