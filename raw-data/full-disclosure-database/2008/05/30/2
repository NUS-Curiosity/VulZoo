Subject: Request for Information on Exploit 'Novell
 eDirectory evtFilteredMonitorEventsRequest() function Buffer Overflow
 vulnerability'

Hi,
      I'm developing a tool for testing the effectiveness of IPS/IDS 
devices against various exploits. I could not find any working Poc for 
this particular vulnerability.

      Please help me out with any information about any working exploit 
for this vulnerability or Poc.

Details:

Exploit: Novell eDirectory evtFilteredMonitorEventsRequest() function 
Buffer Overflow vulnerability

Product: Novell eDirectory  <= 8.8.1

Description:
The evtFilteredMonitorEventsRequest function in the LDAP service in 
Novell eDirectory before 8.8.1 FTF1 allows remote attackers to execute 
arbitrary code via a crafted request containing a value that is larger 
than the number of objects transmitted, which triggers an invalid free 
of unallocated memory.
