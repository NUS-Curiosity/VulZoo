Where else can the hard-working security industry employees go once a
year to hang out with their only fat, retarded goth loser friends who
where suits and act like fags? Security conferences provide the only
outlet for social activity for thousands of people annually.

After this they proceed to tell the same lame stories about what
happened at Blackhat/Defcon for the rest of the year. This further
murders any potential of them having a normal social life as their
only existence is to go to these circuses of pity.

Don't you have any compassion for the autistic losers? As not only a
security professional but also a certified mental and physical health
advocate I try to promote these types of things in the same way in
which I tried to promote your Web Exploitation Day, n3td3v.

Please try to be more respectful and civilized towards me in the
future on the Full Disclosure mailing list. This is a place for
learning and engaging in research for the good of the world. It's
because of people like us that freedom and prosperity exists.

Thank you for your time,
Professor Micheal Chatner, M.D., CISSP
