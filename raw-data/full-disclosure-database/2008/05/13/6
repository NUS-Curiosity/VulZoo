Subject: Fwd:  n3td3v's agenda

Mr. Wallace, since you've decided to stay, could you answer these questions
for us?  What's the group's official agenda?  Is there anything more to your
group than you posting links to random security articles you've been given
or found around the net?  Anything else I missed, please reply to the
questions below, too.

actually, we'd all like to hear this.  n3td3v or whatever your name
is, please honor this request.  what is the n3td3v agenda?  what is
the n3td3v group?

u probably wouldnt be ridiculed so much if you actually answered
questions seriously.
