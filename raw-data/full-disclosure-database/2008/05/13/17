Going to a security conference is a great way to register with the
intelligence services if You haven't worked how to send an e-mail on
F-D yet.

They'll get you on the mailing lists, and if they can't get you there,
they'll get you at the security conferences, either way You will
register with the intelligence services.

All the best,
