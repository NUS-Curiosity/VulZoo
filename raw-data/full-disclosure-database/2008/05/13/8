-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office. Exploitation requires that
the target opens an Office file that contains malicious Jet DB Engine
objects.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of a column structure. The
DWORD value from the structure that specifies the column count is
trusted. If this value is changed, an inline memcpy to the stack can
overflow while reading a column name. Typically Jet DB structures are
used within MDB files which are considered unsafe. However, it is
possible to embed such files within a trusted format, such as an Office
Document (.doc). This issue allows for remote code execution under the
context of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
