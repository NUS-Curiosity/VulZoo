Not silly to point that out at all. I borrowed the media term du jour
("Islamic fascists," or alternately, "Islamofascists"). I typically use the
term "Salafist radicals" since it's more technically correct and less
inflammatory (well, not necessarily on FD), but that term often
necessitates more explanation.

"islamic fascists" is a (probably null) subset of "muslims", while
"jews" is not a similar small subset of itself.

I suppose it would be silly to point out that "fascism" has a totally
different
goalset than "islamic fundamentalists", with an even bigger divergence of
philosophy than the Shiite-Sunni rift...
