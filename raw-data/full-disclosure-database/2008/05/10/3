How do you know what Jews are taught? Do you know Hebrew? Are you a Jew?
Have you read the Torah and the Talmud front to back?

I am not misquoting verses from the old testament. I am copying them
unaltered from the KJV translation, not taking them out of context, with the
chapter and verse provided so that people who doubt my words may check for
themselves. There is absolutely no ambiguity to the commandments of Moses to
eradicate non-Jews.
