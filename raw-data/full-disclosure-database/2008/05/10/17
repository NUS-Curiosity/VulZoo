Subject: NetWorker impersonator

i recall seeing a tool to impersonate various network clients via ARP
and DNS injection on a LAN.  i cannot seem to find this tool
anywhere...

due to the deficiencies of Legato/EMC NetWorker authentication, a
directory of clients could be obtained without authentication via the
networker server(s), and then impersonation of the desired client host
would allow retrieval of any desired files.  my thanks in advance for
a mirror or pointer.

additionally, if anyone is aware of undocumented parameters for
nsrexecd to direct the bound IP/interface this would be helpful.  i'd
rather not rely on filter rules.

best regards,
