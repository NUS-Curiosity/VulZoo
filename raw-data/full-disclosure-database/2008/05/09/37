Valdis,

Furthermore, using scholarly resource WikiPedia, I have been able 
to find more flaw in your statement. As it turns out, the jews 
actually *are* a small subset:

That is small dude! LOLOL.

Now, we both have accepted that any set is a subset of itself, it 
is now proven that jews are a small subset of jews. QED AKA LOLOL.
