Subject: Free IT Security Training



Over the past several weeks, I’ve been gathering free training resources
to share with the IT security community.  

Training that I’ve collected and others have sent to me can be found at:

http://www.FreeITSecurityTraining.com

Thanks to everyone who provided resources.  If you haven't already, I hope
that you will take a short time to register and post any free resources you
have encountered over the years.

Registration isn’t required to access training that others have shared. 
I encourage you to pass this info along to anyone who might be interested.

If you have any questions or comments, you can reach me at:

scott@...eitsecuritytraining.com

Best regards,

Scott (scott@...eitsecuritytraining.com)
