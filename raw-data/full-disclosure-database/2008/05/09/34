Also, I got this for you Valdis, scholarly source WikiPedia to 
teach you about set theory since you went through all that trouble

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset

"Any set is a subset of itself, but not a proper subset." - 
WikiPedia

You see, jews are a subset of jews. LOLOLOL, check your work!
