I'm sure they'll be other theme days though that others will start,
like a Buffer Overflow Security Awareness Day that others can
organise.

I'm just leading the way of a new trend, my day wasn't successful, but
if HD Moore or others announce some other theme day, i'm sure it will
be a success.

The mailing lists have become boring over the years, theme days are
just something to make the lists more exciting and stimulating again.

All the best,
