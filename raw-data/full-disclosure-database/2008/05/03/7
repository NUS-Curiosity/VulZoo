Subject: Web Application Security Awareness Day Deemed
	Complete Failure

Good Evening Full Disclosure Members,

The Internet + Web Application Security Blog has posted a recent news
article surrounding the past "Web Application Security Awareness Day" that
was to have occurred on May 1, 2008. While many were skeptical that the
n3td3v agenda has any influence whatsoever after numeros failures and
embarrassments, there were still a handful that were hoping that they could
meet with success. Unfortunately this did not occur and we witnessed one of
the word failures in modern web application security history. A full
article on this event has been cataloged at the following site -

Brief excerpt
~~~
Saturday May 3, 2008 media and security researchers have come to the
conclusion that "Web Application Security Awareness Day" was a complete and
utter failure. This stunning revelation comes just two days after the event
came to a close, without a single submission or person recognizing the
event.


 "We just kept waiting and hoping a single submission would come in. We were
thinking that maybe the researchers had their clocks set wrong or they were
working hard on a release that just couldn't cut the deadline", said a well
known industry expert who wishes to remain anonymous.
