Subject: Re: [NANOG] IOS rootkits

Miss Wallace:
Why does "n3td3v" hate network security enthusiasts?
Why is "n3td3v" being so disruptive?

A rootkit for Cisco will not damage anything, Cisco has even shown 
interest in the development.  A rootkit for Cisco will cause Cisco to 
look into the issue more closely, which in turn will make IOS *more secure.*

If "n3td3v" is concerned about the "safety of the internet", they/you 
should go back to your hole and never come out.  Or if you do come out, 
don't post on any security-related mailing lists or even your google 
group (which cannot be considered security-related, since you run it).

Please, stop trying to make the internet a more dangerous environment.

All the best,
 Your mom's a bloody cunt.
