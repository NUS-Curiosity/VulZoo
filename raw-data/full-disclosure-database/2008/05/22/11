Subject: Need some help with management

My management here wants to put a server on our LAN, not administered by
us (the IT department) and use a share on it to serve files and data to
our workstations.  They do not understand why having a server with a
file share that is NOT part of our secure infrastructure represents a
threat to the computers accessing it. Keep in mind this is an all
Windows network. Sooo, if you guys can succinctly explain why having a
trusted computer trust an untrusted computer is a problem, that would be
helpful. Keep in mind we are talking to management here. It's kind of
like trying to explain why, when you are in the United States, it's a
bad idea to drive on the left hand side of the road. It's just so basic
it's not documented anywhere. So, please help me explain why netbios and
file shares on machines not within your network are bad ideas.

 

Thanks,
