Dear Viktor. thank you for sharing your experience and your personal point 
of view, I appreciate that.

As to the banks, indeed actual, eventual, down-time was non consequential 
(for some, 2 hours) while others still did not process credit card 
requests a month later. All-in-all incident response made sure people in 
the streets only found out about certain issues through the press.

As to the technical evidence, indeed, the attacks, while sizable (c'mon, 
4mpps is still big) is almost insignificant when compared with size of 
attacks we have seen in the past. Very small in comparison.

I refuse to take a stand or offer an opinion (amymore) on if it was Russia 
or not, I convey only what I can prove, which on that regard is absolutely 
nothing except for the fact it was organized, ad-hoc or by an entity, you 
can decide for yourself.

It is not my place to take sides or comment politicially, DDoS hurts the 
`net, no matter who is under attack, and that is why the Internet security 
operations community and the CERTs community got involved, as well as 
myself.

Thanks again,

 	Gadi.
