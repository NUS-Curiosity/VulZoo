Subject: IRM Security Advisory : Barracuda Networks Spam
	Firewall Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

Barracuda Networks Spam Firewall Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
CVE Number: CVE-2008-2333


Vulnerability Type / Importance: Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected) /
Medium

Problem Discovered 24 April 2008
Vendor Contacted 24 April 2008
Advisory Published 22 May 2008

Abstract
The Barracuda Spam Firewall device web administration interface is
vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability which may
allow theft of administrative credentials or downloading of malicious
content.

Description:

The Barracuda device presents LDAP testing functionality via a script
called 'ldap_test.cgi'. The script does not sufficiently validate
user-supplied input within the 'email' parameter. As a result,
client-supplied script code can be injected into the 'email' parameter
that would execute in the browser within the security context of the
Barracuda device.
Vendor information:
http://www.barracudanetworks.com/ns/support/tech_alert.php

Proof of Concept:

https://<vulnerable_host>/cgi-bin/ldap_test.cgi?host=127.0.0.1&port=1&tl
s_mode=tls_mode&tls_require=&username=&password=&filter=&searchbase=&uni
que_attr=&email_attr=&domain=*&email=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%
3C/script%3E

Mitigation:

Access to the web management application can be limited by IP address.
Firmware release 3.5.11.025 has been released by the vendor to address
this issue; however the patch has not been tested by IRM.

Tested/Affected Versions:

IRM confirmed the presence of this vulnerability in Barracuda Spam
Firewall 600 Firmware 3.5.11.020.
The vendor has confirmed the issue exists in all versions prior to
3.5.11.025.
