Objet : [Full-disclosure] Did n3td3v infulence Google Security Team

I don't often write to the list nor contribute much at all at this point 
mostly due to work commitments  but I felt a need to this time.

Why on earth was this posted to the list?  it provided no usefull
information.  
It had nothing to do with full disclosure of anything.  all it did was waste

my time and others.  At this point the author of the post has made it to the

filter to hit the trash bin straight off marked as read.

Do us all a favor...stop posting this crap.  Its pointless, provides no 
information and can be used for nothing.  In a word this post ranked no 
higher than SPAM!

My 2cents worth.

Flame away  chances are I'm not going to respond anyway.

if [ !=n3td3v ] then;
mv $post spam
fi
