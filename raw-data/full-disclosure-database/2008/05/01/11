Subject: Happy Valdis Kletnieks Day

Happy Valdis Kletnieks Day, a new and innovative day where nothing
gets post on FD!!!

Valdis Kletnieks, Ureleet and others hope it will catch on and that it
will take place every year.

Its all about counter productive awareness, don't post anything on FD
every May 1st.

All the best,

n3td3v
