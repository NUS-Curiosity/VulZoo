What's your point numbnuts? Its also registered with marc.info. Should
I be afraid of a couple of linux geeks with squinty eyes and bad
breath kicking down my door? (Or at least knocking politely)

In case you're two stupid or paranoid to figure that one out ; no, no
I shouldn't. Because like MI6 they couldn't give a flying fuck what
some donkey has to say on FD unless it is backed up by some serious
and reputable other information that this person is a threat.

Christ your stupid. (and yet I still feel the need to respond at
times... why is that? I must secretly crave your approval or want the
glory and fame that comes with calling you out. Yes, that must be it.)
