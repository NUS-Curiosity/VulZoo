Mr. Wallace,

You have refused to rebut my question to you about Robert Lemos'
website being destroyed.  You vanished from this list right before his
website was destroyed and you reemerged right after it had been
destroyed.

Due to your sidestepping my previous questions, it is apparent to me
that you condemn law breaking under the auspices of the ZF0 group -
but support law breaking under the auspices of the n3td3v group.  I
expect this to be the understanding of any reasonable person when
presented with the text of your statements.

I continue conversing under a pseudonym due to my belief that you
destroyed Robert Lemos' website and that your reach extends far beyond
the court system into the seamy and lawless underbelly of the computer
espoionage and intelligence world.


Mr. Wallace, I have some straightforward questions for you.

Question 1:  For what would you prosecute me?

Question 2:  Is the n3td3v group the same as ZF0?

Question 3:  What is the n3td3v agenda?
