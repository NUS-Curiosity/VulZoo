Subject: Fredrick Diggle Security Unfortunate News

Fredrick Diggle Security is sad to report that it's founder the
Fredrick Diggle III Esquire CISSP has not been feeling well due to
increased responsibility at the zoo. This basically means that Fred
would like to apologize for his lack of 0day disclosings of late. HE
does however have hope that he will in the future be able to attend to
these matters of finding the security bugs which elude the other
researchers.

look for many 0day in the coming weeks.

-your friend mr diggle
