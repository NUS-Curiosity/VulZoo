Subject: Jews, n3td3v and all the like

I have to admit it's been quite interesting to read all such definitive
emails on jews, subsets and flaming n3td3v (whoever this might be). 

But all those posts are actually quite boring after all. 

As to n3td3v, let him die. 

As to jews, read again George Steiner. 

As to subsets, I don't care. 

As to FD, I'd have expected better. 

As to me, please forgive my poor english.

PS: Feel free to flame this. Just hope you have nothing more important
to do in your life.
