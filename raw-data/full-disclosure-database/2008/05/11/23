     I actually looked up what Mr. Schmehl does and he has quite a 
C.V. of accomplishments, merits and awards. On top of that he 
maintains  the security of a very large campus network at the 
University of Dallas. I would not want that headache for a million 
pounds. 
     He does not deserve your lame bashing. Look before you leep 
and take your fist out of your arsehole.
     Toodles, L.B.
