Subject: Re: Out of Office AutoReply: Snort Signature to
	det ect credit cards

Fredrick Diggle would like to disclose a vulnerability in email auto
responders. Using these auto responders causes information disclosure
that the victim is currently not in the office. an attacker could use
this information to know when a victim is not in the office and XSS
their browser for fun and profit.
