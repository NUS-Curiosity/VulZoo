Scaring people with fullScreen

    * Posted by bunnyhero

When Flash Player 9 goes into full screen mode, it pops up a little
security message that tells the user how to exit full screen mode. It
appears as white text on a semi-transparent black background so it is
generally always visible (which is good). Still, I wondered if it
could be obscured.

The message is always on top, so it is impossible to draw over it. But
what if we tried distracting the user from the actual security
message?

Here's a silly test:

Of course, you can press Esc (or alt+tab to another window) to escape.

UPDATE: I have made the source code available, warts and all, under a
ZLib licence. Share and enjoy :)
