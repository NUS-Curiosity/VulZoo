Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in Pngcrush might result in user-assisted execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Pngcrush is a multi platform optimizer for PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/pngcrush     < 1.6.4-r1                     >= 1.6.4-r1

Description
===========

It has been reported that Pngcrush includes a copy of libpng that is
vulnerable to a memory corruption (GLSA 200804-15).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
PNG image, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Pngcrush users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/pngcrush-1.6.4-r1"
