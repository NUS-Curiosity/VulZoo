You are being sent this notice, because you had a user account on my
site, robertlemos.com.
Hackers gained access to the password account to the site. This does
not mean they have your password, but a scrambled version of your
password, known as a hash. Unfortunately, malicious hackers could use
try to brute force the hash or use other techniques to find your
password, especially if is an easy to guess combination of letters and
numbers.
For that reason, I recommend that, if you use the password on other
accounts, you change those accounts to use a new password.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. I apologize for
the inconvenience.
