Subject: Re: fear mongering and utter BS from secnap

so because I use a gmail account it means everything I said is invalid? Why
not answer some questions about your practices since it seems your company
is a bunch of script kiddies for hire & master's of scaring people into
buying services

Also where did the 100,000 hackers figure come from? Did you make this up
also?
