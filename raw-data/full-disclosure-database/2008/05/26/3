I did some research on this recently, and the story for browser support
is actually much more complicated. In addition to CRLs there is a
protocol called OCSP for checking the status of a specific certificate
by serial number.

	* Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 on Windows XP
support CRL checking but default to not using it. 
	* Firefox 1 and 2 support both OCSP and CRL, but default to
using CRL. 
	* Internet Explorer 7 on Vista and Firefox 3 support both OCSP
and CRL and default to using OCSP. Opera 8.5 and later supports only
OCSP and uses it by default.
