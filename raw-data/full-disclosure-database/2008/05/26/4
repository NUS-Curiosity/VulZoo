It is even a bit more complicated - CRL checking can mean two different
things:
  1. check manually downloaded and installed CRLs, which is what Firefox
     1 and 2 will do if you install one. This is different from
  2. download CRLs automatically from the "CRL Distribution Point"
     (CDP), which may be contained in the certificate and check the CRL
     afterwards. Firefox 1 or 2 won't do this for you.

So for a typical user, this
