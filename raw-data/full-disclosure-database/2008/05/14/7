Hey Guys,

I was wondering if any of you had written any songs about disclosing
things and how great it is.

What Full Disclosure needs is a theme song or something to get the
subscription rates up.

So come on computer wizards! Let's show some spirit! It's for you
"come out of the closet" as they say and show the world how great
computer security programmer guys really are!

YAY!
Professor Micheal Chatner, M.D., CISSP
