====================================================================== 
1) Affected Software 

* imlib2 1.4.0

NOTE: Other versions may also be affected.

====================================================================== 
2) Severity 

Rating: Highly critical
Impact: System access
Where:  Remote

====================================================================== 
3) Vendor's Description of Software 

"Imlib 2 is the successor to Imlib. It is NOT a newer version -- it
is a completely new library. Imlib 2 can be installed alongside
Imlib 1.x without any problems since they are effectively different
libraries which have very similar functionality."

4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in imlib2, which
can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of
Service) or compromise an application using the library.

1) A boundary error exists within the "load()" function in
src/modules/loaders/loader_pnm.c when processing the header of a
PNM image file. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer
overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted
PNM image in an application using the imlib2 library.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

2) A boundary error exists within the "load()" function in
src/modules/loader_xpm.c when processing an XPM image file. This can
be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking
a user into opening a specially crafted XPM image with an application
using the imlib2 library.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
