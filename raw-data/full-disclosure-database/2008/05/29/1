Subject: Repositories of CRLs?

With the Debian OpenSSL fallout and my distrust of CAs in general, this
seems like a great time to stuff Firefox full of CRLs.  I found this
page -- http://www.geekwisdom.com/dyn/node/189 -- listing a few major
CRL sources, but that seems like it leaves out a bucket of the CAs that
Firefox comes equipped with by default.  If anyone knows of a good place
to go to get CRLs, or has URLs for a few more of the major or semi-major
CAs, I'd be grateful.  Considering how little-used or badly-configured
OCSP commonly seems to be, I'm putting more stock in having CRLs
installed in Firefox than I am setting security.OCSP.enabled to 1.
