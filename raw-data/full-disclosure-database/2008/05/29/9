The difficulty in "making it work" is directly related to how "work" is
defined.  You need a *clear* idea of why the server is there, what business
needs are being filled by it, and what the proposed method of handling the
business need (remember - there's often more than one way to skin a cat - for
instance, if the requirement is "share data between business units", that
doesn't automatically imply CIFS access).  Otherwise, you have no way to tell
if it's "working" or not.
