Its time to come over and to my place and post some messages ;-)

n3td3v predictz Sebastian Muniz of CORE Security Technologies is about
to release his Cisco IOS rootkit presentation to the web.

n3td3v says because Cisco released an out of cycle patch release last
week for IOS that he, Sebastian Muniz was asked to give it a week to
let the patches circulate with the Cisco customer base before
releasing the rootkit presentation to the web.

The security community are now ready to receive your carbon copy of
the presentation you gave at EUSecWest 2008.

The government, the security industry and the underground now have had
enough time to come to terms with the situation and are ready to take
on the challenges that face us to protect our national infrastructure
from cyber attack.

Yes, I was scared at the imminent release at first, but the time zone
for discussion and panic has passed, its now time for a full Cisco IOS
rootkit EUSecWest presentation release to the mailing lists.
