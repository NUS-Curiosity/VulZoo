This was posted to OpenRCE already by a different person, and as I
wrote there, it's not so much a bug in Olly as a side-effect which
produces a known Windows behaviour.
Causing an exception while the T flag is set will trigger a secondary
exception inside the KiUserExceptionDispatcher, resulting in the
single_step exception being delivered first (except in VirtualPC, at
least).
