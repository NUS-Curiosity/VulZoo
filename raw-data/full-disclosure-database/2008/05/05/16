There's 2 really great uses for metasploit for white hat security guys:

1) When you're handed a /16 or two during a pen test, and need a quick way
to poke a whole bunch of machines for a vulnerability, it's hard to roll-your-own
exploit tester as fast as you can chinese-menu one in metasploit.

2) It's a *great* tool for impressing on a PHB just how easy it is to launch
an exploit for something at one of the unsecured systems he's responsible for.
