When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

When you already have a good supply of tools and know how to use them, finding
another tool you can use increases the range of things you can do with those
tools.

That's why some of us think metasploit is just a script kiddie tool, and others
of us can find lots of non-script kiddie uses for it.
