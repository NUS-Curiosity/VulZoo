First off, "prosecute" is a term usually reserved for the government's
attorney in criminal cases - in civil law, a tort case has a plaintiff
and a defendant, and the operative term is "file suit".

Secondly, please note that many jurisdictions recognize an offense called
"barratry", which is the repeated filing of suit, or threatening to do so,
solely to harass and annoy.

Thirdly, did you find a lawyer who is willing to pursue the suit pro bono,
or are you filing it pro se, or did you find one willing to take a risk on
a percentage of the return, or do you have some other means of financing a
lawsuit?  Legal fees pile up very quickly at the average lawyer's per-hour...
