Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 05.27.08: EMC
 AlphaStor Server Agent Multiple Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 05.27.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 27, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

AlphaStor is a suite of applications used for disk management. For more
information, please see the vendor's website at the following URL.

http://www.emc.com/products/detail/software/alphastor.htm

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple stack based buffer overflow
vulnerabilities in EMC Corp.'s AlphaStor could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

AlphaStor consists of multiple applications, one of which is the Server
Agent. The Server Agent is one of the core components of AlphaStor, and
is used to initiate disk management requests. The Agent consists of
several processes, one of which is the AlphaStor Command Line Interface
process. This process listens on TCP port 41025, and is prone to
multiple stack based buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected service, usually
SYSTEM. The vulnerabilities occur before any authentication, so they
can be exploited by anonymous attackers with the ability to create a
TCP connection to port 41025 on the server.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities in
AlphaStor version 3.1 SP1 for Windows. Previous versions, as well as
versions for other platforms, may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for these issues.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

"EMC has issued updates to correct this issue. More details can be found
in knowledgebase article emc186391 available from powerlink.emc.com. EMC

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2008-2158 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
security problems.
