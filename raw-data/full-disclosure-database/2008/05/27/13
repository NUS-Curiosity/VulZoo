Ah, them and a gazillion of others.

I ran a little experiment some time ago.

I had an unused ipadress (bog standard dynamic home issue cable feed) and just for fun I installed nepenthes (and Nessus) on an old PC and logged how, when and with what is was attacked.

After a week I dropped generic portscans from the log because it was too much to process.

After a month I dropped sql-slammer from the log because it was also to much to process.

After six months I cancelled the entire project because it was too depressing.

Now I only detect,log and drop ssh brute force attempts (avg 3-4 per day, mainly from mainland china and some from korea).

Limiting the continued propagation of sql-slammer is both a worthy and commendable deed.

But I'm afraid that it's totally futile.

Even if you _do_ manage to get someone to react and investigate they will just tell you that the source is a server managed by some external entity that management has forced them to accept on their network (see last weeks discussion on that subject).
