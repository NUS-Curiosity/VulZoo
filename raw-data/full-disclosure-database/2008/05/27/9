Europe, or US?  And in relation to their online activities or other?

When I was on my placement year, I did all of Ford Europe's website and I
was employed by the Marketting company Winderman Cato Johnson - so I guess
contacting them if it's Europe and to do with their online prescence.

Things may have changed, but a quick google suggests Wunderman are still
heavilly involved with Ford, Europe.
