Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 05.27.08: EMC
 AlphaStor Library Manager Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 05.27.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 27, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

AlphaStor is a suite of applications used for disk management. For more
information, please see the vendor's website found at the following
link.

http://www.emc.com/products/detail/software/alphastor.htm

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in
EMC Corp.'s AlphaStor could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
with SYSTEM privileges.

AlphaStor consists of multiple applications, one of which is the Library
Manager. The Library Manager is used to manage the replacement of disk
drives in distributed locations. The Manager consists of a single
process, the "robotd" process, that listens on TCP port 3500 for
incoming connections.

The Library Manager is prone to an arbitrary command execution
vulnerability. When sent a specific request, "robotd" will use a string
from the packet as a command to execute on the system via the
CreateProcess() function. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary
programs on the host with SYSTEM privileges.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the affected service, usually SYSTEM. The
vulnerability occurs before any authentication, so it can be exploited
by anonymous attackers with the ability to create a TCP connection to
port 3500 on the server.

Since the vulnerability allows an attacker to run arbitrary programs
with arbitrary arguments, little skill is required for exploitation.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in AlphaStor
version 3.1 SP1 for Windows. Previous versions, as well as versions for
other platforms, may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
