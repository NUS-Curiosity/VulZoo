How so?  Code Red II and Nimda appear to have disappeared, albeit after many
years.

I suspect that somebody let loose the Crclean anti-worm on Code Red II, but
nobody appears to want to confess to it.  I bet that SQL-Slammer would be
vulnerable to the same sort of anti-worm (i.e. responding only to SQL-slammer
scans, rather than doing scanning on its own).

           As for you government types intercepting this,
           thanks for keeping us safe from our freedoms.
       Warrantless wiretapping is un-American and unpatriotic.
