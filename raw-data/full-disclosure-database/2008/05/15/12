Right, because the CISSP isn't about hacking. It's about risk management.
It's about balancing the cost of adding more security to a system against
the costs of an intrusion.  It's about the costs of testing a disaster
recovery plan, and the costs of not having a plan.  It's about what sort
of backup schedule you should have, and what the retention period on the
backups should be, and why.  It's about knowing how deep a background check
you should make on prospective employees.  It's about how much security
awareness training the users need.

Hacking is a *very small* part of the security world.
