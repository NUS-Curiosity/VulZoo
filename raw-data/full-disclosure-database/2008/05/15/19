Subject: Forwarding message vulnerability on Google Groups

If joebloggs@...gle.com is banned from a Google Group and
xploitable@...il.com is registered with that group,
joebloggs@...gle.com can subscribe to a mailing list such as
Full-Disclosure and start forwarding all messages xploitable@...il.com
sends to that mailing list if xploitable@...il.com is registered to
it, and directly post them to the Google Group joebloggs@...gle.com is
banned from.

This is probably done by the banned joebloggs@...gle.com setting up a
filter on Gmail Settings > Filter > Matches:
from:(xploitable@...il.com)
Do this: Forward to (n3td3v@...glegroups.com).

Severity of this issue is obviously critical and you should switch the
victim's registered (xploitable@...il.com) e-mail address on a Google
Group to "moderate" as a work around, until Google Groups fixes this
vulnerability.

Google Inc. (GOOG) was notified simultaneously as this security
advisory was published to the wild.

All the best,
