Subject: Debian OpenSSL vulnerability - major CAs
	unaffected

Hi,

some good news in the whole Debian OpenSSL vulnerability mess:
We have tested all the CAs with 1024 and 2048 bit keys with a
public exponent of 653537 which are included in the
Windows or Mozilla CA store against our list of known weak keys,
but none of them were affected.
Not that we expected that they were, but we thought it might be better
to check ;-)
A minor 13% has not been tested because they were using different
key lengths or public exponents ...

Cheers,
  Alex
