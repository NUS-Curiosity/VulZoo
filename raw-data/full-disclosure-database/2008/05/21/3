Has it ever occurred to you that *maybe* MI5 is fully aware of the situation,
and thinks that the best way to improve security is to let the talk happen?

If he gives the talk, the trade rags will cover it, the C-levels that pay
attention to the trade rags will get on the case of the Chief Info Officer,
who will lean on their chief networking guys To Do Something About It, Dammit,
and if the routers weren't secured to BCP before, they hopefully will be.

If the talk doesn't happen, the C-levels don't see it in the trade rags, they
don't lean on the CIO, who doesn't lean on the networking guys, who go off and
deal with whatever *other* problem they have to deal with (like why their BGP
feeds keep creating BGP Wedgies at two remote sites, or why they're having
performance issues on one of their trans-ocean lines, or...) , and the company
gets pwned by somebody with a rootkit.
