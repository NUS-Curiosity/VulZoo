Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Service Control Engine Denial of Service
Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20080521-sce

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080521-sce.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2008 May 21 1600 UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

Three Secure Shell (SSH) vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco Service
Control Engine (SCE) that may result in system instability or a reload
of the SCE. The first vulnerability may be triggered during SSH login
activity that is conducted within aggressive time frames. The second
vulnerability may be triggered with normal SSH login activity in
combination with other SCE management actions occurring simultaneously.
The third vulnerability may be triggered during SSH login and is
specific to the usage of unique invalid authentication credentials.

Cisco has made free upgrade software available to address these
vulnerabilities for affected customers. There are no workarounds for
these vulnerabilities.

Note: These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a device may
be affected by one vulnerability and not by the others.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080521-sce.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The SCE 1000 and 2000 series devices are affected by the following
vulnerabilities if the SSH server on the SCE is enabled:

  * System vulnerability to SSH login activity - affects SCE software
    versions prior to 3.1.6.
  * SSH login activity leads to illegal Input/Output operations -
    affects SCE software versions prior to 3.0.7 and 3.1.0.
  * SCE SSH authentication sequence anomaly - affects SCE software
    versions prior to 3.1.6.

Note: The SCE SSH server is disabled by default.

To determine whether you are running a vulnerable version of Cisco
Service Control Operating System (SCOS) software, issue the "Show
Version" command-line interface (CLI) command. The following example
shows a Cisco SCE that runs software release 3.1.6:

    SCE2000#>show version
    System version: Version 3.1.6 Build 157
    Build time: Mar 31 2008, 18:58:49 (Change-list 303626)
    Software version is: Version 3.1.6 Build 157


Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco SCE 1000 and 2000 series devices provide high-capacity advanced
application-level bandwidth optimization, stateful application
inspection, session-based classification and control of network
traffic. The SCE solution allows for the detection and control of
network applications including: web browsing, multimedia streaming, and
peer-to-peer (P2P).

This Security Advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities are independent of each other.

  * System vulnerability to SSH login activity

A vulnerability impacting the SCE SSH server may be triggered during SSH
login activity, resulting in system instability or a reload of the SCE.
Specific SSH processes may encounter temporary resource unavailability
if called within aggressive intervals.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsi68582 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2008-0534.

  * SSH login activity leads to illegal Input/Output operations

A second vulnerability exists in the SCE SSH server that may be
triggered with normal SSH traffic to the SCE management interface
occurring in conjunction with other management tasks. During this event,
an illegal IO operation may impact the SCE management agent, requiring a
reboot of the SCE to recover management access.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsh49563 and has been
assigned CVE ID CVE-2008-0536.

  * SCE SSH authentication sequence anomaly

A third vulnerability exists in the SCE SSH server that may also be
triggered during the SSH login process but unrelated to login attempt
frequency or other concurrent management tasks. This issue is triggered
by the usage of specific SSH credentials that attempt to change the
authentication method, resulting in an authentication sequence anomaly
impacting system stability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsm14239 and has been
assigned CVE ID CVE-2008-0535.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory based
on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in
this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.
