eh? have you kept up with UK politics recently. No heads roll
with 'new labour' - no matter what massive messes they make of
things.  petrol prices 2x higher than when they came into power.
rail network that still fails a couple of times each season.
10p tax fiasco. no idea about technology.

loss of internet for some short time while it all gets fixed
up?  perhaps they'd lose a by-election over it. nothing more.
