http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080521-cvp.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

CVP software versions prior to 4.0(2)_ES14 for the 4.0.x release,
4.1(1)_ES11 for the 4.1.x release, and 7.0(1) for the 7.x release are
vulnerable.

Note: CVP systems running software release 3.x are not vulnerable.

CVP systems running software release 3.x are not vulnerable. CVP systems
running version 7.0(1) or later are not vulnerable. No other Cisco
products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP), which is part of Cisco
Customer Interaction Network solution, provides customer voice and
video self-service integration. Using CVP, organizations can provide
intelligent, personalized self-service over the phone, allowing
customers to efficiently retrieve the information they need from the
contact center.

There are three different user roles within CVP: superuser,
administrator, and read-only access. A vulnerability exists in CVP
where a user with an administrator role can create, modify, or delete a
superuser account, which has greater system privileges.

This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug ID CSCsj93874 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2008-2053.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in
this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding VSS

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be
bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_warranties_item09186a008088e31f.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for software
upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreements with third-party support organizations, such
as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for guidance and assistance with the
appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or fix
is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it is
deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service
contract, and customers who purchase through third-party vendors but are
unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale
should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance
Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to a
free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested
through the TAC.
