Subject:  Pointless Post

I have nothing to say but since I can just make a post and say nothing of substance like the ones I have been receiving I decided to say thank you with this pointless post.

Maybe I should add the name netdev and then everyone will reply with hate post and cause it to run on for weeks.

Thanks for nothing....
