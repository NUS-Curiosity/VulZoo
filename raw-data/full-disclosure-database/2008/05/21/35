-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Cerulean Studios Trillian Pro.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the header parsing code for the msn
protocol. When processing the X-MMS-IM-FORMAT header, certain attributes
are copied into a buffer located on the stack without any length
verification which can eventually lead to code execution with the
privileges of the user that is running the application.

and is available at http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/downloads/
