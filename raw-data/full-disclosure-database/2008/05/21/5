How will the company get pwned with a Cisco rootkit if the
presentation doesn't go ahead and HD Moore can't work out how to code
a script kiddie point and click tool to make him even more famous with
the script kid community than the already is?

We all know the HD Moore's of the world have a vested interest to stay
current with the script kid community, and whoever releases a Cisco
rootkit tool will be crowned king of info sec in the script kid
community.

Its HD Moore's final fantasy and it will become reality on Thursday if
you get your way, Valdis.

All the best,
