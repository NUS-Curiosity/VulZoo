Smoke Detector + Webcam = cheapo RNG

I know some highly secure operations (eg: web casinos, using Geiger 
counters and background radiation) use a version of this for their RNGs, 
and random.org does it with RF (radios listening to static) .. do 
patches exist for OpenSSL to use hardware devices? (short of a hack to 
take something like the above and pipe it to /dev/random, etc).
