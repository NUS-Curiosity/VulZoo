Of course, if you're trying to write a PoC, you don't need to know how to
code the API - all you need to do is grab the source for the key-tester that
got shipped as part of the OpenSSH patch and snarf out the nicely enumerated
list of all vulnerable keys, and use that list as the brute-forcer, 6 per
connection attempt. ;)
