How can you say the cyber world is unlikely to end when Cisco is the
most widely used router on the internet today? Everyone uses Cisco,
all the ISP's and everyone.

Even if the in the know guys secure their routers, there is still a
hell of a lot of people who won't and a rootkit for Cisco will damage
the internet, e-commerce and government!!!

All the best,
