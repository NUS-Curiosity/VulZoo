Tell me,

Do you want this presentation to go ahead, Yes or No?

I will link back to your reply and so will historians.

If you don't listen to n3td3v and Gadi Evron, at least we know we
tried to avert what we see is going to happen.

It won't be our necks on the line, it will be heads within government
which will be rolling who decided to ignore us and that this
presentation was a good idea.

All the best,
