Mr. Wallace,

In your rush to reply, you failed to actually respond to my post.

Again, you use the technique of "Supressed Evidence" to forcefully
reply while not actually responding to the point that was made.

No guarantee is required.  Rootkits and tools already exist.

Backpedaling is meaningless.  You have numerous times violated UK and
international law.

1.  It is obvious to security researchers, Mr. Wallace, that a number
of such tools already exist.
2.  There exist a number of Cisco rootkits that are known to security
researchers.
Mr. Wallace, I am sure that you are thoroughly versed in these things
because of your standing in the security community and your
affiliation with Global Intelligence Services.  So, why do you
repeatedly cast aspersions on HD Moore?
