Subject: Tool for SSL Proxy mitm

Hello,

I'm looking for a SSL proxy to do a mitm against a specific software.
Since there is certificate verification, what I'm thinking is to modify
the program certificates so it can communicate with the proxy and then
have the proxy communicate with the final server with legit identification
grabbed from the program.
My objective is to snoop what is being sent. I could try to do some API
hooking but still not explored this on Mac OS X. Anyone knows some good
reading for hooking on Tiger ?

Thanks,
fG
