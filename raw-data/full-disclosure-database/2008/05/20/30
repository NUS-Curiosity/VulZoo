Subject: Re: [NANOG] IOS rootkits

Mr. Wallace,

1.  HD Moore long ago released a kit that could be used to rootkit
Cisco boxes.  This is an obvious statement of fact.
2.  In-the-wild Cisco rootkits have been known to non-eponymous
security researchers for a considerable time.
3.  You have said that HD More is a global threat.
4.  You have repeatedly defamed/slandered/libeled HD Moore among a
global community of peers and coworkers.

I am providing this opportunity for you to show a correlation between
the current existence of rootkits for Cisco systems and the current
existence of tools from HD Moore.
