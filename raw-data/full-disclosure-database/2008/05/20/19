Subject: An account of the Estonian Internet War

About a year ago after coming back from Estonia I promised I'd send in an 
account of the Estonian "war". The postmortem analysis and recommendations 
I later wrote for the Estonian CERT are not yet public.

A few months ago I wrote an article for the Georgetown Journal of 
International Affairs, covering the story of what happened there, in 
depth. The journal owns the copyright so I had no way of sending that 
along either. I wasn't about to email saying "go buy a copy".

Mostly silly articles kept popping up with misguided to wrong information 
about what happened in Estonia, and when an Estonian student was arrested 
for participating, some in our community even jumped up to say "it was 
just some student". Ridiculous.

This is the "war" that made politicians aware of cyber security and entire 
countries scared, NATO to "respond" and the US to send in "help". 
It deserved a better understanding for that alone, whatever actually 
happened there.

I was there to help, but I just deliver the account. The heroes of the 
story are the Estonian ISP and banking security professionals and the 
CERT (Hillar Aarelaid and Aivar Jaakson).

Apparently the Journal made my article available in PDF form by a third 
party:

Battling Botnets and Online Mobs
Estonia's Defense Efforts during the Internet War

It is not technical, I hope you find it useful.
