 Description
_______________

Altiris deployment solution is a suite installed to manage the 
configuration and operation of machines on the network. SQL Server 
is used as the backend database. 

Altiris deployment solution listens for connections from the Altiris
client on port 402. It is possible to make a request that will 
result in the exploitation of a SQL Injection vulnerability. This 
leads to database access under the context of the Deployment server,
which typically then allows, command execution under the context of 
the SQL Server.

Note that through access to the SQL server, it is possible to take 
control of all clients managed by the server.
_______________

 Details
_______________

When a client machine that is running Altiris client 'comes alive'
it makes contact with the Deployment server and sends a 
notification packet to alert the server that the client machine 
is available. 

This packet is an ASCII based packet with a terminating NULL 
character.

At least two of the strings contained in this packet can be used 
to inject arbitrary SQL syntax into a SQL call, resulting in 
SQL injection.
