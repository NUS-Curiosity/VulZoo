Subject: Re: Fwd: 0day auctions, should they be outlawed?

It's futile trying to use the law to change things.
It will simply force people into the shadows. Which today involves
using tor and some Russian web money account.

I read a slogan from before my time, in a book: "If source is outlawed
outlaws will have source" - same applies to zero days.

Anyway I don't think it should be Illegal. I own a set of lock picks -
I don't intend to break into someone's house. And if I did I'd go to
jail (for the burglary and being equipped with picks), untill then I'm
innocent. The UKs law has an attitude like that - I like it!
Resources should go into actually preventing crimes taking place. Not
stumbling around hoping that making it awkward for criminals to get
the tools they need will make a difference.
