What do you mean 'fuck the vendors put them on fd'? what kind of pratice
are you running?

Are you trying to say everyone who posts vulnerabilities on fd has your
mind set of 'fuck the vendors'?

Are you trying to say this is a 'fuck the vendors' mailing list? If so
this isn't a very polite mailing list is it?

Please refrain from future language of this nature, as not everyone who
posts to fd has a 'fuck the vendors' mind set.

You are a very rude person not the kind of person everyone on fd agrees
with your language of 'fuck the vendors', you could put it in a more
carefully constructed manner as not to be so rude.

You are the worst kind of individual to be posting to fd with your mind
set of 'fuck the vendors'.

Trust me not everyone who posts to fd has your mentality of 'fuck the
vendors'.

Does this mean you are wanting the vendors to be fucked?

You are running borderline on unethical, and this list is full of
whitehats like me who get angry when blackhats come on the list and
think they can behave in a nature thats unethical.

You should learn some manners and go wash your mouth out with soap and
water.
