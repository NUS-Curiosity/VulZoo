Subject: Bluetooth keyloggers?

Hi List,

Just wondering if anyone has technical feedback/musings on the
emerging bluetooth keyloggers available, such as the following
products:

1.  http://www.wirelesskeylogger.com/index.php
2.  http://www.keyear.com/articles_pages/BTKeyEar2.html
4.  Other commercially offered products?
3.  Any custom kit/gear folks have cooked up, and are willing to talk
about, brining to a conference, etc.?

Specifically I'm looking to find out more concerning these attributes:

* Remote discovery of these devices (active and passive) via
bluetooth, localhost device discovery, any other means, etc.
* Countermeasures, any and all, including isolated "jamming" and, if
feasible, control of data flow or "injection" of false data
* Fingerprinting (a la "Blueprinting" -
http://trifinite.org/trifinite_stuff_blueprinting.html)
* Real-world performance in light of interference (signal and obstacles)
* Any other "stuff" -- honeypots, long-distance snarfage, creative
applications, automation, etc. ;-)

Off list comments are fine too.

Cheers,
--scm
