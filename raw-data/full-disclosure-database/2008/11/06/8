@ alessandro telami
Most antivirus , nowadays locks there processesAVG 8.0.173 and older
doesn't. At the time, i'm writing this lines there are public
computers in my local area that can be used to infect.

Note: This is usefull for hack tools execution or pay-per-install schemes.

Note 2: An automatic POC with source is already made.
