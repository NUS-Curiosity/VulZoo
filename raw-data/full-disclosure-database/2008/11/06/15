Subject: Re: Bluetooth keyloggers?


Hi,
SM> * Remote discovery of these devices (active and passive) via
SM> bluetooth, localhost device discovery, any other means, etc.
Passive detection is always possible
Active (as in scan(query) detection depends on keylogger setup - I would guess no

SM> * Countermeasures, any and all, including isolated "jamming" and, if
SM> feasible, control of data flow or "injection" of false data
Jamming is always possible, injection depends on protocol usage
