Because the cut-n-paste bloggers on funsec are up-front about it, and
don't start off with "my sources tell me..."

The *real* problem here is that when they cut-n-paste a URL about Intercage
or McColo or similar, you know two things:

1) They almost certainly were more involved in it than the cut-n-paste says.
2) You weren't.

And it bugs the crap out of you.
