Subject: Fredrick Diggle Security is looking for a few
	good men (or mediocre women)

Fredrick Diggle Security has taken the the world wide web by storm in
recent years with disclosures in some of the most popular software
ever written including

- The Internet
- Notepad
- The Linux
- Fredrick Diggle Security execve exploit program

Due to the massive feedback they have received Fredrick Diggle
Security is now in a position where it needs to hire several
individuals to pick up some of the slack.


Did you ever want to work for the "best" at something? (google code
search regexs)
Even better -- do you want to work *with* the best at something?
(Fredrick Diggle... duh)
Would like a chance to become *one of* the best at something? (XSS maybe?)
Do you want to become an expert at web application security? (and
eventually write a book/give a blackhat presentation)
Do you want to learn the ins and outs of general software security?
(as well as the what-have-yous)
Do you want to become legitimate hacker? (And be invited to the cool
kids channels on IRC)
Would you like the challenge of testing your skills and your mettle
and hack some of the most important and famous software on the planet?
(PHP guestbooks beware)
Would you like to see how some of the largest websites in the world
actually work, and rethink your assumptions about the Internet? (Is it
really tubes after all?)
If your answer to any of these is yes, then you want to work for
WhiteHat^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HFredrick Diggle Security, and we just may have
a place for you.
