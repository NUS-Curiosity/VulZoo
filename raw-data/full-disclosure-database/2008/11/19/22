The virus is believed to be the Mytob worm, which spreads via e-mail
and plants a backdoor Trojan on infected computers that can be used to
remotely take control of the machine, according to security firm
Sophos.

"There will, no doubt, be concerns that the confidentiality of
patients' data may have been put at risk, and the hospitals will
surely be keen to reassure the public that security has been
maintained," Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos,
wrote in a post on his blog.
