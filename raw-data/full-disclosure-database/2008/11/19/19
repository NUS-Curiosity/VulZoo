BNP members have told BBC News they have received threatening and
abusive phone calls and e-mails after a leaked document was published
online.

The membership list includes police officers, who are banned from BNP
membership, teachers and soldiers.

It includes names, addresses, telephone numbers and jobs of 12,000 people.

It has been removed from the blog it was published on after protests
by BNP leaders but members say they are still receiving threatening
messages.
