Hi.

Please stop sending your mails, belonging to wrong message routing from
Stadt Salzgitter, to the complete fd list!

The mails, you are receiving, are bounces. Keep in mind, that the sender
is a german city, so you are talking to german bureaucrats that don't
work before 9 a.m.!

So long,
Holger Librenz
