why don't you complain about cut-n-paste bloggers on funsec who don't
have any unique information of their own and just copy&paste lines
from the written media? why are you spear targeting me, when lord
evron & co do exactly the same thing. or don't you have a problem with
cut-n-paste bloggers and infact you're just knit-picking over words
that *i* copy&paste for the benefit of others? it just seems rich that
you talk about cut-n-paste bloggers when thats all funsec is and is
all lord evron, paul ferguson and juha-matti ever do. are you just
jealous that i have managed to get such a following in the security
community that at present i have a mailing list group of 5000
subscribers and growing? go and screw your self valdis and give your
mustache a brush down. thanks :)
