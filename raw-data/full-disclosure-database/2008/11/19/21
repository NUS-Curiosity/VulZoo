He's using the term "self-contained" to mean "100% of the machines on the
net are infected so it can't get much worse".  You know, kind of how a
fire will eventually go out once it runs out of combustibles.

(And yes, I know there's tire dump, peat, and coal mine fires that have
been smoldering for 30-40 year now... "eventually" doesn't always mean
"in your lifetime")
