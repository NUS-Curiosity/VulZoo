Police are investigating a suspicious car fire close to the alleged
home of a British National Party (BNP) member.

West Yorkshire Police said firefighters and police officers were
called to the blaze on Eighth Avenue in Windy Bank, Liversedge, on
Thursday.

It is believed the car, which was parked at the time, did not belong
to anyone connected to the BNP.

Police confirmed that one of the lines of investigation concerned the
publication of the list of BNP members.

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said nobody was hurt.

Charred debris

Asked about the proximity of the vehicle to a BNP member's home, he
said: "The cause of the damage and any potential motive all form part
of the current investigation."

Eight houses in Eighth Avenue remained cordoned off by police on Friday.

A charred patch of debris was visible on the road and path outside one
of the red brick semi-detached houses.

There are eight people with Liversedge addresses on the BNP membership
list which was leaked on the internet.

The BNP said the list of 12,000 activists, which included names,
addresses, home telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, dated from
2007.
