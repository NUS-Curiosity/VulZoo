Subject: IRC Security Channels

After a week of mostly chatter I think we should have a productive thread.

Security related IRC Channels.

Would anyone mind sharing a list?  Or collectively combining one.

I'll start:
irc.2600.net <irc://irc.2600.net/offthehook> (hosts channels related to 2600
magazine.)
