Yeah, especially when the random folks don't even understand the problem space.

You ever consider the possibility that some of those machines *need* the
removable media, because they are sneaker-netting highly sensitive data
around (the sort that you'd be upset if it was on a network-accessible
machine)?  That puts constraints on what you can and can't do to secure
the removable media.

It's a bad idea to epoxy-glue the USB slots when that's the only way to
get data in or out of the machine.  Kinda boat-anchors it.

Having said that, it *is* a good idea to configure the box so the removable
media is flagged non-execute - unless the removable media includes the
executable that's the machine's reason for being, but the media has to go
back into the GSA-rated safe when you're done working with it.

(And yes, there *are* boxes out there that don't *have* permanent storage - you
have to check the removable storage in and out of the vault.)
