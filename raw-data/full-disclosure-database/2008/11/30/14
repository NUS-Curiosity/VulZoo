The SANS Internet Storm Center has been doing this for ages.

It has the advantage of being data driven, using the DShield reports as
a primary sensor mechanism.

>Hi,

>It is time to take an example from Homeland Security and define codes
>of color for cyber-warfare threat levels. I propose the following:
>
>Green level: There is negligible threat to online security.
>Yellow level : There is a minimal level of threat, and this must be
>monitored and contained.
>Orange level: This level of threat indicates there are parties who are
>actively engaging in cyber-warfare. Caution is required when online.
>Red level: This level indicates a full blown cyber-war. It indicates
>very high probability of all communications being intercepted.
>
>While homeland security's implementation does not seem to have a real
>world merit, such a threat level would certainly be very useful in the
>online security realm. Please disseminate this announcement of the
>project Chroma levels for online security. The immediate mission of
>the project is to be picked up by the antivirus and security tools
>vendors, so as to add the color codes to their products and provide
>users with a tangible measure of their online security.
>
>Current status: Threat level Yellow.
