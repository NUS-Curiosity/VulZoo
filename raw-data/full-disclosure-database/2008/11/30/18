Subject: /bin/login gives root to group utmp

There is a group-utmp-to-root privilege escalation vulnerability in
/bin/login in Debian, and I expect in all other Linux distros.
For details and exploit please see
 
  http://bugs.debian.org/505271
 
Currently am not aware of any group utmp issues (that could be
leveraged to get root).

Cheers,
