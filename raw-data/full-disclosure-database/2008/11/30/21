So have you actually come up with a feasible metric for measuring the
current state of malicious/non-malicious traffic on the tubes vs the current
state of global tube defenses or is n3td3v's abstract world just rubbing off
on you and all you have is a list of colors and a crazy and horribly
unrealistic idea in your head?

Did you guys just complete ignore the FD charter when you subscribed to the
list or what?
