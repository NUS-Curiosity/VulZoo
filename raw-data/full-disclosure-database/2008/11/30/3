Hi

I agree with you. It's just these 'underground communities' tend to be
a bunch of kiddies playing with milworm, bots, and asking help with
basic programming.

Where's the original ideas, the research, and the worth-while discussion?

I guess I described an extreme scenario, but you get the picture.

Really, tell me. If there was a friendly, 'academic'(as aposed to
'business-like') online community then show me, I'd join up in a
flash.

I'm your best best friend.

Usually I like it when you contradict me, it might help me learn. Just
don't be so angry.
