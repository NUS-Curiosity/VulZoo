Subject: Project Chroma: A color code for the state of
	cyber security

Hi,

It is time to take an example from Homeland Security and define codes
of color for cyber-warfare threat levels. I propose the following:

Green level: There is negligible threat to online security.
Yellow level : There is a minimal level of threat, and this must be
monitored and contained.
Orange level: This level of threat indicates there are parties who are
actively engaging in cyber-warfare. Caution is required when online.
Red level: This level indicates a full blown cyber-war. It indicates
very high probability of all communications being intercepted.

While homeland security's implementation does not seem to have a real
world merit, such a threat level would certainly be very useful in the
online security realm. Please disseminate this announcement of the
project Chroma levels for online security. The immediate mission of
the project is to be picked up by the antivirus and security tools
vendors, so as to add the color codes to their products and provide
users with a tangible measure of their online security.

Current status: Threat level Yellow.
