Subject: Re: Indian allegations alarm Pakistan

Aren't they just a bunch of kids trying to brag on IRC that they
hacked their 'enemy' country? Maybe they don't like them because of
propaganda is telling them Indians did the bombing. Or maybe they,
like most kids, they've no idea about current affairs and just want to
prove themselves good in their own little world.

Like what happned with Russia vs. Georgia.
