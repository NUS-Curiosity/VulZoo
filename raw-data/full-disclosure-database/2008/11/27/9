This is not really a feature of the browsers but of the underlying library
routines that do the resolving (yes, most OS' have this interesting feature).

It looks like while most browsers just pass the host part to the library
routines, the proxy (proxies) that you tested don't but do some checking
first, or they use different library routines.

We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that
works. Some say that should read Microsoft instead of technology.
