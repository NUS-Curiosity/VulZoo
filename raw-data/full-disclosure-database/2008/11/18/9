Dear Juha,

Is there a reason that you and your security team decided not to
cover these breaking bits of important information security news in
your blog?  What merits security news being reposted to this list,
vs the quality of security news that earns column in your e-zine?
I used to depend on your website as my single source of relevant
information security news, knowing you and your co-conspirators
would blab about anything I need to know but now I am developing
some serious doubts as to your dedication to this community and the
integrity of your services.

Can you please clarify?
