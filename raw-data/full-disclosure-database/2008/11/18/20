Subject: New hackers defacing the internets

Fredrick Diggle has recently noted an upswelling of defacement on the
internet and believes it is worth noting. Most notably Matasano
Security has apparently been "owned" and their popular internet "blog"
replaced with a defacement page.

http://www.matasano.com/log/

The group goes by a number of names including "404", "404 Bandits",
"404 Not Found", and simply "Not found". This is believed to be linked
to terrorism and possibly communism. Other recent defacements of note
include the following.

http://www.google.com/404bandits
http://www.foxnews.com/404
http://icanhascheezburger.com/notfoundbandits

This could be the beginning of something bigger. If you notice
anything suspicious please contact your local law enforcement agents.

YAY! from Brazilia
