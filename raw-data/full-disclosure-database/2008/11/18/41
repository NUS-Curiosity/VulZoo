N3td3v,

Please refrain from making fun of mustaches, coca-cola products & new  
kids on the block. Otherwise, you will be off of my buddylist.  How  
would you feel if we starting making fun of pimples?

Btw: since I have been off your list I have been missing the daily  
emails of natural male enhancement suppliments and investment  
opportunities.

Best regards,
Trollie
