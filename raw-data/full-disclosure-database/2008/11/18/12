Three London hospitals have been forced to shut down their entire
computer systems for at least 24 hours after being hit by a virus.

St Bartholomew's (Barts) in the City, the Royal London Hospital in
Whitechapel and The London Chest Hospital in Bethnal Green are
affected.

A spokesman said well-rehearsed emergency procedures were in place.

Theatres and outpatient departments had remained operational, and
patients with appointments were still being seen.

The spokesman said walk-in patients were being accepted at accident
and emergency, and processed using manual back-up systems.

But ambulances were being diverted to neighbouring hospitals to ensure
that seriously ill patients did not suffer as a result of the slower
manual systems being used.

The patient transport system used by elderly or disabled patients to
attend routine appointments has also been disrupted.

The spokesman said the virus was "not malicious", and the infection
was "self-contained".
