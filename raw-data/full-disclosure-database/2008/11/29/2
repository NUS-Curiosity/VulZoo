You're taking yourself into a false sense of security there. If you
sit on a mailing list like full-disclosure and expect everything to be
brought to you on a plate you are mistaken. You can't take the lazy
bum approach to security and say, everything I need to know is on
full-disclosure. From my experience the majority of stuff goes on in
the underground communities, full-disclosure is only essentially an
announcement list, the rest is going on in individual communities.
What you need to do is get yourself dug into the underground
communities, you need to get yourself informants and build
relationships with members of communities, you _really_ can't sit on
full-disclosure and expect every security community and hacker
community to bring everything to you. I'm not talking about the n3td3v
group here because luckily I forward the key stuff to full-disclosure
for the lazy bums who can't be bothered to engaged in individual
communities and their members. Let me say though, the real
intelligence isn't on full-disclosure its elsewhere.
