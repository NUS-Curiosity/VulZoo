Excellent - avoid the main point, focus on the minor point. To get
back to the major point, I'll ask a question: How is freedom served by
your recommendation?

If you wish to know where I live, google me.

This kind of management is always bad, in that it means decreasing the
ability of free people to ply their trade, or even to explore the
world and gain knowledge on their own.

To rebut your response on the minor point, I'll ask another question -
how much do you think home invasion burglaries would diminish in your
country if ordinary folks could own effective means of defense?
