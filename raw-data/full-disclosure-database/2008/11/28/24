Subject: Re: im so done.

TBH, i have joined those mailing lists for a reason... when it comes to
something out of topic and ridiculous enough, I DONT ANSWER (but right now
im fed up :@). I think you should all do the same..

IMHO this keeps going because someone replies.... what if only 2-4 people
spoke on such matters? The matter will be dropped. So just refrain
attention..

Thanks
