Subject: DC4420 - DEFCON London - Christmas Meet - Tuesday
	2nd December, 2008

Yes folks, it's that time of the month/year again...

This will be our last meeting of 2008, so we're planning to make it a 
goodun!!! All are welcome, but remember - we operate Fight Club rules... 
If this is your first meet, you *will* speak! :)

We've got extended bar time at the upstairs bar at our usual venue, so 
we don't need to relocate after the meeting if our livers need further 
punishment...

For those that haven't been before, we have exclusive access to the 1st 
floor bar from 19:00, talks start at 19:30, and there is excellent food 
and real ale to accompany our equally excellent speakers...

This month's lineup includes:

   - Bluetooth fun & Wargames - Christer & Mr K (long talk, double slot)

   - 'hacking rogue for fun & profit (mostly profit)' - freakyclown

   - Coring BlueCore - Mark

and, of course, the noobs... :P

CFP is open for Jan/Feb meetings - please send your proposals to me 
and/or alien (alien@...en8.org.uk)

I hope to see you all there!

Pirates rule!

cheers,
MM
