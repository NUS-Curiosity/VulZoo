Subject: im so done.

n3td3v/andrew wallace of the uk

u r a waste of time.  a waste of air.  i m done w/ u.

u wont admit u know nothing, u dont do anything worth a thing.  u dont
do anything original

hell, u dont even blog original shit.

if ur goal was 2 get me to leave, u win.  im out.  i think ive proved
my point.  others will follow in my footsteps. they already have.

if u start lying, start ranting, start reposting other's work. ill b back.
if u get back up 2 ur old tricks, ill b back.

i will no longer reply 2 u, unless u get out of line and start down ur
path of lies and deceit again, then ill b back.

b original.

get a blog.  get ur "followers" to read ur blog, post sum comments of
those that agree w/ u.  post ur research on the blog.

research sumthing.  do real work.

its not just u either.

juha and the others from funsec -- u need 2 do the same.  do original
research and quit just reposting.  i know u do a bit, but stop
reposting.
gadi -- u need 2 do the same 2.  i know u do original work, and ill
give u credit for it, but u still repost bullshit.  u r no better than
n3td3v when it comes 2 this.

i apologize for those inboxes that i have filled in the past.
n3td3v/andrew wallace from the uk, learn. read.  get a job.  post
original work.  admit u r a foney, and b real.  right now, u suck.  u
r a liar.  a *liar*.

im leaving 4 absolutely no other reason than i am tired of replying.
thats it.  dont read anything into it, its not a vast conspiracy from
mi5 2 shut me up.

so, for now, i am gone.  n3td3v, u r a disgrace 2 the community by
calling urself 1 of us.
