Subject: Re: NTLM Multiprotocol Replay attacks

Its a completely new tool as it does not share code with the old smbrelay
however, as the main goal is to replay NTLM authentication challenges, i
decided to name it "smbrelay", like the great cdc tool.
smbrelay3 have been tested against windows 2000/xp/2003 and works fine.
