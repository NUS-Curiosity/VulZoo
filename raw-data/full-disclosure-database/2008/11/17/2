	Exploit

Point taken! :) 

Actually I wanted to have separate section for putting the exploits I have
published for vulnerabilities already discovered by someone else; but later
thought of putting all in the same page with a note indicating highlighting
those vulnerabilities which are not mine but the exploits are... 

Hence the text is now changed to - 

"All the vulnerabilities/exploits listed here are all researched and
discovered by me except the one highlighted in blue (In this case the
exploit is by me)."


Thanks for pointing out this.... -d

Exploit

not really fair to say "All the vulnerabilities/exploits listed here are 
all researched and discovered by me." on your page when in fact you 
didn't discover this one (didn't check the others listed there).
