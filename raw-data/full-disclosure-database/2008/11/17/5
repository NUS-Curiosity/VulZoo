Why do we as a community reserve so much time on criminal hackers?

We should bring in a law to stop criminal hackers from profiteering
from their crimes or otherwise reaching any kind of stardom.

Leaving these "stars" to profiteer is breeding the next generation of
criminal hacker.

I'm disgusted.
