I'm afraid you got that one wrong. The surveillance laws in Germany
are not about the secret services, which already have the access they
wanted (and had it since their (re-)creation after WWII). The main
beneficiary of the new surveillance competences is the
"Bundeskrimialamt", the German federal office of criminal
investigations, who are "extended" legally to the state of a de-facto
secret service. And that's the point of criticism here: it mixes secret
service competences with the normal executive pillar of the state.

However, I'm not sure that belongs here.
