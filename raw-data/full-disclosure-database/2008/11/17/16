Oh, *usually* they're allowed to talk, write, give interviews, and so on - they
just aren't allowed to personally make any money by doing so.  So if they
got $25K for an interview, that money would usually be forfeit and go to
a victim's compensation fund or similar.

The details will of course vary by jurisdiction and exactly what the
final sentencing report says - for instance, Mitnick had a 7-year ban on
writing about it (which suggests I'm getting senile - I'd manage to overlook
the fact it had expired when I commented on his being on shaky ground).
