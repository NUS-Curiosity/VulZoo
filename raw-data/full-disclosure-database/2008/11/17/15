It's generally accepted that convicted criminals forfeit large sections of
their "rights".  Being in a jail or prison is certainly cutting down on their
"right" to liberty - and if you're a convicted felon, you also usually lose
your "rights" to vote or own firearms.  In general, the various branches
of government are free to restrict any other "rights" they choose, as long
as they manage to stay clear of the Eighth Amendment prohibition against
"cruel and unusual punishment".
