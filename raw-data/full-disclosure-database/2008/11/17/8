You might want to actually investigate what the law really is in your area.

In most areas, there already *are* laws that specifically prohibit or
severely restrict a convicted felon's ability to profit from their
notoriety by selling interviews/books/film rights/etc regarding the
crime in question.  This is why OJ Simpson will probably see next to
zero profits from any "How I did it" books he tries to sell (the victim's
family has first claim on that money), and why Kevin Mitnick can write
a book about 'The Art of Deception' and make money off it, but he'd probably
be on shaky ground if he wrote a book *specifically* about the hacks that
got him landed in jail.
