Subject: Re: Securing our computers?

a discussion on n3td3v mailing list is talking about stateless
computing to take the security responsibility away from the single mom
and retired couple crowd. some on the mailing list think that is the
answer to security problems, but i don't agree i think its just
shifting the problems to different places. again, if stateless
computing and cloud computing is going to become a big thing for joe
average sixpack, then the issue of trust comes into play again. are we
to trust big corporations with stateless computing if all our data is
to be held at one central data farm and for the majority of joe
average sixpack computers to become something that resembles dumb
terminals.
