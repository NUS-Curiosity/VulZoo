i'll be lobbying soon to outlaw 0day auctions, this means the banning
of 0day sales on the internet. i've noticed an increased level in 0day
sales lately on mailing lists, and web sites... i think this should be
against the law. let me know what your opinions are on this, so i can
form what im going to say when i lobby people about it. cheers.
