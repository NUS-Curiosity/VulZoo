Like I said, there are problems with this :)

My original point, which has become a bit lost in this discussion, was that
'fixing the user' is a very difficult goal to achieve and other methods to
improve home PC security should be looked at.  The suggestion of a 'NAP
enabled router' was meant as an example of how other devices in the home
that users are less likely to 'screw around with' could be used to increase
the overall security of the user .  NAP may or may not be helpful here but
there may be ways that the home router could be utilised better?

This is getting offtopic for FD though.  Happy to continue this off list.
