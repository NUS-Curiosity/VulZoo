Actually Russ - you're not quite right on this one.  Down in the trenches,
the various A/V techies *do* cooperate across company boundaries an awful
lot - although actual signatures aren't much use to exchange because the
engines that interpret them are proprietary and dissimilar, samples get
exchanged *all* the time (where do you *think* all those samples that get
sent to virustotal.com go? :), and hints/suggestions of what they've managed
to RE of the sample's structure and behavior - "Hey, it's using the WizBang
packer, and you probably wanna look at this registry entry, and...."

Think for a moment: how come Symantec can release a pattern only 3 hours
after they see the first sample - and they already know what their competitors
are calling the critter?
