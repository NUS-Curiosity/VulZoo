Actually I think a new game should be created that revolves around stalking
n3td3v. Points would be awarded for the quickest response to each of his
worthless posts. At the end of the month a Stalker of the Month could be
selected and given a prize. Bonus points could be given out for the most
degrading responses. I think it could be a lot of fun.
