Given the number of things that simply aren't detected/removed by current
AV solutions, what makes you think that this would make any real measurable
difference?

For that matter, what makes you think that this hypothetical NAP would be
any more secure?  Hint 1: consider the security of most consumer-grade
cablemodems before you answer.  Hint 2: How does this NAP identify that
you're behind on AV updates?

And somehow, I doubt people will buy an XBox 360 that happens to have IE, MS
Office, and an IM client installed on it (even if that's what they actually
*need*).
