It's not a user's fault that C-like languages' runtime is vulnerable by
design. And it's certainly not a user's fault that C-like languages are
being widely used.
It's not a user's fault that most of widely used hardware platforms and
OSes are lacking of any advanced secure task isolation. And it's
certainly not a user's fault that the currently available isolation
functionality is being misused and overestimated everywhere.
It's not a user's fault that most of widely used software, including
OSes, and protocols has been designed and implemented mostly without
security in mind.

It's mostly the industry's fault. And the industry earns much from it.
I wouldn't blame users, because they are a minor evil in this story.
