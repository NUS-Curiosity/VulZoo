There should be a FD listing fee for the 0day so the list can garner a 
commission from the sale.

Absolutely no increase in government should be directed toward 0day sale 
prevention or enforcement.
The answer to these things rarely should incude the words 'government', 
'task' and 'force'.

the latest guy put up an alias that says "anti security" and i guess
demanded money to make the 0day be known, and then there is still no
guarantee that the affected vendor or the government is going to get
wind of the exploit. that means, there is going to need to be a
government task force in place to infiltrate these sales, to make sure
the good guys are getting the info before blackhat elements. is there
already a government strike force in place to buy these "0day offers"?
or are the government sitting on their hand as per usual? im becoming
increasingly frustrated about what is going on. cheers.
