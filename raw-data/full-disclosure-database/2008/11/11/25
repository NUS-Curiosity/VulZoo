	Request]Computer Forensics Officer

Aaron,

 

As Ivan pointed out, I think that knowing the basics principals and
security fundamentals is all you can do. In the field of data forensics
I would recommend having or at least knowing about particular
certifications. EnCase (
http://www.guidancesoftware.com/training/index.aspx ) is the industry
leader in data forensics where techniques and evidence collection have
been recognized by courts worldwide. Data forensics is such a new
market, general IT security is just now being taken seriously, there are
not a ton of established world recognized organizations with published
standards. It just has not matured yet. So I don't think any reasonable
employer would expect you to be an expert in all that is data forensics.

 

I think knowing the regulatory laws regarding data would be your best
place to start. In America you should know about the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
in particular complying with section 404. Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act, FERC/NERC, FFIEC & CLBA, and ITIL. Some
international standards are ISO 17799, EU Directive, and UK Data
Protection.

 

Good Luck.

People, ever thought it may be an entry level position? 

Best advice is to know you your stuff, and in the event you don't know
something, know where to look and how to find it. Look at it this way,
its problem solving. 

eg, Someone at your work is accused of surfing p0rn. What will you do to
gather evidence that may be admissible in court, in the event of the
employee being terminated and a wrongful dismissal case brought. 

Scenario questions are more than likely

cheers
Ivan
