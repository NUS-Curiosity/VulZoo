Interesting variation on the old "it's the rest of the world that is
mad, not me" rationalistion that i hear from all my personality
disordered or psychotic patients

As has been said *many* times before you have your own "sec" group so

That week when you didn't post was so nice, made me realise how much i
hate your juvenile, uninfomed crap.

go and get a job
