	Computer Forensics Officer

People, ever thought it may be an entry level position?

Best advice is to know you your stuff, and in the event you don't know
something, know where to look and how to find it. Look at it this way, its
problem solving.

eg, Someone at your work is accused of surfing p0rn. What will you do to
gather evidence that may be admissible in court, in the event of the
employee being terminated and a wrongful dismissal case brought.

Scenario questions are more than likely

cheers
Ivan
