My intentions are usually good when I start a thread about something, but they are quickly taken down the anti-n3td3v gateway, into all out flameness about how n3td3v's opinion sucks and how great everyone else is on the list. n3td3v is a blogger of cyber security, if you don't like my opinions thats sweet, just don't tell the rest of the list about it, because then I get the blame for it. I want to be able to give my opinion without getting a bad reaction, so why can't the people who don't like me just shut up and get a life on some other mailing list?
