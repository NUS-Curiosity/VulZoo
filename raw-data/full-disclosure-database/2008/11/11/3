Subject: [Cross Post] [Job Interview Guidance Request]
	Computer Forensics Officer

Hi,

I have an interview with a government agency for the post of Computer
Forensics Officer. Has anybody had experience interviewing for a
similar position? I would highly appereciate if anybody could give me
an idea about what to expect in the interview.

I have read through the forensic wiki and electronic evidence
information center sites and other resources on the Internet. I just
need some idea of what to expect in the interview.

Thanks in advance.

Aaron.
