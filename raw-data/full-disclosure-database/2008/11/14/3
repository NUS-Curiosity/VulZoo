Subject: IP-Adresses of German Secret Intelligence Agency
	supposedly leaked

Don't know, if this is the right place for this kind of information. I
also believe it's no big deal but you might want to scan your server
logs for these addresses to see who's watching you.

The PDF contains a list of ip-addresses which seem to be used by the
german "Bundesnachrichtendienst".

Changes to german wikipedia pages committed by those addresses are
listed here (german text):

German blogger Fefe knew about (some of) these adresses inn 2005 already
and notice visits to his site. They were looking for "cold fusion at
home" ("kalte fusion zuhause") and "muslim world outreach".
