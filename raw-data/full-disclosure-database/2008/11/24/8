Subject: Re: [inbox] Re: Fwd: Comment on: USB devices
	spreading viruses

This feature (blocking based on device ID) is also a built in feature
of Windows Server 2008 group policy. An administrator can now
centrally restrict devices from being installed on computers in his
organization. The implementation, though, is not for the
faint-hearted, it requires creating a list of authorized devices and
adding them to the "Allow installation of devices that match any of
these device IDs" under the following group policy tree:

Computer Configuration
 -> Administrative Templates,
   -> System
     -> Device Installation
       -> Device Installation Restrictions

Here are a couple of Technet links that provide more detail on this:
