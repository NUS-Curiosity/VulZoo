Subject: Re: [inbox] Re: Fwd: Comment on: USB devices
	spreading viruses

What i was referring to was having only programs on a corporate white list
run. White listing services are provided by http://www.bit9.com/ and they
have now partnered with Kaspersky to be able ID most programs and anything
else run it in a sandbox.

However your approach to blocking USB devices is better. But this is an
overall approach.
