Subject: Browser Rider v20081124 is out.



Date: 25th of November, 2008


1. What is Browser Rider?


Browser Rider is a hacking framework to build payloads that exploit the browser.


The project aims to provide a powerful, simple and flexible interface to any


client side exploit. Browser Rider is not a new concept. Similar tools such as


BeEF or Backframe exploited the same concept. However most of the other existing 


tools out there are unmainted, not updated and not documented. Browser Rider wants 


to fill those gaps by providing a better alternative.


2. Features


- Easily create powerful payloads and plugins


- Manage payloads automatically with plugins


- All data can be saved in a database


- Obfuscation


- Polymorphism


- Control more than one zombie at a time


- Simple administration panel


3. Where to download it?

- Apache with url_rewrite on


- Targets must have Javascript turned on
