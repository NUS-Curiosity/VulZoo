Dear Valdis,

Need we remind you that you do not speak for the mustache, and that
the mustache speaks for you?  Also do not forget that the mustache
divorced itself from you due to your poor hygiene and ringworms you
caused it to live with.  No one on this list believes the mustache
has anything to do with you anymore.

Regards,
- -al
