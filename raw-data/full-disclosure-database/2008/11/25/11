That, plus Russ didn't even bother to read the fine article:

"And to be clear, the impact would have been to render many (or nearly all)
customers' network-based applications then inoperable. For instance, an Outlook
2000 client wouldn't have been able to communicate with an Exchange 2000 server.

I know the users Russ supports - we'd have needed a body bag for him if
he had chosen that route rather than "not cause a significant impact".

This wasn't a buffer overflow, the problem was that the NTLM protocol was
screwed up by design - and fixing a protocol bug is usually a *lot* more
painful.  If you read between the lines of the article, it appears that MS
added support for a fixed protocol back in XP SP2, and has decided that the
number of pre-SP2 systems out there talking to updated systems has grown small
enough that it's finally practical to flip the switch.  That's pretty much the
only way to change a protocol without a flag-day cutover - ship dual-stack
during a transition, and then flip the switch when few enough old-style
machines are left.

Let's face it - the number of systems that have gotten compromised via
SMBRelay attacks is *far* smaller than the number of boxes pwned just
because they have IE installed and a user at the keyboard. The number of
systems pwned via SMBRelay is *also* a lot smaller than the number of
boxes that would have broken if Microsoft had "fixed" things the way Russ
apparently wanted them to.
