Call For Papers

    The CanSecWest 2009 CFP is now open.

    Deadline is December 8th, 2008.

CanSecWest CALL FOR PAPERS

    VANCOUVER, Canada -- The tenth annual CanSecWest applied
    technical security conference - where the eminent figures
    in the international security industry will get together
    share best practices and technology - will be held in
    downtown Vancouver at the the Sheraton Wall Centre on
    March 18-20, 2009. The most significant new discoveries
    about computer network hack attacks and defenses,
    commercial security solutions, and pragmatic real world
    security experience will be presented in a series of
    informative tutorials.

    The CanSecWest meeting provides international researchers
    a relaxed, comfortable environment to learn from
    informative tutorials on key developments in security
    technology, and collaborate and socialize with their peers
    in one of the world's most scenic cities - a short drive
    away from one of North America's top skiing areas.

    The CanSecWest conference will also feature the
    availability of the Security Masters Dojo expert network
    security sensei instructors, and their advanced, and
    intermediate, hands-on training courses - featuring small
    class sizes and practical application excercises to
    maximize information transfer.

    We would like to announce the opportunity to submit
    papers, and/or lightning talk proposals for selection by
    the CanSecWest technical review committee. This year we
    will be doing one hour talks, and some shorter talk
    sessions.

    Please make your paper proposal submissions before
    December 8th, 2008.

    Some invited papers have been confirmed, but a limited
    number of speaking slots are still available. The
    conference is responsible for travel and acommodations for
    the speakers. If you have a proposal for a tutorial
    session then please email a synopsis of the material and
    your biography, papers and, speaking background to
    secwest09 [at] cansecwest.com . Only slides will be needed
    for the March paper deadline, full text does not have to
    be submitted - but will be accepted if available. This
    year we will be opening up the presentation guidelines to
    include talks not in English (particularly Chinese) which
    we will offer to translate for the speaker if they are not
    a native English speaker.

    The CanSecWest 2009 conference consists of tutorials on
    technical details about current issues, innovative
    techniques and best practices in the information security
    realm. The audiences are a multi-national mix of
    professionals involved on a daily basis with security
    work: security product vendors, programmers, security
    officers, and network administrators. We give preference
    to technical details and new education for a technical
    audience.

    The conference itself is a single track series of
    presentations in a lecture theater environment. The
    presentations offer speakers the opportunity to showcase
    on-going research and collaborate with peers while
    educating and highlighting advancements in security
    products and techniques. The focus is on innovation,
    tutorials, and education instead of product pitches. Some
    commercial content is tolerated, but it needs to be backed
    up by a technical presenter - either giving a valuable
    tutorial and best practices instruction or detailing
    significant new technology in the products.

    Paper proposals should consist of the following
    information:
     1. Presenter, and geographical location (country of
        origin/passport) and contact info (e-mail, postal
        address, phone, fax).
     2. Employer and/or affiliations.
     3. Brief biography, list of publications and papers.
     4. Any significant presentation and educational
        experience/background.
     5. Topic synopsis, Proposed paper title, and a one
        paragraph description.
     6. Reason why this material is innovative or significant
        or an important tutorial.
     7. Optionally, any samples of prepared material or
        outlines ready.
     8. Will you have full text available or only slides?
     9. Language of preference for submission.
    10. Please list any other publications or conferences
        where this material has been or will be
        published/submitted.

    Please include the plain text version of this information
    in your email as well as any file, pdf, sxw, ppt, or html
    attachments.

    Please forward the above information to secwest09 [at]
    cansecwest.com to be considered for placement on the
    speaker roster, or have your lightning talk scheduled. If
    you contact anyone else at our organization please ensure
    you also cc the submission address with your proposal or
    it may be omitted from the review process.
