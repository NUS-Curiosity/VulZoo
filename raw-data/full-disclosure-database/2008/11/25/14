No shit, Sherlock.  Microsoft is a *corporation*.  As such, they need to
make trade-offs and decisions based on the bottom line. So it boils down to:

1) How many corporate accounts, and how much revenue, was lost when the
company said "Screw this, we're *SO* pissed at the fact you haven't fixed
the SMBRelay issue that we're going to Linux instead"?

2) How many would have said "Screw this. If our Outlook 2000 client can't
talk to our Exchange 2000 server, we may as well run Linux instead."?

End result: They decide against the quick but majorly disruptive fix, and
look for ways they can deploy a fix over several releases without breaking
anything so badly that customers jump ship.
