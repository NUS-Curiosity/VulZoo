Subject: New tool and paper for Oracle forensics...

Hey all,
I've just posted a new tool and paper for Oracle forensics. The tool, 
orablock, allows a forensic investigator to dump data from a "cold" Oracle 
data file - i.e. there's no need to load up the data file in the database 
which would cause the data file to be modified, so using orablock preserves 
the evidence. Orablock can also be used to locate "stale" data - i.e. data 
that has been deleted or updated. It can also be used to dump SCNs for data 
blocks which can be useful during the examination of a compromised Oracle 
box. Indeed, this is the subject of the paper "Oracle Forensics Part 7: 
Using the Oracle System Change Number in Forensic Examinations". Both the 
tool (which compiles on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows) and the paper are 
available from http://www.databasesecurity.com/.
Cheers,
David Litchfield
