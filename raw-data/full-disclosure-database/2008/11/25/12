Really?  And links, elinks, lynx, dillo and others are affected too?
What about my Firefox that (I assume) has no ffdshow code inside it and
there are no ffdshow-related plugins coupled to it?  Is it vulnerable?

I am really appreciate that you're searching for the issues and
releasing advisories -- thanks for doing this!  But, please, use the
appropriate wording, or your advisories will lead to controversial
feelings.

Sorry for being a bit bluffy :(
