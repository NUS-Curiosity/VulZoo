Urleet: I do believe that Gadi's work with the Israeli CIRT is both common
knowledge and not under NDA.  Or at least the fact that he worked there isn't
under NDA - I'm sure lots of specific incidents are still covered.

Israel is a big enough country network-wise that "I spent several years
working at the national CIRT" buys you a whole lot more credibility than
"I spent several years blogging from my mom's basement".
