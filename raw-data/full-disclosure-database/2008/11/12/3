Subject: Re: [Full-disclosure] What Christianity means to me

I'm about to unsubscribe thanks to these stupid arguments, rants, trash talking, and especially n3td3v.  n3td3v, I honestly agree with you half the time and disagree the other half, but I must ask, is this the place for this?  I mean seriously, is this a security list or a soap opera?  And n3td3v, although I sometimes agree with you, you really don't put up an intelligent argument to support your views.  Let's try to keep this a security list and not a middle school playground.  I could be wrong, but if I'm not I'm unsubscribing soon.
