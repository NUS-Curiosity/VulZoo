And my answer would be that as my job will be to assist senior
forensic officers (and learn on the job as I don't have any prior
experience), if they don't know something then I might seek help from
other sources as the post I am applying for allows fresh graduates
(like myself) to apply. And usually fresh graduates don't have any
professional experience. Academics can not teach a person what they
learn on job.

And I was not asking for any specific questions or answers, I just
wanted to get an idea of what kind of questions do they ask. In
general.

Anyways thanks for your help.


Regards,
Aaron.
