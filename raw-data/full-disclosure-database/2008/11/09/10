this is a thread about pauldotcom that you're in, so the question is
about pauldotcom. don't comment in a thread about pauldotcom if you're
not a supporter of them?

are you a supporter of pauldotcom? you are in a thread and are going
against what im saying, that makes you a supporter of pauldotcom by
default.

get a grip, and keep your mouth shut if you're not a supporter of
pauldotcom. you're making yourself out to be a supporter of pauldotcom
and many people don't like them, so its your choice how you proceed in
the future but i ask you to take further comment with caution to the
wind because your comments could well backfire on you.
