Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Gallery may lead to execution of arbitrary
code, disclosure of local files or theft of user's credentials.

Background
==========

Gallery is an open source web based photo album organizer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/gallery       < 2.2.6                           >= 2.2.6
                                                             *>= 1.5.9

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Gallery 1 and 2:

* Digital Security Research Group reported a directory traversal
  vulnerability in contrib/phpBB2/modules.php in Gallery 1, when
  register_globals is enabled (CVE-2008-3600).

* Hanno Boeck reported that Gallery 1 and 2 did not set the secure
  flag for the session cookie in an HTTPS session (CVE-2008-3662).

* Alex Ustinov reported that Gallery 1 and 2 does not properly handle
  ZIP archives containing symbolic links (CVE-2008-4129).

* The vendor reported a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Gallery
  2 (CVE-2008-4130).

Impact
======

Remote attackers could send specially crafted requests to a server
running Gallery, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code when
register_globals is enabled, or read arbitrary files via directory
traversals otherwise. Attackers could also entice users to visit
crafted links allowing for theft of login credentials.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Gallery 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/gallery-2.2.6"

All Gallery 1 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/gallery-1.5.9"
