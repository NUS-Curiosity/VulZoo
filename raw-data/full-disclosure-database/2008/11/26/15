Sayeth Eric Raymond himself: http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/online-preface.html

"This document (the Jargon File) is in the public domain, to be freely used,
shared, and modified. There are (by intention) no legal restraints on what you
can do with it, but there are traditions about its proper use to which many
hackers are quite strongly attached."

Also, note that since I'm in the US, that even if it had *not* been placed
in the public domain, the "Fair use" limitation on exclusive rights as
listed in 17 USC 107 applies.

In particular, note 17 USC 107 (4): ".... the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work."  This also happens to cover the vast majority of copyrighted material
posted to Funsec - it's basically hard for the copyright owner to claim
that it's infringing when it tends to *increase* the number of hits the
original story page gets, thus increasing the value of the original.
