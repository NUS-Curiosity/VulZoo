Hey, kid -

If you've got any better ideas about how to fix NTLM, the industry is ready
& waiting to hear them.

The fact is, NTLM is an old & busted protocol that happens to be used *
everywhere*, and there's no way to fix it without breaking compatibility
with, oh, just the entire installed base.  I was happy to see MS08-068
because the technique it implements is better than nothing - it offers a
nice, clever way to reduce the exploitability of the issue without breaking
anything important.

Don't bother telling us all how M$ should just bite the incompatibility
bullet and turn NTLM off - that's been an option for users, theoretically
speaking, since about the time Windows Kerberos support became mature, and
practically speaking, nobody seems to be turning NTLM off here in the real
world.
