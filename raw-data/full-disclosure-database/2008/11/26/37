Subject: does the aim service save chat session details?


Is AIM IM purely peer to peer or a store and forward type protocol? We need
to determine if we can recover a past IM chat conversation that occurred
over two weeks ago. Our chat client did not have IM logging enabled so we
need to know if the "service" archives all chat conversations for law
enforcement and legal purposes.
 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
