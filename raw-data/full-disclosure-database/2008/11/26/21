Weird.  We were the ones that reported this issue to Microsoft back in 1998 or 
9 (don't recall exactly when now) or at least a part of the issue.  Very 
strange to see it pop up after all these years.  Of course they essentially 
told us the same thing that you describe - can't break everything to fix that 
one thing - wait for the next release.

And you're right - it wasn't a great risk unless you were already in the 
network in a serious way.
