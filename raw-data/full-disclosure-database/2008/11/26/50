Gadi Evron done the same as n3td3v, look here:
http://www.linuxbox.org/pipermail/funsec/2008-November/018748.html so
why is Ureleet wanting n3td3v in jail? We've both broken the law.
Maybe me and Gadi Evron can share the same jail cell? n3td3v doesn't
have a criminal record and it may affect my career. :concerned:
