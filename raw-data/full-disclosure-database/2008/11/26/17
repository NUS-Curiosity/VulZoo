Um, NTLM isn't the only 20 or so year old protocol to take the rap
recently, I can think of a low numbered rfc, lets say 1034 and
1035. Hindsight is 20/20, and 20 years ago, who would have thought
that a 16 bit number was way too small for DNS transaction id, the
same "who would have though" goes for NTLM and the rest. Lets face
it, protocol design bugs suck, and to completely replace a widely
used protocol ranks pretty high in the PiTA hall of fame...
