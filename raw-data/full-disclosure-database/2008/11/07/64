Valdis, if you're not careful, going down this route will lead a certain
spammy/ranty/unwanted someone to have a defense for all his meandering and
fitful email crap he sends daily. :)

To response, however, let me just say there is something to be said about
exercising certain skills in appropriate places so as not to waste
everyone's time and patience. Want an employee who can intelligently dive
into metaphysics/religion/rhetoric? There are better places to look and/or
test.
