That's a good try, you play the oppressed card, Calimero sayed it: life is
so injust.
To bad that's not the real reason.
You're polluating this mailing list since a couple of years, there's even a
profiling Pdf dedicated to you (amnesic reminder:
www.hackerfactor.com/papers/who_is_n3td3v.pdf)

now it's enough, it's not a question about white/grey/blue/black hat, it's
about a fucking morron named n3td3v.

So please consider my past advice :
Get The Fuck Out Of Here ,you have no friends here.
