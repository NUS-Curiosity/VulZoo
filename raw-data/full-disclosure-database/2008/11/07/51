Being able to *understand* what you read (and thus be better able to see
what the implications of something are), and being able to do further research
to figure out if something is bullshit or not, are critical skills for
a security researcher.

Hell, earlier this morning somebody was getting raked over the coals because
10 years of parroting didn't qualify them as a serious security researcher.
