Do you even understand why people dont like you? It is because you have all
these crackpot ideas but no experience to back it up. All your ideas only
make sense from a theoretical standpoint, but in practicality most will
fail.

Do you understand that or are you much of an ignorant person to even realise
that you are a joke to us. I will say that again just incase you missed it
YOU ARE A JOKE.

And people dont think I just make up that hes a drugfuck, he even admitted
his use of illegal substances way back in 2005. So, Mr n3td3v, my question
to you is how can you be in such support of the governments security posture
on one hand, but ignore their views on drugs on the other? Do you think you
are above the governments laws and as such only need to follow what you
dictate to be applicable to you?
