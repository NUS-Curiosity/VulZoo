Subject: Re: Two bulletins from Microsoft on Patch Tuesday

so you don't think its logical that these 5 day heads up could be
helping the bad guys out? right. i think the world's biggest hackers
could do a lot of research in 5 days. but then again n3td3v isn't
logical so i must be wrong. damn those drugs eh? i just asked what the
realistic possibility was for a 5 day turn around from the day of the
heads up until a patch is released. i just thought it was bad that we
were giving the bad guys a 5 day head start, but never mind n3td3v
isn't logical so i must be wrong. scraping the 5 day head start isn't
a good idea because n3td3v isn't logical? right, i threw away 10 years
of my life to not be logical...
