good poll you have doing this, not only do you gain intelligence about
your readership, but you have a bunch of ip addresses logged with
their respective answers about their wireless posture. answering such
a poll could be a security vulnerability in its self but there is no
security through obscurity though right? 675 ip addresses so far have
been dumb asses and answered your poll. keep up the good work or not
as the case may be. to be frank the question is none of your business,
but if people are stupid enough to answer it then why the hell not. i
don't know if its a good trend to have folks asking those types of
questions over the internet and have people answer them, the bad guys
could leverage a way to exploit such a trend and isc shouldn't be
setting up a trend where such questions are asked. its like saying to
folks, nobody will ever ask you what your password is via email, and
then you setting up a poll asking people what their password is. yeah
it really is as dumb as that, but carry on polls of this nature if you
think its the right standard to be setting by asking these types of
questions over an internet connection where anything or anyone could
be electronically capturing the answers, the ip addresses and other
information as it flies through the air. good day isc, don't take it
personally now, this email is to isc not any individual, so don't come
replying with narky comments or do a joel esler by posting the email
to internet relay chat and complaining how rude i've been when sending
an email to handlers@...s and taking it personally as if the email was
personally addressesd to you when it wasn't. damn, you would think
joel esler would have known already not to take emails personally that
are sent to an organisations email address, but yeah well he paid the
price by doing so because i put all his dirty washing out to dry on
full-disclosure. take cares isc.
