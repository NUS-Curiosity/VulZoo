I don't think any hacker is going to bother spending 5 days looking
for a needle in a haystack when he can reverse engineer specific files
once the patch is released. I know very little of looking for pointers
in DLLs but from what I've seen it looks like a bit of a nightmare.
The best way is to "diff" two files - the un-patched and the patched
then you see where the changes are.

Of course if you had thought about it or done *any* research before
you posted you would already have made that point.

I am not a white/grey/black/pink hat I'm just an NT Admin type person
who monitors this list for Full Disclosure of bugs in software.
Instead I have trawl through your incessant ramblings on most days.
Yes I have filters set up in Gmail of course, but I still have to deal
with the replies, which before you go on about it are justifiably
offensive because you've polluted this list for years with your crap -
most have had enough of it.

Now please go and get a job in something completely different so you
can sleep through the night like the rest of us.

Regards,

Colin.
