FAIL.

You're parroting (and citing a circular definition, at that). Andrew A at least
*groks* what Jesus was trying to tell us.

Among other things, Andrew A notices that Jesus didn't develop his teachings
in an intellectual vacuum - he would have been at very familiar with the
Old Testament, and had at least passing familiarity with the various Greek
philosophers.  Even in those areas where Greek teaching was incompatible
with Judeaic teachings, they'd be known in "compare and contrast" form.

As we find in Luke chapter 2:

46 After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the
teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 
47 Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.

Note that the text implies that at that time, it was not unusual for a
12 year old boy to be at the temple talking to the teachers - what *was*
unusual was the depth of understanding for a 12 year old.
