Dear n3td3v,

I sincerely regret to inform you that if all you have done for the past 10
years is "monitor the scene" (i.e. trolling/spamming mailing lists and
chatrooms with elementary ramblings) then you have no leg to stand on when
somebody questions your experience.  In fact, it is quite pitiful.  Get a
job or something.

Sincerely,
offbitz
