Not quite exactly... The actual impact is unclear due to the  
complicated exploitation mode.
And there are suggestions that it can be expanded upon...

The attack lets AP -> Client communications be decrypted, and a  
hostile attacker can inject traffic.
Client -> AP communications are not threatened yet, AFAIK.

What can be done with this capability is still to be evaluated. The  
complicated part comes in the
fact that part of this attack is cryptographic weakness, and part of  
it is a protocol weakness.

It will take some more study before it is fully understood and the  
full scope of impact is known IMHO.
