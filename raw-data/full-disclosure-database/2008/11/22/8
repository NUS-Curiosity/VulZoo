wow, disabling files to run from the root of all drives would never, ever
fly in a corporate environment.  Although I do like the idea on stopping
autorun malware, it would work... but oh the calls to the helpdesk! ;-)  

Simply disabling autorun is a much better solution.

spreading viruses

USB / FLOPPY are attractive means for virus/worm to propagate. Here is
a workaround to stop a successful infection from happening (well ~99%
of the time least)

1. if you dont use wscript.exe disable/rename it.

2. start menu > control pannel > administrative tools > local security
policy >software restriction policy >additional rules

say if c:\ d:\ and e:\ are your fixed drives then....

right click additional rules > create path rule and create path rule
[DISALLOWED AS]

c:\*.*
d:\*.*
e:\*.*

// why let anything to execute from root of fixed drives.

for all other drives (removable/non existing) from a - z do as
a:\
b:\
f:\
g:\
........and so on. Why let anything execute from removable drive
unless you are 100% sure the pendrive is clean and from a trusted
source only.

always have file extension and hidden/protected system file to "show
by default" from folder option.

well this is it. From a personal experience i assure the above should
be the BEST solution for this problem and a extra layer of defense if
AV fails to detect it.

thanks,
