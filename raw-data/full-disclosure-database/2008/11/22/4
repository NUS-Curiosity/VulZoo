Subject: 3ware web is all big hole

Hi!

After endless reports and attempts to report over years to let 3ware
know about their SQL injection holes they still have all data
unprotected. Up to reader what to think about me or this company. I just
supply screenshot which I tried to report many times discretely:

Previous problems include stuff like ' or 'a'='a logins and so on.
