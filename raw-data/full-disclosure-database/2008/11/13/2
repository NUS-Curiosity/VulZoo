	Occasional OT discourse is expected in unmoderated lists.
	Continual OT discourse is not expected in unmoderated lists.
	Vilification is not expected in any list, moderated or otherwise.

	There are complaints because the amounts of traffic that
	falls into the later two categories are exceeding what the
	list members feel is apporiate, needed or necessary.

	Apply self moderation.

	Mark
