On Monday 11/17 at 1:00pm EST (1800 UTC/GMT) I'll be giving a webcast
titled "Understanding the WPA/WPA2 Break".  There are no product
pitches, just straight to the point material:

+ Overview of the TKIP attack and impact on organizations
+ Analysis and technical detail on how the attack works
+ Defense strategies for organizations

The SANS Institute is graciously providing the facilities for the
webcast.  You can sign up at:

https://www.sans.org/webcasts/show.php?webcastid=92188

Please drop me a line with any questions.  I hope to see you there!

Thanks,

- -Josh
