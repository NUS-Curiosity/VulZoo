Subject: Netgear WGR614v9 DoS to Admin Interface (internal
	and external)

Not sure how to rate this, but at the same time, i really don't give a shit.
(one of those days...)

You can crash the admin interface by sending a malformed URL to the web
interface of this wireless router. No recovery, a reboot fixes the issue.

Wouldn't even really call it a "malformed URL" either, but whatever.

e.g., http://192.168.1.1/?

all you need to do is add a ? to the end of the URL.

This is with the latest firmware from netgear's site.

that's all folks.

keep on talkin that smack you talk so well.
