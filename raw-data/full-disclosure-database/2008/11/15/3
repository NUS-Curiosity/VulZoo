 OSX.Lamzev.A

This is and was the situation when writing the entry.
More information and information about the possibly previously unknown vulnerability related to the Trojan is not available.

Now Symantec analysis says that
-Trojan creates the file /tmp/com.apple.DockSettings
-inserts its contents into ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and
-deletes /tmp/com.apple.DockSettings.
