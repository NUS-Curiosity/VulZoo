Dynamic Port Scanner -  A Reliable Spoofed Source IP Port Scanner
-----------------------------------------------------------------

0x01 Introduction

The sole idea of the Dynamic Port Scanner (DPS) is to provide a reliable
spoofed source IP port scanner. The spoofed source IP is dynamically generated
at run time and it varies for every scan packet; every scan packet carries a
random spoofed source IP. Traditionally, a port scan with a spoofed source IP
has been considered unreliable due to the fact that reply packets would not
reach back the scanning system. However, the technique used by DPS ensures the
reliability of such spoofed scan. This technique is based on the  
integration of
ARP Poisoning into port scanning to achieve the desired result. The spoofed IP
addresses used by DPS during a scanning process fall within the range of the
local subnet. Thus, DPS is best suited for internal scanning.

0x02 Features

     * DPS V 1.5 is a multi-threaded application. It creates upto THREADS_MAX
       threads at once. Each thread scans a port and does the corresponding ARP
       Poisoning.
     * DPS differentiates between a scanned host withing the local net and a
       host outside the local net. If the scanned host is within the local net,
       it is the target of ARP poisoning. If not, the gateway/router  
will be the
       target of ARP poisoning.
     * The spoofed source IP will never match the IP of the scanned machine if
       it is within the local net. The reason is that one cannot ARP-poison a
       host with fake info about the machine itself.
     * DPS features 10 different TCP stealth scanning techniques. These are:
       SYN, FIN, NULL, ACK, URG, PSH, XMAS, XMAS1, XMAS2, XMAS3.
     * DPS is built on top of Libpcap and Libnet

     * Example 1: The default option will scan the ports 1-1024 using SYN scan
                  type.
