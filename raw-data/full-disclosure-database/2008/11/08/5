A lot of hardware can be configured to provide CCMP only. That's where
we want to go. If you provide CCMP+TKIP, nonetheless you obviously
expose stations using TKIP, but you also expose all group traffic that
will be encrypted using TKIP for everybody, as the common denominator.

Yes. But future 802.11w won't support TKIP. So we can hope it will first
deprecate WEP (802.11i should have done so already), and TKIP hopefully.
At least a WPA3 could do it.

But everything is left to vendors, as they will have to provide
appropriate firmwares and out-of-the-box configurations, which is far to
be true, still now. I was helping a friend setting up his AP last week,
and it was only supporting WPA with TKIP out of the box. We had to
reflash it so we could get the full monthy. And I don't speak of some
drivers that will just fail if you try to do CCMP...
