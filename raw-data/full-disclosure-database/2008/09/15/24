There is a difference between being outspoken and making dumb
comments no one cares about.

For instance, if I were to go into a group of Mac users and make a
strong, technical argument that OS X security was a joke, then I
would be outspoken.

If I come onto a security list talking about things no one cares
about and making arguments that have no backing, in addition to
making very uneducated and ignorant assumptions about respected
members of the research community being a part of xyz intelligence
agency, then I would be a troll.

You are the latter. You want to be respected and not laughed at, be
the first one. Being outspoken doesn't mean you have to act dumb.

See above. It means you post stuff no one cares about and/or run
your mouth off about things you have no business talking about.

Respect is earned, not given. You've done nothing to merit the
respect of anyone here and hurt your case by your insane obsession
with intel agencies and making accusations against people you know
nothing about.
