RSA theory, discussed here, was not broken (if you have evidence - 
please, share it or turn off your claims in this context).
If you (or somebody) need actual evidence of program existense without 
payment - we can give you one copy (with corresponding NDA, with 
notarial witness of signature). "Trial and bypass" way - not best way 
here (if you understand us).
Concerning Eugene Chukhlomin - not only "The Big Prism" laser projection 
system, you forget his patents for "Quasi-monopol power source" 
(magnetic generator) and time-amplitude audio coding algorithms.
Cheers,
