If you're doing *actual* threat analysis, the risk that a *credible* threat
will be pre-announced on the F-D list (as opposed to wannabes that couldn't
terrorize their way out of a wet box of tissues) is sufficiently low that it
can probably be ignored.

If you're doing Security Theatre, or Firesign Theatre, or other surreal
theatrical event, the rules are of course different...
