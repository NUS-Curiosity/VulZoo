In America this is called the electric chair, let's extradite everyone
to America we don't agree with on F-D and put them in the naughty
chair.

The Americans think they actually have control of F-D, even though its
a British mailing list and is with all due respect owned by
MI5/6/GCHQ, nothing actually to do with American rules at all.

If we want to play around on our own mailing list all day, we fucking will.

So less of the lecturing from Americans about how F-D should be run, OK?
