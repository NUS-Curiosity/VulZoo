Subject: Critical Vulnerability in Apple Quicktime’s Indeo Codec

http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/critical-vulnerability-in-apple-quicktimes-indeo-codec/

Paul Byrne of NGSSoftware has discovered a critical vulnerability in
Apple Quicktime's implementation of the Indeo Codec (CVE-ID:
CVE-2008-3615) which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on
a user’s system via playing a malformed movie file in Quicktime
containing video encoded in the Indeo Codec. This is also possible to be
executed through the Quicktime Internet Explorer Active X control. It is
in the Quicktime library for Indeo in the file "ir50_32.qtx" which was
previous distributed through Apple's website but written by a third
party. The codec has now been removed and is no longer supported in the
latest version of Quicktime.

This issue has been resolved in the newest version of Apple Quicktime
7.5.5, to see Apple's release go to:

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3027

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details of this flaw for three months.
Full details will be published in December 2008. This three month window
will allow other vendors the time needed to create patches in their
versions of Indeo Codec before the details are released to the general
public. This reflects NGSSoftware’s approach to responsible disclosure.
