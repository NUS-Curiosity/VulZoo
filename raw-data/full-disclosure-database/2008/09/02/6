OK, now s/security patch/silent data corruption/ and tell me what's *actually*
different.

Wow, you still need to consider it, check it, test it, and deploy it.

Unless of course you don't give a shit about your data.  But in that case,
the security patch can probably be overlooked too.

That's Linus's point - if the patch is important enough to go into one of
the -stable tree kernels, it's probably something you want to install, whether
or not it's a security patch.
