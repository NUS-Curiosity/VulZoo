What speaks for itself?

Our work is a proposal for a few alternatives for doing port 
randomization. Two of them are new, and are supposed to avoid some of 
the problems that are usually caused by a trivial port randomization 
algorithm (e.g., algorithm #1 and algorithm #2). Full stop. We simply 
provide a small survey in case you ask yourself "what is being done 
out there" by popular TCP implementations. The survey is simply an 
appendix, and was added as I was examining the Linux and *BSD code myself.

If algorithm #3 is seeded poorly, then I think you should document 
it, and send a patch so that that problem is fixed in the base system.

If anything, it should be "should randomize". "MUSTs" are meant to 
mandate specific behaviors/rules that, if not  followed, would lead 
to interoperability problems.
