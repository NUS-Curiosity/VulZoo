Valdis has already answered your question. That said, the document 
itself is not a survey of what every OS or OS+patch does with respect 
to ephemeral ports, and that little survey we included is not meant 
to be complete (for instance, there's no description of what Windows does).

Also, the base Linux system already implements Algorithm #3. So I 
wonder why anybody would patch the Linux ephemeral port selection 
algorithm.... (unless it is to implement algorithm #4 of our draft).

Regarding me "dismissing" grsec, I tried to (but couldn't) get the 
guy whose e-mail address is available at the grsec web site to review 
one of the documents I have been working on, so that he could provide 
his perspective on each of the issues discussed.

P.S.: The "survey" section must be about 1% of the document. I'd be 
glad to hear comments on the rest of the document.

Kind regards,
