Linus is not a security expert. Not even close. He's not educated and 
not experienced enough to make security decisions, but he does. That's 
the problem. He cares somehow, but he's wrong.

"SECURITY PATCH tag on a fix" helps me to know that there is the problem 
and I must consider the patch, check its correctness and maybe 
test/backport/apply it to my production systems ASAP. Just as another 
tags helps me to know that there are realiability and other issues I 
must care about.
