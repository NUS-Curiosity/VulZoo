Subject: Re: n3td3v domain

Robert,

I checked the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database before 
purchasing this domain.
http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=toc&state=b4jvpr.1.1&p_search=searchss&p_L=50&BackReference=&p_plural=yes&p_s_PARA1=&p_tagrepl~%3A=PARA1%24LD&expr=PARA1+AND+PARA2&p_s_PARA2=n3td3v&p_tagrepl~%3A=PARA2%24COMB&p_op_ALL=AND&a_default=search&a_search=Submit+Query&a_search=Submit+Query

n3td3v is not a registered US trademark.  Anyone can legally own this 
domain without fear of n3td3v wetting his diaper over it.

Who is interested in your-name@...es.n3td3v.com email addresses for $1/each?
How about root@...00ted.n3tdev.com?

There is a lot of potential for vanity email addresses here :)

It's funny that n3td3v calls me a malicious blackhat when he's the 
current highest bidder.  A sale is a sale, and this domain is up for 
anyone to purchase.  May the best man or woman win.
