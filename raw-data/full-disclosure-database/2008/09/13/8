Yep for free all yours, Just need the info to move it, i would assume
you can give fake stuff for now if you don't trust me, as long as the
email is good it should be fine. I have no idea how much verification
is involved, probably nothing i assume.
   Are you still raising hell on FD? LOL You really seem to have good
intentions. Which is what counts when it comes down to it :) and you
seem to be still around so you obviously have will.
                            Best wishes, Tim
