(sorry for the xpostings)



 The call for papers for YSTS (you sh0t the sheriff) 2.0 is now open!

The 2nd edition will be held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on November 17th and 
18th, 2008

INTRODUCTION

YSTS is a very unique event dedicated to the top-notch Information Security 
Society in Brazil, having local and speakers from abroad.

YSTS mixes the highest quality presentations, covering diverse topics in 
information security, from all technical haxor to management C level good 
stuff.

The goal is make the attendees get the "real big picture" of the current 
state of information security world, mixing professionals from different 
Infosec segments of the market.

For the attendees, this is almost an invite-only event. So, submitting a
