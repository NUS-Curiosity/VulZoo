That depends on how you define "communicate"...

It also assumes that everyone will gladly, sheepfully use "modern, multi-
paned mail readers".

You may be a sheep whose communications consist of little more than 
adding simple confirming, negating or further-detail-requesting bleats to 
others' messages, but "discussion lists" and many other forms of 
communication commonly engaged via Email by higher order, bi-pedal 
mammals demand more sophistication of all of the communicator, mail 
reader and medium...

If you dislike "no top posting" because of  neanderthals who haven't 
grokked that it is about better communication and thus mindlessly quote 
an entire message to add their simple confirming, negating or further-
detail-requesting grunts at the bottom, then you are making a false 
comparison, as such stupidity is equally anti-communication-assisting as 
your preferred top-bleating approach.
