Subject: Hardcoded Keys

What would be the the worst case if you implement the following scenario for
a credit card transaction:

- Store the private keys as disk files and place them in an area on a server
that is readable from a DLL that contains the decryption algorithm
-Hardcode one password into a DLL and the other password will be supplied by
the service that requests the decryption. This password is then SHA1 hashed
with a passphrase -- the result is used to decrypt the private key.

After the successful credit card transaction, certain credit card details
are then encrypted and stored within the database.
