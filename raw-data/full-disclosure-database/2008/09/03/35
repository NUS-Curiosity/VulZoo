I thought a high ranking security professional like yourself would
stick to facts, not the latest disinformation handed out by so-called
"trusted" security professionals. Marcus Sachs is good at it, Sans is
good at it. We already know the CIA use Sans for it,
http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/666. Yet you continue to hang out
with them on #dshield on Freenode. You are being led up a garden path
by power hungry folks feeding the media news about anything they can
orchestrate to ramp up cyber security as a national security agenda
item as the next administration is coming in so they can become more
powerful in Washington, yet you still trust them. Stop playing into
the hands of these guys and have your own opinion about things, unless
you two are part of the power hungry cyber security circle of folks
who are trying to artificially ramp up and put infront of the media a
common cyber enemy, as the next administration is coming in.

We will never forget the Youtube video..."How do we put it infront of
the media and get their attention?" We can get Valdis to keep
repeating an artificial common cyber enemy and have Valdis put random
comments on the mailing lists? We all know you hang out with the power
hungries because i've idled on #dshield and seen you, and it wouldn't
suprise me if you were at that particular speech Marcus Sachs did. No
one believes what you say anymore Valdis, you're part of the group who
is trying to get the attention of the next administration as they are
coming in and 100 days after the next president is in the White House.

The Youtube video says it all about what's going on in the world and
everything thats wrong with it. Don't be part of the corruption thats
going on Valdis, don't be associated with the Marcus Sachs's of the
world, you don't want to be that type of person, trust me it will get
you into a lot of trouble when it comes to building the evidence of
who is guilty for what false flags and who was involved in the ground
work and propaganda building on the internet.
