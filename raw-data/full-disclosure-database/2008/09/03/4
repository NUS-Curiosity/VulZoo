Hi,

---------------------------------------------------
Software:
Google Chrome Browser 0.2.149.27

Tested:
Windows XP Professional SP3

Result:
Google Chrome Crashes with All Tabs

Problem:
An issue exists in how chrome behaves with undefined-handlers in
chrome.dll version 0.2.149.27. A crash can result without user
interaction. When a user is made to visit a malicious link, which has an
undefined handler followed by a 'special' character, the chrome crashes
with a Google Chrome message window "Whoa! Google Chrome has crashed.
Restart now?". It fails in dealing with the POP EBP instruction when
pointed out by the EIP register at 0x01002FF4.
