oh fuck off with referring to it as "beta". beta is just a lame tag so
you can release something that you don't entirely trust.

imho if it's "beta" keep it fucking private. if it's public, grow a
set of balls and don't call it "beta" so you can hide behind that when
it fails.

grow the fuck up, google.
