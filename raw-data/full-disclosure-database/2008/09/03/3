You didn't manage to jail break the entire browser, thats whats unique
about Chrome, each tab is in jail, so the entire application doesn't
crash. The real elite exploits will come with you can jail break the
entire Chrome application...

"Chrome's architecture lends itself to secure browsing. Each Web page,
or tab, runs in its own process, and is blocked from accessing other
processes on the computer. "We've taking the existing process
boundary," the comic says, "and made it into a jail." Different and
more flexible permissions are being developed for plug-ins, however."
