Subject: Re: Google Chrome Browser Vulnerability

Hello Larry,

Ya, a beta browser (though I forgot to mention it) but, is there any product from Google not in Beta ;) Thanks, our searches are not through a beta search engine. Anyways, it's just an attempt to make it a better place to browse and help it come out of Beta. 
Rest, I very much liked the minimalist approach and simplicity of it + fast surfing speed. Cheers!

Just my 2 cents.
