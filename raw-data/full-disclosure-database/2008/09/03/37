I'd like to see you provide some proof that this is
"disinformation" aside from your delusional
theories.

There has been plenty of proof that RBN is a real threat, if you
are going to try and call

prepared to present a counter
argument proving it is disinformation. Otherwise all you are doing
is flapping your mouth off.
