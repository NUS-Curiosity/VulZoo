Actually, they probably apply at least *some* automation, like some basic
signal-to-noise filtering.  In procmail, it would go something like:

:0
*^From:.*n3td3v
/dev/null

At which point the list is fairly low-traffic and much higher actual usable
content percentage.

The chances of that procmail filter accidentally throwing a false-positive on
an item that is both important *and* not also echoed on other mailing lists
is sufficiently low as to not worry about.
