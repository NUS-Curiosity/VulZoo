Details: 
- Type of Issue : Buffer Overflow. 

- Affected Software : Google Chrome 0.2.149.27.
    
- Exploitation Environment : Google Chrome  on Windows XP SP2.

- Impact: Remote code execution.

- Rating : Critical.

- Description : 
The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when handling the 
“SaveAs” function. On saving a malicious page with an overly long title 
(<title> tag in HTML), the program causes a stack-based overflow and makes 
it possible for attackers to execute arbitrary code on users’ systems.

- How an attacker could exploit the issue : 
To exploit the Vulnerability, a hacker might construct a specially crafted 
Web page, which contains malicious code. He then tricks users into visiting 
his Website and convinces them to save this Page. Right after that, the code 
would be executed, giving him the privilege to make use of the affected 
system.
