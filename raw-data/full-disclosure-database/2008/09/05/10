How should the community deal with Gadi Evron emails? Should we be
shooting for a complete ban of cyber politics as well as normal
politics which is already banned?

If people want to talk cyber politics then the community could setup a
cyber-politics mailing list so we can rant to each other all day about
cyber politics.

And it would get Gadi Evron and n3td3v off Full-Disclosure, and thats
got to be a good thing.

All the best,
