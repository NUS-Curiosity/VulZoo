It has to be a mailing list run by someone who is neutral to
everything thats going on, you can't have an official central list for
the internet for non-technical cyber politics be called 'n3td3v -
google groups' because its biased towards one particular person etc.
The same reason that Funsec doesn't work either, because its biased
towards gadi, his agenda, friends, the professional scene etc. It
would need to be a mailing list setup by John Cartwright who doesn't
favour any particular person, a certain professional peer group or
view, etc etc. Its got to be a non-technical cyber politics mailing
list thats unmoderated, neutral, central, and unbiased in its
management.
