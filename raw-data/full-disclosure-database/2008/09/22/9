Synopsis
========

R is vulnerable to symlink attacks due to an insecure usage of
temporary files.

Background
==========

R is a GPL licensed implementation of S, a language and environment for
statistical computing and graphics.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package     /  Vulnerable  /                           Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  dev-lang/R       < 2.7.1                                 >= 2.7.1

Description
===========

Dmitry E. Oboukhov reported that the "javareconf" script uses temporary
files in an insecure manner.

Impact
======

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite
arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All R users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/R-2.7.1"
