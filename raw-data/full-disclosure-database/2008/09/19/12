Subject: Re: Reverse Shell Without Enabling Netcat's
	"GAPING_SECURITY_HOLE"

Funny I actually saw your reply before my original post with the
method in it was posted.  The question was he wanted the easiest
method using Netcat.  On a system that you may not have a lot of
access to (i.e. one you are running an exploit against) downloading
cryptcat and running that would be a lot harder since it is not
included in any of the standard *Nix distros, where as Netcat usually
is.  So the goal is to get a reverse shell using as little effort as
possible and if the ability exists without having to run a bunch of
commands on a remote server then why not.  But you are correct as I
stated in the original post, there is more than one way to do this.
In the end it is the results that make them happy getting there is
one's own choice.
