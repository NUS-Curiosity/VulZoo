This is a healthy discussion. This topic leads to a very good question. When
do we call a bug as a vulnerability and when does an issue really turn out
to be a security issue. When we have memory index out of bound error or when
we have a OS level code having a out of bound memory error or when we
reference an index value that doesn't exist  or in many other cases, we do
reference it as a vulnerability.

So, in such cases where simple bugs and vulnerabilities overlap, is it not
good to call it a vulnerability and correct it rather than downgrading from
what it should be. I am not saying anything pertaining to this situation or
redb0ne's email. It is a really good topic to discuss about. Like what
redb0ne has mentioned, we always have 2 subsets. Common bugs that are not
security related and something that is a security issue. And the overlap in
these two would be bugs that leads to vulnerabilities.

Let me know if I am missing something or if you guys know some materials
where I can learn such missing gaps. My sincere apologies if this email
sounded stupid.
