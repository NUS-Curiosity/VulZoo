Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities in dnsmasq might allow for a Denial of Service or
spoofing of DNS replies.

Background
==========

Dnsmasq is a lightweight and easily-configurable DNS forwarder and DHCP
server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/dnsmasq       < 2.45                              >= 2.45

Description
===========

* Dan Kaminsky of IOActive reported that dnsmasq does not randomize
  UDP source ports when forwarding DNS queries to a recursing DNS
  server (CVE-2008-1447).

* Carlos Carvalho reported that dnsmasq in the 2.43 version does not
  properly handle clients sending inform or renewal queries for unknown
  DHCP leases, leading to a crash (CVE-2008-3350).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send spoofed DNS response traffic to dnsmasq,
possibly involving generating queries via multiple vectors, and spoof
DNS replies, which could e.g. lead to the redirection of web or mail
traffic to malicious sites. Furthermore, an attacker could generate
invalid DHCP traffic and cause a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All dnsmasq users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/dnsmasq-2.45"
