Fascinating idea - we could even have 'Full-Disclosure conferences', 
where you could
get 'Full-Disclosure' Islamic prayer mats, mugs and stickers! It would a 
methodology
centric to 'hack the planet'.

What's a CEH? And what leads you to assume that there are 'real security 
professionals' on Full-Disclosure?
I think your desires may be better fed on irc.efnet.org #teenchat; As 
far as I know, there are more sec
professionals there than FD and 2600 put together.

To conclude, Professor Michael Chatner, I'm very impressed with your 
desire to 'hack and trade' Ubuntu 'tips and tricks', here's a very 
useful one for when you feel under the weather, ashamed of your true 
homosexual status, or incapable of understanding how the linux 2.4 kern 
caches directories in kernel memory:
