Well, if you've already warned your client that their software is vulnerable
and they haven't changed to an alternative, then it's fine to release an
advisory with all of the details.

I really don't understand why they'd pay for a penetration test to not take
action if their software was vulnerable. If the vendor is extremely
unresponsive to any information, it may be the case that releasing the
technical details to the public are the only way to get them to take notice.
Just think, you might not be the only person who has found out about the
exploit. There might be some black hat hacker somewhere using it to meet
their own ends. Some vendors are just like that though; they refuse to do
anything until it's too late. Maybe they'll start taking notice of bug
reports after this happening a few times and losing half of their clients.
