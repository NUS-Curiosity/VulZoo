Once a month stops people getting confused, and allows people to
organize patch management better.

You know when the patches are due to be released, so you don't miss
any and get hacked when a hacker reverse engineers the patch.

If you just release patches on random days, folks might get caught off
guard and miss patching as quickly as they might want.

Also, third party patches are the most danergous patches, so its
better to know when the genuine patch is coming out.

I never agreed with the whole ZERT thing, its just encouraging the bad
guys to release third party patches which could be malware pretending
to be a patch.

Never accept third party patches, even if they are from ZERT, it sets
a bad precedence.
