You seem to think because I don't want him to goto U.S that I agree
with what he did and that I do similar things? STFU. I'm a security
researcher and ethical hacker, with one of the biggest groups on
google groups for security researchers and ethical hackers. Why the
fuck would you make up this lie about me? If I was some evil hacker
that was doing bad things like you suggest, would I be drawing
attention to myself on full-disclosure? You're just trolling me and
you got me to bite, good luck with the rest of your mailing list
career. n3td3v forever.
