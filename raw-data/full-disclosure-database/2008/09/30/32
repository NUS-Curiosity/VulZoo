Could the bad guys exploit this Adsense bot to do a bit of
reconnaissance work if they had obtained passwords and given them to
the bot? What kind of info does Adsense bot give back to the bad guys
about password-protected pages it has been told to access? I'm not
talking about the Mckinnon case right now, I just think I might have
just opened a can of worms on a seperate issue. This bot could go in
to places and break the law, while the bad guys break no law? This
needs to be researched.

All the best,
