I couldn't agree more.  The man committed a crime, in either country.  He
should be held accountable.  I've also seen plenty of people claim the law
was changed to prosecute him, that's simply not true either.

Enough with the 60 years, he'll get 4 years tops.
I feel sorry for the guy, and I think the military probably did roll some
heads after the breach.  But to say that military admins should be held
criminally responsible is ludicrous (but maybe not entirely...save for
another discussion).  Stupid?  yes.  Discharged?  for sure...and it's pretty
apparent they should find another career field.

Can we put this to rest already.
