You are quite right, of course. In that particular instance I wasn't 
seeking to make a technical argument per se,
I was more focused on any plausible intent, as that seems to be central 
to at least some people's arguments.

I apologise if that threw anyone with the context switching. This one's 
nearly back on topic to tech/security...

Personally on a server that I knew was meant to be secure, and had made 
an effort to secure for the long term , I would make sure that there 
were two separate checksum databases for every binary file on the 
system, and hence be able to verify anything "important" had not been 
tampered with, without having to rely on file timestamps, which I (like 
most on this list) know can be unreliable after a compromise.

I've not to date seen any server maliciously attacked where the binaries 
or files and processes involved were not either 'important' or 
'obvious'. Perhaps I have not run into a high enough calibre of hacker? 
(NOT an invitation ;-).

However. back to the point... One would have assumed that the US 
military would have taken explicit steps to secure their systems by 
default, perhaps until this very email thread??? The implications of 
them not even making such an effort are ludicrous on so very many levels.
