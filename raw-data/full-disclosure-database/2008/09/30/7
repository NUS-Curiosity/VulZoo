He didn't break in, the door was left open. He left a note to say he
had noticed the door was unlocked, maybe you should fix it. After he
walked away, anyone could have gone in and done the damage. Its all
circumstantial evidence that he done anything to the machines, or
changed files.

So bring this evidence forward, release the info to the public domain
to prove Mckinnon did the damage.

You have him at the scene of the crime, you ain't got nothing else.
There were tons of IP's accessing the same systems, the door was left
open for any hill billy to walk in.

If you have more facts to release to the media, so be it. I'm running
with what Gary Mckinnon has said on You tube that he didn't do any of
the damage that he is being accused of.

You said he was going to fry, how do you expect people to react?
You're the Americans, you carry out your threats, e.g: Iraq.
