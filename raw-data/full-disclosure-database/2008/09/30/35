excuse me?  You're attempt at insults are pointed wrongly.
 
  I've read the legal brief on his case, the UK documents on his case too,
he's ADMITTED guilt.  In my book that's enough to call him a criminal, he
should be arrested and tried in a court of law to determine if that is a
fact or not.  It's up to his accusers to prove his guilt.  He is not
actually guilty until he is found to be guilty in the court of law.  If they
cannot prove he is guilty, he must walk a free man.  Not to difficult to
prove guilt when the accuser admits to what he's done....  
    
   He is completely innocent until found guilty... at least in the US, UK,
and even Australia that is the way things are.  Lets see what the Chinese
would do to him if he did the same thing over then than over here.
 
  oh, to answer your question, YES, I'm an American, and proud of it....

 Look, Mckinnon broke into the computer systems.  Under his own admission he

in AGAIN easier...  AND he leaves a note threatening that he will do it

again.



  All this on KNOWN government computer systems.  He intentionally wanted to

get into these systems to look for UFO crap.     



   This goes way beyond just simply leaving a note stating that your door is

unlocked.  This is going into the unlocked car, putting in a remote control

door opener, and threatening to re-enter the car again.



   He knew what he was doing, he knew who's machines he was doing it to, he

was obviously going to keep doing it until caught by the sound of his

message.



   He's a criminal, period.  He should be properly tried in a court of law.

The way the UK an dthe US law is written, that means extradited to the US

for a trial.



  All the protesting or debating won't change the fact that he's a criminal.

Plain and simple, deal with it....  His sentence will be based upon what

comes up in court, and it hardly ever is the maximum.




I'm sorry, are you American? Are you a typical American?

If so, you have just demonstrated why he should not be extradited, as you,
as a typical American have him decided GUILTY already without seeing and
hearing all the ACTUAL  evidence. not just the rhetoric the politicians want
the media to tell you about, so he has no chance of fair trial.
