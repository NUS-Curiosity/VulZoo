 did not reply sooner

Maybe he works for the CIA/NSA/FBI or other Three Letter Agency... most
likely not, but that same tactic has been used under several
authoritarian regiemes of the past (like Soviet Russia, or the
Austria-Hungarian Empire). It's probabbly used now in China. If the
<insert TLA> could just demand a list of emails from every email
provider, spam the hell out of a ton of people, then just investigate
the results, it would be worth the time. If they even got one response
from one crazy person they could claim they've "stopped a terrorist"
and look like heros for doing nothing. Sure, we all know how hugely
illegal that is, but seriously, has that *ever* stopped them before?
I'm not saying that's the case, I'm just sayin....

Or maybe it's just some strange fucking spam.
