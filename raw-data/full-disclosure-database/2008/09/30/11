Subject: UK e-crime unit finally given the go ahead,
	n3td3v over the moon about it :)

The government has finally committed funding to a specialist national
e-crime unit, a year after a proposal was submitted by the
Metropolitan Police.

A new £7M police unit dedicated to tackling cyber crime and clamping
down on internet fraud was announced by e-crime Minister Vernon Coaker
today.

The new Police Central e-crime Unit (PCeU) will provide specialist
officer training and co-ordinate cross-force initiatives to crack down
on on-line offences.

This is great news, i've been fighting for this ever since the
National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) was closed down and merged into
SOCA in 2006.

All the best,

Sign a petition

We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to give the formation
of a police central e-crime unit, as proposed by the Metropolitan and
ACPO urgent priority.

More details

The consequences of, and reactions to, the loss of records by HM
Revenue and Customs, make the creation of a well resourced operation
to address computer assisted crime (including information and identity
theft from data and call centres, not just the use of the Internet to
automate old crimes and invent new ones) a matter of great urgency.
The operation should cover all the activities proposed by the
Metropolitan Police to the Home Office for such a Unit (beginning with
the collation of incident notification and intelligence and support
for and co-operation with organisations like Get Safe On-Line and the
National E-Crime Prevention Centre) but it needs to be on a scale akin
to similar operations in the United States, with additional funding
and resources from other government departments and industry (i.e. not
just existing Police budgets) as necessary.

Submitted by Neil Stinchcombe of Infosecurity Europe – Deadline to
sign up by: 29 February 2008 – Signatures: 179
