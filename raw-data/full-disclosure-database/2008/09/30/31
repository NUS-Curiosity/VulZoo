Yes, but what I'm asking about is what happens if the Google bot (or
other bots) are indexing and come upon a hyperlink, which otherwise
would be followed, of the form:

http://someone@[subdomains.]somewhere.tld

Does it then try the null ("") password to authenticate, or does it
stop there? Would it be considered computer fraud to try the null
password in this situation?

This is not necessary a page of a Google AdSense customer. It could be anything.

Isn't think what happened to make a whole bunch of Papa Johns'
corporate emails public via the Google cache? (And nobody pressed
criminal charges against Google developers...)
