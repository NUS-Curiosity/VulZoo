Actually, if you do that here, and there's a big fat sign at the
entrance saying it's a restricted area deadly force authorized, it
doesn't matter that the door was wide open, you're going to be lucky

McKinnon was warned, he chose to ignore the warning at his own peril.
I agree that extradition and 60 years in the slammer is a bit extreme,
though.
