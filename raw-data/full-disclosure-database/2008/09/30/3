My issue with this is, if he didn't cause any damage, with your example of a
computer system as a door... Would ANYBODY get 60 years for walking up to a
house, testing the door handle,  opening and closing the door, then walking
away?

Personally, I don't find it as criminal. I find it as human curiosity!

Then again... I'm stupid.

Whilst I agree that criminal actions should be met with criminal
consequences, 60 years for breaking (I use the term losely) into
shittily protected systems is absurd. You do less time for murder in
most places.

I wonder, if he was an American citizen, would he have been charged
with treason and executed?
