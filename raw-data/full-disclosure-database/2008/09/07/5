How much will it cost to fly him over to U.S, keep him in prison,
watered and fed? Is the U.S not already in a recession, have they
really got the money to ramp up somebody's crime to give a false
impression to the presidency that computer hacking needs to be a
national security agenda for the next administration to worry
about?.... really I don't think hackers are a national security item
for a president to worry about...

All the best,
