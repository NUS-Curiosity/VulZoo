2. Vulnerability Summary

A vulnerability has been discovered in the Graphics Rendering Engine (GRE) component of Microsoft Windows. Specifically this vulnerability is exposed by the Microsoft Windows GDI+ subsystem. The vulnerability is created by an error in parsing certain Windows Metafile (WMF) files, a standard image file format used by many commonly-used software applications.

3. Vulnerability Analysis

A remote attacker may exploit the vulnerability by sending a malicious WMF file to the target system and enticing the target user to view or preview it. A successful code execution attempt will result in arbitrary code to be executed within the security privileges of the currently logged in user. An unsuccessful attack attempt will result in abnormal termination of the program used for opening the malicious file. 

Applications affected by this vulnerability include Windows Explorer, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Paint, Windows Picture and Fax Viewer, and various Microsoft Office products. Note that the vulnerable file may be embedded inside other formats in the form of OLE objects, allowing the malicious file to appear as RTF files, Microsoft Office documents, or other formats.

4. Vulnerability Detection

Assurent has confirmed the vulnerability in:

  Digital Image Suite 2006
