https://www.cacert.org/ might as well be appropriate and is nowadays
supported by most distributions of Linux (though not turned on by
default for some obscure reason? One has to dpkg-reconfigure
ca-certificates. Maybe someone from the Debianist camp can enlighten us
on why?)

I personally think that it also has the better trust model; I trust
people more if they have been assured by a number of geeks than if they
simply had the money to pay for a certificate[1].

But whatever suits you.

[1]: Apart from the fact that it seems that not all pay-by-cert
     "authorities" are recognized either; I also had problems
     with expensive wildcard certificates not being recognized as
     signed by a proper CA. You learn who to trust pretty quickly.
