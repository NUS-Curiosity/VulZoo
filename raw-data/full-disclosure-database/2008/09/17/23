A couple of useful tools I put together, more to come. Hope some of you find them useful.

* Known Websites by IP Discovery Tool
* DNS Zone Transfer via AXFR
* Multi-RBL Check (includes the ARSPAM Argentinian Spammers DNSBL, quite new)
* OpenSSL PRNG VulnKey Checker (as announced in nmap-dev)
* â€¦ and more in the future! (send ideas to buanzo@...nzo.com.ar)

Bye
