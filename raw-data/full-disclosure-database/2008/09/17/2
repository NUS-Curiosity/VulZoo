Subject: Cygwin Buffer Overflow

Recently I tried to use Cygwin and tried to use the command grep -a
naughty_word_here /

It went to the cygdrive and ran into a buffer overflow when it tried to
analyse the windows pagefile in /cygwin/c

This might be due to the largeness of the pagefile. Anyhow, can anyone else
confirm?
