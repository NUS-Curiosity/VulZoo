Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV may result in a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus is a free anti-virus toolkit for UNIX, designed
especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  app-antivirus/clamav       < 0.94                         >= 0.94

Description
===========

Hanno boeck reported an error in libclamav/chmunpack.c when processing
CHM files (CVE-2008-1389). Other unspecified vulnerabilites were also
reported, including a NULL pointer dereference in libclamav
(CVE-2008-3912), memory leaks in freshclam/manager.c (CVE-2008-3913),
and file descriptor leaks in libclamav/others.c and libclamav/sis.c
(CVE-2008-3914).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to scan a
specially crafted CHM, possibly resulting in a Denial of Service
(daemon crash). The other attack vectors mentioned above could also
result in a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.94"
