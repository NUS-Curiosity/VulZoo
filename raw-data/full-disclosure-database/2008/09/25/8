Synopsis
========

Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been discovered in
Wireshark.

Background
==========

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer with a graphical front-end.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  net-analyzer/wireshark       < 1.0.3                     >= 1.0.3

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were reported:

* Multiple buffer overflows in the NCP dissector (CVE-2008-3146).

* Infinite loop in the NCP dissector (CVE-2008-3932).

* Invalid read in the tvb_uncompress() function when processing zlib
    compressed data (CVE-2008-3933).

* Unspecified error when processing Textronix .rf5 files
    (CVE-2008-3934).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending
specially crafted packets on a network being monitored by Wireshark or
by enticing a user to read a malformed packet trace file, causing a
Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-1.0.3"
