Uh, so what?

Most remote-login systems allow you to do that.

If someone gets access to my email, the last thing I am worried
about them getting is my IP address. My email account has much more
sensitive and revealing information that would be useful to an
attacker.

If you work in a sensitive environment and are connecting to a
webmail provider then that alone is a problem.

It'll give you the country, possibly the state, that is about it.
You'd need a court order to get any more information and good luck
with that.

Useless? I value knowing if someone else is accessing my email
account via that feature, much more than I worry about someone
finding my IP address.

No, not time to "scrap this feature".

This is another sad attempt at attention whoring, but you'll find
that more people care about the risks of NOT having this feature
than they care about the fact someone could find the IP address you
connected to, which in this day and age is trivially available
information.

Please, leave the real research to the experts and stop trying to
whore attention.
