Hackers don't care about being caught.

1. They goto jail for two years.

2 . They get made a martyr by hacker social circles.

3. They come out of jail, get hired as a security consultant and get
paid Â£65,000 a year for the rest of their life.

Yeah, its a *real* bad thing getting caught hacking these days.
