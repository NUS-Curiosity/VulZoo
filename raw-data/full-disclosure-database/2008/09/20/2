Subject: ASLR

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Anyone tried setting the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
Manager\Memory Management\MoveImages key (which, by default, does not
exist) so as to mandate ASLR coverage (value of -1 to mandate coverage on
all PEs)? Anyone had success (or big problems) with this, such as major s/w
vendors' apps not being compatible?

Thanks,
G
