you come across as more retarded than the people you're replying to
though, so surely what you're doing is counterproductive? you're not
going to become the next gobbles or n3td3v if thats what you're trying
to do, you're not really cut out for trolling are you? you fail at
trolling,and its unlikely robert lemos is going to write about any
more trolls, i think n3td3v was the first and last he will do, due to
moral concerns about talking about people he doesn't really know much
about. n3td3v is unique, you just aren't showing any unique qualities
thats going to get you spoken about in the media, or in pdf files :)
notice security gods, and stand aside when you can't equalize.;)
