	Low Signal to Noise Ratio on FD

I recommend altering the sampling spot & frequency, once the frequency of 
mails start rising to a rather high level, take a sample, and thrash the 
rest.
If required, repeat over a period of at least 3 days to manage the lag & 
noise. Oversampling could yield erraneous results and could lead to 
segmentation of the FD community.
