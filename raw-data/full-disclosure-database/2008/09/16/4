I don't think the old girl is going to last very much longer.
At a guess i would think that he will have large rent arrears and is
probably spending his money on alcohol rather than food so the end
can't be long.

The SNR will improve once he is either homeless or incarcerated in the
Royal Edinburgh hospital.

Either way he will be phun for tourists to watch next festival as he
rolls around in the gutters of teh grassmarket uttering his confused
paranoid ramblings assuming he survives the winter.

best wishes

mike
