Subject: OFFTOPIC - moderated subset of list is back

Apologies for the off topic post. Send flames directly to me, not to 
full-disclosure please.

For those of you like me who can't stand the incessant noise and smell 
of monkeys flinging poop at each other I've started running a moderated 
version of full-disclosure again. Currently 152 email addresses are 
allowed (vendors, smart people, etc.) to post automatically and 167 are 
blocked (the poop flingers). It's not as fine grained as I would like 
but it's mostly automatic so posts aren't held up.
