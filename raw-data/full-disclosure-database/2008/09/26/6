Autism experts, politicians, lawyers and civil rights campaigners are
urging Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, to intervene in the case of
the British hacker Gary McKinnon so that he can be tried in Britain
rather than being extradited to the US.

McKinnon, recently diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome (AS), has
exhausted all legal challenges but Smith can intervene on
compassionate grounds.

McKinnon, 42, from north London, is accused of hacking into US
military and Nasa computers and causing $700,000 damage. Having lost
appeals against extradition to the House of Lords and the European
court of human rights, he could be extradited to the US any day.

Karen Todner, his solicitor, said yesterday that she was still waiting
to hear from the home secretary regarding a plea that he be allowed to
stand trial in the UK.

"I hope that she will be brave enough to make the right decision or,
at the very least, ensure that he would be allowed to serve his entire
term in this country," said Todner.

Autism specialists are also calling on Smith to exercise her
discretionary right. "I believe Gary to be 'guilty' of having AS,"
said Dr Luke Beardon, senior lecturer in autism at the autism centre
at Sheffield Hallam University.

"That he hacked into the Pentagon is apparent; it is also crystal
clear to me that he did this as a direct result of following the
obsessional interest which drives him, with no malicious intent to
harm the computers or any human beings whatsoever."

Sir John Stanley, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, wrote to Smith
earlier this month expressing his concern about the "one-sided nature"
of the UK-US extradition agreement.

Campaigners are due to protest against the extradition outside the US
embassy in London on Sunday.
