Subject: Estonian Cyber Security Strategy document -- now
	available online

Hello.

The Estonian cyber security strategy document is now available online.
I must say once again the concept of a national cyber security stance is 
quite interesting.

Those who wish to download the document::

My contact there specified she'd be happy to answer any questions. To 
avoid spam of her inbox, email me for her address.

Gadi Evron.
