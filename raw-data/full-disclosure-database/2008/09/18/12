* Title:     McAfee SafeBoot Device Encryption
             Plain Text Password Disclosure
* Date:      17/09/2008
* Software:  McAfee SafeBoot Device Encryption v4, Build 4750 and below

--[ Synopsis:

    The password checking routine of SafeBoot Device Encryption fails to
    sanitize the BIOS keyboard buffer after reading passwords, resulting
    in plain text password leakage to unprivileged local users.

--[ Affected Software:

  * SafeBoot Device Encryption v4, Build 4750 and below

--[ Non Affected Software:

  * SafeBoot Device Encryption v4, Build 4760 and above
  * SafeBoot Device Encryption v5.x

--[ Technical description:

    SafeBoot's pre-boot authentication routines use the BIOS API to
    read user input via the keyboard. The BIOS internally copies the
    keystrokes in a RAM structure called the BIOS Keyboard buffer
    inside the BIOS Data Area. This buffer is not flushed after use,
    resulting in potential plain text password leakage once the OS
    is fully booted, assuming the attacker can read the password at
    physical memory location 0x40:0x1e.


--[ Impact:

    Plain text password disclosure. Local guest access is required,
    but no physical access to the machine.
