	execution of arbitrary code

Steve,

I just had a look at your patch and it seems to me that you just filter out
the remote command execution and not the file disclosure in Twiki.
http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/t/twiki/twiki_4.0.5-9.1etch1.diff.gz

The configure file is patched with this
   if ( $image =~ /^([-.\w]+)$/ ) {
        $image = $1;
    }
You are basically allowing the ../../../ which can be used for
../../../etc/passwd

In terms of example, what you have done is filter out
/bin/configure?action=image;image=|ls%20-l|;type=text/plain
and not
/bin/configure?action=image;image=|../../../../../../etc/passwd|;type=text/plain
