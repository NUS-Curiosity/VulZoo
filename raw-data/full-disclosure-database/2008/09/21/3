Sometimes I wonder why we bother...

This has been used in the past (and maybe even to phish Yahoo -- not sure 
now).

Several times.

And reported thusly.

Maybe Yahoo just doesn't care?  They fixed this same redirector issue on 
other Yahoo sub-domains, but missed (or chose not to fix it on) the 
"login" sub-domain.

The gibbons in their web dev teams must be seriously underpaid, or just 
don't care.

The Yahoo! security wonks who got this fixed on the other sub-domains 
back in February will be a tad pissed at the gibbons for missing this 
instance though, I suspect...
