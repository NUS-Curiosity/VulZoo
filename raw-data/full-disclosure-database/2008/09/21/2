Remember - n3td3v is in the British Isles, where clusterfuck IT is rampant in
the government sector.  You know, like "Let's lose the financial details of
*EVERY SINGLE FRIKKING FAMILY IN THE COUNTRY on an UNENCRYPTED DISK".

Oh, why was the disk unencrypted? Because the policy on how to securely
transfer the data was deemed so sensitive that it was only accessible to
upper management - the people *doing* the work didn't have access to the
policy of how to do it right.
