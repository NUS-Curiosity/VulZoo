Subject: Re: The new 'cyber politica' mailing list thats
	planned for the non-technical elite

Hi, my comment wasn't meant to flame you. I was basically trying to say that
if you used your email for sensitive stuff, and it had been compromised, the
intruder finding out your IP address is the least of your worries. I'm sorry
if it was interpreted as a flame.

Anyway, I like the idea of a non-technical mailing list. I'd be sure to sign
up :)
