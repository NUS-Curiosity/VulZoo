Not good; this is usually interpreted as coercion by companies like
e.g. Cisco. I've seen cases where companies had all of their Cisco
accounts terminated because someone took this approach.

There's a better way to do this than to find every single user: become
a member of a local CERT, and have the issue discussed there, for
example.

Do not nonymously release advisories for security issues the vendor has
not acknowledged! This is a straight road to trouble.

Sometimes other CERT members happen to have developer accounts for the
products in question, if such a thing exists. This allows you to create
a patch for the product and circulate it along with the advisory. This
minimizes the risk level for users of the product, of course.
