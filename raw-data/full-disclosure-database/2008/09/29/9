I just think someone from the military should be in the dock as
well!!! This wasn't a one sided security incident, sloppy admins were
involved in the 'threat to national security' that Gary Mckinnon
supposedly posed.

The passwords on the systems weren't set, if it wasn't Gary Mckinnon
it was going to be some other script kid who got in.

I don't know why the military are making a big deal about what
happened, when ultimately its their I.T security staff who were the
main culprits of blame.

Accoriding to Gary Mckinnon, there were lots of script kids in the
systems at the same time as him, they just decided to pick him out of
the crowd to make an example of the activity that was going on.

This should be a non-issue that should have been delt with internally
in the military, the I.T security staff blamed and the script kids
left to go on their humble way.

When the way of intrusion is this lame, and its obvious the blame is
on the I.T security staff, then I don't think they should waste
everyone's time herding one of the script kid across the atlantic,
just to keep America's nation pride in tact.

Geez fucking christ, it was totally the military's fault, there is no
get out clause.
