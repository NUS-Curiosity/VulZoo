Subject: W3C filtered as child porn by Finnish ISP

According to Neural Broadcaster blog of Martti Roitto:

"Due to reasons yet to be determined, the website of the World Wide Web Consortium, w3.org/w3c.org, is being filtered as child pornography (wget/curl) by the Finnish ISP, DNA Internet.

Update Sept 27. 3PM: DNA has removed w3c from their list, but another ISP, Mikkelin Puhelin (MPY) has added it (dig/host).

To clear up some confusion: The blacklist isnt maintained independently by ISPs but rather centrally by the Finnish Police.
The reason w3c isnt being blocked by other operators is simple - they havent yet updated their lists to the latest version."

The blacklist has been reportedly updated and W3C is not blocked any more.
