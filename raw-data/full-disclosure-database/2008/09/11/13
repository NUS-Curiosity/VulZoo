There has been a lot of publicity about the Marcus Sachs Youtube video
that is a clip of his panel discussion at Black Hat 2008, "Commission
on Cyber Security for the 44th Presidency".

Jeff, we need the full pdf, audio, video of what he said to put my
mind at rest, can you arrange it bro?

There is a lot of speculation now about the Obama sex video spam, Cnet
News is even speculating about a false flag cyber attack to influence
the political process.

"Is it the work of the Republicans?" Cnet News said.
