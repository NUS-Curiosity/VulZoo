Ok, I'll bite.Â  Why, my dear n3td3v, do you consider yourself "elite"?

You're one of the FD trolls, don't try and talk as the 3rd person.

You're constantly on Nanog trolling as well.

You manage to pass off to some as a legit mailing list poster, but
many think you're nothing more than a troll.

You are part of the non-technical elite, you should be on FD asking
for it to be split in two, technical and non-technical, you and me
being on the non-technical.

If we're non-technical we're called trolls, if we're technical
we're
called hackers.

Let's hope John Cartwright sets up 'cyber-politica' soon, so me and
Gadi can get off the technical FD for good and leave the hackers to
it.
