I've recently been involved in an email thread which, partly by my
doing, unfortunately degraded into a dirty flame war for a few hours.

Whenever meta discussion takes over real discussion, frustration builds
up inside me. This comic strip from today which a friend just sent me,
seems to explain the concept much better than I can.

FD trolls, take a look.
