Here is some brain storming then:

- The reason for the outage / cyber attack might be political.

- Even if the outage is just a computer glitch, it might have
political ramifications.

- outages@...ages.org is a 'professional' mailing list, cyber-politica
would welcome all high jinks, not just the professional crowd.

- You might be an IT professional who wants to post an outage / cyber
attack report on cyber-politica to see what the cyber miscreants
reaction is, you are currently scared to do this on full-disclosure
incase you get called something, or accused of 'noise'.[1]

Add your own ideas to the list of what value cyber-politica could bring. :)

[1] Gadi Evron currently does this on full-disclosure and everyone
hates him for it because its ment to be a technical mailing list, on
the cyber-politica mailing list it would be allowed and you wouldn't
get called something, or accused of 'noise' for trying to get the
opinion of cyber miscreants about outages and cyber attacks.
