Who are those "American officials" that the BBC is quoting?

The only one that can pass sentence, is the judge himself... And he MUST be
impartial...

Yet the Americans haven't comforted anybody in that respect, they've
said the usually rhetoric you expect to hear from them, "we want to
see him fry" and won't give any guarantees of a lenient sentence,
thats whats causing all the problems and uncertainties.

If Gary Mckinnon thought he was going to get a fair trial and a fair
sentence, he would have flown over. The problem arises that the U.S
are noising him up and saying he is gonna fry.

"American officials involved in this case have stated that they want
to see him 'fry'."-- BBC.

All the best,
