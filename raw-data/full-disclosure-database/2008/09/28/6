 He faces a MAXIMUM sentence of 60 years....  I seriously doubt he'll get
the maximum.

  I hear that in the UK people are calling him innocent, and that he didn't
do anything wrong, he doesn't deserve to be tried....  

  The words are both with the US AND with the UK.... Goes both ways....

If you're only going to give him 4 years, then don't say he's gonna
get 60 and that he is gonna fry. This is what is causing all the
problems, just say we're gonna give you 4 years if you come over.

Don't come out with the usual American crap about going to fry. It
really is all about the fry comment and 60 year stuff thats causing
all the problems.

If America isn't going to give him 60 years, then don't make out that
he is with the fry comment, the language is causing a lot of issues.

The Americans need to stop screwing with the guys head and be fair
about whats going to happen to him, he has admitted to the crime, he
has been fair with you, now you be fair with him, and stop all this
gonna fry non-sence.
