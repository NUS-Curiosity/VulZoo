Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability in ed may allow for the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GNU ed is a basic line editor. red is a restricted version of ed that
does not allow shell command execution.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  sys-apps/ed        < 1.0                                   >= 1.0

Description
===========

Alfredo Ortega from Core Security Technologies reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in the strip_escapes() function when processing overly
long filenames.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to process specially crafted
commands with ed or red, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU ed users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/ed-1.0"
