Marcus Sachs and his cronies want him sent over to the United States
during election time, to hype up his crime, put him infront of the
nation on CNN and Fox News and tell everyone how hackers are about to
take over the world.

The next administration will believe the propaganda and the general
public too, because they don't actually know much about cybersecurity
and take Marcus Sachs's word for it.

Its a shame for Gary Mckinnon, he has been extremely unlucky, he is
going to be used for political objectives by Marcus Sachs and his
cronies.

Marcus Sachs is powerful enough in "cyber" to save this man's skin,
but the political wins he will get out of hyping up Gary Mckinnon's
crime and sending up away for 60 years is too big a political capitial
for Marcus Sachs and his cronies to let slip.
