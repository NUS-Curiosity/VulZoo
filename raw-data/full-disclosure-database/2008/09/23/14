Subject: Disintegrate! Gust of wind! Can we get back to
 saving the world already?

I've recently been involved in an email thread which, partly by my doing,
unfortunately degraded into a dirty flame war for a few hours.

Whenever meta discussion takes over real discussion, frustration builds up
inside me. This comic strip from today which a friend just sent me, seems
to explain the concept much better than I can.

FD trolls, take a look.
