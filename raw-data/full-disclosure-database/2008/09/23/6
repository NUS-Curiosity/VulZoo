Subject: Infected U.S. PCs may have attacked Georgia

When political tensions flared last month between Georgia and its
large neighbor to the north, the country was ready to block Internet
traffic from Russia, hoping to avoid the denial-of-service attacks
that shut down Internet service in Estonia for several days in 2007.
Instead, most of the DoS attacks that were directed against Georgia
came from an unlikely place: the United States.

cronies to influence the next administration as it is coming in, so
for the next 4 / 8 years cybersecurity will be a national security
item and so his group will get funding and be taken seriously.
