Hi,

I am glad to release sqlmap version 0.6.

Introduction
============

sqlmap is an automatic SQL injection tool developed in Python. Its goal
is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities on web
applications. Once it detects one or more SQL injections on the target
host, the user can choose among a variety of options to perform an
extensive back-end database management system fingerprint, retrieve DBMS
session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes, privileges,
databases, dump entire or user's specific DBMS tables/columns, run his
own SQL SELECT statement, read specific files on the file system and
much more.


Changes
=======

Some of the new features include:

* Added multithreading support to set the maximum number of concurrent
HTTP requests.

* Implemented SQL shell (--sql-shell) functionality and fixed SQL query
(--sql-query, before called -e) to be able to run whatever SELECT
statement and get its output in both inband and blind SQL injection attack.

* Added an option (--privileges) to retrieve DBMS users privileges, it
also notifies if the user is a DBMS administrator.

* Added support (-c) to read options from configuration file, an example
of valid INI file is sqlmap.conf and support (--save) to save command
line options on a configuration file.

* Implemented support for HTTPS requests over HTTP(S) proxy.

* Enhanced logging system: added three more levels of verbosity to show
also HTTP sent and received traffic.
