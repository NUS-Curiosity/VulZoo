Because he's writing about the *BASE* system kernel for Linux and the *BSD's.

If he included grsec, he'd *also* have to start adding 'NetBSD does this,
unless you've applied this patch to your kernel, in which case it does that, or
if this other patch was added, making it do this instead...'

Or you can get Linus to merge the code in question.  See the the helpful info
in the file Documentation/SubmittingPatches.  You want to send them to the
netdev@...r.kernel.org list for review, that's where the network developers
hang out.
