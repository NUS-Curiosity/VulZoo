Synopsis
========

Amarok uses temporary files in an insecure manner, allowing for a
symlink attack.

Background
==========

Amarok is an advanced music player.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  media-sound/amarok      < 1.4.10                        >= 1.4.10

Description
===========

Dwayne Litzenberger reported that the
MagnatuneBrowser::listDownloadComplete() function in
magnatunebrowser/magnatunebrowser.cpp uses the album_info.xml temporary
file in an insecure manner.

Impact
======

A local attacker could perform a symlink attack to overwrite arbitrary
files on the system with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Amarok users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/amarok-1.4.10"
