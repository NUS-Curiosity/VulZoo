Marcus Sachs and his cronies don't care though, they want to
artificially ramp up cyber security, no matter how much the cost or
disruption... to them cyber security is a national security agenda,
and they want to convince the average joe it is as well. Bringing Gary
Mckinnon to U.S is a god send gift for him. He'll be able to get Gary
Mckinnon onto every television screen in U.S during election time,
influence middle America, all the areas of America he needs to
convince about cyber security, get the voting public onside, a better
job than he managed to do with Die Hard 4.

All the best,
