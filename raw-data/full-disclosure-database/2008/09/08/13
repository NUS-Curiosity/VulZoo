As a percentage of the total US federal government budget, it's merely a grain
of sand on the beach.  Nobody gives a flying f**k in a rolling donut about one
more guy in prison, we've already got several million there already and one
more will make a 0.000005% difference in our prison budget.

It may come as a surprise, but there are many economically challenged areas in
the US that will *welcome* a new prison, because that means jobs for prison
guards.  If your local unemployment rate is hanging around 10-15% because of a
lack of major industry in the area, a prison starts looking pretty good...

Good. Now that you've said that, can you please shut the fuck up about cyber
warfare, whether it's government sponsored or grassroots movement?

For the record, although any single hacking case probably isn't the President's
job, unless it's a highly visible one like the McKinnon case, the question of
what policies/directives should be issued to deal with the general question
*is* the President's job.
