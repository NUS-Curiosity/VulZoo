so do you work for Salsoft, or are you trying to break into a machine owned
by them?
 
If it's a network you monitor, meaning you have direct responsibility for,
wouldn't you already know if it's a honeypot?
 
  sounds fishy that you have to ask....

So...one of the networks I monitor has this ip:

66.139.73.183

Doing netbios scans on it.  A cursory inspection shows it as a win2003
box...that's WIDE open.  Could this be a honeypot that's been compromised?

Curious
