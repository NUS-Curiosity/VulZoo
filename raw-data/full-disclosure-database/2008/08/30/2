Subject: Inside Indiaâ€™s CAPTCHA Solving Economy

Hello,

The following article aims to expose a booming CAPTCHA solving economy
in India, employing thousands of legitimate data processing workers,
whose business model is already being abused by cybercriminals paying
pocket money for using it :

"Let's analyze the shady data processing economy of India, discuss
exclusive photos of Indian workers breaking MySpace and Google
CAPTCHAs, and take a tour inside the web applications of several
Bangladesh based franchises, whose team of almost 1,000 international
workers is actively soliciting deals for breaking Craigslist, Gmail,
Yahoo, MySpace, YouTube and Facebook's CAPTCHA, promising to deliver
250k solved CAPTCHAs per day on a "$2 for a 1000 solved CAPTCHAs"
rate. One of the services in question is the India based
decaptcher.com, which will allow you to retrieve its API once you
putIndia CAPTCHA breakers money in their PayPal account."
