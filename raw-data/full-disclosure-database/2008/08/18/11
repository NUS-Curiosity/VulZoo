   Isn't that quite old news?  Not only the article doesn't offer anything 
new, but It also doesn't give the full picture and offer very little 
useful information compared to the real discussion.

   I did read the thread at this time, and there was many interesting 
ideas.  If I happens to see an article that resume well the issues 
involved, I'll post a link, but I won't spend much time searching, so 
don't wait after me.


   By the way, Linus Torvalds is very well known to enjoy starting flames 
on purpose (he calls that "flamefesting").  This time, the troll was trown 
at OpenBSD, but It was too big to be taken seriously by them, so It is 
mostly the security people that reacted.

   I prefer the troll he launched last year when he basically said that 
Gnome is just a waste of time and than both users and developers should 
just give-up and move on to KDE, which would be a much better and 
productive use of their time.  It was said in 2007 directly on some major 
Gnome mailing list, like his previous flames against Gnome. :o)
