sir, the etymology of the fine Tea Baggins, son of Frodo Baggins,
begat from Bilbo, son of Bungo Baggins, sired by Mungo Baggins, who's
father, the great Balbo Baggins, is patriarch of the tree of Baggins,
including all Tea Baggins, is not a matter to be taken lightly!

please excuse yourself for such dishonor implied by this obscene
"TEABAG" reference.

(also, contrary to popular misconception, the great Gandalf has never
enjoyed "lemon parties"; this rumor merely one of the many frenzied
insults devised by Saruman's groupies...)
