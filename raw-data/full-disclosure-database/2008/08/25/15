* Title:     Microsoft Bitlocker Plain Text Password Disclosure
* Date:      25/08/2008
* Software:  Microsoft Bitlocker

- --[ Synopsis:

    Bitlocker is the disk encryption feature introduced in Microsoft
    Vista. It has the capability to authentify users in several way,
    including with a password (PIN), when configured to work with the
    TPM chip.

    The password checking routine of Microsoft Bitlocker fails to
    sanitize the BIOS keyboard buffer after reading passwords, resulting
    in plain text password leakage to unprivileged local users.

- --[ Affected Software:

  * Microsoft Bitlocker/Vista (SP0)

- --[ Non Affected Software:

  * Microsoft Bitlocker/Vista (SP1)

- --[ Technical description:

    Bitlocker's pre-boot authentication routines use the BIOS API to
    read user input via the keyboard. The BIOS internally copies the
    keystrokes in a RAM structure called the BIOS Keyboard buffer
    inside the BIOS Data Area. This buffer is not flushed after use,
    resulting in potential plain text password leakage once the OS
    is fully booted, assuming the attacker can read the password at
    physical memory location 0x40:0x1e.


- --[ Impact:

    Plain text password disclosure. Local guest access is required,
    but no physical access to the machine.
