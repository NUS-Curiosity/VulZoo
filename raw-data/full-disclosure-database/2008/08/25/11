4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Novell
iPrint Client, which can be exploited by malicious people to 
compromise a user's system.

1) A boundary error in the Novell iPrint ActiveX control (ienipp.ocx)
when handling the "GetDriverFile()" method can be exploited to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow by passing an overly long string as the 
third argument.

2) Two boundary errors in the Novell iPrint ActiveX control 
(ienipp.ocx) when constructing a URI based on input to the 
"GetPrinterURLList()" and "GetPrinterURLList2()" methods can be 
exploited to cause limited stack-based buffer overflows via an overly
long string passed as the 1st argument.

3) A boundary error in the Novell iPrint ActiveX control (ienipp.ocx)
when handling the "GetFileList()" method can be exploited to cause a 
heap-based buffer overflow via an overly long argument.

4) Various boundary errors in nipplib.dll when e.g. creating a server
reference or interpreting a URI can be exploited to cause stack-based 
and heap-based buffer overflows by e.g. passing an overly long string 
as argument to the "GetServerVersion()", "GetResourceList()", or 
"DeleteResource()" methods provided by the Novell iPrint ActiveX 
control (ienipp.ocx).

5) Boundary errors in the Novell iPrint ActiveX control (ienipp.ocx) 
when constructing a URI based on input to the "UploadPrinterDriver()"
and "UploadResource()" methods can be exploited to cause a heap-based 
buffer overflow and limited stack-based buffer overflow via an overly 
long, specially crafted "uploadPath" argument.

6) A boundary error in the Novell iPrint ActiveX control (ienipp.ocx) 
when copying "target-frame" option values passed to the 
"ExecuteRequest()" method can be exploited to cause a limited 
stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long "target-frame" option 
value.

7) A boundary error in the Novell iPrint ActiveX control (ienipp.ocx)
when handling the "UploadResource()" method can be exploited to cause
a stack-based buffer overflow by passing an overly long string as the
7th argument.

8) Three boundary errors in nipplib.dll within the 
"IppGetDriverSettings()" function can be exploited to cause 
stack-based buffer overflows by passing an overly long string as the
2nd, 3rd, or 4th argument of the "GetDriverSettings()" method provided
by Novell iPrint ActiveX control (ienipp.ocx).

9) A boundary error in the Novell iPrint ActiveX control (ienipp.ocx)
when handling the "UploadResourceToRMS" method can be exploited to 
cause a stack-based buffer overflow by passing an overly long string 
as the 8th argument.
