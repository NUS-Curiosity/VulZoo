Subject: ASCII Art shellcode

Hi all,

I've put some more stuff online I created in the last two years; ASCII Art
shellcode:
 http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php?title=ASCII_Art/Shellcode/Organic
*http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php?title=ASCII_Art/Shellcode/Blocky*<http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php?title=ASCII_Art/Shellcode/Blocky>
 http://skypher.com/wiki/index.php?title=ASCII_Art/Shellcode/Julia

As the name suggests, it is working shellcode that's also ASCII Art. They
all use the same basic principle: a small decoder embeded into the first
characters of the ASCII Art. After the decoder, the original shellcode is
encoded into the remainder of the ASCII Art. When executed, the decoder
decodes the original shellcode and runs it, similar to how my ALPHA2
alphanumeric shellcode works.

If you are going to release an exploit, you might as well make it look good.

Cheers,

SkyLined
