Subject: Re: free static analysis tool for c/c++

Awesome!
I hadn't realized that I could use fd to make requests also.

I would like some quicktime 0day, some bitchin shellcode that makes all 
the windows melt away revealing the word "PWNT" in big red letters on a 
black background, and 3 gallons of chocolate milk.

On a side note, lack of proper static analysis tools in the OSS 
community makes the baby jesus cry.
