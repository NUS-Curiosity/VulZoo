Verbal contracts of non-disclosure agreements don't work, you need a
new law in place, which I call the responsible disclosure act,
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Jul/0439.html to enforce the
agreement by a law if the agreement is broken. Or are you guys just
gonna do another "oops the cat's out the bag" again like what happened
with the verbal contract agreement Dan Kaminsky had with everyone
before a blog entry leaked the vulnerability by *accident*. Is this
Microsoft agreement of non-disclosure actually enforceable by any
current law? If not a new law is needed to be drawn up, see the link
above, or this "Microsoft Active Protection Program" is gonna turn out
a complete shambles.
