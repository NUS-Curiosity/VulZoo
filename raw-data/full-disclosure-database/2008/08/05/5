Subject: Re: more rehashes of xss & 'evil gif'

Clearly this class of vulnerabilities is nothing short of epic, entirely
new, and truly worth our time and fear.  When combined with the stellar
research and presentation skills of said researchers it meets 3/4
requirements for widespread media cuntbaggery, observe:

1) words that sound new and cool
-->"The attack relies on a new type of hybrid file"

hybrid: hybrid, hmm sort of hydra, sort of like internet super worm of
doom??!! watchout!

2)social networking sites
-->"giving the bad guys access to the victim's Facebook account."

zomgz did someone say facebook? watch out, your teenage whore daughter is
now at risk!

3)moderately not clever acronym
-->"They call this type of file a GIFAR, a contraction of GIF and JAR"

plus it sounds like some sort of mythical beast?!  GIFAR, ROAR!  do you
think they'll have a cool animation for it on their slides? one can only
dream!

wait, what about the 4th requirement?  how about the possibility of anyone
actually being owned? wait, no.
