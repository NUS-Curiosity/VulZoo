Is what you're describing not against the law Valdis, it sure sounds
like it to me. Some kind of gross negligence...

Is this what goes on at Virginia Tech on a regular basis? Maybe the
authorities should be looking into you a lot more while they are
looking into HD Moore. ;)

I wonder if the the intelligence services thought like you before 9/11
and 7/7 eh...I get the feeling they did.

For sure people like you who support this kind of activity should be
investigated. It sounds criminal.

Have you ever carried out this kind of activity Valdis where you put
security and people at risk to make and/or save money?

If cyber-terrorism is going to become a real threat, we don't need
people like Valdis around and we should sure keep track of him.

Would you allow a cyber-9-11 to happen Valdis if there was money
involved? I'm starting to become worried about you dude, maybe I
should be e-mailing the folks at Virginia Tech this thread, and
perhaps, just perhaps the F.B.I and see what they think about what
you've just told me.

You seem to be normalizing what you've just described to me as normal
run-of-the-mill legal activity, when it clearly isn't.

To me what you've just described is illegal, criminal and wrong.

All the best,
