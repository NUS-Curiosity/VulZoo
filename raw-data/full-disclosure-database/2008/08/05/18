Are you suggesting HD Moore had prior knowledge that the Austin Texas
AT&T servers were vulnerable? Knowingly knew AT&T was vulnerable but
purposely left it exposed to attack, so that he could get publicity
for the tags "HD Moore", "Metasploit" and "Breaking Point" if the AT&T
servers ever did get attacked? This sounds like something the
intelligence services do, they know about an attack is possible but
let it happen for political gains.

What is it you're accusing HD Moore of Valdis, allowing an attack to
happen like the intelligence services do all the time?

This is a big allegation you've put forward Valdis, that AT&T and the
authorities should look into..

Yeah, i'm beginning to see how this industry works, false flag
attacks, allowing attacks to happen for political gains, the
corruption and the criminality.

All the best,
