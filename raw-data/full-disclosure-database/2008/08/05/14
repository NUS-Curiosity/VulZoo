FLAWS:
1)  This also assumes that no new users ever start using the Internet that
may become new victims
2) It also assumes that all evolutions in phisher techniques are
predictable.  Anyone following the industry knows that all sorts of things
have been done so that their phishes seem more realistic/plausible.  And,
after using these new techniques, RED can push the number of victims back up
-- in direct contradiction of your statements, which do not reflect what
happens.

These 2 facts alone explain why phishing isn't the simple fix you have made
it out to be.  Your model is flawed, as it is based on flawed assumptions.

not interesting anymore.
