No - simply saying that either they were vulnerable, or they weren't.  If
they weren't vulnerable, HD didn't have to do anything.  And even if they
*were*, somebody would still have to actually *attack* them.

And even if they *got* attacked, it's quite possible that the upsides of not
bothering to do something outweighed the risks.  If you estimate that the
cost (including "things you could have spent your time doing") is more than
the losses, why bother?  "Even if we *got* whacked, we'd lose maybe $500. But
in the time I'd waste dealing with the issue, I could generate something that
will get us $2,000 in revenue.  So if I fix it, I lose $1500, and if I ignore
it, I come out $1,500 ahead if we get hit, and $2,000 if we don't".
