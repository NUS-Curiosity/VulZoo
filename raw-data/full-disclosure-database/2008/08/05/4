seems dan isn't the only press whore around! rebouncing from his embarasing
post about 'deputy dan' and the matasano blog - whoosh anyone? nate and his
crew of javascript gurus have whipped up another rehash of an old class of
bugs that has been used in the wild for a long time. we personally want to
thank nate for his great work hes done for conferences over the years
filling up their talking spots with useless crap. his work is only rivaled
by gadi evron who gets accepted to every conference because declining a fat
AND jewish person is guarenteed to get 1000s of big nosed ambulance chasers
after you by the end of business day.

once again we would ilke to thank nate for his cutting edge research and
hopefully he will get nommed for next years pwnie life time acheivement
award!
