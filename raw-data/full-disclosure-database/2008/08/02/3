Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 08.01.08: Ingres
 Database for Linux ingvalidpw Untrusted Library Path Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 08.01.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 01, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Ingres Database is a database server used in several Computer
Associates' products. For example, CA Directory Service use thes Ingres
Database server. More information can be found on the vendor's website
at the following URL.

http://ingres.com/downloads/prod-cert-download.php

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an untrusted library path vulnerability in the
"ingvalidpw" utility, as included in Ingres Database 2006 Release 2 for
Linux, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

The vulnerability exists within the "ingvalidpw" utility included with
Ingres database. This utility is used to verify a user's credentials,
and is installed set-uid root. When loading shared libraries, the
"ingvalidpw" program will load libraries from a directory owned by the
"ingres" user. By using a specially crafted library, a user with
"ingres" privileges can gain root.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to elevate their
privileges from the "ingres" user to root. By itself, this is not that
serious of a vulnerability. However, when combined with the libbecompat
and verifydb vulnerabilities it allows an unprivileged local user to
gain root privileges.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Ingres
2006 Enterprise Edition Release 2 for Linux x86 (32-bit). Other
versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
