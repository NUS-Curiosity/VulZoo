Subject: ArpON detects and blocks Arp Poisoning/Spoofing
	attacks

Hi,
My name is Andrea Di Pasquale and I study at Secondary High School  
"S. Quasimodo"
in Catania, Italy.

Some time ago I released a research project related to the security  
of the
address resolution protocol Arp, the project name being Arpon (Arp  
handler
inspection).

Arpon makes the protocol secure without recurring to algorythms, SSL or
any other technology which is not part of the standard protocol.
Arpon is a daemon based on the Arp handling mechanism in kernel space  
that
uses different policies either in static environments (Static Arp  
Inspection
algorythm), or in DHCP dynamic ones (Dynamic Arp Inspection algorythm).
Arpon is written as a user space tool so it can work on posix platforms:
infact it is extensively tested on platform such as Max OS X,  
FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
NetBSD and Linux.

Today I suggest you to have a look at the project, because I think it  
has
great potentiality, the only competitor on the market being Cisco's DAI
on Catalyst 4500 devices (which uses DHCP to securify ARP; Arpon just  
uses
the standard kspace protocol implementation instead).

Furthermore, Arpon is Open Source software.

Thanks for the attention, I hope in your interest.
Cordially,
Andrea.
