Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 08.01.08: Ingres
 Database for Linux libbecompat Stack Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 08.01.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 01, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Ingres Database is a database server used in several Computer
Associates' products. For example, CA Directory Service use thes Ingres
Database server. More information can be found on the vendor's website
at the following URL.

http://ingres.com/downloads/prod-cert-download.php

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the
"libbecompat" library, as included in Ingres Database 2006 Release 2 for
Linux, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the Ingres user.

The vulnerability exists within the "libbecompat" library that is used
by several of the set-uid "ingres" utilities included with Ingres. When
copying a user supplied environment variable into a fixed-size stack
buffer, the library fails to check the length of the source string.
This results in an exploitable stack buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the "ingres" user. By itself,
this vulnerability does not have very serious consequences. However,
when combined with the library loading vulnerability, it allows an
attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Ingres
2006 Enterprise Edition Release 2 for Linux x86 (32-bit). Other
versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.
