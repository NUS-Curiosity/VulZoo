Subject: ISO Standards


Is it possible to buy ISO standards (27001 and 27002) in the US?  I
quickly looked up on Google and couldn't find any place.  There is an
option to order this from ISO's web site.

I am surprised I couldn't locate any US vendors for these standards? 

Thanks for your comments
Arif
