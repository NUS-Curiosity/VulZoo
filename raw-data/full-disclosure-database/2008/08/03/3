Yes, they are both a bunch of fucking faggots.

He is an elite haxor after all, why would he leave the DNS for his own
company vulnerable, or did he over look something so obvious to check
before releasing the exploit to the wild, or is he not as elite as he
makes out to be and actually didn't think to check DNS infrastructure
linked to his company.

The faggot tried to say nothing at his company was compromsied so he
has nothing to be blamed for, no HD Moore was a fucking faggot who
should have checked out AT&T wasn't vulnerable.

He has no excuse for what happened, he is a global international
hacker leading the release of the exploit code, its his entire
responsibility to make sure his company is secure, even if the servers
that were vulnerable were owned by AT&T.

The AT&T servers are still on his watch, because he is responsible for
the global international release of the exploit code.

So if HD Moore thinks he's off the hook for his company's website
getting hacked via AT&T, think again, you were hacked HD Moore and its
all your fucking fault.

Fucking lamer. Don't go talking shit on your blog that it had
absolutely nothing to do with you, every single server on the internet
that gets compromised because of your irresponsible showing off by
releasing the exploit code when asked not to is all your fucking
fault.

Look, mommy and daddy I built a sandcastle, come look at what I built!
Thats the fucking mentality you had when you released the exploit code
without the permission of the security industry you fat American
Austin Texas fuckhead.

All the best,
