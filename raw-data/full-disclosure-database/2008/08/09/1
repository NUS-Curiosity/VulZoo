An anonymous contributor has risked his life and honor for
mirroring the Petko D. Petkov mailbox on Rapidshare. We appreciate
this act of justice and wish him our best luck on any of his future
endeavors. Justice prevails.

The new mirrors:

Fellow justice vigilantes and Internet inhabitants alike, support a
good and righteous cause today and mirror these files on your
MySpace, web host, P2P folder or wherever it can be made available
for all to see. It is important to protect the availability of
these files. In 10 years, Petko/pdp could still be boring us all
with XSS and useless javascript 'clientside' exploits, and claim
that, as of his super hacker status, he's never been owned. To
ensure this will never happen, these files have to be made part of
Internet history.

All that is unleashed unto the Internet shall remain on the
Internet for the ages to come. This is our very own Rosetta Stone
of Shame and Despair. Don't let it vanish. You can make a
difference today, and we need you.

We might be humble superheroes with extreme awesomeness and
superpowers beyond human comprehension, but we still need help.
Don't let our tight pants get lost in some law enforcement agency
laundry room.

With true love,
the Great Council of Internet Superheros.
"To protect exposure and serve ruin. Justice prevails."
