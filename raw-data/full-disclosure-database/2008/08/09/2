We lost our virginity quite some time ago (some of us with dogs or
ferrets), how about yourself? Does your partner bottom, top, or
both? Do you have any regular sex? We are superheroes, don't waste
our time with these trivial and earthly questions. Our immaturity
amuses us as much you get amused seeing your private email
communications unleashed unto the Internet like a legion of mad
peepees.

For the record, we've seen your pictures, and quite honestly, your
physical fitness is well out of the standards required for any
mediocre superhero. You are chubby, ugly and have a severe lack of
sense for fashion and style. Learn to write English properly if you
want to run into a showdown with the almighty Squadron of Justice.
You are simply not qualified for the challenge. Jews and blacks can
do better.

Regarding getting laid, personally, I, Pink The Whiz Kid, right
hand of Crimson Avenger, have no issues at all. Since I'm a flaming
homosexual with good looks, shaved balls (soft as eggs) and
athletic built, I have plenty of potential sexually active partners
waiting to bottom for me. If you ever question my sexuality again I
will blast a superhero cock into your anus and provoke the biggest
rectal bleeding ever seen. No shit.

Please go suck our super awesomely powered dicks on MTV, and
remember to swallow. If we receive any further non-sense without
proper spell and grammar checking, we'll have to run our X-Ray
vision and mad 0day over your life.

Love,
the Great Council of Internet Superheros.
