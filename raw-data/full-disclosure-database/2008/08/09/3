Subject: Brazilian Bank (Caixa Economica Federal) Stupid
	Vuln #02 (Opera's Style)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Hi folks,
some brazilian banks has implementing a system based in computer
identification (like a PC register).

The system have some vulns and can be easily exploited.

Caixa Economica Federal (http://www.caixa.gov.br) never reply us. So,
we will show another stupid way to bypass the computer identification.

One more time, if the attacker have the USERNAME and the PASSWORD of
the user account, the attacker can log in on the bank account without
identify the computer.

To this, just download the Opera Browser. (yes, this is a stupid way
to bypass the bank "protection")

The system based in computer identification can be easily bypassed
using the Opera Browser.

So, download the Opera Browser and you will be logged in, without need
register/identify you machine. :Pwned!

Well, i hope the CAIXA team solve this problem hurry. And next time,
reply our mails.

Sorry to bad english.

Regards...
