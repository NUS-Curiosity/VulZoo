Subject: [PLSA 2008-33] [UPDATED] Opensc: Security Bypass

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pardus Linux Security Advisory 2008-33            security@...dus.org.tr
------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Date: 2008-08-31
   Severity: 2
       Type: Remote
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

[UPDATE]: Last security update with OpenSC 0.11.5 had a small glitch due
to a strict check, so this version fixes that issue.

A  security  issue has been reported in OpenSC, which can be exploited by malicious people
to bypass certain security restrictions.


Description
===========

The security issue is caused due to the application improperly  setting
the ADMIN file control information to  "00"  while  initializing  smart
cards having a Siemens CardOS M4 operating system. This can be exploited
to change a user PIN code without having the PIN or PUK  if  the  smart
card was initialized with OpenSC.


Affected packages:

   Pardus 2008:
     opensc, all before 0.11.6-7-2


Resolution
==========

There are update(s) for opensc. You can update them via Package Manager
or with a single command from console:

     pisi up opensc
