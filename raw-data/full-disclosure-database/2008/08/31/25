Much, if not most, activities in information security have very little  
to do with law, law enforcement, legal actions, or arresting people.   
To catch a criminal is a great thing to do, but day-to-day, the idea  
is to prevent yourself and the people you are trying to protect from  
becoming victims of an attack in the first place.

Publishing a list of domain names that have the potential to be used  
in scams allows administrators (and savvy end-users that read ISC) to  
be aware of potential upcoming problems.  If publishing the list  
deters the owners from using them in scams, then that's a positive  
outcome too.  If they dropped the (admittedly small) amount of money  
speculating on a domain name they wind up not using, then they might  
think twice about doing it again, knowing that there are people  
watching the registrations.  Personally, I don't think it will keep  
them from using the domain names in scams, as there's plenty of money  
to be made, even after subtracting out the would-be-victims informed  
by this list.

Some of the names may see legitimate use.  The ISC postings even  
acknowledge this.  If they do see legitimate use, then that's great,  
however it's still worth monitoring these domains and setting up  
alerts for them in your organization until it can be verified which  
ones are legitimate.
