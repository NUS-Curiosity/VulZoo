As for domain name retailers being named and shamed on funsec, I would
be taking legal action at this stage if I was a domain name retailer,
and if that list appeared on the Nanog mailing list BEFORE an offence
was commited, as I know attention seekers like Gadi Evron are so
tempted to do on Nanog,  i'd be kicking up an even bigger fuss about
it all.

So drive with caution before distributing lists of domain names and
web domain companies before actually doing it.

If such lists appear on Nanog, a real outcry will happen... thats a
message to Gadi Evron, because I know he's going to be tempted to
press send to the ISP community, to look like the leader of info sec
in the eyes of the ISP / LEO mailing lists.

All the best,

n3td3v
