1) Often funsec posts start getting used in news journalist articles.
2) Gadi Evron runs the funsec mailing list and he blasts out anything
to Nanog thats going to get his name up in lights.
3) If accusations of domain name retailers start appearing in the
press, I don't think the domain name retailers are
going to be too happy, seeing as those customers at this stage haven't
commited any offence.

All the best,
