And the actual *damages* would be what, exactly?

How much money was lost, or will likely be lost, as a result of this? Remember
in your discussion to include the fact that these are all *new* sites still
struggling to attract eyeballs - so you can't even claim "Gadi scared off
10% of our eyeballs" because they had *zero* eyeballs last week, so there's
no history to compare against....

Hint: read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect and ask yourself
whether the sites in question - all *new* ones that do not have any established
users yet - are better off being mentioned or not being mentioned.  Gadi
just saved them the cost of paying some (probably shady) company to improve
their page ranking and getting them some hits...
