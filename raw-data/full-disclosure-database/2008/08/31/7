Subject: Re: Gustav, domain name reportage

All i'm saying is, don't copy these idiots, Marcus Sachs and
Jon.Kibler if you are going to be talking about domain names this
hurricane season, thats the message I want to get out to folks.

While its probably most likely these domains are malicious, its wrong
to list them, so publically in this fashion until you know 100% what
the reason is for each domain.

All the best,
