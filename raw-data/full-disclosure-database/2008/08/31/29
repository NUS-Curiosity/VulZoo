Subject: Monthly Hands-On Meetups

Hey Guys,

I was wondering if anyone would like to start something like a
Full-Disclosure monthly group in cities all over the world. It could
be like 2600 meetings except with real security professionals because
personally I don't want to even talk to someone unless they have a CEH
cert.

I just started a new job in digital forensics. It would be fun to meet
other people who like hacking and trading Ubuntu tips and tricks!

Let me know what you think!
