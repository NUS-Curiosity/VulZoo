Putin blames US for Georgia role

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has accused the US of provoking
the conflict in Georgia, possibly for domestic election purposes.

Mr Putin told CNN US citizens were "in the area" during the conflict
over South Ossetia and were "taking direct orders from their leaders".

He said his defence officials had told him the provocation was to
benefit one of the US presidential candidates.

The White House dismissed the allegations as "not rational".
