Sorry to resurrect a 9 day old thread here...

It's an interesting concept, but like all timing based attacks, won't
the digits be more susceptible to noise due to possible network
latency? Even with two queries, there is still a large volume of
requests getting made, and one little bump can invalidate the
information you are pulling out.

If that really isn't an issue, you may want to consider putting the 6
digit first, then 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9 as that's going to show up far more
frequently.
