We bumped into the same problem when we took the ordinal(char) approach.
A small hiccup on the line easily makes an A an E

The bit by bit approach we use
(http://www.sensepost.com/research/squeeza/) makes this problem much
easier to deal with.. i.e. we once had an insanely bad connection to a
box and upp'ed the delay per bit to 14 seconds.. i.e, 14 secs == 1, 0 ==
0. The analyst aged a few years while waiting for the output he needed,
but you can be fairly confident of the integrity of the data.

(its why squeeza happlily does a transfer of binary files from the
server using just timing (and patience))

/mh
 
Ps.. checkout the paper on the same page for snippets of the sql we are
using..
