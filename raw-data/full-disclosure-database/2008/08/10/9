We missed some relevant updates.

Mike Rothman's phone number:
+1 678-449-7183

And some neat insight into Alan Shimel's income, his IRS forms
scanned:

http://bayimg.com/image/cakkdaabc.jpg
SSN: 088-54-4202

This guy earns 16k US dollars monthly. In the meanwhile, people
are struggling in Africa to fight starvation, walking a few miles
to bring non-edible water to their people.

If Alan spared some dollars from paying abortions for his
extramarital
relationships and burgers at McDonalds, a few dozen families could
realize there's a better world for them out there.

This Great Council disapproves these abuses against humankind. An
overweight man makes 16k-plus bucks a month just for blogging,
taking phone calls, meeting other obese executives, and a child has
to walk 4 miles in Africa to avoid dieing dehydrated.

Alan Shimel goes to Disneyworld with his family (we won't release
information on minors, or relatives unless they are associated
with business or activities in the industry, superheroes have strict
ethical codes and creeds) while other kids are brutally abused
in Thailand by midget executives from Europe and the USA.

See his reservation (if someone dares to do anything with his
family information we will lay acts of Great Justice upon them,
kids aren't to blame for their parents sins):

These people, who claim to protect Internet infrastructure, who
claim hacking does not mean breaking into systems. The same people
who have never experienced breaking into a system with PaX, mprotect
restrictions, >16 bit ASLR, and RBAC policies configured, the same
people who have never backdoored a PHP extension on runtime, the
same people who have never broken into Fortune 100 C-level
executives
mailboxes.

Zeroday can happen to anyone. Especially if it's openssl flavored.
