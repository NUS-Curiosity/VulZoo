Subject: what happened to fd??.. even eff cant save it??.

if fd is outlawed.. there will be a lot of exploits and a lot fewer
patches... the patent systems were to protect buisness... now the
anti-fd is also to protect the business... isnt there anything to
protect the intellect??... may be fd can do something with the gnu/fsf
and try make some legal protection for fd... eff seems to be
ineffective...
