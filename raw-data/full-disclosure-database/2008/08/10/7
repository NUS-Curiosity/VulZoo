Ovens were the best technology available by 1996 and early 2000s.
The good old times of pr0j3kt m4yh3m (RIP gayh1tler), el8 and
other fellow superheroes of their time.

Now it's 2008. A new age. A new menace. A new threat. Weakened
enemies, only stronger in their minds because of years without
siege from the lines of the superhuman and the brave.

We don't use ovens anymore. That was Hitler technology. No need
to use the oil of the corpses of Jews and Gypsies. If they smell
bad alive, imagine when they are dead and burning!

Now we use hadron colliders, high power lasers and technology
from crashed UFOs. In case of emergency, we resort to microwaves.
When massive firepower is required, we resort to black magic and
breaking into nuclear plants with our superpowers, to overheat
the graphite bars and party like it's Chernobyl Vol. 2.

May the shenanigans be with you, fellow peanuter. The address is
real,
don't bother sending us gifts and fan mail. Bulletgirl keeps burning
the mailbox when she's on her cycle.

For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against
the Rulers, against the Powers, against the world Forces of this
Darkness, against the spiritual Forces of Wickedness in the Digital
Realms.

With love,
Tyler.
