Subject: OpenVAS Stable Release

Hello,

the OpenVAS project is proud to announce the release of the first stable 
version of the "Open Vulnerability Assessment System". OpenVAS is a fork of 
the Nessus security scanner; while Nessus switched to a proprietary license, 
OpenVAS will continue to improve the scanner and will provide all components 
as Free Software.

In July 2008 the OpenVAS developer team finished the update cycle of the 1.0 
release including all four server modules and the client.

The most work during this update cycle went into cleanups and support for RPM 
and Debian packagers. The number of necessary bug-fixes remained pleasingly 
low.

OpenVAS installation packages are readily available for various platforms: 
OpenSUSE, Fedora, Mandrake, FreeBSD and Gentoo. Packages for Debian and 
Ubuntu are in the works. Additionally, OpenVAS-Client is available for 
Microsoft Windows operating systems.

The OpenVAS developer team has started creating a comprehensive documentation 
for the whole toolchain; the next major challenge for the project is now to 
extend the range of the vulnerability tests for present and upcoming security 
issues, especially for those reported as CVEs, BIDs etc.

It is a fundamental goal of the OpenVAS project team to accompany the Free 
Software OpenVAS network security scanner licensed under GNU GPL with a feed 
of vulnerability tests being Open Source and readily available for everyone 
as well. Additional contributors are welcome to join the OpenVAS developer 
team.

Michael Wiegand
