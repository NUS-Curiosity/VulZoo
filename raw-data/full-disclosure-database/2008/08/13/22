Announcing this during the Georgia cyber attacks is well and truly calculated.

It draws attention to U.S cyber ambitions while there is the Georgia
cyber attacks happening, which makes my theory that the Georgia cyber
attacks are U.S false flags even stronger.

How else could U.S get the cyber command and U.S cyber ambitions in
the media at exactly the same time as the Georgia cyber attacks, but
to make up a story that the big U.S cyber command is shelved.

They've done the false flag cyber attacks in Georgia, and now they are
playing the media by keeping the ambitions of a big U.S cyber command
front focus just at the right time.

All the best,

Watch this video by Marcus Sachs at Black Hat 2008
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSUPTZVlkyU, he talks about, how are we
going to get the next president's attention in the transition period
in the first 100 days of Obama or McCain getting into the White House
and to take "cyber" seriously?

Now by this video it seems that Marcus Sachs
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Sachs is trying to say we need a
cyber false flag attack in the first 100 days that Obama or McCain get
into the White House to make sure "cyber" is fully funded and that
cyber offensive operations are fully OK'd for the next four to eight
years.

"We want to get the attention of the next administration as they are
coming in" --Marcus Sachs.

He talks about the first two months or 100 days of the next presidency
is crucial in getting the attention of the president and its
administration.

Is this a hidden message here by Marcus Sachs about a Die Hard 4.0
scenario false flag attack being planned?

He said also in the video, when Bush was coming in, the powers that be
got their attention with 9/11 and that "cyber" got distracted, and now
he is basically saying when Obama or McCain come in that the U.S
government under world are planning a cyber 9/11.

It seems that Marcus Sachs is frustrated that 9/11 got all the
attention last time, and now the powers of be are going to make sure
"cyber" takes up the main agenda this time around.

How are they going to get the attention of the next presidency to get
"cyber" fully funded and taken seriously is anyones guess, but I fear
the worst and that we must keep our eyes and ears open for any false
flagging and other suspicious looking cyber security incidents, so we
are better prepared to call out "false flag" at the earliest
opportunity.

All the best,
