Update
======

The previous version of the PowerDNS Recursor (3.1.5) did not
properly address the issue, as UDP source port selection was 
insufficiently randomized. We advise all users to upgrade to 3.1.6.

The updated sections appear below.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/pdns-recursor       < 3.1.6                      >= 3.1.6

Description
===========

Amit Klein of Trusteer reported that insufficient randomness is used to
calculate the TRXID values and the UDP source port numbers
(CVE-2008-1637). Thomas Biege of SUSE pointed out that a prior fix to
resolve this issue was incomplete, as it did not always enable the
stronger random number generator for source port selection
(CVE-2008-3217).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send malicious answers to insert arbitrary DNS
data into the cache. These attacks would in turn help an attacker to
perform man-in-the-middle and site impersonation attacks.

Resolution
==========

All PowerDNS Recursor users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/pdns-recursor-3.1.6"
