The guy definitely needs wire tapped and perhaps a psychologist.
Especially when he started ranting about money and the value of human
life in relation to security. I just hope Virgina Tech and the F.B.I
get involved in montioring him for his comments, especially after the
Virginia Tech massacre and the likes. We could have a fruit ball
member of staff at the institute considering something criminal to cut
corners in cyber security... or even something murderous in real life
depending on what type of mental condition he has actually acquired to
make him talk like this.
