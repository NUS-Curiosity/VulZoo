What:
Webex Meeting Manager
http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html

How:
The Webex Meeting Manager utilizes several ActiveX controls, one of
which is vulnerable to a stack based buffer overflow. The atucfobj
Module contains a single method called NewObject() who's only
parameter is vulnerable to this issue.

This issue has been confirmed in version 20.2008.2601.4928, prior
versions are believed to vulnerable as well.

atucfobj.dll version 20.2008.2601.4928
{32E26FD9-F435-4A20-A561-35D4B987CFDC}

Fix:
The vendor has released version 20.2008.2606.4919 of this control,
which fixes this issue. The control should be updated when the user
joins a meeting.

Workaround:
Set the killbit for the affected control. See
