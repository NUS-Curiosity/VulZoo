Synopsis
========

Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been discovered in
Wireshark.

Background
==========

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer with a graphical front-end.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/wireshark       < 1.0.2                     >= 1.0.2

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities related to memory management were discovered
in the GSM SMS dissector (CVE-2008-3137), the PANA and KISMET
dissectors (CVE-2008-3138), the RTMPT dissector (CVE-2008-3139), the
syslog dissector (CVE-2008-3140) and the RMI dissector (CVE-2008-3141)
and when reassembling fragmented packets (CVE-2008-3145).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a
specially crafted packet on a network being monitored by Wireshark or
enticing a user to read a malformed packet trace file, causing a Denial
of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-1.0.2"
