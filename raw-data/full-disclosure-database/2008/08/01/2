That's probably not the case. It would only alter the scope of
attack to include encryption and not simply port+xid. Since UDP
is stateless one could could have theoretically kicked off some
semblance of brute force attack against the key used for
encryption. For algorithms that use bits larger than would be
feasible for brute force attacks, the latest SNMPv3 vulnerability
comes to mind, as does Tim Newsham's attack on WEP.

In other words, there are always options. The attack wouldn't have
gone away. As they say, there are 1,000,000 ways to get to Detroit.
