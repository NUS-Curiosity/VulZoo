Subject: Black Hat talk on Apple encryption cancelled
To: n3td3v@...glegroups.com



Just days before the annual Black Hat security conference in Las
Vegas, a talk on Apple's FileVault encryption system was abruptly
canceled by its presenter.

Researcher Charles Edge told the Washington Post that he had signed
confidentiality agreements with Apple. The agreements prevent him from
discussing further any vulnerabilities he may have found within
Apple's FileVault encryption system. Edge, Director of Technology of
318, Inc, has spoken at previous Black Hat and DefCon conferences.

This is not the first time a vendor has asked a security research not
to give at talk at Black Hat.

In 2005, then-ISS employed researcher Micheal Lynn, was asked by Cisco
not to present a talk on flaws within that company's routers. On stage
at Black Hat, Lynn first quit his job, then went ahead and gave his
original talk. Afterward, he, too, signed a confidentiality agreement
with Cisco.
