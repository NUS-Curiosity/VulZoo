Not just Rouge apps, it's much more widespread: other colors such 
as magenta, mauve, fuschia, and even the extremes of pink and 
purple can also be impacted.

    What's the infection vector?  URL Link?  Rouge Facebook app?

        Hi all.

        There's a facebook (possibly worm) something malicious 
sending fake
        messages from real users (friends).

        The sample also has a remote drop site (verified by someone 
who shall
        remain nameless).

        This is possibly zlob, not verified. Thanks Nick 
Bilogorskiy for his help.

        Infection sites seen so far are on .pl domains.

        The AV industry will soon add detection.
        Facebook's security folks are very capable, so I am not 
worried on that
        front.

        It's not that we didn't expect this for a long time now, 
but...
        Be careful. Some users know to be careful in email.. but 
not on facebook.

        Note: unlike 2003 when we called everything a worm and the 
90s when
        everything was a virus--this is a bot which also 
spreads/infects on facebook.

               Gadi.
