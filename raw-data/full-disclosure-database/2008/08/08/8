The Great Council of Internet Superheros can't reveal the source of
its awesome superpowers. It is beyond any human comprehension, and
our knowledge was transmitted through generations of superheros in
tight pants, ruling the digital realms with an iron fist.

Our mission is to bring justice, joy and happiness. We hack, we
ruin, we condemn and prosecute those who attack the innocent. We
won't make piles of money out of this, but eventually we might
charge some porn subscriptions and pizzas to your doorstep on your
credit cards.

Mr. PhD Petko D. Metkov, you assume that performing acts of justice
on your mbox was a difficult challenge. You assume wrongly. The
Great Council of Internet Superheros doesn't need you to remind
them how good they are: they are fucking superheros, moron. They
can X-Ray your mailbox like Superman on acid, fly through your IDS,
spit fire at your antivirus and crack your SSH keys at sight.

And certainly the superheros are in possession of copious amounts
of cocaine, meth, and Google infrastructure 0day with their fingers
on the triggers. Do not dare challenge their awesomeness. Only
death and Stone Age will save you.

Last, the Great Council of Internet Superheros has determined that
anything unleashed unto the Internet, stays on the Internet. No
exceptions.

See attached text contributed by a bl4qh4t l1b3r4t10n 4rmy commando
known as 'p0lt3rg31st squ4dr0n'. Not Mickey Mouse this time. Also,
you don't need to mail us, just leave the message on your Drafts
folder and we'll read it for you. Comprende?

For Justice,
the Great Council of Internet Superheros.
"To protect exposure and serve ruin."
