You would probably expect me to the be last person to say that
Sendmail
is perfectly within their rights.  I have had a lot of problems with
what they are doing.

But what did you pay for Sendmail?  Was it a dollar, or was it more?
Let me guess.  It was much less than a dollar.  I bet you paid
nothing.

So does anyone owe you anything, let alone a particular process
which
you demand with such length?

Now, the same holds true with OpenSSH.  I'll tell you what.  If
there is
ever a security problem (again :) in OpenSSH we will disclose it
exactly
like we want, and in no other way, and quite frankly since noone has
ever paid a cent for it's development they have nothing they can say
about it.

Dear non-paying user -- please remember your place.

Or run something else.

OK?

Luckily within a few months you will be able to tell Sendmail how to
disclose their bugs because their next version is going to come out
with
a much more commercial licence.  Then you can pay for it, and then
you
can complain too.

hei, man
here is something that I wrote yesterday night. Can you have a look
through it and tell me what you think. I will put it on my blog but
I
have some reservations so I need advice from true friend. If it is
lame, just tell me. :) Thanks man. Check the attachment.

Web browser flaws are nothing new, but the professional crooks are
finding new ways to combine these flaws into a system for turning a
quick profit. This post describes an example of how one web site is
combining system fingerprinting, browser vulnerabilities, email
spam,
fake web forums, and buggy PHP applications into an automated
malware
installation system.

good start !!!!

Nabil,

I will look for LC5 latter but I don't know if I will be able to
find
it or even send it. The best thing to do is to get it from
bittorent.
It will take you less than 10 minutes.

I can write the software for you but I don't have any details. If
you
tell me where you want to login to, what username and password (this
is for testing when developing the application) you have to use and
what information you are looking for I will be able to help you.

Cheers man,
Speek to you soon.

Well, I am not an exprert, however this is what I think:
If the data is actually a file, which is probably what you are
looking
at the moment, you can save it as such and run some of these
signature
tools; like 'file' for UN/LIN. It is lame and stupid I know. :)

Yeh, javascript is amazing... I am quite interested in XSS worms.
Did
you have a look on the latest yahoo worm. After myspace incident, it
is getting quite attractive way of compromising online accounts and
generating network activity which could lead to ddos.

cool,

I've put your code into AttackaAPI.js together with credits... If we
can make all these working from a single Js file it will be great. I
am also putting cidrToRange and rangeToArray Util functions and
other
stuff that might be helpful just as a proof of concept.

I will mail you the code as soon as I finish it.

Hi Ryan,
How are you? I will try to answer your questions as promptly as
possible. I don' t mind at all.


1. have you reported this to apple?  Have they acknowledged
receiving
a report and said anything about a possible fix?

The short answer is no. Vendors are not interested in fixing issues
related to features in their products. Fixing it means removing it
or
restricting it and that is not what they want.

It is quite interesting to be a security researcher today. You can
see
patterns in the way various companies mitigate security problems
found
in their products. I don't blame them. They are quite right from
their
business point of you.

This is a quote from an article I wrote a month ago about disclosing
security vulnerabilities:

[quote]
For me and other people that I know, it is crucial to stay ahead of
the game. After all we are the good guys. It is not that we want to
satisfy our ego and that is the reason why we continue researching
these topics. All this research, could be valuable to professional
attackers but the tendency is that it will take some time until it
gets into mainstream exploitation. This gives us a couple of months
technological benefit that we will use for the good.

Now here is something that I learned from Mario Puzo's "The
Godfather". When the heads of all families gathered to discuss about
the potentials in the drug business there was only one of them that
made any sense. This dude, sorry I forgot his name, reasoned that
after all, although he don't believe in drugs, he will take part of
the business because then he can control it. As such he will do more
good than evil by not allowing drug lords to go to schools or other
public places.
[quote]

2. do you think this can be expanded in live attack scenarios? Can
you
provide a few examples of what's maliciously possible?

Yes, IMHO this issue can be exploited on a massive scale. This is
the
reason why I posted this security notice to full-disclosure and
other
security related mailing lists.

Let's put it this way; media formats are the essence of today's
Internet. Youtube, Apple's Movie Trailers are just two of many other
websites that deals with media content.

iTunes and QuickTime are standard part of many business and home
workstations. QuickTime is widely spread technology in the business
sector due to its functionality. Also it is the default player in
Mac
environments. Macs are getting quite popular today and this makes it
even worse.

Attackers can exploit the issues I found in many different ways with
various degree of success. This all depends on how skillful they
are.
JavaScript and mainly browser related exploitation attacks are not
as
mature as traditional buffer overflow attacks. It will take some
time
for the bad guys to realise the potentials.

A skillful attacker can get complete access to the local filesystem
via this vulnerability. This effects all home users. In corporate
environments attackers are able to break into network devices and
hijack network interfaces and all this can be done through a simple
mp3, mp4, m4a, mov, avi, etc... file. You can see the potential
problems. Keep in mind that WEB traffic is usually allowed by many
firewall setups. This enables attackers to sneak into any network
they
want totally unnoticed.

3. what triggered your interest in researching these backdoors?
understand you also worked closely on the pdf backdoor issue...

Yes, I participated in David's research although "Backdooring PDF"
is
his own work. I am glad this issue was well covered by the media. We
were looking into backdooing PDF documents for quite a while and
there
is a lot more to be said.

I have been researching client side security for quite a while. I
truly believe that this will be the next generation of attacks;
high-end hacking.

There are many other issue found in HTML, Flash, QuickTime files as
well. I welcome you to check my website. It is really hard for me to
summarize all issues in this correspondence. :)

4.  is this an implementation vulnerability?  Or just a feature that
can be manipulated maliciously?

It is quite useful feature actually. I guess it can be quite handy
when dealing with DVD content. Actually when I found this issue I
realised that I can use it to organize some media files I had
hanging
around my home folder. It is quite handy feature.


5.  do you think we'll start seeing actual attacks using these
backdoors in popular file formats? Why?

Yes. You will see more of them I guarantee. I know for sure that
this
issue can be used to create worms similar to Yamaner and Samy but
with
much higher degree of impact. As I said earlier Word Documents,
MP3s,
AVIs, MOVs can bypass firewalls and other network based protection
mechanisms. They can carry malicious payloads that upon execution
will
bring attackers into your network.


6. lastly, is there a real name I can use?  Can you identify
yourself?
Are you affiliated with a research company or working independently?

Well... my name is Petko D. Petkov. "pdp" is my initials. My other
nickname, "architect" was the result of a research I conducted years
ago based around passive hacking and information gathering attacks.
A
lot of people started to reffer me as information architect since I
was dealing with quite a lot of information.

I am security research from UK. My research is independent while my
day work is based around non-standard penetration testing for
various
companies in the London area.

If you have more questions please bash me an email.

Petko

The address is still the name but my parents changed the name. Is
that
a problem?
