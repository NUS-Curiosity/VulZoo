    Well, they might have done this *knowingly*, but--at least for 
some--I doubt that they *know* what they have done. IMO, it is bad 
practice to implement only half of a protocol/standard for any reason 
(especially out of laziness or ignorance), but that is what using 
certificates without CRL checking amounts to.

    If we believe that the current PKI was truly flawed, it would be an 
act of gross negligence to use it for anything requiring a properly 
secured communication channel.

    To extend Ben's advice: Decide if you want to use the current PKI. 
If so, implement CRL checking.
