Synopsis
========

A flaw in OpenLDAP allows remote unauthenticated attackers to cause a
Denial of Service.

Background
==========

OpenLDAP Software is an open source implementation of the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-nds/openldap      < 2.3.43                          >= 2.3.43

Description
===========

Cameron Hotchkies discovered an error within the parsing of ASN.1 BER
encoded packets in the "ber_get_next()" function in
libraries/liblber/io.c.

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted ASN.1
BER encoded packet which will trigger the error and cause an
"assert()", terminating the "slapd" daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenLDAP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-nds/openldap-2.3.43"
