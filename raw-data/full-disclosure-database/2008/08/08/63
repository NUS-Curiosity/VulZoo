Sorry Ben, but any web site or service (HTTP, SMPT, IMAP, SSH, VPN, etc) 
which makes use of a compromised key has an actual problem and not *a* 
potential problem. Open ID as a standard isn't more affected than, lets 
say XMPP...If there are servers and providers relying on such keys the 
have a real actual problem. I don't see your point about Open ID nor 
didn't I see anything new....

The problem of weak keys should be dealt at the CA level, many which 
have failed to do anything serious about it.

I think it's superfluous to single out different services since any 
service making use of the weak keys is affected, with recent discovery 
of DNS poisoning making the matter worse. I suggest you try a forum 
which can potentially reach many CAs, they in fact have everything at 
their disposal to remove this threat!
