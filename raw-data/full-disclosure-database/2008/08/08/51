You'd also end up with a rather large list for the client to carry around, 
which would be especially problematic for lightweight clients.  You'd need to 
represent it as something like a Bloom filter to avoid this (given that most 
users will just click OK on invalid certs, the small false positive rate 
shouldn't have much effect either :-).
