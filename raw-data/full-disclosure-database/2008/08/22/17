(yes indeed, vim doesn't completely sanitize it's input)

EXPLOIT:

echo '1 b3 1ee7' >> pwned

Copy and paste the above line into a unix shell or windows cmd window. File pwned is
created. Note, if the windowing system is not started, type the above command in
manually.

IMPACT:

 I can create this file and mail it to ANYONE! ZOMG!  Someone get me
Kaminsky's slide templates so I can get the PR machine going for this
discovery. 

And I thought XSS stuff was lame. Sheesh.
