You could use the SSL Blacklist plugin
(http://codefromthe70s.org/sslblacklist.asp) for Firefox or heise SSL
Guardian
(http://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/Heise-SSL-Guardian--/features/11
1039/) for IE to do this. If presented with a Debian key the show a
warning.

The blacklists are implemented using either a traditional blacklist
(text file) or distributed using DNS.

Isn't this a good argument for blacklisting the keys on the client side?
