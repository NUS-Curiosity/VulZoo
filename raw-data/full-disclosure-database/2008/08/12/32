Subject: Re: Internet attacks against Georgian web sites

This is an update of my previous post on the subject.

To be honest here, no one truly knows whats going on in Georgia's Internet 
except for what can be glimpsed from outside, and what has been written by 
the Georgians on their blog 
(http://georgiamfa.blogspot.com/2008/08/cyber-attacks-disable-georgian-websites.html 
outside their country). They are probably a bit busy avoiding kinetic 
bombing.

As mentioned in the previous post, Renesys has been following the Georgian 
links, which seem to be there, but occasionally drop due to possibly power 
failures. Renesys URL here: 
http://www.renesys.com/blog/2008/08/georgia_clings_to_the_net.shtml

Shadowserver and others have been following the botnets attacking the 
Georgians web sites, and that is confirmed as happening. Shadowserver was 
quoted, here: 
http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9112399&intsrc=hm_list

According to Dancho Danchev, there have also been some defacements, which 
he describes here, along with other conclusions I don't necessarily agree 
with: http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1670

So--it is clear their web sites are under attack, and that Internet 
visibility-wise, the impact is real for the Georgians. And yet, it is 
simply too early and there is not enough information to call this an 
Internet war. It is too early to establish motive or who the perpetrator 
is, however much we may want to point fingers.

Following every and any political or ethnic tension, world-wide, an online 
aftermath comes, in the form of attacks, defacements, and enthusiast 
hackers swearing at the other side (which soon does the same, back).

While Georgia's suffering is real, such attacks are nothing but routine 
here in Israel. When I ran the defense for the Israeli government Internet 
operation and then the Israeli government CERT, such attacks would occur 
daily. Hackers on the other side would band together, talk, coordinate a 
date, exchange tools, and attack.

While I apologize for the analogy, post-9/11 Israelis were shocked. We 
were sympathizing and crying for the victims. What we did not understand 
was why people were still shocked ten minutes past, as this was a normal 
every-day life happening for us over here. The same applies for 
cyber-space, the Internet--we are used to this.

The difference in this attack was that the Georgian authorities, like 
numerous others around the world still aren't, were not prepared to face 
and fend against such an attack.

In my article "Fighting Botnets and Online Mobs" for the Georgetown 
Journal of International Affairs covering the Internet war in Estonia, I 
state how our opponents will no longer be just countries, or even 
organizations as Martin van Creveld once predicted ahead of his time, but 
that on the Internet playing field any individual or loosely affiliated 
group can be a player, affecting countries and yes, corporations as well.

The best article describing the events so far is by John Markoff at the 
New York Times:
