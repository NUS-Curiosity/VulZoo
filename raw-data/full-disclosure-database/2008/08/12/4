Agreed. You can't compare a $20 dollar whore to a $1200 an hour
escort.

Valdis, if you don't retract from your misleading and deceptive
words,
we regret to say that the Council might consider opening your case
files
again and ruling a different verdict. That is, guilty of all crimes.

Our Squadron of Justice is currently waiting for commands on
these matters. There will be no further warnings. Get yourself out
of the list and enroll into a proper rehabilitation program. Quit
the
rocks or we will be forced to use our superpowers.

Have you noticed any unusual latency issues with your mail server
lately?

Love,
the Great Council of Internet Superheros.
