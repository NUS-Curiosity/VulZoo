[*] What is the ekoparty?

It's a one of a kind event in South America; an annual security
conference held in Buenos Aires where security specialists from all
over Latin America (and beyond) have the chance to get involved with

environment the

This event was born from the IT underground, where Consultants,
Security Officers,
Researchers, Programmers, Technicians, Sys-admins, Geeks, Ninjas,
Pirates and technology enthusiasts get together and enjoy two days of
the most important security researches of the year - as well as
enjoying some of the best weather on the continent.
