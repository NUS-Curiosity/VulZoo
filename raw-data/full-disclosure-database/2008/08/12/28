Further requests of proof of our otherworldly abilities, awesomeness
and superpowers will be taken as an offense to our creed and
mission on Earth. Other, non super powered, less awesome and uglier
individuals might compensate their lack of knowledge, manliness and
beauty by means of deception. But superheroes aren't deceptive. Our
strength is truth. Our weakness is none. Our weapons are digital and
volatile. Our enemies are all financially, spiritually and socially
bankrupt individuals of these digital realms. We do not siege,
attack
nor leave the innocent forsaken in despair. Our duty is to lay
great justice with furious vengeance and rebukes upon wickedness and
inequity.

Regarding the amount of messages the Squadron of Justice undercover
operatives were able to obtain: all of them. No exceptions. Not a
single byte was left unsupervised in Petko D. Petkov's wicked email.
Their effectiveness and reliability is only paralleled by their
unstable minds and a total lack of control of their superpowers, to
the detriment of our cause and creed. We refuse to admit it, but the
Squadron of Justice might be the last stronghold of great Justice in
the universe, and the risk of world wide mayhem and chaos is worth
taking when equity, justice, righteousness, awesomeness and
manliness
are at stake. And their struggle against evil and wickedness in high
places is, indeed, eternal.

Here shall be proof of justice (accept our apologies for showing
your private email address and phone number, also, superheroes would
recommend you to stop using Pine for reading email, or great justice
could ensue):

Hi,

Dan Goodin, a reporter with The Register, here, wondering if you

  <pre wrap="">Well, :) I cannot see how you can force someone to
type / at least
twice. Even if the targeted user writes a blog entry it is very
unlikely that he/she will use / . I guess this vector works well on
wikies and other systems that allow you to specify the text format
through meta-characters.

The cool think about stealing the address bar focus is that a
confused
user will try to repeat typing the url again and that may give you
enough slashes and other characters to steal /etc/shadow or
/etc/passwd for example, which means that this attack vector can
work
virtually every where. For example:

Joe visits eveil.com. He is not interested in the site but evil.com
is
interested in his files. Joe types <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
href="http://[what">http://[what</a> ever]. evil.com
hijacks the address bar focus. This is how they get the first /. Joe
will probably repeat to type stuff in the address bar again. The
rest
of the characters are not obtained.

Now of course Joe will realise that he is not typing in the address
bar but he will probably think that either the browser is screwed up
or that he forgot to select the address bar first (it happens all
the
time).

So, this is why I think that combination of both issues can create
one
hell of a good attack.

Here is another idea.

Joe visits Betty's MySpace private page. The page contains XSS. On
the
page there is an input box and a captcha. The user is asked to enter
the text in the captcha in order to access the page. The captcha is:

pde/t/aswsc

Joe enters the text but the he receives a complain that his input is
incorrect. The attacker repeats the process until all required
characters are entered into the FILE INPUT box.

simple.

Firefox won't settle for a path without drive specification (but it
will
accept SMB requests ;-). On *nix systems, of course, aiming
/etc/passwd is
easier than C:\whatever.

The problem with intercepting address bar input is that you can't
echo the
entered text back there without unloading the current document and
its
scripts; in my examples, I tried to make sure that it's hard for
the user
to notice that his input is not going where it should (in MSIE
