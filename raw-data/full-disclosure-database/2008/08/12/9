Subject: StumbleUpon XSS (fixed)

Hi all,

I found an XSS issue in StumbleUpon, which has been fixed. If you're
interested in what the problem was, look here: http://skypher.com/

What I found most interesting about this case is that there were only 40
minutes between the acknowledgement of receipt of my email about the issue
and their fix being online. In my experience that is really, really fast!

Cheers,

SkyLined
