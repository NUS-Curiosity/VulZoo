Subject: ISP's confirm '2012: The Year The Internet Ends'

Update: Bell Canada and TELUS (formerly owned by Verizon) employees
officially confirm that by 2012 ISP's all over the globe will reduce
Internet access to a TV-like subscription model, only offering access to
a small standard amount of commercial sites and require extra fees for
every other site you visit. These 'other' sites would then lose all
their exposure and eventually shut down, resulting in what could be seen
as the end of the Internet.

Dylan Pattyn *, who is currently writing an article for Time Magazine on
the issue, has official confirmation from sources within Bell Canada and
is interviewing a marketing representative from TELUS who confirms the
story and states that TELUS has already started blocking all websites
that aren't in the subscription package for mobile Internet access. They
could not confirm whether it would happen in 2012 because both stated it
may actually happen sooner (as early as 2010). Interviews with these
sources, more confirmation from other sources and more in-depth
information on the issue is set to be published in Time Magazine soon.
What can we do?

The reason why we're releasing this information is because we believe we
can stop it. More awareness means more mainstream media shedding light
on it, more political interest and more pressure on the ISP's to keep
the Internet an open free space. We started this social network as a
platform for Internet activism where we can join forces, share ideas and
organize any form of protest that may have an impact. If we want to make
a difference in this, we have to join together and stand united as one
powerful voice against it.
