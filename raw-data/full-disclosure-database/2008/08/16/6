Subject: Linus summarizes state of the "security industry"
	with precision and accuracy.

... hypothesis that "security researchers" are all masturbating monkey
whores is now proven definitively. [0]

"""
Too often, so-called "security" is split into two camps: one that
believes in nondisclosure of problems by hiding knowledge until a bug
is fixed, and one that "revels in exposing vendor security holes
because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are
corrupt and crap, which admittedly mostly are," Torvalds states.

Torvalds went on to say he views both camps as "crazy."

"Both camps are whoring themselves out for their own reasons, and both
camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason
for existence," Torvalds asserts.
