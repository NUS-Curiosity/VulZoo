Subject: Tool: PorkBind v1.3 Nameserver Security Scanner
	(New Version)

This program retrieves version information for the nameservers of a domain
and produces a report that describes possible vulnerabilities of each.
Vulnerability information is configurable through a configuration
file; the default is porkbind.conf. Each nameserver is tested for 
recursive queries and zone transfers. The code is parallelized with 
libpthread.
