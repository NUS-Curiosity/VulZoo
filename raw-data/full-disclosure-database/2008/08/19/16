Subject: Denial of Service Survey

Hey All,

I'm usually more of a lurker, but since I'm attempting to gather some
statistics, I thought I'd make use of the mailing lists I read.

I'm dong a survey on Denial of Service and people's perception related
to it and I'd love if anyone had time to complete the survey tied to
it

Thanks,
