  Are you seriously asking that, or just trying to start a "flamefest" (in 
which case, looking like clueless is a good attempt).

  Unless you are very Junior in the computer field (and even then), you 
should have heard of Linus Benedict Torvalds.  It should be very basic 
general knowledge for someone in the computer security field, like knowing 
who is Dr. Bernstein, Bjarne Stroustrup, Denis Ritchies, Dijkstra and many 
others.  They are not necessarily directly related to computer security, 
but their contributions all have significant impact in today security field.

  Instead of telling you who is Linus, I'll tell you a well garded secret: 
most famous people are described in Wikipedia.  And even if they are not, 
It is usualy very easy to find something using Google.


  Well, probably another proof that showing a certification is not the 
same than showing expertise in a field.
