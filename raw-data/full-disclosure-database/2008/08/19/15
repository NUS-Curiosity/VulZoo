Hi Ferruh,

I just had a read of your paper. You open with: "If the injection point is 
completely blind then the only way to extract data is using time based 
attacks like WAITFOR DELAY, BENCHMARK etc." This is not the case. You can 
use other non-time based (and therefore faster) methods to infer the value 
of data. See "Data-mining with SQL Injection and Inference" -
