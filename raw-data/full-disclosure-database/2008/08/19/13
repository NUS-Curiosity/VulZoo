Subject: Deep Blind SQL Injection Whitepaper

This is a short whitepaper about a new way to exploit Blind SQL Injections.
It's implemented in BSQL Hacker (
http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/application/bsql-hacker/ ).

*It is possible gather information from a target server with a 66% reduction
in the number of requests made of the server (compared to normal Blind SQL
Injection), requiring two rather than six requests to retrieve each char.
