Subject: Coordinated Russia vs Georgia cyber attack in
	progress

Hello,

The following factual analysis is a complete account of the events
that took place during the weekend in regard to Russia's
self-mobilization of Internet users in an attempt to coordinate and
launch a cyber attack against Georgia's Internet infrastructure, and
limit the Georgian government's ability to disseminate information on
the events taking place inside the country.  The attacks are ongoing
despite the ceasefire.
