I'm afraid, all that cyberterrorism nonsense is proposed (solely or not)
for the purpose of gaining more control over the Internet.
Today we hear: "There are terrorism, so we need to eavesdrop your
communications."
Tomorrow we may hear: "There are terrorism *and* cyberterrorism.
Cyberterrorists use techniques that made an eavesdropping ineffective
today, so to save Democracy and Peace we need to *control* your
communications."
Yeah, to control like this: "Ban everything and allow only what *we*
explicitly allow."
North Korea is coming.
