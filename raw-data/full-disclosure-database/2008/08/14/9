Subject: ISOI 5 (Tallinn) agenda is now online

Greetings!

The agenda for the ISOI conference (held on the 11th and 12th of September
2008, in Tallinn Estonia) has just been made public.

You can find it here:

Suggested hotel is the Viru:

Our kind host is the Estonian CERT (Hillar) who is also planning a
special after-hours event for us to enjoy.

We have the option of moving to a bigger room if necessary, so you can RSVP
when you like (although we'd appreciate notice, and our confirmation is
required).

Best regards,

Randy Vaughn and Gadi Evron.
