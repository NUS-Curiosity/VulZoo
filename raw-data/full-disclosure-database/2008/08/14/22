Which is, of course, what any miscreant who wanted you to visit a site that
will drop malware into your browser would say.

The risk is mitigated quite a bit for *this* e-mail because the link is in
a text/plain, so you're either cut-n-pasting the link and can see where you're
going, or your MUA has linkified it but you still can see the actual target.

Unfortunately, most users can't tell the difference between a link in a
text/plain and <a href="http://127.0.0.1">http://www.goodstuff.com</a> (and
you probably should double-check what your MUA did with the above line :)
