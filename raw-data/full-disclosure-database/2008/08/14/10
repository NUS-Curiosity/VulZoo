PartyGaming PartyPoker Malicious Update Vulnerability

http://www.security-objectives.com/advisories/SECOBJADV-2008-03.txt

AFFECTED: PartyPoker Client (Build Number 121/120, Build Date Mar 18 2008)
          Other versions may also be affected

PLATFORM: Intel / Windows

CLASSIFICATION: Origin Validation Error (CWE-346)

RESEARCHER: Derek Callaway

IMPACT: Client-side code execution

SEVERITY: Medium

DIFFICULTY: Moderate

REFERENCES: CVE-2008-3324


BACKGROUND

PartyPoker.com (www.PartyPoker.com) is the world's largest online poker brand
in terms of number of players and revenues. You'll find a great variety of 
poker games and tournaments, plus blackjack. 

SUMMARY

The PartyGaming PartyPoker client program can be forced into downloading a
malicious update. This is a result of the PartyPoker client not properly 
confirming the authenticity of the network update server or the 
executable update files themselves. When downloading an update, first  
the client program resolves the DNS address of the update host. Next, it 
establishes a TCP connection on port 80 of the previously resolved IP  
address. Then, it sends an HTTP request for an EXE file under the web 
server's Downloads directory. Upon receiving the HTTP response, the 
requested portable executable is written to disk and executed.

ANALYSIS

To successfully exploit this vulnerability an attacker must be able to 
somehow position themself such that they can impersonate the update server.
This can be accomplished through DNS cache poisoning, ARP redirection,
TCP hijacking, impersonation of a Wi-Fi Access Point, etc. The attacker 
also would have configured a rogue web server to push out update code of 
their choosing. 

Before PartyPoker downloads the update it communicates with another 
PartyGaming server in the 88.81.154.0/24 subnetwork via SSL to determine 
if a new client update is available; if so, a HTTP GET request is sent 
to www1.partypoker.com for an EXE file in the /Downloads/en/vcc 
directory and is stored on the local filesystem under 
C:\Programs\PartyGaming\tmpUpgrade and executed. Afterwards, the user 
may login and operate the PartyPoker client as usual.

Since the update itself is downloaded from a seperate server, the client 
can contact the legitimate PartyGaming server during exploitation to 
determine if an update is available as normal. The attacker only needs 
to masquerade as www1.partypoker.com.

WORKAROUND

Do not use the PartyPoker client program.

VENDOR RESPONSE
