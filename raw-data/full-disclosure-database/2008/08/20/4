Subject: OWASP DirBuster 0.11.1 Released


A new version of the OWASP DirBuster Project is ready to be downloaded.

If you are not familiar with this OWASP project, DirBuster is a multi  
threaded java application designed to brute force directories and  
files names on web/application servers. Often is the case now of what  
looks like a web server in a state of default installation is actually  
not, and has pages and applications hidden within. DirBuster attempts  
to find these.

Features include:

     * Multi threaded has been recorded at over 6000 requests/sec
     * Works over both http and https
     * Scan for both directory and files
     * Will recursively scan deeper into directories it finds
     * Able to perform a list based or pure brute force scan
     * DirBuster can be started on any directory
     * Custom HTTP headers can be added
     * Proxy support
     * Auto switching between HEAD and GET requests
     * Content analysis mode when failed attempts come back as 200
     * Custom file extensions can be used
     * Performance can be adjusted while the program in running
     * Supports Basic, Digest and NTLM auth
