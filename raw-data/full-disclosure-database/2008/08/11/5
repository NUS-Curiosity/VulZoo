So in your world, only murderers can be policemen, and only arsonists can be
firemen, only pitchers can contend for the batting title, and only linebackers
can be quarterbacks?

A quarterback is trying to throw the pass - the linebacker doesn't need
to be able to throw well. He needs to be able to intercept or break up the play.

Similarly, the needed skill sets for white and black hats differ.
