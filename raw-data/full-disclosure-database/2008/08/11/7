Subject: Surf Jack - HTTPS will not save you

Say hello to a new security tool called "Surf Jack" which demonstrates
a security flaw found in various public sites. The proof of concept
tool allows testers to steal session cookies on HTTP and HTTPS sites
that do not set the Cookie secure flag.

Tool: http://surfjack.googlecode.com/
Short paper: http://resources.enablesecurity.com/resources/Surf%20Jacking.pdf
Screencast: http://www.vimeo.com/1507697

This research was done independently from Mike Perry's[1], but it
appears to be effectively the same thing.
