On Saturday Gadi Evron to Paul Ferguson said:

"I don't believe this is cyber warefare. Political tensions lead to cyber
fans. I doubt RBN.

let's not make this a story.

Thanks for sharing! Interesting,

 	Gadi."

Big U-turn from your original comment is it not Mr.Evron?

1) Nobody takes you seriously anymore.
2) You're not a leader in the internet security industry.
3) The ISP community is sick of you as well. Read:

Adding your Linkedin http://www.linkedin.com/in/gadievron profile to
the bottom of your posts isn't going to make anyone take you more
seriously.

You make it up as you go along, hence your U-turn, anything thats
going to get you a reason to do a big multiple mailing list cross post
with your name on it, you pick up on.

On Saturday it was a non-issue, by Monday its worthy of a multiple
mailing list cross post with your name on it, what gives Gadi?

Did Mossad phone you up after your original comment on Funsec and tell
you to start beating the hell out of this to make it a story?

Some fishy about your U-turn Gadi, perhaps you can explain to the
security community why on Saturday this was a non-issue that didn't
need to be made into a story by news journalists, has suddenly turned
into a multiple mailing list cross post.

All the best,
