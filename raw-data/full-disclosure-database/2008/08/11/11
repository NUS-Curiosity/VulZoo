Gadi Evron has connections with the Israeli government and probably
Mossad, how do we know its not the Israeli government behind these
attacks? Think about the sudden U-turn I was talking about that Gadi
Evron did on this particular security incident, one minute he was
downplaying it, the next he was doing a multiple mailing list cross
post. Remember Gadi Evron is good at information warfare, and he is
probably being directed to do this by Mossad.

1) Full-Disclosure is run by MI5/6.
2) Securityfocus Bugtraq is run by FBI/CIA.
3) Funsec is run by Mossad.

Gadi Evron shouldn't be coming on a British mailing list with his
"propagandas" just because Mossad told him to, the intelligence
analysts can see straight through it.

All the best,
