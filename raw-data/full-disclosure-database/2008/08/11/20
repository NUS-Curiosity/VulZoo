you idiot.

fd is not announcing existence of your sploit to the world, scant on
detail, in some kind of white hat tease days, weeks, even months ahead
of disclosure.

fd is dropping the bomb out of the blue on the unsuspecting.

you can't get an injunction against the unknown...

(the many factors supporting the decline of fd is a long political
discourse for another day. the optimist would say this represents an
improved vendor security awareness and increased responsibility of
security researchers.  the pessimist would say this underscores the
filthy lucre to be claimed by selective disclosure to those lining the
many pockets of researchers the world over.  only n3td3v knows the
truth... *cough*)
