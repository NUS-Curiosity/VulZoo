I'll tell you what's really going on, Gadi Evron is partaking in
information warfare via the mailing lists on behalf of the Israeli
government.

Note: This thread isn't on Bugtraq yet even though its been post to
it, maybe the moderator *cough* CIA didn't want Gadi Evron's output
going on their mailing list this time because they know something the
public don't.

Its strange for Gadi Evron posts to be denied from Bugtraq isn't it?
They usually let all his posts go through, not this one though.

All the best,

n3td3v
