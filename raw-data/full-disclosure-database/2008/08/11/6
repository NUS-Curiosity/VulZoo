Subject: anyone developing a secure telephony application
	for GSM CSD?

I would like to enter in contact with all the guys here that 
worked/developed on encrypted/secure telephony apps.

Would like to start a community based platform for who worked/is working 
on this kind of technology in order to establish a standardization and 
interoperability path.

No, i am not talking about VoIP clients but encrypted voice clients that 
leverage "legacy" telephony networks (GSM, SATCOM, PSTN, ISDN, etc).
