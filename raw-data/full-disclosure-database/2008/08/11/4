Subject: Inguma version 0.0.9 released

Hi,

A new release of Inguma is available for download. This release fixes a
bunch of bugs in about  all parts of Inguma. In this version 6 new
modules were  added: dnsspoof, fakearp, dtspc, jsfuzz, ikescan and
unicornscan.

In the exploits section you will notice a bunch of new exploits. Just
DOS exploits for various vulnerabilities recently fixed in Oracle and
SUN software. In future releases I'm planning to add more "interesting"
exploits  (not just "DOS" exploits) but, well, the vulnerabilities must
be fixed by vendors prior to public announce. ;)

The complete ChangeLog is the following:

    * Library libTNS updated (enhancements).
    * Fixed bugs in the SMTP, POP3 and IMAP brute forcers.
    * Module "isnated" enhanced (Thanks you Sp0oKeR!).
    * Added module "dnsspoof".
    * Added module "fakearp", a fake ARP server.
    * Added various changes to make Inguma Debian friendly.
    * Added module "dtspc" to gather information from dtspcd.
    * Many changes and enhancements to PyShellCodeLib.
    * Added libdisassemble from Immunity Sec to the toolkit.
    * Added a JavaScript object's fuzzer. Connect with your browser to
the spawned web server and follow the instructions.
    * Help command now shows output summarized by category (discover,
gather, etc...).
    * Upgraded Scapy to version 1.2.0.2 to avoid problems with IKE.
    * Added module "ikescan", a tool like the well know ike-scan.
    * Added module "unicornscan", a wrapper for the popular tool. Thanks
you Hugo!.
    * Added to the public version of Inguma various DOS exploits for
recently fixed vulnerabilities in Oracle TimesTen, Oracle Internet
Directory and Sun Java Web Proxy Server.
