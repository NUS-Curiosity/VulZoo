Do you have any proof of this, other than your own rantings?  Skip over all
the "he stands to benefit" crap - do you have any actual *evidence* that Marcus
was in fact involved?

A bit of news for you: flash mobs on the Internet *do* happen. We had one hit
our websites back on April 16 of last year - big enough that we had to light up
a 10GigE pipe to Level3 and even *that* didn't clear all the traffic. Or maybe
*that* event was orchestrated by the North Korean government as a combined
cyber and real-life terrorism attack, or was that Marcus Sachs too?
