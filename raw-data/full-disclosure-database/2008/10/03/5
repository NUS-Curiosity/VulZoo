Subject: Marcus Sachs wants hackers put into the same
	category as "war on terror"

"security expert Gadi Evron said"
ha ha ha.

"he suggested it was the work of a "flash mob" of individuals from all
over the world."
ha ha ha.

A flash mob of the CIA you mean, ha ha ha...directed by Marcus Sachs.

It was worth it for the $30 million and presidential directive !

I can't wait to read the dodgy dossier in November, he will claim
hackers are about to take over the world and we must give him an extra
$100 million for his troubles !

I wonder what the American taxpayer is thinking about all of this...
they probably don't even know what these criminals are up to !

Â£130 million to fill in blank passwords so Gary Mckinnon can't find
their UFO evidence, ha ha ha... unreal.
