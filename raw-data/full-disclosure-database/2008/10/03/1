Using the release date of a patch to verify the legitimacy of a patch is a 
bad idea.  It is too easily exploitable.

How about:

#1) Decide who you are prepared to accept patches from.  Conduct a risk 
assessment.  Chances are you'll only want vendor patches.

#2) Verify that the patches are properly signed.  If the vendor doesn't 
sign their patches then you may want to find a new vendor.

While I agree this is true in most cases, it is possible to formulate this 
statement more generally.  See #1 above.

It isn't about only accepting patchs from an arbitrary group of people, it 
is about knowing who you are accepting patches from and being prepared to 
trust them.
