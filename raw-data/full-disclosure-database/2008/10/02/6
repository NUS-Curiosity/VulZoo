Subject: low bandwidth DoS attack against TCP/IP stack

Hey all,

There's been some buzz about a new bug within the TCP/IP-protocol.
According to the people who discovered it, it affects some if not all
OSes. They explain it a little bit in an interview (URL below) without
telling any details.

(the podcast starts off in Dutch, but switches to English when the
actual interview starts).

Does anyone know more about it? Or are we just going to have to wait for
T2'08? (

Kind regards,
