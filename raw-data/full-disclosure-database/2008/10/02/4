Subject: Brazil's weirdest infosec aspects: "your private
	key is officially theirs"

Greetings,

Locaweb is the name of the most prominent web hosting organization in
Brazil. It was founded in 1998 and hosts more than 260 thousand
domains today, according to its main website:

http://www.locaweb.com.br/

Unfortunately, not big enough to respect its customers.
Locaweb seems to be confusing two concepts, the so called "cloud
computing" and "privacy".
This is about its e-mail outsourcing service, named Locamail, which
offers a web based access option, with lots of features. Some are
useful. One of them though, acts really strangely. It's this key
generation capable, weird PGP module. The target of this text.

The whole thing is simple to depict:
by the time one generates a key pair, surprise! One only receives a public key.
And as if not automatically providing its customers with their private
keys wasn't enough, if some of them happen to formally request their
account's private keys, Locaweb denies them, that is to say, one can
always use "its" web based private key for decrypting received
messages or signing his mail, but that key belongs to Locaweb. One
cannot read the private key he uses.

Such a horrifying situation clearly poses as a threat to Locaweb's
customers privacy. Thinking sensibly, there's no scenario in which a
"Private-Key-as-a-Service" model would be welcome.


Yours faithfully,
