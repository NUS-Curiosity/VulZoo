FYI, just because the technology exists does not mean
hoteliers have to run out and accomodate everyone in
deploying these technologies. If employees were trained
in the risks associated with technology, many of these
technologies would go the way of the dinosaur.

Supposing someone made you aware of the danger of
logging into a network because of the impact of
sniffers. Would you PERSONALLY be cruising random
hotspots. If you knew definitively the person who
runs the network could see and record everything
you did, I'm sure the chances of you picking up
any network to surf on would diminish.

Many people aren't aware of the dangers and this
is the root of the problem. Technology is nothing
more than a stepping stone. Corporations have the
capabilities (or should have) to protect their
assets on a layered approach and instances like
this - employees hooking up from a hotel - can be
mitigated way before the fact. Its called policy.
