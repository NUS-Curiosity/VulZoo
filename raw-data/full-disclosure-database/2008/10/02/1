$30 million to protect themselves against a false pretence? cyber
security doesn't need that much investment, the folks ramping up the
idea of a real life die hard 4 are living in cloud cuckoo land. there
are no cyber terrorists out there, there is no threat to national
security. people like marcus sachs want you to believe there is, so he
can get hold of power and money in washington, but its all fantasy
make-believe threats that aren't actually there in reality.
