Something else that one needs to remember is the thing called "lead
time". If you were to write a book today about the latest exploit on
the net, we still wouldn't see it in the bookstores until after
Christmas. Writing a book is a *lot* of job. If you checked their
website, and listen to their podcast, you will notice that when they
were writing the book the Kamakazi release was still SVN-only and
writing anything about such software on something that is created by
dead trees is a waste of resources (the OpenWRT team could have
changed the whole build system by the time the book went out to the
shops).

Yes, I may be a fan boy of the show (did even sponsor them with some
cool custom laptop skins), but it does not change the fact that print
media is a slow moving beast.
