Subject: Layered Defense Research Advisory: Juniper
 Netscreen Firewall Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) event log injection

==================================================
Layered Defense Research Advisory 1 October 2008
==================================================
1) Affected Product
Juniper Netscreen Firewall
ScreenOS version 5.4.0r9.0
==================================================
2) Severity Rating:
Low - Moderate
Impact: Potential system compromises but requires user interaction.
==================================================
3) Description of Vulnerability
A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Injection vulnerability was discovered 
within the Juniper Netscreen firewall NetOS version 5.4.0r9.0. The 
vulnerability is caused by failure to validate input from the web 
interface login, and telnet session login. This makes it possible for 
an attacker to inject javascript as part of the user name during 
login. The javascript is then stored in the device event logs. When 
the event logs are viewed within the Netscreen web console the 
javascript is executed. A successful attack would allow an attacker 
to run JavaScript on the computer system connecting to the netscreen 
web management console which could lead to system compromise.
==================================================
4) Solution
Upgrade to ScreenOS versions 5.4r10, 6.0r6, 6.1r2, and later. If 
unsure if your product is vulnerable  it is recommended that you 
contact the vendor.
