The economics alone of such a set of laws is enough to realize how
unrealistic it is. Not to mention the privacy concerns, international laws,
enforcement, etc. In the perfect world of your imagination this might just
work but in the real world it's an absolutely ridiculous idea. Do you
honestly believe such a thing could ever happen or are you just speculating
for no reason?
