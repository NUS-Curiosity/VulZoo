they are already doing it, you just don't know about it yet, oh you do
now...because they want to start using the data for court cases, so
the announcement has been made.

if the government announce something, it usually means, "we've tested
this out already and it kicks ass, and now we want to make it official
and no longer a secret, as we need to admit to a judge how we came to
have certain evidence in order to convict people we want to take out
the picture, either because they are an immediate risk to national
security or are getting in the way of MI5/6/GCHQ strategic ambitions."

if public opinion says no to the database, the database won't be taken
away, it will still be there as an open secret.

the only problem that arises is the data held would still only be able
to be used by intelligence officers to coordinate operations, but
couldn't be used to convict anybody.

what's going on right now is, they want to use this database to
convict people, so they had to make the announcement, however the
database has always been there, and even if the public don't give it
the go-ahead, even if it doesn't exist yet, they would just build it
in secret anyway...

however n3td3v believes the database is already in place.

This news release is just a public acceptability test, for a database
which is already in existence.
