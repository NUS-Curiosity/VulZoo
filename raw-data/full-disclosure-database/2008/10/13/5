I believe the government might be considering such a scheme, although
im just throwing the idea out there for people to comment on. I have
no power, ability or will power to have anything to do with its
implementation, im just trolling the idea around, maybe people who do
have the will power will use my ideas to implement it.

Like said previously, im just a bedroom person, I have no power or
ability to carry this ambition out, but there may be folks on the list
who do, thats the kind of people im trying to influence right now.

So while n3td3v has no power or ability, he still has a chance of
being an influential figure, either now or in the future.

While I use the word "trolling the idea around", that doesn't mean I
don't believe in it and that im not serious about the principal of the
idea.

There are details that would need to be ironed out, things might be
added or taken away, the category system might not be used, and there
might only be a need for one license not two.

Take care of yourself and each other.
