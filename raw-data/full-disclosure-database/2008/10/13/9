lol you wanna hurt me :-)
not sure about the phallic connotations though especially as you seem
so homophobic in some of your other replies

whoop-di-doo you don't have a criminal record *yet*
i'm guessing that most of your l33t hacker mates don't have one either

the big problem with the scottish criminal records office check is
that it only show people that have been caught and successfully
prosecuted
i'm not even sure if the "not proven" verdict gets recorded there

As various people have stated this idea is a non-starter. Move onto
the next item of the infamous n3td3v agenda.
Or go and get a job ffs
In some countries people are ashamed of being unemployed and
subsisting on state handouts.

I don't mind supporting people that are attempting to move on in their
lives or who are genuinely unwell, indeed i do it gladly but i have a
problem with spending tax dollars on eejits that think the world owes
them something because deep down they feel *so* important.
