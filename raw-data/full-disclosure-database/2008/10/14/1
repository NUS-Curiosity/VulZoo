The intelligence about who downloads metasploit is already there, but
currently it is not actionable intelligence.

The license scheme would start to make that intelligence actionable,
without the scheme, you've got intelligence sitting there that can't
be used in an actionable way.

Its all about making intelligence that is already held actionable.

You've got known cyber criminals and terrorists downloading
metasploit, but no legislation in place where the good guys can
benefit and the bad guys be lockered out.

We got to get this situation sorted, the intelligence is there, but
nothing actionable can be done with it.

We've got to get this license scheme implemented sooner rather than later.
