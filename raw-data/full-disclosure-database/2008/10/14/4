So are you talking about Actionable Intelligence? Why should the  
government be gathering any intelligence on me unless I am the target  
of an investigation? Maybe I should also have to register my I.D. to  
any device that I connect to the Internet. I bet that would provide  
lost of actionable intelligence.

You proposal does not solve any problems it only creates government  
bloat. If you restrict the use of these tools it complicates the  
ability for the 'good guys' to get them not the 'bad guys'.
