Subject: actionable intelligence

how can we start to make intelligence actionable? how can we take
intelligence from an idle state into an actionable state? what kind of
schemes can we setup to make intelligence more actionable to locker
out the bad guys? what can we do as a community to get more of the
intelligence that is already held about people, more actionable? i'll
leave you with those kind of thoughts as we move forward.
