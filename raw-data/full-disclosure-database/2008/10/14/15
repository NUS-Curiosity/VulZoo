Again,
you're trying to solve an issue looking at the consequences, whereas
your "license scheme" suggestion should lay on the causes;
as I wrote before, focusing consequences in this case, brings along no
easy solutions.

And by the way, why insistently and specifically targeting Metasploit?
That is a much broader issue.


Best regards,
