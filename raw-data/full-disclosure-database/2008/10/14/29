Subject: script that was used to flood FD a few years ago?

Does anyone have an archive of the script that was being used to send  
furry porn to the list via spoofed list members? I recall it was using  
a mysql db on the backend.

It was sent out during this time frame: http://www.security-express.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2006-08/thread.html

thanks
