I used to be his friend but now he fell out with me, so I want to tell
everyone about him, because he's a yahoo employee i used to give
"intelligence" to, but now he backstabbed me, and he miscalculated how
much i knew about him and his "circle of friends".

and

He obviously doesn't use his real name online a lot. Back when he wasn't
into security, some people got to know him pretty well. You can happily ask
him about the massive amounts of time he spent in Yahoo! Chat attempting to
crack "names" to show off to his other Yahoo buddies.

cracking yahoo names, by the person who says he has never done
ethically or morally wrong?

Hey, don't laugh at him.  He's like the "Special" kid in highschool
that would try to sit at the cool table.  Sure, some of the cool kids
dogged on him but most just felt sorry for him and when they laughed
they made it seem as though they were laughing with him.
