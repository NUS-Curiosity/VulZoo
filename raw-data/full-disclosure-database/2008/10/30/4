Yup, interesting indeed.
i would have more likely called this a ' Dead Mans Switch' disclosure. It is likely that there is existing DMS software that could be relatively easily adapted for this purpose.
Thanks for referencing this journal, btw...hadn't come across it before.

Subject: Poison-pill auto-disclosure for security vulnerabilities

I have thought of something regarding researchers who have made
security discoveries, and I thought of a way in which they might
legally develop, in effect, a 'poison pill' to those who would want to
silence them.  I'm not a lawyer and I don't know all of the exact
requirements but I thought of an interesting way to cause "blowback"
on those who try to browbeat others into silence.
