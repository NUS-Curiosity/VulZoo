-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute a script injection
attack on arbitrary sites through vulnerable installations of SonicWALL.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious web page or open a malicious web link.

The specific flaw exists in the default error page displayed when a user
requests access to a web site that is blocked based on the devices
content-filtering rules. Insufficient sanity checks allow an attacker to
craft a URL that will trigger an error and simultaneously inject a
malicious script. As the browser is unable to differentiate between
content delivered from the original top level site requested and the
inline device, the script injection occurs under the context of the
target domain. This can result in various further compromise.

-- Vendor Response:
SonicWALL has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
