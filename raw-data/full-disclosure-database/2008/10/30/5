rPath Issue Tracking System:
    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-2766

Description:
    Previous versions of the samba package contain a race condition which
    may lead to a crash of the winbindd daemon (Denial of Service).
    
    In their default configurations, rPath Linux and the rPath Appliance
    Platform Linux Service are not vulnerable to this attack.
