Subject: Poison-pill auto-disclosure for security vulnerabilities

I have thought of something regarding researchers who have made
security discoveries, and I thought of a way in which they might
legally develop, in effect, a 'poison pill' to those who would want to
silence them.  I'm not a lawyer and I don't know all of the exact
requirements but I thought of an interesting way to cause "blowback"
on those who try to browbeat others into silence.
