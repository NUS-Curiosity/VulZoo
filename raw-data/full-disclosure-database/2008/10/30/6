    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4360

Description:
    Previous versions of the lighttpd package contain multiple
    vulnerabilities, the most serious of which may allow a remote 
    attacker to cause a Denial of Service by sending an excessive
    number of duplicate header requests.
    
    lighttpd is not installed by default on rPath Linux systems,
    and no default configuration file is provided; only systems 
    customized to include and configure lighttpd are vulnerable.
