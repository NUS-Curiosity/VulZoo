We can already see that. Seriously, you are just as bad as him if you 
keep on ranting back and forth with him. I have already added n3td3v to 
my filters and will do the same for you if you don't stop.
This bs has gone on long enough - don't make it longer. If you have to 
argue, do it OFF THE LIST. None of us here wants to hear about you and 
n3td3v's problems. Unless its security related - stop posting here.

Thanks
