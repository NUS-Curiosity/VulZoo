Subject: Re: Time to patch Windows boxes with MS08-067

I'm sure it's not a new Blaster, but when we today refer to Blaster/Lovsan from 2003 in the future we will refer to MS08-067,
because it was the first remarkable non-Office vulnerability used in targeted attacks.

This vulnerability has been reportedly the weapon of targeted attack during two or three weeks.
The size of malicious n2.exe files used is 397,312 bytes.

SANS ISC InfoCon meter is Yellow now
