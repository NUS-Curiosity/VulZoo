n3td3v, shut the hell up. this isnt some esoteric discussion about the
virtues of disclosure and good vs evil empowered by fear. patch your
shitty 3 box home network, stay the hell out of the way and dont be
part of the problem.

once you have *real world* experience, you'll answer a lot of these
questions yourself. until then, please keep your poorly thought out
comments and questions to yourself. better yet, today while you're in
class, bring them up to the teacher and discuss with the rest of the
devry hopefuls you associate with.

nobody wants to hear your shit today.
