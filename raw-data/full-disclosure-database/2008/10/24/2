You *do* in fact need "a whole US-CERT" to force people to collaborate. There's
a *very* short list of "a couple of independent folks" who can get things to
happen just on their own personal credibility - and they're usually already
totally overcommitted during these sorts of crises.

How many machines got patched for Dan Kaminsky's DNS issue because US-CERT said
"Patch it or else"? And then how many machines got patched because Paul Vixie
said "You really need to patch it"?

And there's always the issue that if it's just some random people, they
might all be off on vacation when things hit the fan - if it's an organized
agency, there's somebody to make sure that there's adequate coverage all
the time.  Yes, somebody needs to work the week between Christmas and
New Year's - and that implies a boss who will make sure that happens.

You obviously haven't been paying attention.
