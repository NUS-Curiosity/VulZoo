the double edged sword of metasploit continues. while we acknowledge
its a double edged sword, does that mean we don't need to monitor the
bad edge of that sword? that is the point n3td3v has been making.


and in a news report today by cnet news, they acknowledge:


On Thursday, new code was put on the Internet that could exploit a
flaw in unpatched Host Integration Servers.

The exploit is part of Metasploit, a toolkit used by penetration
testers and criminal hackers alike.


... that criminal hackers use metasploit as well.


so shouldn't metasploit and the govt be working together to share data?

im in full support of metasploit sharing data with the govt, but the
thing you must do is have a privacy policy in place as well.
