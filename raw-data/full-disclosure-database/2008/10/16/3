Dude, do you ever just shut the fuck up? Even though the content of your
emails is of null value, it must take time to write all this junk so I am
thinking you must have some severe anxiety issues, agoraphobia or are just
plain old demented to consistently write whatever bullshit comes into your
mind a bunch of people who don't respect/listen to a single word that comes
out of your mouth. Why did you pick a security mailing list to rant on? You
have no real "security" skills and only post regurgitated information you
read on a blog or news site somewhere.
Anyway... I could really care less about your security skills but on a
personal level you must be so weird and uncomfortable to deal with that no
one in the real world wants to be friends or even deal with you... if they
did you wouldn't spend so much on mailing lists trying to sound like you are
somebody and know something we don't.

I hope you choke on your anti-depressants and drown in your own vomit you
fucking cunt.
