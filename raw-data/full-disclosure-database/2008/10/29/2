And maybe friends, you could explain me what's so special about dia.mil ?

I would actually understand if CIA central internal information system would
use such trackers, but if it's a public web page, what's so special about it
?
And ok, even if the information on visitors leaks - what's so interesting
about visitors statistics to dia.mil ?
What makes those visitors or the URL-s they request so special ?

Or maybe you suppose CIA will hold sensetive materials on a public webserver
? e.g. www.dia.mil/sometopsecretstuff... Well I agree, you can find stupid
things everywhere nowdays, but I surely hope that they don't do it.

I guess that visitor statistics to google.com are thousand times more
interesting than dia.mil.

>>From my personal point of view dia.mil visitors statistics offer exactly the
same interest like www.desperatehousewives.com visitor statistics.
(intelligence guys, no offence :P)

Welcome to the web!

1 website = content retrieved from dozens/hundreds of sites. Much more than
what the browser's address bar shows ;)

Think of ad banners, analytics JS ("legit" spyware), static content served
from high-speed embedded httpds, etc ...

And yes, there are security implications to this design problem.

A US intelligence agency is basically betting the bank that statcounter.com,
a company apparently based in Ireland, doesn't get pwned or subverted.

Does that give you warm-n-fuzzies?
