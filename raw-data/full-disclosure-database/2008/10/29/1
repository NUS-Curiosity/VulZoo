Welcome to the web! 

1 website = content retrieved from dozens/hundreds of sites. Much more than what the browser's address bar shows ;)

Think of ad banners, analytics JS ("legit" spyware), static content served from high-speed embedded httpds, etc ...

And yes, there are security implications to this design problem.

A US intelligence agency is basically betting the bank that statcounter.com,
a company apparently based in Ireland, doesn't get pwned or subverted.

Does that give you warm-n-fuzzies?
