What's SANS stance on joel esler's behaviour towards n3td3v, he still
seems to be writing on the internet storm center diary... looks like
they don't give a fuck about the breach of privacy, the unfunny
aviation security joke on the sans diary podcast, and then to top it
all off, him and his pauldotcom friends having a semi serious
discussion about arranging a fake meet up with n3td3v, so they could
punch me in the face for exposing joel esler's conduct in the first
place. :)

The SANS name is being smeared all across the mailing lists, due to
joel esler/pauldotcom, yet they still keep him/them associated with
SANS... if they are pissed off about SANS getting a bad name, then get
rid of joel esler/pauldotcom, they seem to be a liability...public
relations wise.

All the best,

n3td3v
