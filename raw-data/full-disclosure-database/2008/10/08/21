However, at least *some* hardware is needed, and I'm not expecting those
who possess the hardware needed will be doing it for free for enough people
for it to matter, and the number of people willing to pay for use/rental
will be low enough to not matter either.

Exactly.  If the number of freeloaders is "a few people", there really isn't
much reason to deploy much of an actual security system, as the system will
cost more than the recovered revenue.

Berlin's trains are cheap, so not much security is needed at all.
UK they're more expensive, to the point where putting a ticket inspector
on each train is cost-effective (note that the inspector is mostly a deterrent,
changing the cost/benefit analysis for people who were thinking of freeloading).

Remember - the security doesn't need to be perfect - it merely needs to be
good enough to be cost-effective.
