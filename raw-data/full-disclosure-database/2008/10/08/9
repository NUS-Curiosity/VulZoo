Subject: ANNOUNCE - RFIDIOt version 0.1t released

Folks,

I'm pleased to announce the release of RFIDIOt version 0.1t

This was delayed waiting for vonJeek to release his epassport tools, 
which he has now done (http://freeworld.thc.org/thc-epassport/), so here 
goes...

As you've probably guessed, the main highlights here are integration 
with the epassport emulation applets for JCOP cards. mrpkey.py now has 
the ability to write previously read passport details back to a JCOP 
card running vonJeek's emulator, as well as to another emulator project 
which I should draw your attention to, and which I've played a minuscule 
part in:

   http://jmrtd.org/ - 'A Free Implementation of Machine Readable Travel 
Documents'

More detail from the CHANGES file:

v0.t
add WRITE function to mrpkey.py for vonJeek JCOP emulator 
(http://freeworld.thc.org/thc-epassport/)
add Makefile and vonJeek.gpsh for installing vonJeek epassport.cap to JCOP

memory/functions on Dual Interface JCOP cards
     as per Philips Application Note AN02105, 
http://www.nxp.com/acrobat_download/other/identification/067512.pdf

<vonjeek@....org>]
