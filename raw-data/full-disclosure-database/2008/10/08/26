Hell -- can't have been much of a security conference if you were 
mentioned!

Well, mentioned in anything other than the most cursory way or as a (bad) 
passing joke...

I've just been at a security conference and I'm fairly confident in 
asserting that you almost certainly weren't mentioned at all.

Ohhh, and please invoke Google Goggles before responding!
