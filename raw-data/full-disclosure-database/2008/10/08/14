OK, what % of the people who ride the buses and trains in London actually
have access to the gear needed for that exploit?

What % have access *and* are sufficiently criminal-minded to want to take
advantage of the exploit?  Remember that *most* people are basically law-abiding
and will actually pay for their cable-TV feed even when it's easy to pirate.

I'll predict that they'll see a 3%-5% drop in revenue, hardly big enough
that they need to "lift the barrier".

You have any actual evidence that they are actually doing that? You reference
a 6-month-old article that says they *want* to, with no proof that they actually
do.  In any case, if they *are* using that card, they're probably using other
means (facial recognition on CCTV cameras, etc) to track you and the other
terrorist suspects, so loss of Oyster coverage isn't a big problem.
