Subject: Re: security industry software license

i have recieved a tip off that says metasploit has no privacy policy
and folks downloading from metasploit are possibly being dhs'd.

we know that the authorities has set up,
http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10066001-83.html, websites in the
past to catch out the bad guys.

my informant also says, there is no need to worry about a security
industry software license because the govt are *on top of it already*.
