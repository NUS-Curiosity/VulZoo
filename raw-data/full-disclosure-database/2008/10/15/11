Subject: Tool release: iaxscan-0.02

Fairly self explanatory to be honest. iaxscan is a Python based
scanner for detecting live IAX/2 hosts and then enumerating (by
bruteforce) users on those hosts. It does so, in an obvious fashion,
by sending valid IAX/2 requests and monitoring responses. Being UDP
based it has all the advantages and disadvantages of the medium, so
watch out for that. At the moment there is no password cracking
functionality as there are other tools that do that quite nicely but
if you really feel the need for it, create a ticket on the project
website.

I haven't tested it extensively so if you have any problems email me
at nnp [at symbol] unprotectedhex.com or (preferably) create a ticket
on the project website.

The tool can be downloaded from
http://code.google.com/p/iaxscan/ and is released under the Mozilla
Public License.

Cheers,
nnp
