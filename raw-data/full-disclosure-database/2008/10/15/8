Subject: OpenVAS 2.0 Begins Public Beta Phase

Hello,

In late September 2008, the OpenVAS[1] developer team released the 2.0-beta1
version of OpenVAS, the Open Vulnerability Assessment System for network
security scanning.
The intended audience for this beta release are experienced users interested 
in upcoming features as well as developers of vulnerability checks.

The new version introduces first steps towards support for OVAL, the Open
Vulnerability and Assessment Language[2]. OVAL is an international,
information security, community standard to promote open, standardized and 
publicly available security content.
The OpenVAS server can now execute OVAL files just like its own Network
Vulnerability Tests (NVTs) by using the OVAL definitions interpreter "ovaldi".
While the plain ovaldi tool can only check local systems where it is 
installed, the combination with OpenVAS enables it to test any target system
for which OpenVAS has collected information. The beta1 release offers sample
support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux security announcements which are
provided as OVAL definitions.

Major internal changes include the cleaned and extended protocol for
client-server communication (OTP) and the transition to the new OID-based
scheme for unique IDs of vulnerability tests. The switch from the NTP
inherited from Nessus to OTP was necessary due to security and design
considerations.

The OpenVAS (NVTs) remain compatible with both the 1.0 and 2.0 series of
OpenVAS. This also means that the free OpenVAS NVT feed service (which has
recently extended to deliver the full range of NVTs, grown to over 5000
available NVTs) is also compatible for both release series. The switch from 
NTP to OTP does not affect NVTs already in existance. This means NVTs written 
in NASL continue to be fully supported by OpenVAS. There is no need to make 
changes to your old NASL scripts -- unless you want to use the new features.

The first release candidate of the new OpenVAS Compendium has been made
available in PDF and HTML format for final reviews and as a base for 
translation into other languages (a translation to German is already in 
progress) as well.

All download links can be found on the OpenVAS website[1].

The OpenVAS team is looking forward to feedback for the beta1 release. If you
want to participate in the beta phase by sharing your experience with beta1 or
if you have any questions, please feel free to use the public mailing lists or
visit us in our IRC online chat[3].

Regards,

  Michael Wiegand
