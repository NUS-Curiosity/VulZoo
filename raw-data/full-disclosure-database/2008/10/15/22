Hello,

There are huge amounts of memory corruption issues in visio.
To find them you can use any fuzzer on any vsd file.
To make things easy:
  1)  copy the fuzzed files to your webserver
  2)  attach a debugger to IE
  3)  use the html below.

(Also, running an activex fuzzer on the visio viewer activex is kinda
entertaining).

<html>
  <body>

<div id="info">text</div>

<object classid='clsid:279D6C9A-652E-4833-BEFC-312CA8887857' id='target'
></object>

<script>

target.src="Tekening1.vsd"

var count=0;

function next(){
  vsd='bug-'+count+'.vsd';
  count++;
  document.getElementById('info').innerHTML=vsd;
  target.src=vsd;
  setTimeout("next()", 500);
}

next();
 </script>


  </body>
</html>


Regards,
Thomas
