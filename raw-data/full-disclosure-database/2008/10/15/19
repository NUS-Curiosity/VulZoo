Do the world a favor, and use whatever grey stuff hasn't leaked out of
your cranial cavity and *think* for a moment.

What would get reported to DHS:

1) Downloads by people that don't matter, because they'd almost certainly
qualify for any sane program to license that sort of software.

2) Downloads by ankle-biting skript kiddies, who can be ignored because they
were dumb enough to download from their own computer.

What *won't* get reported to DHS:

1) Downloads by black hats smart enough to use somebody else's pwned system
or TOR or something to cover their tracks.
