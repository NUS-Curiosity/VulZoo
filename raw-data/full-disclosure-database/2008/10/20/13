Be a productive member of the list instead of just posturing all the
time.  If you have skills and experience, then share them, but don't
go around trying to make everyone think that you're some security hot
shot that is too cool for the people on FD.  There are a lot of people
subscribed to this list.  They don't care to hear about your groups or
lists.  They don't care to hear about the people you know in DHS or
anything like that.  This list is for disclosing and discussing
vulnerabilities.  Outside of that...keep it off of the list.
