Subject: [Full-disclosure] Mini MySqlat0r release

Mini MySqlat0r is a multi-platform application used to audit web sites
in order to discover and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in
applications that use MySQL for storing data. It is written in Java and
is used through a user-friendly GUI that contains three distinct
modules.

The Crawler module allows the user to view the web site structure and
gather all tamperable parameters. These parameters are then sent to the
Tester module that tests all parameters for SQL injection
vulnerabilities. If any are found, they are then sent to the Exploiter
module that can exploit the injections to gather data from the database.
