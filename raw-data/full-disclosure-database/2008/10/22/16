welp then its not an open group, is it.  n3td3v has a false flag!  he
says his group is open, and it isnt.  hes a liar and should be tracked
by mi32

n3td3v lives in scotland, william wallace was from scotland, and he
killed the english.  i think the intelligence services should start
looking into n3td3vs need to kill the english!
