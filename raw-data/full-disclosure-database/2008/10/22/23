thats my point.  this is a security list, and he knows nothing about security
this is a disclosure list and he isnt going 2 nor will he, disclose
shit.  all he does is whine and cry.

i am tired of fd being his personal rant list.  if u want to rant, do
it on your own list on ur own time, git the fuck off of this 1.

n3td3v is a lying FUCKING FRAUD.  his racist views, lies, and
accusations must B stopped.

that is the fd agenda.  to make u go away.  u want an agenda so bad?
there is 1.  to banish u from our lives.  every1 on this list wants u
to go away, and i do 2.  his emails arent comedy, they are racist,
lying, tyrannical rants from a child who didn't get enuff hugs when
they were small.

if u want n3td3v AND me to go away, reply to this email.  come on,
show your support.

i  have received alot of private emails telling me that i cant
convince this punk kid of shit because he is a "baby" with "severe
retardation".  i agree, so let ur voices B heard.  reply 2 all, and
tell us both 2 go jump in a lake.
