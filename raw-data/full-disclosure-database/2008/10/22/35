Cisco ASA

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20081022-asa

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20081022-asa.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2008 October 22 1600 UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive
Security Appliances and Cisco PIX Security Appliances. This security
advisory outlines details of these vulnerabilities:

  * Windows NT Domain Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
  * IPv6 Denial of Service Vulnerability
  * Crypto Accelerator Memory Leak Vulnerability

Note: These vulnerabilities are independent of each other. A device may
be affected by one vulnerability and not affected by another.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate some of these
vulnerabilities are available.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20081022-asa.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following are the details about each vulnerability described within
this advisory.

Windows NT Domain Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------------------

Because of a Microsoft Windows NT Domain authentication issue the Cisco
ASA and Cisco PIX devices may be susceptible to a VPN authentication
bypass vulnerability. Cisco ASA or Cisco PIX security appliances that
are configured for IPSec or SSL-based remote access VPN using Microsoft
Windows NT Domain authentication may be vulnerable. Devices that are
using any other type of external authentication (that is, LDAP, RADIUS,
TACACS+, SDI, or local database) are not affected by this vulnerability.

The following example demonstrates how Windows NT domain authentication
is configured using the command line interface (CLI) on the Cisco ASA:

    aaa-server NTAuth protocol nt
     aaa-server NTAuth (inside) host 10.1.1.4
     nt-auth-domain-controller primary1

Alternatively, to see if a device is configured for Windows NT Domain
authentication use the
"show running-config | include nt-auth-domain-controller"
command.

IPv6 Denial of Service Vulnerability
+-----------------------------------

Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX security appliances that are running software
version 7.2(4)9 or 7.2(4)10 and configured for IPv6 may be vulnerable.
This vulnerability does not affect devices configured only for IPv4.

Note: IPv6 functionality is turned off by default.

IPv6 is enabled on the Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX security appliance
using the "ipv6 address" interface command. To verify if a device
is configured for IPv6 use the "show running-config | include ipv6"
command.

Alternatively, you can display the status of interfaces configured for
IPv6 using the show ipv6 interface command in privileged EXEC mode, as
shown in the following example:

    hostname# show ipv6 interface brief
    outside [up/up]
        unassigned
    inside [up/up]
        fe80::20d:29ff:fe1d:69f0
        fec0::a:0:0:a0a:a70
    dmz [up/up]
        unassigned

In this example, the "outside" and "dmz" interfaces are not configured
for IPv6.

Crypto Accelerator Memory Leak Vulnerability
+-------------------------------------------

Cisco ASA security appliances may experience a memory leak that can be
triggered by a series of crafted packets. This memory leak occurs in the
initialization code for the hardware crypto accelerator. Devices that
are running software versions in the 8.0.x release are vulnerable.

Note: Cisco ASA appliances that are running software versions in the
7.0, 7.1, and 7.2 releases are not vulnerable. The Cisco PIX security
appliance is not affected by this vulnerability.

Determination of Software Versions
+---------------------------------

The "show version" command-line interface (CLI) command can be used to
determine whether a vulnerable version of the Cisco PIX or Cisco ASA
software is running. The following example shows a Cisco ASA Security
Appliance that runs software release 8.0(4):

        ASA# show version

        Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.0(4)
        Device Manager Version 6.0(1)

        [...]

Customers who use the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to
manage their devices can find the version of the software displayed in
the table in the login window or in the upper left corner of the ASDM
window.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) is not affected by any of
these vulnerabilities. Cisco PIX security appliances running versions
6.x are not vulnerable. No other Cisco products are currently known to
be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

This Security Advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities are independent of each other.

Windows NT Domain Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------------------

Because of a Microsoft Windows NT Domain authentication issue the Cisco
ASA and Cisco PIX devices may be susceptible to a VPN authentication
bypass vulnerability. Cisco ASA or Cisco PIX security appliances
configured for IPSec or SSL-based remote access VPN may be vulnerable.

Note: Cisco ASA or Cisco PIX security appliances that are configured for
IPSec or SSL-based remote access VPN using any other type of external
authentication (that is, LDAP, RADIUS, TACACS+, SDI, or local database)
are not affected by this vulnerability.

The Cisco ASA security appliance supports Microsoft Windows server
operating systems that support NTLM version 1, collectively referred to
as "NT servers". NT Domain authentication is supported only for remote
access VPNs.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsu65735 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers
CVE-2008-3815.

IPv6 Denial of Service Vulnerability
+-----------------------------------

A specially crafted IPv6 packet may cause the Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX
security appliances to reload. Devices that are running software version
7.2(4)9 or 7.2(4)10 and configured for IPv6 may be vulnerable. This
vulnerability does not affect devices that are configured only for IPv4.

Note: Devices that are running software versions in the 7.0, 7.1, 8.0,
and 8.1 releases are not vulnerable.

To configure IPv6 on a Cisco ASA or Cisco PIX security appliance, at a
minimum, each interface needs to be configured with an IPv6 link-local
address. Additionally, you can add a global address to the interface.

Note: Only packets that are destined to the device (not transiting the
device) may trigger the effects of this vulnerability. These packets
must be destined to an interface configured for IPv6.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsu11575 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier
CVE-2008-3816.

Crypto Accelerator Memory Leak Vulnerability
+-------------------------------------------

The Cisco ASA security appliances may experience a memory leak triggered
by a series of packets. This memory leak occurs in the initialization
code for the hardware crypto accelerator.

Note: Only packets destined to the device (not transiting the device)
may trigger this vulnerability.

The following Cisco ASA features use the services the crypto accelerator
provides, and therefore may be affected by this vulnerability:

  * Clientless WebVPN, SSL VPN Client, and AnyConnect Connections
  * ASDM (HTTPS) Management Sessions
  * Cut-Through Proxy for Network Access
  * TLS Proxy for Encrypted Voice Inspection
  * IP Security (IPsec) Remote Access and Site-to-site VPNs
  * Secure Shell (SSH) Access

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsj25896 and has
been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier
CVE-2008-3817.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
may allow an attacker to successfully connect to the Cisco ASA via
remote access IPSec or SSL-based VPN. The Denial of Service (DoS)
vulnerabilities may cause a reload of the affected device. Repeated
exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.
