Subject: Re: marcus sachs

he failed 2 make any news with his attack on hdm, now hes back 2 his
old steadfast insults of marcus.  but aparently he wasnt paying
attention when it didnt work 4 him the first 2 times he tried this
racist bigotry, so hes back to fail some more.

if u ever bothered to read information about marc u would know that he
used 2 b in the perfect position 2 influence the govt if he wanted 2.
now he wurks 4 verizon.

plez try and say what is wrong with marc without using the words
"false flag" (which u clearly dont understand), and dont mention
funding because none of it went 2 marc.  so..  put up or shutup u
faggot.  O...  and u better have proof. dont conspiracy theory, that
belongs over on that other list "full-morons".  this is a security
vulnerability list, and u arent disclosing shit.

in other words, its late at night, n3td3v is drunk, and is ranting.

all plez 2 notice that when he writes at night, his rants are insane,
but when he writes while sober it slightly makes sense and is less
insane.  notice my words.  'less insane'.

u fag, u talk n rant in circles picking on the same 4 or 5 ppl every
couple months.  get a new n3td3v agenda, because this 1 doesnt seem to
be working 4 you, and frankly there isnt a person on this list who
isnt tired of it.  mi6 doesnt care, the government doesnt care, the
cia doesnt care, the nsa doesnt care, isi doesnt care, and we damn
sure dont give a fuck... so. go. away.

fuck u, im out.
