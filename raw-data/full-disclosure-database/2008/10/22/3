what do you mean? he is in a key job, he was born in pakistan, he has
ambitions to influence the media in the run up to the u.s election and
100 days after. how would he achieve this, and who could he be
reporting back to? i don't understand your reasoning? inter-services
intelligence has already been responsible for a number of false flags
in their region. and now he could be possibly planning some cyber
false flags, as part of how he influences the media and the next
administration. under the isi umbrella? it would be useful for the isi
to have approached him, he is in a strategic position inside verizon
and influential towards the u.s government. you can't say he wouldn't
be of interest to the inter-services intelligence, to keep tabs on
what's going on and to shape it for pakistan's own interest. good bye
raj mathur, you have jumped to conclusions, im neither racist or a bad
person, im investigating the power hungries to make sure there is no
foul play going on. if i offended you im sorry, there was no offence
intended...
