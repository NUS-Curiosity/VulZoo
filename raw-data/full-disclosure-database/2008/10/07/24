Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in WordNet, possibly allowing for
the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

WordNet is a large lexical database of English.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-dicts/wordnet      < 3.0-r2                         >= 3.0-r2

Description
===========

Jukka Ruohonen initially reported a boundary error within the
searchwn() function in src/wn.c. A thorough investigation by the oCERT
team revealed several other vulnerabilities in WordNet:

* Jukka Ruohonen and Rob Holland (oCERT) reported multiple boundary
  errors within the searchwn() function in src/wn.c, the wngrep()
  function in lib/search.c, the morphstr() and morphword() functions in
  lib/morph.c, and the getindex() in lib/search.c, which lead to
  stack-based buffer overflows.

* Rob Holland (oCERT) reported two boundary errors within the
  do_init() function in lib/morph.c, which lead to stack-based buffer
  overflows via specially crafted "WNSEARCHDIR" or "WNHOME" environment
  variables.

* Rob Holland (oCERT) reported multiple boundary errors in the
  bin_search() and bin_search_key() functions in binsrch.c, which lead
  to stack-based buffer overflows via specially crafted data files.

* Rob Holland (oCERT) reported a boundary error within the
  parse_index() function in lib/search.c, which leads to a heap-based
  buffer overflow via specially crafted data files.

Impact
======

* In case the application is accessible e.g. via a web server, a
  remote attacker could pass overly long strings as arguments to the
  "wm" binary, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

* A local attacker could exploit the second vulnerability via
  specially crafted "WNSEARCHDIR" or "WNHOME" environment variables,
  possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with escalated
  privileges.

* A local attacker could exploit the third and fourth vulnerability
  by making the application use specially crafted data files, possibly
  leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All WordNet users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-dicts/wordnet-3.0-r2"
