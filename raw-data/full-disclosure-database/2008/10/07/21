Easy.  For the same reason that the NSA used to have (circa 1985) big, 3-ring
binders full of 0-days for VMS, PR1MOS, AOS, NOS/BE, VM/CMS and System III:

The NSA and CIA and GCHQ (a.k.a. "ECHELON") use them to get in to places they
wouldn't ordinarily get, or for other purposes, like that bank robber used
Craigslist to recruit involuntary henchmen.
