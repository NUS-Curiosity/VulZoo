The last pauldotcom podcast I listen to was this was one,
http://pauldotcom.com/2008/06/pauldotcom-security-weekly-epi-152.html
perhaps the most retarded podcast i've ever heard.

I'm not going to listen to pauldotcom anymore, and i've already
stopped reading the SANS internet storm center diary, and their
podcast.

I don't want to read/listen to anything by people who threaten people
with violence on mailing lists or on irc channels.

They just lost my respect and probably a lot of other peoples.

You're not alone in what you say, I was on the mailing list talking
about them long before you were.

They are scaring away the people they should be attracting, YOUNG
people, the next generation.

In short, Joel Esler and PaulDotCom are arseholes and between them
they are ruining what SANS used to be, respected.

They should get rid of Joel Esler and PaulDotCom and the other
arseholes, that would make a start to SANS getting credibilty back and
maybe a little respect.

All the best,
