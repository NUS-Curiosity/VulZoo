Hi fellows!


Found an interesting podcast, which is quite new:

%%
Adam Shostack, a well-respected voice on privacy and security issues,
joins Dennis Fisher in this episode of the Nameless Security Podcast to
discuss the data breach epidemic, the untimely demise of Zero Knowledge
Systems and his new book, “The New School of Information Security.”
