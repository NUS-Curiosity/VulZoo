Subject: Time to patch Windows boxes with MS08-067

The out-of-the cycle update from Microsoft is MS08-067 - Vulnerability in Server Service Could Allow Remote Code Execution:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/ms08-067.mspx

Recommended workarounds:
-Disable the Server and Computer Browser services
-Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall

As reported in Tuesday's advance notification all major Windows versions are affected, the bulletin rates Vista update as Important.

Microsoft has updated their AV products to protect against this RPC issue too.
