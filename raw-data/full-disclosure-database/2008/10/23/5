FGA-2008-23:EMC NetWorker Denial of Service Vulnerability. 
2008.October.21 . 
. 
Fortinet's FortiGuard Global Security Research Team Discovers Vulnerability in EMC NetWorker . 
. 
Summary:. 
. 
A resource exhaustion vulnerability exists throughout multiple EMC products through an exploited RPC interface.. 
. 
Impact:. 
. 
Denial of service. . 
. 
Risk:. 
. 
Medium. 
. 
Affected Software:. 
. 
NetWorker Server, Storage Node and Client 7.4 SP3 . 
NetWorker Server, Storage Node and Client 7.3 SP4 build 565 . 
NetWorker Client and Storage Node for Open VMS 7.3.2 ECO7 . 
NetWorker Module for Microsoft Exchange 5.1 SP1 . 
NetWorker Module for Microsoft Applications 2.1 . 
NetWorker Module for Meditech 2.0 SP1 . 
NetWorker PowerSnap 2.4 SP2 . 
. 
Additional Information:. 
. 
The RPC interface used by the affected EMC products does not properly enforce bounds checking on a parameter which is used to allocate memory on the heap. The vulnerable NetWorker products use the process "nsrexecd.exe". A remote attacker can exploit this by repeatedly sending requests to the RPC interface, each time allocating more and more memory. Eventually system resources will be exhausted, and denial of service is achieved. . 
. 
Solutions:. 
. 
Use the solution provided by EMC http://powerlink.emc.com/. 
The FortiGuard Global Security Research Team released a signature "EMC.Products.Malicious.Array.Count.DoS", which covers this specific vulnerability.. 
.
