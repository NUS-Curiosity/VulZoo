"GNU Enscript is a free replacement for the Adobe's enscript program.

PostScript output to the specified printer or leaves it to file.
Enscript can be easily extended to handle different output media and
it has many options that can be used to customize printouts."

4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in GNU Enscript, which 
can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the 
"read_special_escape()" function in src/psgen.c. This can be exploited
to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by tricking the user into 
converting a malicious file.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but
requires that special escapes processing is enabled with the "-e" 
option.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution

Do not convert untrusted files.

Various Linux vendors will issue patched versions soon.
