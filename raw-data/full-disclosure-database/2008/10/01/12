Not that this actually pertains to the case of Gary McKinnon, but...

They used them **to launch attacks**.

It's illegal to launch cruise missiles from the public park, but that
doesn't mean it's illegal to go in the public park.

Has anyone ever been prosecuted for using unsecured wireless for legal purposes?

Wouldn't that contradict FCC rules governing use of wireless (in the
general sense of wireless), where a wireless system must accept
interference?

(Whereas breaking into, or perhaps even using with a null password,
encrypted wireless, even if the encryption is as pathetic as WEP,
would still be illegal.)

What am I missing?
