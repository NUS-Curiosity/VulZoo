Perhaps during the trial, Gary McKinnon's lawyer
should put n3td3v on the stand to attempt nullification.

If that does not work, perhaps during the sentencing
phase one should put n3td3v on the stand as a character
witness.

And, of course, n3td3v is free to submit an amicus curiae
brief to the court (I suspect that they are not going
to be reading full disclosure).
