Nobody will think that, they will think stupid yanks again who didn't
set their passwords, why are they bothering with this kid. It will
just highlight their stupidity, not his. Stars and strips up their own
arses. They will call him a hacker, even though nothing was hacked, he
walked straight in. If you're going to make an example of someone,
actually get a hacker who actually hacked something! Mckinnon is no
hacker! The whole thing is ridiculous.
