This has happened in the UK a few years back -
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4721723.stm.  A guy was fined Â£500,
given a 12 months conditional discharge and had his laptop and wireless card
confiscated for repeatedly using someone's unsecured wireless with his
laptop from his car.  There was no evidence to suggest he was doing anything
malicious with it.
