Subject: XSS in Celoxis project management software

==Background==
>>From Celoxis.com:
 > Celoxis is a comprehensive web based project management 
 > tool to improve collaboration and streamline management 
 > of projects, time sheets, expenses and even business 
 > processes specific to your organization

==Problem==
The Celoxis project management software contains several pages that 
accept parameters in their URLs and display the contents of those 
parameters as page content.  Many of these parameters may contain 
HTML tags, including the <script> tag, and in most cases their 
content is not sanitized in any way.  These parameters are used 
internally by the software to display messages to the end user.  
Most of these pages are only accessible with a paid or trial 
subscription.

==Proof of Concept==
The following POC may be accessed without a subscription:

http://asp1.celoxis.com/psa/user.do?bxn=umyhome&ni.smessage=XSS+goes
+here+%3cscript%3ealert('XSS')%3c/script%3e

==Potential Impact==
This vulnerability can be used to manipulate arbitrary objects 
within the application without user authorization.  Objects include 
projects, tasks, users, etc.  It appears to be possible to exploit 
this vulnerability to cause users to delete their own projects.  

==Timeline==
