I sure hope they have actually employed some investigative staff who 
actually have a clue about how things work, and are actually going to 
work towards improving the failing legal framework in which they work 
("the attacker wasn't in the UK so we can't help"??), rather than 
re-hiring the same staff from the NHTCU.

Having had to call them up due to an unnoticed hole left by a previous 
systems administrator that was exploited (obviously I was f**ked off 
that I missed it), I wished I hadn't bothered in the end.

They were no help at all. I don't think we even received a crime 
reference number for the incident.

It was a weird experience, though, it seemed more as though they were 
trying to work out my skills (and why would they want to know other than 
as a prelude to either hiring, or [eek!] framing me?), rather than being 
interested in the actual incident.

ISTR the excuse was they were 'going for' this guy because it was more 
'high profile':

Which oddly, sounds rather like the McKinnon case in some respects, but 
enough about that one already!
