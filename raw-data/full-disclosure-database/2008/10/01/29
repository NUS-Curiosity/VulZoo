they banned me from their irc channel for criticizing them.

then one of them threatened to trick me into meeting up with one of
them so, they and joel esler could bump me off.

1. they don't like me for criticizing them.

2. they don't like me for mentioning on f-d that joel esler broke the
sans privacy agreement when he post a private email i sent to them to
##security.

3. they don't like me because i post on f-d that joel esler made an
unfunny joke about avaition security on a sans diary podcast and
because i threatend to tell the TSA about it.

4. they don't like me on full-disclosure in general because im
outspoken, and spoil the way they see f-d should be.

if something bad happens to me in real life, show the cops what im
saying right now.

a previous email i sent about them:

http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2008-September/064304.html

they don't get the concept of full-disclosure, you fuck up, you get
exposed, it doesn't matter how respected in the scene you think you
are.

pauldotcom and joel esler, go fuck yourselves, im staying on f-d and
you'll be exposed in the future as necessary, by the way, I haven't
told the TSA about your aviation security joke, *yet*. don't tempt me,
ok?

you are not immune from criticism, get used to it bitches!
