There is just a power struggle to knock me off the top spot on full-disclosure.

The power hungries don't want me around, there is a list of them.

1. joel esler
2. pauldotcom

What I talk about is my business, none of yours.

I expect another securityfocus article soon to smear me further.

When I left full-disclosure to goto university to become an ethical
hacker, they made sure they gave me a kick on the way out by calling
me a security-troll on securityfocus and pretending i was a hacker
withholding vista zero-day and other made-up rubbish about me.

n3td3v didn't accept this non-sense and came back to full-disclosure
to put two fingers upto the power hungries who thought they had sign,
sealed and delivered who i was, and what i was about and what kind of
person i was.

for them, robert lemos and neal krawetz, it backfired, n3td3v is back
on the scene stronger than ever, my enemies will smear me, claim
mental illness and other made-up crap to discredit n3td3v.

n3td3v is here to stay, john cartwright is leaving me this time.

he originally put me on moderation, but after he learned how cruel
people had been about n3td3v, he took me off so I could stick two
fingers upto the people who hate me.

n3td3v is not a troll, n3td3v speaks the truth.

they caused me to have paranoia because of the securityfocus report
that said who is n3td3v and said i was withholding vista zero-day, and
i knew the intelligence services would need to know who i was for
their records because of the .pdf and securityfocus article.

i have overcome this paranoia created by them now and im on the mend again.

All the best,

n3td3v
