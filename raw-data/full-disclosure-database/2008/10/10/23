i had to get this http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/aboutds.htm to
go on an ethical hacking security course, maybe we can use the same
thing for the security industry software license?

side note to mike my new stalker:
yep, don't worry mike, the government checked me out long ago :)

http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/index.htm

there is already vetting in place for certain security jobs and
courses, so why not extend it to security software?

afterall, part of the reason for the vetting for the security jobs and
courses is because of the security tools they use?

except the new license i propose, would be for everyone at home as
well, not just folks in known about security jobs or on courses...
