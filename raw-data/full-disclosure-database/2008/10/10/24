Do you really think that the "bad guys" wouldn't be able to obtain 
Metasploit if they really wanted to..?
Come on, you're talking about hackers here.
Anything and everything can be a weapon, in the wrong hands. A 
screwdriver can be lethal, but it is also used to turn screws.
Better to make the security of the software out there better through 
pen-testing with Metasploit so everybody is safer.
