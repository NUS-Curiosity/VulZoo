You don't want to go there.  They start requiring licenses to have Metasploit
or Snort or Nessus, it's a slippery slope, and they'll start requiring a
background check and a basic clue test before you're allowed to use an email
client other than Outlook, gmail, or hotmail.

And then where would you be?
