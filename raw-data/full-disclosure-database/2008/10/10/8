A consortium of government, corporate and academic institutions have
joined forces to created a new nonprofit organization to fight cyber
crimes.

The new public-private Center for Applied Identity Management Research
will study ways to improve personal identification management on the
Internet to combat crimes such as identity theft and fraud, narcotics
and human trafficking, and terrorism.

The group includes Bethesda-based federal contractor Lockheed Martin
Corp., Chantilly-based identity theft tech company Intersections Inc.,
Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM Corp., Pasadena, Calif.-based Cogent Systems
Inc., New York-based LexisNexis, San Francisco-based Visa Inc., and
the Secret Service.

"In spite of our recent successful investigations both domestically
and internationally, cyber crime remains a substantial threat that
continues to evolve and attack our financial systems," Michael
Merritt, assistant director for the Secret Service Office of
Investigations, said in a statement. "Successfully combating emerging
identity crimes requires that the Secret Service and law enforcement
forge and enhance partnerships with industry, academic and research
organizations."

The new organization is the first interdisciplinary group to jointly
address criminal justice issues pertaining to online financial crimes,
biometrics, cyber crime and defense, data protection, and homeland
security and national defense.

Executive Director Gary Gordon, who teaches identity management at
Indiana University School of Law, Bloomington, will oversee the
organization.

Additional members include the U.S. Marshals Service, Identity Theft
Assistance Corp. (ITAC), Information Technology Association of America
(ITAA), and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
(NCMEC), as well as Wells Fargo & Co., Fair Isaac, Dragnet Solutions,
ID Experts, and University of Texas at Austin.

Applied research efforts will begin with studies pertaining to:

• Public Safety: Identity theft, cyber crime, computer crime,
organized criminal groups, document fraud and sexual predator
detection

• National Security: Cyber security and cyber defense, human
trafficking and illegal immigration, terrorist tracking and financing.

• Financial and Corporate Fraud: Mortgage fraud and other financial
crimes, data breaches, e-commerce fraud, insider threats and health
care fraud.

• Individual Protection: Identity theft and fraud
