a field and enrich those who get licensed, and exclude a number of competent
people.

Personally I do not favor such measures...speaking for myself here.

So let them, ... because they haven't registered with the scheme
(which criminal programmers are unlikely to do, or want to do), they
are easier to deal with under law, and so are the people using the
software.
