Presumably background checks would include looking for issues
regarding mental instability such as those which you have professed to
have on public mailing lists repeatedly and often.

Unless it was just more poor me bullsh*t.

"i could have been a contender if it wasn't for those nasty sec
professionals. i could have completed my Abertay uni course and become
