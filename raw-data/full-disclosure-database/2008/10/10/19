Would this licence be from the same government that can't manage to
work out that someone claiming for 36 new kids in 2 years isn't up to
fraud?

Or is unable to enforce proper data protection from one of their
preferred consultants?

Or the same government that tells the scottish ambulance service that
it is ok to send live data to yet another third party company by disc?

<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7470006.stm>

Or which has lost 6 lappies in the last 12 months?

Answered by John Swinney (Thursday, August 28, 2008): In relation to
core Scottish Government (SG) directorates and close agencies using
the SG network, six SG laptops have been lost during the last 12
months. Two of these were unused new machines lost in transit to their
intended users by the courier company.

Or should the licence be handed out by the local authorities for each
region after all they know all about due diligence?

<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7662459.stm>

after all the whole icelandic banking system was based on one
leveraged hedge fund which most financial people wouldn't have touched
with a 60' pole


That is just the uk/scottish gov.

Why should HDM place any trust in governments to be able to decide who
should or shouldn't have access to the software he produces?

After all, your "largest sec google group" may qualify you to be
granted this whitehat ticket that you are so keen on yet any
half-hearted search of the archives would patently demonstrate that
you are *way* too volatile be allowed axs to anything that could
construed as harmful to other users of the intarweb.
