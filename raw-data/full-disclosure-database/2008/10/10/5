Subject: Re: Metasploit 3.2 Offers More 'Evil Deeds'

You can find our SecTOR presentation online at:
  http://metasploit.com/research/conferences/

Grab an early of 3.2 (testing) from SVN:
  $ svn co http://metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/ msf32/

A little bit about the new licensing (much more to follow):

Metasploit is now officially an open-source project with a mostly-new 
group of developers behind it. We are still a week or two away from the 
final release, so keep an eye out for more information about the new 
features and improvements on the metasploit blog:

PS. The "Evil Deeds" article is mostly correct, but some of the specific 
items were mangled in translation. The new EXE template does not allow 
you to turn a metasploit exploit into an EXE, it lets you take a 
metasploit payload+encoder into an EXE, big difference :-)
