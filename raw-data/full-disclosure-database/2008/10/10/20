While we are at it, why don't we just impose government
restrictions on all security related books and since a lot of the
technical security issues can be found in computer science
textbooks, lets impose a restriction on them as well. In addition,
anything that someone might be able to learn something illegal or
dangerous from should be restricted. Why don't we just force all
citizens to stay inside! That'll work well too and lower the crime
rate.

What you are talking about is taking away our freedom and our
rights to free speech. This issue is very similar to gun control,
this would only keep the good people honest and give the criminals
more rights than law abiding citizens. Criminals would still be
just as capable of creating their own tools and using them. So you
are only making life more difficult for people who actually try to
defend against these attacks.

I think if you did some research, which I know is a difficult thing
for you to do, you'd find that the use of Metasploit contributes to
a very minor percentage of crime.
