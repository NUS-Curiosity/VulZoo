Subject: security industry software license

there should be a central license that people apply for to use
software like metasploit.

all the *respected* programmers would require the license before you
get to download.

anyone can apply for a licence, however only those who meet the
criteria get given the licence.

background checks are done on you to see you are who you say you are.

that you're not a cyber criminal or terrorist, and that you're going
to be using the software for the intentions of which the product was
designed.

verbal contracts never hold ground, saying, this software is for
testing purposes isn't any guarantee that the bad guys won't use the
software.

we need a centralised security industry software license scheme so the
good guys can take full advantage of the tools made by creators of
security software, while shuttering the bad guys out.

to rely on a "verbal contract" for security software as a safe guard
is no longer enough for the security industry in light of metasploit
and other borderline "evil" purpose software.

its time that members of the industry work together to form such a
scheme, to insure a streamline programme that all the good guys can be
part of, only letting the good guys use the software for good
purposes.
