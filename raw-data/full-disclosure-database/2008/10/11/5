Sure. But one question remains: is it worth it ? Using a botnet to crack
John Doe's PSK where you can just push password stealing malware on his
box ?

My problem with this kind of "announce" is that it seems to make people
believe that cracking WPA/WPA2 is easy, just like WEP. But it is not,
and really far from it. Maybe, or likely, some day, not that far away,
someone will come up with a crypto or implementation flaw that will
crush them down, but right now, it is not the case.

So we stuck to a password guessing game. A game we play for years, with
password hashing algorithms that we are *way* more efficient at cracking
than a PBKDF2.

I don't say we can't break PSK. I say that we suck at it with current
implementations, even with a x100 performance increase.
