Just don't waste my tell jelling aloud there's a problem, when you can
post on a bugtracker, reaching the persons, that need to be reached.

Because it's tested. Knowing a vulnerability is worth a lot.

Fact is fact. if you've got valid facts, point them out. If you want a
great show, just mail to Slashdot, point out you're a researcher, say
the Internet will break and have fun.
Many do so. Media are stupid enough to believe, because there are very
few really security minded people. And they usually don't work in press.

Security as a market depends on disclosure, for reconstruction _and_
construction in general. It's future depends on how open security-people
are, on trust, on legitimate processes. Unorganized chaos, conference
disclosure, and advertisement security circus stuff is shit. Do so, and
it fails.

If there's just a small knowing circle, vendor based, blackhats can
cause huge damage, because any reconstruction gets much harder. A
secretive security response in very few cases is constructive. The
blackhats are steps ahead, if you disclosure your small finding or not.
Who really think that botnet owners are dependent on socks-stress or DNS
spoofing, never saw the backend of a huge botnet!

What you need is to address the right motivated people. That's easily
done with leaving out explanations and just posting pure code ;) *g*.
Really: use the bugtracker, not the media.

Thanks,
