Subject: Re: security industry software license

The only thing this would serve to do is cause "cracked" versions of tools
such as Metasploit and other security scanners to be put up on sites like
the pirate bay. Then, what about if somebody coded their own "security
tool"? Would they have to have a license to use it?

This whole idea goes against the idea of open source and free software.
Sure, let the large corporate vulnerability scanners do whatever the hell
they want with their software, but try telling an open source project that
they have to close their source so that the "bad guys" can't get hold of
their tools.

A licensing system of this size would cost millions, if not billions to
implement. This, along with the fact that it would be completely
unenforceable when implemented makes it clear that you really haven't
thought this through properly. It's like the government springing up and
saying you must have a license to own a computer. Virtually every home in
every MEDc has a computer already, that was bought before the licensing.
There are no records of who owns a computer. Must the government go round to
each home and search for a computer? If the owner hasn't got a license what
do they do? Remove the computer? Sorry for this crappy metaphor, but it's
something of a simillar scale and it's all I could think of to represent the
absurdity of the idea.
