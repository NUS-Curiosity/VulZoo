But your SSID is very easy to retrieve, as it is leaked every time you
associate a legitimate box to your wlan... And guess what: the regular
process of cracking a WPA PSK implies disassociating a client to sniff
the 4-way handshake. Doing this, the attacker will also sniff SSID
cleartext in the air.

Which means: *do not* rely on SSID cloaking for your security.
