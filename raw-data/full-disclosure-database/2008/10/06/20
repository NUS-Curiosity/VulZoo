Whoever it was who threatened a British citizen with violence over an
international mailing list is in a lot of trouble. If they are from
SANS or PaulDotCom or any other company, they will probably lose their
job once they are tracked down and charged, and I publish their name
on the mailing list, after I have been given the real name of the
person by the authorities. Respected security researchers, indeed.
