Only if you stretch the definition of "terrorist" so far as to render
it useless for anything.

A terrorist would be one who *sets* the fire, with the possibility that
somebody dies in it, such that it terrorizes the target group.  Note that this
doesn't even include all arsonists - those who burn down buildings for
insurance fraud and don't particularly care who gets cooked, and those who burn
down buildings because they want the specific person inside dead don't count.
Those who burn down buildings to send a message "Your building (might|will) be
next" however *are* terrorists.

At best, he's in violation of some statute against hate speech.

And if you Google for the phrase "die in a fire", the first hit is:

http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=die+in+a+fire

It's pretty clear that it's an Internet meme, rather than a literal request
that the person go do so.

Though I do have to admit that your continued attempts to out-stupid the
entire Internet definitely make people think of you in sense #4 of the URL.

The fact that somebody as unclued as yourself allegedly has one of the biggest
security groups around is a sad statement on the state of security these
days, and explains *why* groups like SANS are needed - so the people who are
even less clued than you have a fighting chance to find their ass with both
hands and a roadmap.  So quit dissin' the SANS crew till you're doing more for
security than they are...
