	Firewall Content Filtering Features + SonicWALL firewalls 0day

This isn't new. It isn't even a technique.

A very recent example of this kind of vulnerability. My god you
gnucitizen people are retarded. At least you didn't give it a
ridiculous name like 'clickjacking'. Can you GNUtards please keep your
'research' into subjects people already know to yourself or at least
not post it the lists, then at least I won't have to see it.

Also "Malaysia: Cracking into Embedded Devices and Beyond!", who the
fuck uses the word 'cracking' instead of 'hacking' in 2008? Sure for
cracking passwords, but wow.
