Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.31.08: OpenOffice
 EMF Record Parsing Multiple Integer Overflow Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 10.29.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 29, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

OpenOffice is an open-source office application that supports reading
and writing a wide variety of file formats. For more information, see
the vendor's site found at the following link.

http://openoffice.org

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in
OpenOffice versions 2.4.1 and earlier could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

Integer overflow issues exist within the code responsible for parsing
multiple EMR records within an EMF file. This allows an attacker to
overflow heap memory with data they supplied.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the current user. An attacker would need to
entice a user into opening the malformed file using OpenOffice. The
file could be distributed to users via a Web page or e-mail
attachments. Upon opening the file, exploitation of this issue would
occur and execution of arbitrary code would be possible.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in OpenOffice
version 2.4.1.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
