As usual you just don't get it.

Because you contribute nothing useful, and at the same time seem intent on
causing pain to
people who do real work. we'd ALL like to punch you in the face, and ALSO
break your
fingers.  Except that you aren't presently worth the trouble.

An unscientific survey was taken at a recent conference where several
attendees you
abuse were present.  Yes, we actually talked about you!

Our conclusion:

None of us know of a single credible security researcher who has even the
time of day
for you, not to mention any respect for your abilities or work.

The usual trajectory seems to be
try to help -> amused tolerance  -> pity -> you're dead to me

As the entire conference was under Chatham House Rule, I cannot tell you who
was
there or participated in the discussion.

So, like Intercage, can you cite a single person whom you actually work with
who would say a good word
in public for you?  (I doubt it, given that you have few skills and little
talent, combined with a concept of
"risk" which is contorted by your bizarre paranoid personality, and and
excess of persistence
which is not enough to overcome all of that insanity.)  You are not an
original, out-of-the-box
thinker, you are an annoying pariah.

Only Valdis (whom you regularly abuse) seems to have the patience of a saint
in wasting
time arguing with you.  As you never seem to listen to anyone other than the
voices in your
head, you don't learn anything from him or anyone else.  As you always have
to be
right, and get the last vindictive word, the community has entirely given up
on you, one by one.

Many people have suggested you should eat shit and die, or continue drinking
yourself
to death, a friendless pauper in your sod hut in Scotland still waiting for
the black helicopters
of some intelligence agency to some day whisk you off to cloud cuckoo land
after realizing
your great value to them.

I think we would be satisfied if you just  silently disappeared, and never
darkened our
inboxes ever again.  This is the best service you can do the security
community:
shut up and disappear.  Find something useful to do with your so-called
life.


All the best,
