Subject: CVE-2008-2625: Oracle DBMS - Proxy Authentication
	Vulnerability


Oracle DBMS - Proxy Authentication Vulnerability



Background


Oracle is a widely-deployed Database Management System (DBMS) that
supports a variety of applications. Many multi-tier applications are
designed to use proxy authentication, restricting a middle tier to
establish the database connection on behalf of the users. The standard
authentication mechanism requires the client, the middle tier in this
case, to provide valid credentials in order to authenticate and connect
to the DBMS. User sessions are then created through the proxy
connection. Oracle TNS protocol messages are used for session setup,
authentication and data transfer. 


Scope


Imperva's Application Defense Center (ADC) conducts extensive research
on enterprise applications and databases. During its research, the team
has identified a vulnerability in Oracle's proxy authentication and
access control mechanism. 


Findings


While proxy authentication is enabled for a user account through a proxy
account, it is possible to create a separate connection using the
original user account without authenticating the connection. 


Details


Oracle supports a proxy authentication mode which a user establishes a
session through a proxy and the proxy establishes a session on the
user's behalf to the database. These sessions are created using the
Oracle TNS protocol level messages and do not require additional
authentication. This scenario is recommended by Oracle for multi-tier
environments. 

While the user sessions are open through the proxy connection, an
attacker can create a new connection to the database impersonating the
original user without supplying a password. The attacker executes the
attack by opening a TNS connection to the database server and sending a
manipulated authentication message with the login mode flags set to
proxy login and the session ID and serial number of the original session
opened through the proxy account. 


Vulnerability ID


Proposed CVE Candidate (as of October 14, 2008): CVE-2008-2625 


Tested Versions


Vulnerable
Oracle 8i (8.1.7.x.x)
Oracle 9i (9.2.0.7)
Oracle 10g Release 1 (10.1.0.4.2)
Oracle 10g Release 2 (10.2.0.1.0) 


Vendor's Status


Vendor notified on December 13, 2005. Patch released by vendor on
October 14, 2008. 


Workaround



*	Always require password authentication, even for proxy
connections 
*	Alternatively, disable proxy authentication mode and enforce
this policy by configuring the SecureSphere Database Security Gateway to
alert when users are granted proxy access 
*	The SecureSphere Database Security Gateway can also enforce all
proxy account connections to the database originate from the proxy
server IP address
