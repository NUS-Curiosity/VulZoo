Dude, why do you have it in for Gadi so bad?  Oh, I know, it's because he is
making a damn good living at being a REAL security professional and you're
not.  And because he's actually making a real, honest to goodness
contribution to Information security...

  Where are YOUR speaking engagements?  Where is YOUR contribution to
Information Security as a whole?  What are YOUR credentials as a security
professional?  
  I'll make the answer easy for you... THERE AREN'T ANY!!!

  It takes more than calling yourself a security professional to be one.
It's takes more than creating a mailing list on Google groups to be a
security professional.
  
  All we see from you is banter and non-sense coming from you, all you do is
bitch, bitch, bitch about everyone else that is actually making a
contribution, a REAL contribution.

  At one point you promised that you would leave this mailing list...  I
think we all wish you would really do it...  Oh yah, and take all your other
email addresses that you have on here and unsubscribe them too... We're all
tired of your non-sense....
