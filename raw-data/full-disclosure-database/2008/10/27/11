Subject: Re: www.dia.mil

I am more concerned about IP address of people who visit .mil website
leaking to third party/intelligence.

If you have it, you could do some traffic analysis. Are some people
visiting the website too often? Time of day ? What are their IP's?
What are other websites /network on your control do those IP also
visit? Do some linguistic analysis if you can, do browser
fingerprinting. Now, If you (a marked IP) visit any other website that
use statcounter.com someone out there can know it its you again who
visited the .mil website in visiting different domain. Such
web-service can act like a honeypot that can passively identify the
presence an identity across different domains. Do some more
personality profiling, what type of website do they visit etc Try to
build some correlation, say; using Paterva, Maltego to process the
data. If you know someone who runs a botnet, are there any ip from the
list already infected... See if you can look around.................

The point is one with the resource can find such data valuable. The
point is if/what does this information leak value to you.

thanks,
