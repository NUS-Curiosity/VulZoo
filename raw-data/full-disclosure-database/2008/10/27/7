He's pointing out the wrong part. He's highlighted the link, which is
of no importance.

Yes, they're including a remote javascript. Then again, tens if not
hundreds of thousands of other websites include the very same script.
If statcounter's servers aren't very secure, they would have already
been compromised.

On the other hand, look at the voting machines the US gov't has
contracted. They have a tendency to screw up with technology, making
this one of their lesser problems (if you want to consider it a
problem at all).

Just my $.02.
