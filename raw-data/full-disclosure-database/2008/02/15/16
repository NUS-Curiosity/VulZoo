Subject: Re: let's name something after dude vanwinkle

Fredrick Diggle named one of the monkeys at the zoo after him... Only
its not a very good effigy because Dude VanWinkle the monkey is
actually quite smart. I guess he should have named the little emo
monkey who sits in the corner and cuts himself after Dude instead. Oh
wells.
