Subject: let's name something after dude vanwinkle

i've been thinking about this for a few days and i think something
should be named after him or a foundation or charity setup in his
name.

even a new mailing list named after him or some good cause to come
from his life to keep his alias in circulation for future generations
of security folks to learn about him.

i'm very disappointed he wasn't mentioned on securityfocus but those
folks are on the same downhill spiral as yahoo inc anyway, so why
should we care what securityfocus are doing.

its time to get brain storming on this, but i want him to stay in
memory long after we're gone..

me and dude vanwinkle weren't best o friends or best o enemies but i
did read his posts everyday and thought he was ok.

i will leave it upto the funsec crowd and gadi evron to organise and
decide if something and what should be named after him, i don't want
to be part of organising, i'm just throwing the suggestion out there
for the real decision makers to decide what the next step should be in
remembering the dude.

i have a mailing list called n3td3v so if i get killed there is
something for me on the internet to keep my name in circulation, its
time there was something to remember dude vanwinkle.

i'll leave it upto the higher ups to decide if this is a good or bad
suggestion its not upto me to decide on things like this.

gadi evron is a born leader, so i give it to him to lead this and
decide on what should be setup or named after him.

and if nothing is setup and named after him, then i will do it myself,
because i think something should.

so folks, get brain storming and we can come up with the best tribute
for to remember the vanwinkle by.

we don't want to name a worm after him or anything like that, let's
keep it lawful and whitehat lolz.

i will be montioring the conversation closely and if i think something
is wrong with what you are doing i will step in and make my views
clear on matters. but i think gadi evron is competent enough to come
up with a fitting tribute to name him after without me putting my
weight in. my weight however will always be available to step in if i
don't agree with whats going on. lolz.

i don't like gadi evron,however, he is the biggest person after me on
the mailing lists, so i elect him to do it. i am big in the security
community, bigger than evron, but i want him to do it cos i
decided.lolz.

hackerz+security experts unite...to create something for the dude.
