_*JSPWiki Multiple Vulnerabilities*_

*__**_
Vendor:
_*Janne Jalkanen JSPWiki – http://www.jspwiki.org 
<http://www.jspwiki.org/>*_

Application Description:
_*From JSPWiki website - “JSPWiki is a feature-rich and extensible 
WikiWiki engine built around a standart J2EE components (Java, servlets, 
JSP).”

*_Tested versions:
_*JSPWiki v2.4.104
JSPWiki v2.5.139
/Earlier versions may also be affected.
/*_
JSPWiki Local .jsp File Inclusion Vulnerability
_*An input validation problem exists within JSPWiki which allows to 
execute (include) arbitrary local .jsp files. An attacker may leverage 
this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on a vulnerable 
server with the privileges of the web server process.

/Example (including //rss.jsp// file from the application root directory):/

http://server/JSPWikiPath/Edit.jsp?page=Main&editor=../../../rss 
<http://server/JSPWikiPath/Edit.jsp?page=Main&editor=../../../rss>

/Note: //page// parameter must be an existing page on the server./

This grants an attacker unauthorized access to sensitive .jsp files on 
the server and can lead to information disclosure.

/Examples:/

http://server/JSPWikiPath/Edit.jsp?page=User&editor=../../../Install 
<http://server/JSPWikiPath/Edit.jsp?page=User&editor=../../../Install>

http://server/JSPWikiPath/Edit.jsp?page=User&editor=../../../admin/SecurityConfig 
<http://server/JSPWikiPath/Edit.jsp?page=User&editor=../../../admin/SecurityConfig>

The first example disclose sensitive information such as the full path 
of the application on the server, page (and attachments) storage path, 
log files and work directory by including the application installation 
(Install.jsp).

The second example disclose the application security configurations by 
including the JSPWiki Security Configuration Verifier file 
(admin/SecurityConfig.jsp).

In addition, JSPWiki allow users to upload (attach) files to entry 
pages. An attacker can use the information disclosed by the installation 
file to upload a malicious .jsp file and locally execute it.

_By executing malicious server-side code, an attacker may be able to 
compromise the server._

 *_JSPWiki Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
_*An attacker may leverage cross-site scripting vulnerability to have 
arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user in 
the context of the affected site. This may facilitate the theft of 
cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.

 /Example:/

http://server/JSPWikiPath/Edit.jsp?page=Main&editor=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E 
<http://server/JSPWikiPath/Edit.jsp?page=Main&editor=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E>
