A death in the Peer-Group.  Despite the fact that we're 6-60, and  
despite the fact that
some of us have strange names and even stranger proclivities, I think  
it's safe to say that
everyone from Gobbles to Gadi might have taken a sec. to think...that  
all of us, whether warriors,
wing-nuts or wunderkind...are gonna die.

While I doubt it will bring more humanity to the group, the ripple  
effect can't be denied;  Imagine
if someday we could take the collective brain-power of this group and  
focus it into a precedent
melding event...For Good.

..If and whenever that may happen, it's sad to see us lose a team  
member -- all in all, something
  to think about.
