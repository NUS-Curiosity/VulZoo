Subject: cyber armageddon due feb 10

dear the security community,

i would like an insight from "anonymous" about whats going to happen
on the feb 10 so the authorities can prepare.

if there are any school kids around who can inform us on what you are
planning... and the size of your bot net, do get in touch with the
netdev global hack research group at the following URL:
http://groups.google.com/group/n3td3v

n3td3v's opinion so far:
http://groups.google.com/group/n3td3v/browse_thread/thread/868a57a06376743a

further n3td3v opinion will be post to my news group as this story
develops towards the feb 10 and the aftermath.

regards,

netdev global hack research group
