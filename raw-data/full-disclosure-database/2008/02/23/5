hrm. sigh. Normal moles not being able to grasp trivial knowledge.

Airports are duh known conduits of business travellers with lots of data, thus increasing the possibility of targeting a more valuable target. So your statement that only ordinary criminals steal at airports is shortsighted. If anything a common criminal isnt going to try and steal at a place with a fucking million security cameras around. You obviously dont have enough of a grasp of the techniques to understand this thread so drop back off. 

You hardly need a barrel of liquid nitrogen - If you could summon not  a barrel but more of a can of  clue you would be better off.

if somebody steals your notebook at the air port the chance of this
person just beeing an ordinary criminal not interested in your data is
very high.

and if you just shut down your notebook, the DRAMs are still warm,
decreasing the time window for an "ice-spray-attack". so, unless the
notebook is thrown into a barrel of liquid nitrogen...
