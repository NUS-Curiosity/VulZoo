first question: do those travellers use encryption? from my experience,
most people are just ignorant when it comes to security.

how many notebooks are stolen to do industrial espionage? any statistics?

anyway, you're right - if they do use encryption and if they felt safe,
they have to feel a little less safe from now on.

that means: if in doubt, you should not carry too much important data on
your notebook. (a VPN access might help...)

and you might just turn your notebook OFF, instead of putting it to sleep.

hmm, ok, who would do so? would you say, it is easy to grab a notebook
in an airport lounge and leave the airport before anyone notices or
security folks get after you?

ok, so what you have to do is: grab the notebook while it's powered on
or in an ACPI sleep state. (maybe hit the victim in the toilet or
something.)

get out of the airport into a car and disappear quickly. in your car you
might have a *can* of liquid nitrogen or just a bunch of screwdrivers
and an ice spray. (the DRAMs might not be easily accessible.) you need a
computer with the same slots and be sure that the DRAMs have compatible
timing... and gloves, by the way...

possible, but complicated.

still, there are comparatively *simple* countermeasures. use glue. use
TWO encrypted drives (one for your personal data and one for your secret
business data). use an RFID- or bluetooth device to secure your
notebook. and then there are anti-tempering methods. i have heard there
are secure memory modules which erase themselves quickly...

or just don't let them snatch your computer!
