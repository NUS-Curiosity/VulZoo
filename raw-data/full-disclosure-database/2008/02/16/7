Living things die some day or the other, it is only life span that changes
and the fact whether they will be remembered beyond their life span. I don't
understand why the "Security" community are not doing their jobs, and
instead typing crap in discussion boards.

If you guys really have time, I guess you should all concentrate on the
protection part or rather the security part rather than thinking of the
names that come for those products. Example: Backtrack ---> Awesome product,
the product was not famous for its name but for its quality.

Less talk, more work. Our community needs help, so do help by spending as
much time in valuable stuff. I do understand that there will be shitty
responses and some supportive responses. Do us all a favor, do not respond.
Use your time wisely in learning and saving the world. If you are unable to
save the world, save your ass by protecting the people who paid you to
protect them, rather than wasting your time in typing crap in mailing lists.
