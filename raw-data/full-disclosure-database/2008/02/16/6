Dear Andjew,

c35312fb3a7e05b7a44db2326bd29040

This hash is proof that Gobbles and n3td3v are one in the same. I 
will reveal this information as soon it is cleared for publication 
by Dr. Neal Krawetz, with whom I have been collaborating with for 
some time now.

As for your Anti-Semetic remarks, they are not appreciated. Please 
take your hatred for the Jews and other sub-human cultures off list.

J

commands respect. Men may hate us. But, we don't ask for their
