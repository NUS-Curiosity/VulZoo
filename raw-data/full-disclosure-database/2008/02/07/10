They're trying to keep themselves from being overwhelmed by complaints. :)

Imagine that the average phish or other spam hits 1 million mailboxes, and
0.1% of the people get pissed off enough to actually do something other than
just delete it.  We now have 1,000 people trying to complain.  If we make it
hard enough so that 99% of them give up, we only have 10 complaints to wade
through, rather than 1,000...
