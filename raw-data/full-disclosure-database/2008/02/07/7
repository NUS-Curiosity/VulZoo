Checkpoint SecuRemote/Secure Client NGX Auto Local Logon Vulnerability
(Or, How to Be Bill Gates, if Bill Gates uses a CheckPoint VPN Client)

Discovery Date:
December 13, 2007

Vendor Release Date:
February 6, 2008

Severity:
Impersonation of users. What's your VPN protecting?
Checkpoint says.... MEDIUM

Vendor:
Checkpoint

Systems Affected:
VPN-1 SecuRemote/SecureClienetNGX R60 for Windows VPN-1
SecuRemote/SecureClient NGAI R56 for Windows Earlier versions may be
affected as well

Overview:
Issues with credential storage in the registry allow anyone with read
access to the registry to utilize stored credentials to login and
impersonate the user who stored their credentials.

Technical Details:
Sorry, no sexxy buffer overflow! However, you too can be an
authenticated VPN user!
Checkpoint's VPN client has an option to store credentials. All users
have read access to the registry key where these are stored. A user
can export this registry key, install the software, and configure it
to cache credentials. Then, import the registry and connect. No
prompting, and you are now the alternate user. Bad hacker, bad!

Scenario:
A user has enabled the Auto Local Logon option in the client, and
stored their credentials.  These credentials are kept in the registry,
under HKLM\Software\Checkpoint\SecuRemote.  Credentials are
specifically under the subkey named…. "Credentials"… sneaky!
Permissions for the Checkpoint key are set to Everyone – Full Control.
This means anyone with a local logon to the machine, or any
administrator from a remote machine, if remote registry access is
enabled, can view and export this key.  Next step: Install the client
on another machine, and reboot as required.  Configure Auto Local
Logon, and create a site, but provide no credentials.  Import the key.
 You are now the other person.  Probably not Bill Gates, but still,
messy.

Fix:
Disable the caching of credentials. Who's a fan of that anyway.
Alternately, see the vendor fix below.
