Subject: Re: Checkpoint SecuRemote/Secure Client NGX Auto
	Local Logon Vulnerability

Or better... how to be Bill Gates, if Bill Gates uses a CheckPoint VPN
Client AND you have access to some machine he used.

I agree it´s a medium problem... why try to make it so special?



cya,

>
> Discovery Date:
> December 13, 2007
>
> Vendor Release Date:
> February 6, 2008
>
> Severity:
> Impersonation of users. What's your VPN protecting?
> Checkpoint says.... MEDIUM
>
> Vendor:
> Checkpoint
>
> Systems Affected:
> VPN-1 SecuRemote/SecureClienetNGX R60 for Windows VPN-1
> SecuRemote/SecureClient NGAI R56 for Windows Earlier versions may be
> affected as well
>
> Overview:
> Issues with credential storage in the registry allow anyone with read
> access to the registry to utilize stored credentials to login and
> impersonate the user who stored their credentials.
>
> Technical Details:
> Sorry, no sexxy buffer overflow! However, you too can be an
> authenticated VPN user!
> Checkpoint's VPN client has an option to store credentials. All users
> have read access to the registry key where these are stored. A user
> can export this registry key, install the software, and configure it
> to cache credentials. Then, import the registry and connect. No
> prompting, and you are now the alternate user. Bad hacker, bad!
>
> Scenario:
> A user has enabled the Auto Local Logon option in the client, and
> stored their credentials.  These credentials are kept in the registry,
> under HKLMSoftwareCheckpointSecuRemote.  Credentials are
> specifically under the subkey named. &quot;Credentials&quot; sneaky!
> Permissions for the Checkpoint key are set to Everyone  Full Control.
> This means anyone with a local logon to the machine, or any
> administrator from a remote machine, if remote registry access is
> enabled, can view and export this key.  Next step: Install the client
> on another machine, and reboot as required.  Configure Auto Local
> Logon, and create a site, but provide no credentials.  Import the key.
>  You are now the other person.  Probably not Bill Gates, but still,
> messy.
>
> Fix:
> Disable the caching of credentials. Who's a fan of that anyway.
> Alternately, see the vendor fix below.

> Vendor Status:
> Checkpoint has released a bulletin for this issue, at:
