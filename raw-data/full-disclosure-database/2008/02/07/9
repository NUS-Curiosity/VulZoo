Sorry to say, but Yahoo!'s front line support people are practically
useless.  You can tell them you need the phone number for the White
House and they'd still ask you for the "full subject and email headers"
in order to "assist us in a prompt and full investigation".  I actually
wonder if real people read those complaints or if they have some bot
that scans for what looks like email headers and simply auto-replies
if it doesn't see them?!?

You're not doing Yahoo! a favor!  ;^)  It doesn't HURT THEM if someone is
using a Yahoo! email address for illegal purposes.  You're doing the 
potential innocent victims a favor, but that's not Yahoo!'s problem, is
it??

>Does anyone know an Yahoo! security contact that actually does his job?

Actually, yes, I do.  The email address 'ymailabuse-prio@...oo.com' goes
to REAL PEOPLE who really read the complaints and do something about them
(as far as I can tell).  I hope I don't lose my "complaint privileges" for
having posted that email address here?? (I don't know why they make it so
hard?!?)

Now, if anyone can get me it touch with someone in the Google/Gmail abuse
department, THEN we'd be making progress!  Google/Gmail hides their contact
info even more than Yahoo!, and then creates a group/forum for people to
get help THATS MANNED BY OTHER USERS!!!  Google/Gmail thinks they shouldn't
have to help us, but we can help each other?!?  Geez, talk about LAME!!
