Subject: Firefox 2.0.0.12 SSL Spoofing and Domain Guessing
	vulnerabilities

Firefox seems to have trouble with defining the proper hostname when
requesting a ssl connection. I was able to trick Firefox in thinking
the hostname behind the at-sign is legit and the same as the URI that
requested an ssl connection, and this without a warning.

You can add as much garbage between .com and the @ sign.

So what else can we do?

PoC:
www.cnn.com%C0%AF%C0%AF%C0%C0%80@...gle
www.gmail.com%C0%AF%C0%AF%C0%C0%80@...mail

ah heck we don't need that at all:
www.gmail.comxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@...mail

works fine also :)
