I am not sure the intended point of the exploit since you have @roguehost
and not a proper POC, but I believe all you have triggered is normal
behavior for auto logging into .htaccess protected folders in the form
username:password@...t.com

I did it with google.com and @mail.yahoo.com and it tried to log me into
mail.yahoo.com with google.... as my username as expected
