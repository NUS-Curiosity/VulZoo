Hash: SHA1

Immunity is proud to announce: Immunity Debugger v1.4 "veni, vidi, pwn"

We would like to express our appreciation for the enormous amount of
contributions, feedback and requests we receive daily from the Immunity
Debugger community at http://forum.immunityinc.com.

Our TODO list seems infinite but we are getting the most requested
features out there for you guys.

New in this release: a proper process detach, a Second Pass Analysis
which will soon grow into better argument/local variable recognitions
and a new Silent Mode for batch scripts.

Last but not least, we have included a collection of new scripts
including a lot of contributions from forum regular Bob (scanpe.py,
hidedebug.py and bpxep.py) and the contest winning plugin from JMS
(Instead of a candle dinner with Kostya, he received a brand new job as
a Developer on the CANVAS team).

Thanks for using Immunity Debugger! We hope you enjoy this month's
release, Check out the Changelog below for more detailed information.

You can upgrade your current Immunity Debugger by going to Help/Update
or directly downloading the new installer from
http://debugger.immunityinc.com/register.html

Sincerely
Team Immunity
