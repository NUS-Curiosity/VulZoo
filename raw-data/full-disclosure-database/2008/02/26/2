Description

Serendipity (S9Y) is a popular blogging system.
If used in a multiuser environment, one user can inject javascript code into 
certain fields in the backend to steal the cookies and hijack the accounts of 
other users.

Serendipity has the trustxss plugin to prevent XSS between users on multiuser 
setups, but that doesn't catch these issues.

In the »Personal Settings«-Dialogue, the »Real name« field can be filled with 
javascript, which appears on newly written articles. The »Username« field can 
also contain javascript, but there's no attack vector, as this field is only 
shown to the user itself.

Beside, the media library accepts uploads from any file format, including htm, 
html and js, which obviously also leads to xss.
Workaround/Fix

If you have a multiuser-blog and don't trust all users, you need to install 
the trustxss plugin and should immediately upgrade to 1.3-beta1.
If you're using a single-user blog, you are not affected.
