Subject: Re: Southwest Airlines Ticket Silliness


What Image? You just go to the kiosk and swipe a credit card, chosing 
the option 'Reprint boarding pass'. You have to of course have booked 
travel using the 'Business Select' option which is basically a fully 
refundable ticket with a few extra perks (one of which being you get 
double credit for that flight on their frequent flyer program, 
considering it only takes 8 round trip tickets in the first place you 
can see why I pick this ticket when flying for business travel)

I really only tried it myself because I wanted to see if the flight 
attendants would stop me from using multiple coupons. I figured they'd 
let me get away with 2 because, they don't know, I might be using both 
coupons on a multi leg flight, but 4 is more than a little obvious 
something fishy is going on. Of course I tried to tip her handsomely; 
but she told me she couldn't accept it unless I was paying cash. ? Odd...

Anyways, I thought it was a rather interesting oversight in policy and a 
neat security hole. :)

I attempted to call the 800 number to report the issue, but they didn't 
have a clue what to do about it or who to talk to, so I figured I'd post 
it here.
