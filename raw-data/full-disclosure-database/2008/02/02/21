No seriously don't post it there.

Unless you want:

a) get the secret services round your door
b) get sacked from your company
c) get put on the no fly list
d) get followed by the intelligence service in your day-to-day life

Media coverage involving your suggestion:

n3td3v strongly suggests *not* posting to the TSA blog under any
circumstances, it is being highly monitored by the intelligence
services and transport officials. You would only be giving yourself a
death wish posting there, even if *you* consider the information
useful you post there, for the love of god don't do it!
