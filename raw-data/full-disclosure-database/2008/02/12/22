Subject: Re: Brute force attack - need your advice

Hi,

> have pasted and also the advice on keeping the SSH on a different port.

run SSH on a different port?  oka, dumb scanners wont find it, but
others will. just dont use password-based SSH and dont let it be wide
open to the whole internet (firewall it to the addresses you need - and
add in a port-knocker if you do need to open from a different location)
