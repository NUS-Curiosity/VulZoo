Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in scponly allow authenticated users to bypass
security restrictions.

Background
==========

scponly is a shell for restricting user access to file transfer only
using sftp and scp.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/scponly        < 4.8                              >= 4.8

Description
===========

Florian Weimer from Debian discovered that scponly does not filter the
- -o and -F options to the scp executable (CVE-2007-6415). Joachim
Breitner reported that Subversion and rsync support invokes subcommands
in an insecure manner (CVE-2007-6350).

Impact
======

A local attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to elevate
privileges and execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable host.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All scponly users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/scponly-4.8"

Due to the design of scponly's Subversion support, security
restrictions can still be circumvented. Please read carefully the
SECURITY file included in the package.
