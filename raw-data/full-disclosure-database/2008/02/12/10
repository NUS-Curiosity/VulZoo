I don't really think that this is closely related to the use of your
mail address. Outside in the real nature, there is rain/snow/whatever,
which occurs from time to time in some type of natural cycle, and you
can't help it.

The same goes for SPAM and worms/virii/other automated attacks. They'll
always be there, like the rain and the show. What you should do is put
on a rain coat: make sure your systems are up to date and looking
regularly for holes in the coat. Keep the SPAM and worms off yourself,
and whatever flies through your network is just random noise.

(But please don't deduce from this posting that you should use it as
input in a random number generator to generate cryptographic keys!)
