FYI,

Lible:

An untruthful statement about a person, published in writing or through
broadcast media, that injures the person's reputation or standing in the
community. Because libel is a tort  (a civil wrong), the injured person
can bring a lawsuit against the person who made the false statement.
Libel is a form of defamation , as is slander  (an untruthful statement
that is spoken, but not published in writing or broadcast through the
media).

I'll bet that JP's family can file a lawsuit against the socially
dysfunctional idiots that are tarnishing JP's name. Especially since JP
is deceased. As a result they should be able to subpoena the ISP's and
providers and track these emails back to the places of employment from
which they are being sent. (Or their parents houses.)

I think that JP's family should very seriously consider this option. I
know of a few very good law firms that will work on a percentage with a
small deposit.
