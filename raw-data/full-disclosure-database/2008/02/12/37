i think you should mention dude vanwinkle in your news brief, i don't
care about your usual whitehouse journalistic publishing policies,
this guy was a legend.

you fail at the intertubes, you haven't mentioned him.

massive fail fail fail for securityfocus staff.

out of touch and out of sync.

this guy tracked your news and all the news non-stop around the clock
and post hundreds of news reports on funsec to prove it.

no respect for someone dedicated not only to cyber security
journalism, but to cyber security as a whole.

he deserved a mention on the mother of all cyber security sites as a
respect for his life and dedication.

this is my last e-mail on this, i don't want to trigger off your spam
defenses... good night.
