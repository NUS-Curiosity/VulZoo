Subject: Re: Brute force attack - need your advice

To clarify my last post. I agree with alan.

I mean it will help with the low hanging fruit. and I didn't get that  
deep into how to run his auth. Thanks for adding. also disable remote  
root access su to root if you need that. root=localhost only.

port knocking works very well too.

Thanks again for the add alan
