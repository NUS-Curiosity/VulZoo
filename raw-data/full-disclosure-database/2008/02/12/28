While I agree with locking down and checking for vulnerabilities, I
personally think that Snort is snake oil. It hardly ever detected
attacks for me which could have harmed my systems. (There were quite a
bunch of them, but they went mostly unnoticed.)

There are behavior based, autolearning IDS modes, but I've had my
experiences with jumping in public parking lots (which caused terror
alert because the IDS wasn't used to people jumping), so I am quite
sceptic of that as well.

Apart from the fact that you cannot destroy a hard disk in a way that
makes it unrecoverable (with expensive equipment and time), this is
pure populism.

I agree here; and don't log to syslog on localhost, have a separate
logging host like syslog is intended to be used...

This is security by obscurity. If you just fiddle with the ports which
were open for a second, it is pretty easy to determine which service is
running on it. I see no point at all in all of this port changing.

Apart from the bandwidth induced, bruteforce attacks are pretty useless
if you have sanely chosen passwords. And in the age of Tengig networks,
the bandwidth penalty is minimal.

I totally agree to backups though, for various reasons[1]. ;-)

This is pretty useful for various purposes, also for saving bandwidth
used by brute force attackers. But I don't agree to ...

...using any script Google finds, some have nasty bugs and blacklist
the wrong hosts (e.g. if you set an user name with spaces). You clearly
don't want your DNS server blacklisted, for example.
