Subject: Re: Brute force attack - need your advice

Hello experts,

Thank for all your rude, honest, polite, helpful replies. I'm really glad I
posted here and most of your replies (if not all) are very useful to me.
Sorry iam not able to reply individually to everyone and thank you. I've
been using a couple of servers and it was very unusal for me to get brute
force on the server in which my persona website is hosted. That is the
reason i posted this question.

Anyway, I shall keep the server tight. Thanks for the port scan report you
have pasted and also the advice on keeping the SSH on a different port.
Thanks again to everyone who has replied.

Kind regards,
Abilash
