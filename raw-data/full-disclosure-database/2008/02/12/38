I would not suggest that I have not set it up correctly, because it
recognized all the background noise attack patterns just well (and did
not notify), but nevertheless it was totally incapable of detecting
anything which could really have been interesting.

Well, you can take Flash storage and put 300-400V or so at the
contacts - just enough to melt the core before the contacts. If the
voltage is too high, only the contacts melt away and the core stays
intact. That is the only really erasable medium I'm aware of.

An alternative for the longer term is a PGP smart card with an 8192 bit
RSA (not! DSA) key which you simply break apart as you get into
trouble. It takes a while to reverse engineer the data.

But as I said, this is pure populism, servers are here to serve, not to
be made inaccessible. It is possible to maintain reasonable security
without achieving unusability.

That script kiddie won't find its way into a reasonably maintained
server anyway, it takes someone clued to do it.

Me too; there are e.g. scripts which evaluate failed logins from syslog
and ban them. Thus the mention of the user name with spaces, some of
these scripts fall for that trick.
