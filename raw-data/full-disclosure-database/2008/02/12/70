You need to check your spelling. Libel != Lible

Death -- Yes, legally, it is no problem to speak ill of the dead. For 
example, in James Bamford's The Puzzle Palace, a book about the National 
Security Agency, a former government employee is called a Russian spy 
even though he was never convicted of anything other than contempt of 
court. The family considered a defamation lawsuit, but learned that it 
was impossible because the subject was dead. In some cases, a libel suit 
filed by a person who dies may be continued, but relatives of a dead 
person cannot bring a libel suit.
