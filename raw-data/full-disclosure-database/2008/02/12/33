This so sucks...

Over the holidays I was discusing this list with Donna (who
tolerates my fascination with technology, but does not
share it) and reading her some of the threads.  What made
the conversation interesting enough to keep her attention
was not the topics, it was the people involved. 

I do not at all recall which issues were in the threads I
was showing her, but I do recall both of us laughing and
chatting about the humanity and humor amidst the arcane
technobabble. Dude, you made a lady smile who thought you
were an adorable and lively spirit - and now I can't share
that with you.

For the rest of you, I'll say it while we are both still
here - you're good folks (most of you ;), and I love every
irascible one of you.

PS and yes I'm Top Posting - I'm not going to edit Gadi's
words this time.  Well said.
