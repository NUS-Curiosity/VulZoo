Did you see any support of any trolls? I stay out of trolling. Besides 
death is death, its a sad loss but life moves on. People come, people 
go, had I known him I'd make a comment to no one on a public forum since 
it wouldn't be the right medium. Maybe flowers or a condolence card to 
his family would have been my route. I have little time for trolling 
especially to spit on someone who's not around to defend himself. I've 
no opinion of JP other then he seemed to be a knowledgeable person 
unlike many a poster here. I don't play the suck up game either "he will 
be greatly missed". I'm sure his family and friends will miss him and I 
hope they cherish his memory lest they become robots, as for me, I 
didn't know him to make a comment. My comment was towards you and your 
incorrect ASSumption of law.
