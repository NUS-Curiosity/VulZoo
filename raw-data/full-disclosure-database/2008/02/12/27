Subject: Re: Brute force attack - need your advice

Ok - I may not be able to lock in the SSH to a particular IP, but can
ofcourse try port-knocker and a non-password-based SSH. I will research a
bit about these as i'm not very familiar with a port-knocker and a
non-password-based SSH yet.

Thanks for your advice again. Thanks to Keith too. :o)
