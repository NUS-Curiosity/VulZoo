How much does the reputation Defender charge for to send the emails to
mailing lists begging that they take down bad things about Fredrick
Diggle. He is interested in their services and also for to have them
ban certain libel people from the internets. Is this possible and how
much will it cost Fredrick Diggle? His salary is not high at the zoo
but he would be willing to pay a fair sum.

YAY!
