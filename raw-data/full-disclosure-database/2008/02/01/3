Subject: Southwest Airlines Ticket Silliness

Not sure if anyone posted this before; But I figured this would interest 
you guys...

Southwest Airlines has a class of ticket called 'Business Select'. This 
ticket typically allows you to board the plane first, and because SWA 
doesn't have assigned seating means you have your pick of the seats on 
the plane. But there is quite an additional benefit.

You also get a free drink ticket. But they seem to have forgotten 
something in the implementation of this: Being your drink coupon is 
issued to you when you print your boarding pass. It's also printed 
whenever you *reprint* your boarding pass!

So if you feel like getting drunk on your flight, just print seven or 
eight boarding passes, and you'll have a good flight. I tried this a 
couple of weeks ago on a flight from San Diego to Kansas City, and I had 
myself 4 free drinks no problem.
