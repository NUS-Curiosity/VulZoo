Subject: Brute force attack - need your advice

Hello experts,

I had been talking to our web hosts the other day and they seem to have a
lot of unusual brute force attack on the servers recently. I'm guessing that
it could be because of my emails to the list? I mean, do you advice on using
a personal email for this type of list? Or should I use something like @
gmail.com? I know they can't easily break in to our servers, but am I just
giving them a chance?
