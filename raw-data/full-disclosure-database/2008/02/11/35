Synopsis
========

Insufficient checks in Horde may allow a remote attacker to bypass
security restrictions.

Background
==========

Horde IMP provides a web-based access to IMAP and POP3 mailboxes.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/horde-imp       < 4.1.6                         >= 4.1.6

Description
===========

Ulf Harnhammar, Secunia Research discovered that the "frame" and
"frameset" HTML tags are not properly filtered out. He also reported
that certain HTTP requests are executed without being checked.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted HTML
e-mail, possibly resulting in the deletion of arbitrary e-mail
messages.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Horde IMP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/horde-imp-4.1.6"

==========
