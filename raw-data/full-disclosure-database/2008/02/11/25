Subject: in Memory of Dude VanWinkle / Justin Plazzo

I was just woken up with the news of Justin's death and am unsure what to 
think or how to respond--I need to. I feel things are left unfinished, a 
light just disappeared without warning, and all I can think of is what I 
said to him, when and where. Was I nice? Was I respectful? Did I always 
treat him right? What could I do differently? What will our small corner 
of the universe look like without him?

What's clear is that he was a good guy who strove to always do better and 
was not afraid of voicing his opinion or making himself heard. He was also 
quick to apologize when necessary. His opinions never stopped him from 
seeing the person on the other side.

He took subjects he discussed seriously, but never lost sight of the fun. 
He never stopped learning and he evolved a great deal over the past couple 
of years in which I had the opportunity to know him. One day, I was hoping 
to meet him. He was a good guy.

He became an integral part of our community and only now I realize how 
much that is true.

He cared. I care. He is missed.
