If you're a black hat, it's often worth a *LOT* to see your actual high-value
target say:

"WTF is abilashpraveen.com and how come they just hacked us?"

Remember - an uninteresting host has actual value to a black hat - everything
from a throw-away jump point for launching an attack, to sending spam, to
hosting the websites the spam points back to, and other creative uses.  And
the *more* uninteresting it is, the *more* likely that it's running on autopilot
and the hacking won't be noticed....
