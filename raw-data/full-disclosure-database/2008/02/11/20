This is sad news, however...

I think its wrong for you to post his name and personal information
and employment onto a large mailing list of this size and nature.

I've been in the security scene 9 years and I know not to post
information like this.

He is now open to real life identity theft, social engineering,
phishing, vishing and other mischief.

Let's just hope his secret question isn't his mothers name etc.

Especially in the first few days, weeks, his family,friends,employers
etc are going to be open to exploitation with this information around.
