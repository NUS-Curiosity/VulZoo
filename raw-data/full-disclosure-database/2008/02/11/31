Subject: Re: in Memory of Dude VanWinkle / Justin Plazzo

You have the same feeling as what I had a couple of years back when my 23
years old friend (only son for his parents and a Microsoft VIP) passed away
in his sleep. Everything seems to be a vanity when someone very good and
contributing to technology passes away.

We all work so hard, and when we die - we have nothing to take with us. None
of the praises are going to help Justin or his family now. He is
missed ....and missed forever! I fear eternal life now.
