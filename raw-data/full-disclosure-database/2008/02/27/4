Subject: rtpbreak 1.3 is out!

hi all,
I would like to announce you that rtpbreak 1.3 is out!

documentation:
http://xenion.antifork.org/rtpbreak/doc/rtpbreak_en.html

download:
http://xenion.antifork.org/rtpbreak/index.html

basic description:
With rtpbreak you can detect, reconstruct and analyze any RTP session.
It doesn't require the presence of RTCP packets and works
independently form the used signaling protocol (SIP, H.323, SCCP,
...). The input is a sequence of packets, the output is a set of files
you can use as input for other tools (wireshark/tshark, sox,
grep/awk/cut/cat/sed, ...). It supports also wireless
(AP_DLT_IEEE802_11) networks. This is a list of scenarios where
rtpbreak is a good choice:
    * reconstruct any RTP stream with an unknown or unsupported
signaling protocol
    * reconstruct any RTP stream in wireless networks, while doing
channel hopping (VoIP activity detector)
    * reconstruct and decode any RTP stream in batch mode (with sox,
asterisk, ...)
    * reconstruct any already existing RTP stream
    * reorder the packets of any RTP stream for later analysis (with
tshark, wireshark, ...)
    * build a tiny wireless VoIP tapping system in a single chip Linux unit
    * build a complete VoIP tapping system (rtpbreak would be just the
RTP dissector module!)


have a nice day,
