Subject: XSS Vulnerability in AuthentiX

Description:
"Form-based or 100% cookie-free "Basic Authentication" website 
protection while keeping your NT Users Names and Passwords private. 
Protect all files, not just ASP pages. Validate against internal 
database, text file or external ODBC datasource." - www.flicks.com

Summary:
The AuthentiX administration page suffers from XSS vulnerabilities.  By 
default the /aspAdmin page is not accessible by remote users.

Example:
https://www.HOST.com/aspAdmin/editUser.asp?username=%3CMETA%20HTTP-EQUIV=%22refresh%22%20CONTENT=%220;%20URL=http://www.google.com/%22%3E

Vendor Contact:
20080222 Vulnerability discovered/
20080225 Vendor contacted and responded same day. 

Fix:
Vendor recommends to not allow the admin page to be accessible 
remotely.  If remote accessibility is required then password protect the 
/aspAdmin directory.

William Hicks & Chris Castaldo
