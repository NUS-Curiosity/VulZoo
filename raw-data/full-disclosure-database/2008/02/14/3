Subject: Digitalarmaments a fake orginazation?

i had a bitter experience with the company digital armaments they are
cheating everyone.

for all submitted research paper & vulnerability they offer some points they
never give out any money and they promise these points can be converted to
shares. but the truth is there is no company registered in the name of
digital armaments in USA and they cannot give any shares, and it is
completely fake organization

i hope there will be lot of ppl with same experience
