JaPCrypt means Javascript and PHP Encryption.

JaPCrypt is a PHP class which purpose is to give encrypted 
communications over HTTP by using server and client side scriptng like 
PHP and Javascript.

This project has been started because not every hosting provider gives 
HTTPS access, thus not having the possibility to manage safely sensitive 
datas.

Also, JaPCrypt could be implemented in common CMSes that don't support 
HTTPS natively for administration/private sections (i.e. Joomla).

Happy coding.
