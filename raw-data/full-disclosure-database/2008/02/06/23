It's true that with MITM you could "poison" the javascript to steal the 
key (cookie stealing style) but I think that it's a reasonable risk due 
to the "non-enterprise" environment, in which the suite has been thought 
for. Stealing the key requires a targeted attack MITM, in a precise moment.

I think it's better to use JaPCrypt then normal HTTP... and don't forget 
that all pages "protected" with JaPCrypt won't be indexed by crawlers. 
The "main" problem by now is not massive MITM but massive sniffing, and 
with this suite the problem of "mass-sniffing" is avoided.

Regards,
  Gerardo
