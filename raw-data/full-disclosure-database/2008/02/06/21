They're also the first mail server I've ever connected to that won't accept 
user@...ain.tld and insists on <user@...ain.tld> instead.  So, I'm not 
surprised to find that they 250 everything you type in.

I guess RFCs are even more meaningless now than they always have been.   :-(

BTW, privately I was informed that the *real* address is security@...oo-inc.com.

Who knew.
