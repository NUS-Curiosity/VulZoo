Description:
    Previous versions of the mysql package contain multiple weaknesses that
    can lead to local-server crashes and internal privilege escalations.
    
    Additionally, the immediately previous version of mysql was unable to
    create databases in TRADITIONAL mode.  This has been corrected.
