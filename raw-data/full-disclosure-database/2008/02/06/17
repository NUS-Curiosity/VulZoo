There's this thing called "The Real World", where often you end up doing
stuff like this because something is just plain busticated.  For instance,
https gives us:

a PKI that allows us to use RSA or similar to verify the other end's identity
and exchange a shared-secret to use as a symmetric session key.

Unfortunately, there's cases where you don't *have* https available (as noted
in the original posting).  So what do you do?  You roll-your-own using
PGP or S/MIME to verify identities (if it isn't who it claims to be from,
it won't decrypt) and exchange a shared secret, and then use JaPCrypt to
do the symmetric encryption.
