Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 02.04.08:
 Hewlett-Packard Network Node Manager Topology Manager Service DoS
 Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.04.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 04, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

HP Network Node Manager is a network mapping and management application
that allows administrators to monitor and control their networks. The
ovtopmd process listens, in a default configuration, on TCP port 2532.
More information can be found on the vendor's site at the following
URL.

http://h20229.www2.hp.com/products/nnm/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service vulnerability in
Hewlett-Packard's Network Node Manager product allows attackers to
crash the ovtopmd process.

The ovtopmd process contains an implementation error, in which it
attempts to access an invalid memory address based on data within the
TCP stream. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker can
cause the service to crash.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to crash the ovtopmd process. In order
to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to establish a
session with the service on TCP port 2532. No authentication is
required to access the vulnerable code path.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in HP's OpenView Network Node
Manager 7.5 with all updates applied as of May 14th, 2007.

V. WORKAROUND

Employing firewalls to limit access to the affected service will
mitigate exposure to this vulnerability.
