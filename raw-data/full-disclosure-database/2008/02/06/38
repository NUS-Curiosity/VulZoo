Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Doomsday might allow remote execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

The Doomsday Engine (deng) is a modern gaming engine for popular ID
games like Doom, Heretic and Hexen.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /     Vulnerable     /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-fps/doomsday     <= 1.9.0-beta5.2               Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Packages marked with asterisks require manual intervention!

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple buffer overflows in the
D_NetPlayerEvent() function, the Msg_Write() function and the
NetSv_ReadCommands() function. He also discovered errors when handling
chat messages that are not NULL-terminated (CVE-2007-4642) or contain a
short data length, triggering an integer underflow (CVE-2007-4643).
Furthermore a format string vulnerability was discovered in the
Cl_GetPackets() function when processing PSV_CONSOLE_TEXT messages
(CVE-2007-4644).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the Doomsday server
or cause a Denial of Service by sending specially crafted messages to
the server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

While some of these issues could be resolved in
"games-fps/doomsday-1.9.0-beta5.2", the format string vulnerability
(CVE-2007-4644) remains unfixed. We recommend that users unmerge
Doomsday:

    # emerge --unmerge games-fps/doomsday
