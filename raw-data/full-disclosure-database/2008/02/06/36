Where I work we re-sell third party products and its based on an 
assessment of what the client needs. There is no one size fits all 
solution. When I contracted at a company I won't mention (one of the top 
5 computing companies) we re-sold Juniper Netscreens to migrate out 
Checkpoint to one of our clients because it fit their need. We could 
have sold them bigger equipment to accommodate for it at a higher price.

You and whomever else your cohorts are need to take a better look at 
security design as a whole instead of shooting off rambling messages 
such as these. Let's go back to 1998, 1999 pre @Stake the corporation. 
One would have cringed at L0pht's site from a CTO perspective. Does that 
mean you would have belittled them in your (pseudo)security review.

Perhaps when you called Layer9 they didn't want to be bothered with your 
BS. Perhaps somewhere there is on this list and awaited your call. I 
don't know I don't work for them.

Name me one of the top 20 Fortune 500 companies that doesn't resell 
these services. You think companies don't farm out work?

Based on the reviews you guys put out, I take you as serious as I take 
that Indian kid ockknock whatever the hell his name was. "WTF is this 
idiot talking about." If I were a CSO why would I want to take you 
serious, why should I take you serious. Let's be logical here. What are 
your credentials. What certs do you possess, how long have YOU been in 
the industry, where have you worked, what have YOU done for the security 
community.

Get a real job.
