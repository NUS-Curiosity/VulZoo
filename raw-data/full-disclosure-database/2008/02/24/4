Subject: Re: Security contact at Safeway US

Sebastian,

Whenever I need to find Security at Safeway, I simply 
goto Aisle 9, right between Sauerkraut and the Sugar.

I've also found Gadi's head, right next to the lettuce if anyone is 
interested.

-beenthere

p.s. sry everyone, I just had to do this, back to my lurking hole...

Hi,

apologies for a rather simple question: Does anyknow know a 
security 
contact at Safeway US (the supermarket chain)? I was unable to find 
one 
on their website and using Google...is it as simple as 
security_at_safeway.com or does anyone have a particular email 
address 
or contact I could use?

Thanks.

Best regards,
