Subject: Security contact at Safeway US

Hi,

apologies for a rather simple question: Does anyknow know a security 
contact at Safeway US (the supermarket chain)? I was unable to find one 
on their website and using Google...is it as simple as 
security_at_safeway.com or does anyone have a particular email address 
or contact I could use?

Thanks.

Best regards,
Sebastian Wolfgarten
