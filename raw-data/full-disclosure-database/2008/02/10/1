after the third cut, and geographically disperse cuts along strategic
routes services the same nations, the odds of accidental cuts have
rapidly approached zero.

By my count, we are probably dealing with as many as eight, maybe even
 nine, unexplained cut or damaged undersea cables within the last
week, and not the mere three or four that most mainstream news media
outlets in the United States are presently reporting. Given all this
cable-cutting mayhem in the last several days, who knows but what
there may possibly be other cut and/or damaged cables that have not
made it into the news cycle, because they are lost in the general
cable-cutting noise by this point...

 The evidence therefore suggests that we are looking at a coordinated
program of undersea cable sabotage by an actor, or actors, on the
international stage with an anti-Muslim bias, as well as a proclivity
for destructive violence in the Middle Eastern region.

The question then becomes: are there any actors on the international
stage who exhibit a strong, anti-Muslim bias in their foreign
relations, who have the technical capability to carry out clandestine
sabotage operations on the sea floor, and who have exhibited a pattern
of violently destructive policies towards Muslim peoples and nations,
especially in the Middle East region?

The answer is yes, there are two: Israel and the United States of America.

such sabotage has long been possible and widely acknowledged, but this
type of warfare leads to escalating attrition and is something no
nation has every eagerly embraced.

if this is the start of coordinated warfare against telecommunications
infrastructure, god help the intarwebs...

(no ones wins in these battles, it merely becomes a question of who
loses the most and how quickly)


enjoy the show gmaggro, it will be interesting.
