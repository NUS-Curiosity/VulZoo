So what's the point, Ghostrider, other than character assassination
(or is that asinine-sasion)?

Simply by highlighting what is at most dubious information, you
present it as fact and leave the rest to now-public conjecture.

What is your relation to the guy?  Indeed, when were you
fired...and for what?

Even if your grudge-specific accusation had a smidgen of truth,
exactly how many people sharing that name are in the US..or the
world for that matter?  If you goto:
 http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/namesearch.html  one can get a 
pretty good idea how common the name is, and work the
statistics yourself...  Better yet, if I goto a search engine
starting with Za...I find 5 different people with the same name,
residing anywhere from beautiful Bakersfield, Ca to McCalla, 
Alabama (don't forget your Banjo, pig, and slobbering 'Tard, 'ya 
hear?).

The odds seem to be...lacking, Ghostrider.

What a nasty, spiteful and cheap way to air your grievance against
someone -- one can only hope the groundwork you're laying doesn't
come back to bite you, hard, when the Karma PoPo demand unfettered
access inside 'yer head.

Let's be honest here, perhaps a rare, seminal event for 'ya --
you're not performing research, you're trying to throw this guy
under a bus, an inquisition by any other name -- and I'm calling
you out.

Ghostrider, the question to everyone's answer is usually found from
within, and I hope the looking glass doesn't hurt too much when
it's pointed your way some day.

p.s. Have you seen what the average SCADA admin looks like?  One 
guy in these parts looks like he could have walked off the AC/DC 
Tour Bus...and I must say, I can tell when he comes on shift 'cause 
the lights burn just a little brighter.

I was trying to do a little research on SCADA security and I noticed
this one guy's name (Jonathan Pollet) kept coming up.  It seems he
is
one of the leading experts and it also looks like he is a Vice
President at Industrial Defender (www.industrialdefender.com).  It
looks like they are a leading SCADA security company.  Well through
my
Google searching I also came across an interesting archived Google
Talk chat with his name in it.  I guess not only is this guy a
leader
in SCADA Security it seems he is into drug trafficking also (pasted
below).  These are the people protecting critical networks like
power
grids and nuclear plants!?!?!?!


Chat with Jonathan Pollet show details 7/29/07

me: best way is to tape it to your leg

Jonathan: into different places in my laptop bad

 bag

me: it'll be tiny tiny ziplocks

 you can tape those to your leg

Jonathan: sweet

11:55 PM i can handle that

me: chances of you getting strip searched is probably zero

Jonathan: yeah, I've flown thousands of times
