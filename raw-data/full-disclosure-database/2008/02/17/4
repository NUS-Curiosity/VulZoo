Subject: Re: SCADA Security Corruption

After some offline discussion and a bit more research I agree that the
credibility doesn't seem very reliable.  It looks like it was on a
(non-google) server archive where somebody was manually saving chat
archives.  Who knows... they could have been forged or manipulated.
The only way to know for sure would be to see the actual google server
archive.
