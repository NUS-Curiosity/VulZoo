I would think a more realistic scenario might be a person working at an airport shutting their system down then getting it stolen vs a forensic examiner yanking the cord on purpose. Just an observation.

I found the article interesting, but I wonder about it's practicality. If
you have physical access to the box you never really need to power down the
box in the first place and generally if the box is already on, I think most
people would prefer to attack a service to get on the system directly. But
there are some special cases where these techniques will likely be very
useful.

For me, I've always disliked the practice of doing live forensic discovery.
I'd much rather get a clean disk dump than to poke around on the system
first, but losing RAM sucks. Maybe now IR/Forensic guys can get the best of
both worlds? They can yank the power to save the disk state and dump memory
by using the techniques described in the article. :)
