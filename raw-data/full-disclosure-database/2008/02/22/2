No, the source is VERY good.  They just don't admit it openly on their
website like Vocera's documentation.

So you just generalize and make assumptions about a product based on
heresay?  If the product is vulnerable, that's one thing.  Go ahead and
write about it, but if you can't confirm the vulnerability of the
product, don't attempt to use a company to garner more attempts at
reading your article.  Perhaps your title should have read.  "I think
Cisco is vulnerable, but I don't know?"  We all know Cisco is no better
than anyone else when it comes to bugs/issues, but don't just go making
assumptions and posts without proof.  That's just sad journalism!
