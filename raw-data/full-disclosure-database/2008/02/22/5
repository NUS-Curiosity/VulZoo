The victory conditions will be the contents of specific 
specially  planted files on each system, to be extracted 
by winners. Hack them and you get to keep them, and 
any associated prizes for the exploits used, oh and the
fame and glory. :-)

Browsers (I.E., Mozilla, Safari), Mail Clients (Outlook, 
Mail.app,  Thunderbird), and IM clients (MSN, Adium, 
Pigdin, Skype all platforms) are all in scope.
More details and official rules soon.
