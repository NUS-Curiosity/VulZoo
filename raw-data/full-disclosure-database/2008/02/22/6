Why google code? Don't waste your time or others that want to download
and use SourceForge, Codeplex, FSF, etc. and make them loose revenue.
Is so laughable that even the license permits redistribution in the
first place and mirroring it won't be a crime. And then proxies /
bouncers / tunnels. But then why make you or your visitors loose time?
Or... maybe Google want us to make mirrors without  limitations of
it's entire website and make us get the revenue they won't ;). Let us
know google we are impatient to clone your SF takeover attempt sh...
without restrictions.
