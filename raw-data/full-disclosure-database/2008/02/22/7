(cooling down DRAMs keeps their contents for longer time, even during
reboot.)

well, this shows how important mechanical security still is, even with
all the crypto-stuff out there. if you e.g. just *glued* your RAM
modules into your motherboard, the option left would be booting a
malicious OS. a BIOS-password might put delays on that.

so, if it is really secret put your PC in a locked steel box!

as a dircet countermeasure you might as well consider a simple
temperature sensor next to your DRAMs, releasing [evil self-destruction
hack] when temperatures drop below 0Â°C.

thermite does a good job on destroying HDDs but it's very dangerous.

it's probably more easy to use this device then:

looking at these two methods, i notice how "they" (whoever) seem to aim
not only on physical access but also more and more on surprising the
crypto-user. "they" might use the methods mentioned above or just hit
you with a flashbang, so you can't press the lock key anymore. this
worries me more than any it-related security flaw. i don't want the
police to behave like that.
