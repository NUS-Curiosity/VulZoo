n3td3v is fucking sharp and is about the takeover and the win, fuck the comedy.

i watched die hard 4.0 last night and was energised by it.

the DHS keep making everything electronic, but don't think about the
potential cyber terrorist attacks they create.

if you make everything electronic, make sure you have old skool
backups which are run by old skool methods of cup and string, because
if the bad guys strike, they will strike knowing your technology and
its backups.

i thought the die hard 4.0 movie was going to be crap, but it actually
highlighted a lot of real life potentials that got my mind thought
processes working, i'm suprised the U.S government didn't VETO the
release of DIE HARD 4.0, since they are still struggling to decide
where to build their U.S cyber command LOL.

I will apply for the MI5/GCHQ cyber command and hopefully i will get
gadi evron's home address and send him my good wishes.

I don't need to work for MI5/GCHQ to find out all the troll's personal
infos, i already have contacts with guys in there, who pay me off with
info, for being an informant in the online cyber world.

seriously though, ROFL at the U.S cyber command. Played any video games lately?
