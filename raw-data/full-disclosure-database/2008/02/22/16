i'm fond of tamper resistant / evident packaging, but this is usually
applied to persistent key storage rather than working system memory.
works well for authentication tokens and such, even if these methods
can also be bypassed with some effort.
(see http://flylogic.net/ and their disassemblies at http://flylogic.net/blog )

tamper resistant cases are bit more fun, like the blackbox [0] pelican
padlock'ed with zeroization / panic button.  however, after reading
this paper, it appears that secure overwrite of all key scrubbed
memory and other sensitive locations would be preferable to simple
power off, even if the case is a pain to open...

a fun attack, to be sure.
