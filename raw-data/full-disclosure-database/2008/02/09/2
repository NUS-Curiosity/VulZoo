  Subject: [ NNSquad ] Verizon's access via their provided Actiontec MoCa router

  Hey folks,

  In discussion with Lauren (off list) I recalled the following info that might
  be of interest to any FIOS users who actually want their home network to be a
  bit more secure.

  During a recent UPS battery swapout, I got stuck with a verizon 'dead' DHCP
  lease (it would not lease me an IP address).

  VZ Tech support was able to access and verify the configuration, code rev, and
  connectivity on the Actiontec router, despite there being no visible external
  IP address (according to my web view on the box) on the router.

  To me, that equals no security if they (unknown they...) can access my LAN or
  router without even their router logs showing such external access. Not good.

  Anyway, in bridge mode, I run a software firewall behind it, which does the
  actual DHCP request and is my external visible IP to the world. You can still
  do all the normal stuff, using the Actiontec as a MoCa to Ethernet interface
  (NIM).

  Best regards,
  Andy Burnette
