Subject: Break Captcha to send sms at Movistar Colombia,
	Movistar Ecuador and Comcel Colombia

The captcha of the Movistar Colombia cellphone company web page[1] is
too simple I get in contact with them but don't fix it so I made a poc
to break it[2]

Movistar ecuador[3] has the same problem but it's "captcha" don't even
use an image but 4 numbers in plain text.

Comcel of Colombia don't even use captcha.

In the three cases the person who get the sms has to pay for it.
