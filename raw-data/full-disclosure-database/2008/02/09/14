Amusing isn't it that everytime someone tells reepex to shutup,
he/she acts as if he/she has a personal or business relationship
with them, and that somehow he/she is important to this person.
What transparent bollocks.

It's the exact tactic used on us when running into one's annoying
hosebeast of an ex while out with the new missus, and she says "but
you told me last night you loved me", even tho you haven't seen the
mad bitch for 2 years. reepex has done this at least 3 times in the
last 3 months and it pretty neatly ages him/her to his/her late
teens.

For the record, I have never spoken to reepex, and hold him/her in
no more regard then I do my neighbour's lawn. Although, the lawn
does serve a useful purpose.

reepex has not contributed one useful thing to full disclosure, so
I'm more than happy to join with the increasing majority, who would
like it if he/she STFU.

The good news is that if reepex were older and still exhibiting the
same psycho-ex-girlfriend behaviour, it is highly unlikely that no-
one will want to breed with it, so at least the line will stop
there.
