Why do I get such nonsense said about me because I point out that Eric
Harrison is a script kiddie, Simon Smith is in need of a new security team,
and throwing 5000 As into a buffer is not hacking :(

Are you referring to Simon Smith? I assume you are. It is just strange that
he would tell me so many times in email how inadequate and useless his
security team is and how he wanted me to work for them, only to then make
fun of me. It seems his is jealous/angry at me for not going with his
company.

Yes I have. Ask coderman about my amazing revelation of htaccess in the url
last week, while everyone was talking about 'firefox vulnerabilities'
