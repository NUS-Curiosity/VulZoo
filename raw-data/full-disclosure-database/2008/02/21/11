So you just generalize and make assumptions about a product based on
heresay?  If the product is vulnerable, that's one thing.  Go ahead and
write about it, but if you can't confirm the vulnerability of the product,
don't attempt to use a company to garner more attempts at reading your
article.  Perhaps your title should have read.  "I think Cisco is
vulnerable, but I don't know?"  We all know Cisco is no better than anyone
else when it comes to bugs/issues, but don't just go making assumptions and
posts without proof.  That's just sad journalism!
