Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 02.20.08: Symantec
 Veritas Storage Foundation Scheduler Service DoS Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.20.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 20, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

The Veritas Storage Foundation is based on the Veritas File System and
Veritas Volume Manager products. It allows virtualization of storage
over a variety of platforms. It contains a remote administration
application to configure and monitor the elements of the storage
network. More information can be found at the following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service vulnerability in Symantec
Corp.'s Veritas Storage Foundation scheduler service could allow an
unauthenticated attacker to crash the service.

When the Veritas Scheduler service (VxSchedService.exe) encounters
certain packets, an invalid memory access occurs causing the service to
crash.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause the
affected service to terminate. In order to exploit this vulnerability,
an attacker must be able to establish a TCP session with the service on
port 4888. No authentication is required to reach the vulnerable code.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense Labs have confirmed Veritas Storage Foundation for Windows
version 5.0 (with VxSchedService.exe version 5.0.9.298) is vulnerable.
It is suspected that all previous versions are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Applying filtering to the affected port, such that only hosts which need
to use this service can access it, will help mitigate exposure to the
vulnerability.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Symantec has addressed this vulnerability by releasing an update for
Veritas Storage Foundation. More information is available in Symantec's
