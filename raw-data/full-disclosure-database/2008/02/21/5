Subject: Announce: RFIDIOt credit card sub-module: ChAP.py

Folks,

I have yet to integrate it into RFIDIOt itself, but I've written a test 
program for reading Chip And PIN credit cards using the EMV standard.

This is very much a work in progress, so don't be surprised if it isn't 
stable, but it is showing promise! :)

It currently only works with PC/SC readers, but does support both the 
physical chip and RFID interfaces, so AmEx Expresspay and MasterCard 
paypass etc. should work. I've not yet tested the Visa version.

I will work on porting it into RFIDIOt over the next few weeks so ACG 
readers will be able to support it.

Please let me know how you get on, or if you find any new AIDs (send 
these to aid@...diot.org).

Thanks and enjoy,
Adam
