Subject: Re: Firewire Attack on Windows Vista

Hi, I am new to this list.

I was reading your messages, and began to wonder; For a temporary fix action
why not just disable the ability to install new firewire devices?  I know
that this does not fix the fundamental problem, but it could work as a
decent kludge.

I am reminded of the NSA Security Guide on Disabling USB
Devices<http://www.nsa.gov/snac/support/I731-002R-2007.pdf>,
how do these actions translate to firewire?
