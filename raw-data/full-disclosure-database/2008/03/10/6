Subject: Real Networks RealPlayer ActiveX Control Heap
	Corruption

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Who:
Real Networks

What:
Real Networks Real Player is a popular media player.

How:
Real Player utilizes an ActiveX control to play content within the
users browser.

rmoc3260.dll version 6.0.10.45
{2F542A2E-EDC9-4BF7-8CB1-87C9919F7F93}
{CFCDAA03-8BE4-11CF-B84B-0020AFBBCCFA}

It is possible to modify heap blocks after they are freed and
overwrite certain registers, possibly allowing code execution. Like
so:

- ------------
var buf = '';
while (buf.length < 1005) buf = buf + 'A';

m = obj.Console;
obj.Console = buf;
obj.Console = m

//repeat
m = obj.Console;
obj.Console = buf;
obj.Console = m --> Should crash here
- -------------

Workaround:
Set the killbit for this control. See
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797

Fix:
No official fix known

Exploit:
Working on it
