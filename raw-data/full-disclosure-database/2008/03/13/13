-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems with vulnerable installations of IBM's Informix Dynamic Server.
User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the oninit.exe process that listens by
default on TCP port 1526. During authentication, the process does not
validate the length of the supplied user password. An attacker can
provide a overly long password and overflow a stack based buffer
resulting in arbitrary code execution.

-- Vendor Response:
IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
