Synopsis
========

A Denial of Service vulnerability has been reported in LIVE555 Media
Server.

Background
==========

LIVE555 Media Server is a set of libraries for multimedia streaming.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-plugins/live     < 2008.02.08                 >= 2008.02.08

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma reported a signedness error in the
parseRTSPRequestString() function when processing short RTSP queries.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted RTSP query to the
vulnerable server, resulting in a crash.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All LIVE555 Media Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-plugins/live-2008.02.08"

Note: Due to ABI changes, applications built against LIVE555 Media
Server such as VLC or MPlayer should also be rebuilt.
