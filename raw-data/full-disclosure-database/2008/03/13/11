Worried,

Do you have a blog a some articles out there with your work documented so others can learn from you for free.

If so by all means do share, I think knowledge of any type is worth looking into.

does that imply i'm wrong or less advantaged to make an opinion about
offensive-security?

unemployed and in the security underground somehow makes me at a less
advantage than whitehats?

oh, ok.

i think it means i've got lots of spare time on my hands to fuck about
with systems and i'm likely to have more zero-day and intelligence
than e-commerce or the government.

all the best with that security thingy.
