Cisco Security Advisory: CiscoWorks Internetwork Performance Monitor
                         Remote Command Execution Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20080313-ipm

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2008 March 13

Summary
=======

CiscoWorks Internetwork Performance Monitor (IPM) version 2.6 for Sun
Solaris and Microsoft Windows operating systems contains a
vulnerability that allows remote, unauthenticated users to execute
arbitrary commands. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
Cisco has made free software available to address this issue for
affected customers.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080313-ipm.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

IPM version 2.6 for Solaris and Windows operating systems is
vulnerable.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

IPM versions 2.5 and earlier as well as IPM version 4.0 are not
vulnerable. No other Cisco products are known to be vulnerable.

Details
=======

CiscoWorks IPM is a troubleshooting application that gauges network
response time and availability. It is available as a component within
the CiscoWorks LAN Management Solution (LMS) bundle. IPM version 2.6
for Solaris and Windows contains a process that causes a command
shell to automatically be bound to a randomly selected TCP port.
Remote, unauthenticated users are able to connect to the open port
and execute arbitrary commands with casuser privileges on Solaris
systems and with SYSTEM privileges on Windows systems. This
vulnerability is documented in CVE-2008-1157 and Cisco Bug ID 
CSCsj06260.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

* CSCsj06260 - Remote command execution possible using the Process Mgr

CVSS Base Score - 10

Access Vector:          Network
Access Complexity:      Low
Authentication:         None

Confidentiality Impact: Complete
Integrity Impact:       Complete
Availability Impact:    Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 8.3

Exploitability:         Functional
Remediation Level:      Official-Fix
Report Confidence:      Confirmed

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in the
ability to execute arbitrary commands with the non-privileged casuser
user account on Solaris systems and with full administrative SYSTEM
privileges on Windows systems.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

This vulnerability is corrected in the IPM version 2.6 CSCsj06260
patch for Solaris and Windows operating systems. Fixed software can
be obtained here:

http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/ipm-sol?psrtdcat20e2

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. It is possible to
mitigate this vulnerability by restricting network access to TCP
ports on a system running IPM version 2.6 to trusted systems.
Administrators are strongly encouraged to upgrade to a fixed version
of IPM.

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20080313-ipm.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found a
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_warranties_item09186a008088e31f.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
