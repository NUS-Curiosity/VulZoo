References:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1218

Description:
    Previous versions of the dovecot package are vulnerable to an
    Unauthorized Access attack in which a remote attacker may bypass
    password authentication.
    
    dovecot is not installed by default on rPath Linux systems, and
    the default dovecot configuration file provided with rPath Linux
    does not trigger this vulnerability; only systems customized to
    include and reconfigure dovecot may be vulnerable.
