Did you just say "security underground"?  What does that even *mean*!?  
Hacking underground... yes, I get that... and it actually means something 
(although likely less and commonly thought).  

And so what if the guy makes some cash from training?  Getting paid to support 
the habit is generally accepted as a good thing.  I'm glad you feel strongly 
about making help and discussion available for free.  Many good things have 
come from such ideals... but you sound like RMS of the "underground security" 
scene.
