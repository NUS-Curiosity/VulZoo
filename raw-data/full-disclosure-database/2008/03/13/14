And you're just as likely to have nothing at all.  Since there is no evidence 
to attest to your vaunted knowledge, for all intents and purposes, it doesn't 
exist.

At least once you have to start actually paying bills you might gain some 
knowledge about that evil profit motive.  Whether the "security thingy" works 
out for you or not is an open question.
