That could be, I was more hinting to the open structure of OpenID. If 
you don't trust a provider choose another one. Other frameworks for 
online authentication/autorization don't offer this flexibility, one 
provider only, like passport.
OpenID offers the possibility to offer competing authentication services 
provided by different providers. So you don't have to put all your eggs 
in one basket. (it is easter after all)
