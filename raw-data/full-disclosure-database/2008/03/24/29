Subject: Re: OpenID. The future of authentication on the
	web?

as I said, some websites ask you for a username regardless whether
that will be an email address. and unfortunately a username is not
unique through out the Web. which means that if your username is
john-bambenek on one system it could be completely different on
another system due the fact that some vendors don't like the "-" or
they don't like the length or they ask you to have a number in the
username or even they provide you with such. So keeping track of
usernames is as hard as keeping track of passwords. Put them all
together and then you will experience the pain.

On the other hand OpenID provides you with a unique ID. Only you can
use it on every system without the need to worry.
