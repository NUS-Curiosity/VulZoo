You seem to miss one point, in the current online environment you are 
not talking about 5 or 6 id/credentials but more like 20 to 30. 
(remember each blog you post to, each mailing list each web store 
requires its own id/credentials.) OpenID provides for the possibility to 
group these id's by function and select the correct provider with the 
safeguards you want for each group. An OpenID for money related 
transactions would need more safeguards as an OpenID for lets say full 
disclosure ;-)
