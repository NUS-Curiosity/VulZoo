Subject: Re: OpenID. The future of authentication on the
	web?

I would disagree.  One could simply create a template password and then salt
it with some acronym for the site in question.

For instance, S0m3p4ss!### where ### is a 3-letter acronym for the site they
are accessing.  Still need only one password to remember and you don't
necessarily have a single point of 0wnership anymore.
