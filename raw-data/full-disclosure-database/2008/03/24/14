And even encryption solution have their problems as the key recovery from
ram paper has shown...

If we use public/private keys with SSH, why not use it with more services,
like web ones ? :)
Keys owners would have the responsability to manage their keys (password
recovery procedures substituted by key procedures) and their passwords...

Of course it would take a long time to deploy and teach the general public
about it, but isn't that what security pros are trying to do for a long
time ?
