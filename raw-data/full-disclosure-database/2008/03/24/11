	web?

Indeed but this can be a subsystem, a feature of the OpenID provider.
For example, some OpenID providers have the feature to choose
different persons depending on the usage. So it will be easier to
safeguard a persona within one openid provider. So for example, in my
current OpenID setup I have two personas. One for daily use which is
completely useless and one for mission critical stuff. Although the
mission critical persona is not safeguarded :) (lack of
functionalities here) if such a feature is implemented, wouldn't be
that much better? :)
