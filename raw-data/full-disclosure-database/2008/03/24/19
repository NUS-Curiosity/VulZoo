	web?

>>For instance, S0m3p4ss!### where ### is a 3-letter acronym for the
site they are accessing.  Still need only one password to remember and
you don't necessarily have a single point of 0wnership anymore.

I've never understood this strategy. Once I compromise your
"S0m3p4ss!ama" password for amazon.com how long will it take me to
figure out all your others?
