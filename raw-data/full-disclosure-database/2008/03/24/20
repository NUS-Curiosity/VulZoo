Subject: Re: OpenID. The future of authentication on the
	web?

For the automated low-hanging fruit attacks, they won't crack.  They're
simply trawling for passwords and rarely do they even think to cross-check.
For someone to spend the kind of thought and attention the victim has to be
specifically targetted.

Now, to be fair, I only advocate that strategy for "throwaway" accounts.
For instance, I don't really care if my account on digg gets cracked, I do
care if my bank account gets cracked.  So I use the throwaway for digg (or
other sites that just don't matter if they are compromised) and something
secure and unique for the banks and other important stuff.

The alternative is that someone uses the same password for EVERYTHING, crack
some forum and you've got bank account passwords too.

Long winded, but I'm not sure much OpenID would provide authentication for
I'd care about (admittedly I haven't looked in detail).
