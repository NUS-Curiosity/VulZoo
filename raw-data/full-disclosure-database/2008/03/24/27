I see postings like this in several mailing lists.
Is offensive-security in need of doing that kind of guerilla marketing?

I think it's a good cert, but these actions to attract people to their
cert are not casting a positive light on them.


Heh, n3td3v opinion prevails!!! even on lame-lists@...urityfocus.com

More e-mail like this and they'll end up getting blacklisted as commercial spam.

It is very OFFENSIVE spam by "offensive security".
