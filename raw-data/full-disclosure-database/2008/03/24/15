Subject: Re: OpenID. The future of authentication on the
	web?

Let's put it this way,

It is easy to prevent phishing attacks against OpenID on the
client-side with browser extensions. In fact, I think that Firefox
will make this feature a default in their upcoming versions. It could
work exactly the same as the current trusted certificate authorities
every single web browser comes with. You will have a list of trusted
OpenID providers domains which are also cross-matched with their SSL
certificates and URLs. Done!

If firefox is not planning to implement this feature, heck I will code
it myself. This is a hello world XUL extension.
