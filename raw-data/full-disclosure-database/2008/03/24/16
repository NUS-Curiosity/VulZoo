Subject: Re: OpenID. The future of authentication on the
	web?

Let's be realistic here. It's not about the technical
feasibility, it's about an open standard people trust
and have bought into. This is what Information Cards
are in my mind, much the same as OpenID. 

Sure you could go out and create an extension to serve
the same purpose in your own way, but who would trust
it? I mean PDP is known for javascript port scanning
via XSS (i know you've done more but...), not
authentication.

My point is simple. With OpenID + Information Cards
much of the security concerns/weaknesses (phishing,
passwords theft/loss) around OpenID as a protocol are
addressed. Sure you still have to trust the provider
(or write your own), but the implementation can be
secure, open and publically accessible using currently
available and supported web technologies. Beemba and
MyOpenID currently do this.

BTW, Firefox 3 will have support for Information Cards
by default and an extension is available for Firefox 2
at Codeplex.
