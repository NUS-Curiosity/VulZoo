Subject: More High Profile Sites IFRAME Injected

The ongoing monitoring of this campaign reveals that the group is
continuing to expand the campaign, introducing over a hundred new
bogus .info domains acting as traffic redirection points to the
campaigns hardcoded within the secondary redirection point, in this
case radt.info where a new malware variant of Zlob is attempting to
install though an ActiveX object. Sample domains targeted within the
past 48 hours :

lib.ncsu.edu; fulldownloads.us; cso.ie; dblife.cs.wisc.edu;
www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk; ehawaii.gov; timeanddate.com;
boisestate.edu; aoa.gov; gustavus.edu; archive.org;
gsbapps.stanford.edu; bushtorrent.com; ccie.com; uvm.edu; thehipp.org;
mnsu.edu; camajorityreport.com; medicare.gov; usamriid.army.mil
