Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Secure Access Control Server for
                         Windows User-Changeable Password 
                         Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20080312-ucp

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080312-ucp.shtml

Revision 1.0
============

For Public Release 2008 March 12 1600 UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

Two sets of vulnerabilities were discovered in the Cisco Secure
Access Control Server (ACS) for Windows User-Changeable Password
(UCP) application and reported to Cisco by Felix 'FX' Lindner, 
Recurity Labs GmbH.

The first set of vulnerabilities address several buffer overflow
conditions in the UCP application that could result in remote
execution of arbitrary code on the host system where UCP is
installed.

The second set of vulnerabilities address cross-site scripting in the
UCP application pages.

Both sets of vulnerabilities could be remotely exploited, and do not
require valid user credentials.

Cisco has released a free software update for UCP that addresses
these vulnerabilities.

There are no workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20080312-ucp.shtml

Affected Products
=================

UCP is the vulnerable application and can be installed to
inter-operate with:

  * Cisco Secure ACS for Windows
  * Cisco Secure ACS Solution Engine (Appliance)

NOTE: In Cisco Secure ACS for Windows, UCP may be installed on the
      same or different host as the Cisco Secure ACS for Windows
      application. In the Cisco Secure ACS Solution Engine (Appliance)
      the UCP will be installed on a different host other than the
      appliance.

UCP is not installed by default with ACS installations.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

UCP versions prior to 4.2 are affected. Users can perform the
following steps to determine the version of UCP installed on a
system:

 1. Log in to the system where UCP is installed
 2. Open a Windows command prompt
 3. Change the current working directory to the default directory of
    the CGI scripts that was specified during installation of UCP.
    The default installation directory is 
    "C:\Inetpub\Wwwroot\securecgi-bin". Within this directory execute
    the command "CSuserCGI ver".

The output returned will indicate a CSuserCGI version. Any version
earlier than 4.2 is vulnerable. The following example shows a system
with UCP version 4.2 installed.

    C:\> c:
    C:\> cd c:\inetpub\Wwwroot\securecgi-bin
    C:\Inetpub\Wwwroot\securecgi-bin>CSuserCGI ver
    CSuserCGI 4.2, Copyright 2008 Cisco Systems Inc

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Installations of Cisco Secure ACS for Windows or Cisco Secure ACS
Solution Engine without UCP installed, are not vulnerable.

Cisco Secure ACS for UNIX, does not support the UCP utility and is
not vulnerable.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The UCP application enables end users to change their ACS passwords
with a web-based utility. When users need to change their own
passwords, they can access the UCP web page by using a supported web
browser, validate their existing credentials, and then change their
password via the utility.

For more information about the UCP application please see
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/net_mgmt/cisco_secure_access_control_server_for_windows/4.2/installation/guide/user_passwords/ucp.html.

Several vulnerabilities exist within the UCP application.

  * Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities.
 
    Multiple buffer overflows exist within the UCP CSuserCGI.exe
    code. CSuserGCI.exe is the HTTP interface to the server. 

    This vulnerability is addressed by Cisco Bug ID CSCsl49180 and
    has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 
    identifier CVE-2008-0532

  * Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities.

    Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities exist within the UCP
    CSuserCGI.exe code. 

    This vulnerability is addressed by Cisco Bug ID CSCsl49205 and
    has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 
    identifier CVE-2008-0533.


Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0. CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys
vulnerability severity and helps determine urgency and priority of
response. Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can
then compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact
of the vulnerability in individual networks. Cisco has provided an
FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS at
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html
Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at
http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss .


* CSCsl49180: Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities.

  CVSS Base Score - 10

  Access Vector:          Network
  Access Complexity:      Low
  Authentication:         None

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities may
result in the execution of arbitrary code on the system the UCP
application is installed.

Successful exploitation of the cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
may result in the embedding of malicious code and/or scripts within a
UCP URL.

The malicious code is likely to be a script that is embedded in the
URL of a link. The malicious code may also be stored on the
vulnerable server or a malicious website. An attacker could try to
convince an unsuspecting user to follow a malicious link to a
vulnerable UCP application server that injects (reflects) the
malicious code back to the user's browser.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. In all cases,
customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices to be
upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and
software configurations will continue to be supported properly by
the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance
provider for assistance.

UCP Version 4.2 contains the fixes for the listed vulnerabilities.

UCP Version 4.2 can be downloaded from the following location:
http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Software/Tablebuild/doftp.pl?ftpfile=cisco/crypto/3DES/ciscosecure/special/acs/macgyver/UCP_4.2.0.124-K9.zip&app=Tablebuild&status=showC2A

Note: UCP Version 4.2 works with all 4.x version of Cisco Secure
      ACS for Windows and Cisco Secure ACS Solution Engine. UCP
      version 4.2 is not compatible with 3.x ACS installations.
      No fixed UCP version exists for 3.x ACS installations.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities. Cisco recommends
upgrading to the fixed version of UCP.
