Synopsis
========

Sarg is vulnerable to the execution of arbitrary code when processed
with untrusted input files.

Background
==========

Sarg (Squid Analysis Report Generator) is a tool that provides many
informations about the Squid web proxy server users activities: time,
sites, traffic, etc.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/sarg       < 2.2.5                          >= 2.2.5

Description
===========

Sarg doesn't properly check its input for abnormal content when
processing Squid log files.

Impact
======

A remote attacker using a vulnerable Squid as a proxy server or a
reverse-proxy server can inject arbitrary content into the "User-Agent"
HTTP client header, that will be processed by sarg, which will lead to
the execution of arbitrary code, or JavaScript injection, allowing
Cross-Site Scripting attacks and the theft of credentials.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All sarg users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/sarg-2.2.5"
