Synopsis
========

Insufficient input checking in SWORD may allow shell command injection.

Background
==========

SWORD is a library for Bible study software.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/sword     < 1.5.8-r2                         >= 1.5.8-r2

Description
===========

Dan Dennison reported that the diatheke.pl script used in SWORD does
not properly sanitize shell meta-characters in the "range" parameter
before processing it.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could provide specially crafted input to a vulnerable
application, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
shell commands with the privileges of the user running SWORD (generally
the web server account).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SWORD users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/sword-1.5.8-r2"
