Subject: us cyber command

[02:40] <worried> do you think cyber terrorism is real or its just the
government softening ppl up for a couple of false flags for a reason
to bomb iran?
[02:49] <worried> the u.s are still deciding where to build the cyber
command, so don't expect any die hard style false flags till 2009
[02:50] <worried> they said their false flag cyber command would be up
and running by december 2008
[02:50] <worried> so they will test out their capabilities probably 2009/10
