Subject: Re: IE/Windows blocking Firefox downloads?

I have a worse problem. After unloading Semantic Anti-Virus and installing Comcast's version of McAfee, the damn systems won't allow
IE or Firefox thru, they have annihilated the ieframe.dll and whatever other critical dlls..  A denial of service core war btwn IE and Firefox apparently.  My VMware tcp stack still works though  UBUNTU Konqueorer or for any other VMware player browser.  This is such garbage.  Of course the new Vista PC I have was pre-loaded with Vista, no restore disk.
   
  What kind of a world do we live in when M$ and Firefox can get away with this insanity?  Should be a class action lawsuit and of course I get
  no help from the offending parties.  
   
  Luckily I have other systems running Linux, Win 2000 and other versions of OS's that like to work, like my N800.  
   
  Never had a problem with those.   Anyone know a quick fix other than re-loading a sane OS?

  This is weird. I am sitting on my dad's computer running freshly
installed Windows XP (no service pack- vanilla version) and whenever I
try to open a site related to Firefox with IE, it fails to open.
However, all other sites are working fine.
