Interesting thread, I'll come at it from a different perspective.

Computer forensics and incident response also has an application for
gaining access to physical memory.  Discovering encryption keys from
memory and other volatile artifacts may be of use.  In respect of
incident response how can you trust the OS environment on a compromised
machine?  Are your traditional IR tools going to lie to you during live
analysis and data gathering process?  Grabbing memory via firewire
minimizes this risk and also ensures least impact on the evidence.

OK Joanna Rutkowska has suggested a method to mitigate against these
attacks on AMD64 boxes

As you have rightly pointed out grabbing memory isn't the only nefarious
activity,  if I can login to a target machine then I can deploy all
sorts of nasties.  Could I use firewire to inject a process similar to a
dll injection attack?
