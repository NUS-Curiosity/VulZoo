Odd, since I stayed on topic and called no one a troll at all. By "us" I
meant what you read, If you don't like it, feel free to unsubscribe rather
than whine about it.

I don't care who you are. Read the thread next time before getting upset at
random people and doing the same thing you decry.

PS: I'm not a troll just because I put a PS that says I'm not a troll.
*flex*
