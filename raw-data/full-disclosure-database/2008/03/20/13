Subject: Re: Vonage denial of service through noise packet
	injection.

Who is the "Corporation" injecting "noise"?

I would have assumed that there would be some kind of packet athentication
in the vonage application stack . . .

So assuming that this is a network based attack, and assuming that Vonage
DOES somehow authenticate the incoming packets.  Wouldn't this level of
attack have to be at the ISP level?

So what ISP are you talking about?

Rather than spreading FUD, why not give us some useful information?

Have you experienced this? If so do you have a packet capture?
