Subject: Vonage denial of service through noise packet
	injection.

Vonage service is being disrupted by injecting noise packet filtering into received
calls for VOIP customers.  This is service disruption by a major Corporation and
anyone else experiencing this disruption, static noise on in-coming calls, should 
contact Vonage Customer service.   As this is a deliberate disruption of commercial services and causing illegal denial of service to small businesses.

 A Class action lawsuit against the offending carriers should be initiated and a Federal Anti-Trust lawsuit should be filed by the government.

Anyone else experience this kind of disruption should voice their concerns to the
carrier of choice and only by complaints and direct action can this practice be 
ended.
