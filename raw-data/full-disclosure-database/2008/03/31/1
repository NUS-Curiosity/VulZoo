Umm.. maybe because, despite what you may think, your little pissing contest
with Joel and Johannes doesn't qualify as a "oh my ghod, let's drop *everything*
and shut down the entire workflow and not do a single damned thing until this
issue is resolved".

Hell, when JFK was assassinated, the entire federal government didn't shut
down until the Warren Commission report came out.  And to paraphrase Lloyd
Bensen, you're no JFK.
