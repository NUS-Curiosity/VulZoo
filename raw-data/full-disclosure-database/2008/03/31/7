Subject: ProxyStrike - Active Web Application Proxy

Hi everyone,  we have released a new tool:

ProxyStrike is an active Web Application Proxy, is a tool designed to  
find vulnerabilities while browsing an application. It was created  
because the problems we faced in the pentests of web applications that  
heavily depends on Javascript, not many web scanners did it good at  
this stage, so we came with this proxy.

Right now it has available Sql injection and XSS modules.

Features:

Http request/response history
Request parameter stats
Request parameter values stats
Request url parameter signing and header field signing
Use of an alternate proxy (tor for example ;D )
Sql attacks
Xss attacks
Export results to HTML or XML
Console version (python proxystrike.py -c / proxystrike.exe -c)

Check it at:  http://www.edge-security.com/proxystrike.php

You can choose a win32 or a *nix version.

Regards,

Christian Martorella
