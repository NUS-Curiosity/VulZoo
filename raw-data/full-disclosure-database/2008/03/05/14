it mainly depends on the implementation of the scanner.
We did some large scale internet SNMP scanning some time ago
[see http://www.ernw.de/content/e7/e181/e671/download690/ERNW_026_SNMP_HitB_Dubai_2007_ger.pdf] and used our own scanning tool [http://www.ernw.de/download/snmpattack.pl]. 
Within the different releases of the tool there were _big_ differences as for the scanning speed.

thanks,

Enno
