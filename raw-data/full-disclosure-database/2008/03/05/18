what the hell is this? visiting the iniquity of the applications upon 
the protocols? Winsock is probably the only API that lets you connect() 
asynchronously (via the "non-standard" ConnectEx extension, but still). 
And if you have access to raw sockets, the whole point is moot because 
(IIRC) the advantages of SYN cookies work both ways
