I have contacted Adeptra (note spelling) to ask them if they are the
owners of this number.

However, if they have themselves sold the number on to yet another
party, I have asked for the details so we can hunt down who is running
this scam.

Adeptra are based at
Forbury Court,
12 Forbury Road,
Reading, Berkshire, RG1 1SB
Main telephone number is 0118 938 7000
(so I guess Miss Roberts is a direct number (938 7023) at that address).

their website is

www.adeptra.com
