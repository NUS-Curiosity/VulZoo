WebCT 4.x Javascript Session Stealer Exploits

Software: WebCT Campus Edition 4.x (http://secunia.com/product/3280/)
Affected Version: 4.1.5.8
Discoverer: Benjamin "balupton" Lupton
Date Discovered: November 2005
Date Reported: 25/06/2007
Software Author Contacted (again) on: 20/07/2007
Date Published: 05/03/2008

Attack Type:
Javascript Session Stealer Exploit.

Description:
Mail & Discussion Board messages are not properly checked for javascript,
allowing javascript to perform a session stealing attack (allowing the
attacker to be logged in as the victim).

Tested On:
Attacks were tested fully on eCentral TAFE's WebCT System in November 2005
(with permission of staff),
and again on Curtin University's WebCT System in June 2006 (but this time
only to see if the javascript will run).

Action Taken:
Contacted TAFE lecturers and administrators, who didn't really care.
Contacted WestOne multiple times, but never recieved any response.
Then contacted Secunia, which would not publish as the discoverer did not
own their own copy of the software in question.
Published as WebCT is being phased out, with Blackboard being the
replacement.

Steps:
The attacker publishes the exploit code in a message with "Don't wrap text"
enabled.
The victim accesses the attacker's message and their cookies are sent to the
attacker's remote logger.
The attacker then logs into the system and replaces his/her cookies with the
acquired cookies.
- Cookies are formatted as follows within the "value" attribute:
CookieName=CookieValue; NextCookieName=NextCookieValue;
The attacker is now logged into the system as the victim.
In this case the logger is located here:
http://www.balupton.com/sandbox/logger.php?pass_code=secret_key

Notes:
Victims must be students (attack does not work on non students, eg.
teachers/admins).
Attack 2 will also run in Opera, but fails to retrieve the document.cookie
value.
Attack 2 uses a base64 encoded javascript which is executed.
Both attacks can be customized to allow any javascript to run.
Javascript can also be developed to post a mail or discussion board message,
this works for all types of victims.
