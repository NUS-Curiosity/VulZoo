Subject: Firewire Attack on Windows Vista

Hello,

In the light of recent discussions about firewire / DMA hacks, we would
like to throw in some of the results of our past research on this topic
(done mainly by Peter Panholzer) in the form of a short whitepaper. In
this paper, we demonstrate that the firewire unlock attack (as
implemented in Adam Boileau´s winlockpwn) can be used against Windows
Vista.

The paper is available at:

Best regards, 

Bernhard
