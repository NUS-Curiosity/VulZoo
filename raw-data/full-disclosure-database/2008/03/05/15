Greetings.

I preface that this is not a discovery, but rather a simple observation.

http://www.goolag.org

I am finding that it takes only a few seconds for Google to block query
requests, BY IP!  With this in mind, Goolag Scanner is actually an
effective annoyance tool against large networks.  Simply conduct a
Goolag Scan from a heavily populated network, with a couple hundred
Dorks, and anyone who uses the same public IP address which was used for
the Goolag Scan will have to go through an extra CAPTCHA step to finish
their Google queries.  If they use a Google toolbar of some sort, Google
may not even offer them a CAPTCHA option to continue with the search query.

Within "most" corporate networks, what effective methods can be used,
from the network's perspective, to block mass Google queries?
