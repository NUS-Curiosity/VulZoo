Hi dude,

First, to know whether a TCP port is open you do not need
a complete handshake. A single TCP packet is enough.
I doubt that a single TCP packet is slower than a single UDP
packet.
Second you may need to send multiple (same) UDP packets
since remote peer's rate limiting does not send you back ICMPs;
all due to the unreliable nature of UDP.

But the most important thing is, that if you do it large scale*,
you have to wait for some sort of reply anyways,
either TCP SYN|ACK or some application data. This time of "waiting"
can be used to SYN/request yet another 10,000 hosts.
Thus, how fast a scanner is does not depend on UDP or TCP,
it depends on the upper protocols. Even complex protocols
such as SSH can be spoken very quickly and only require a little
more time (if at all) than walking a couple of SNMP OID's per host.
10,000+ hosts/s for a common application TCP protocol such as HTTP
is easy.

Do not bash me if a UDP app scan takes 10 minutes to succeed
and I need 11, we talk about *differences* :-)

* speaking about application level which needs some
  request/responses in both, UDP and TCP, cases

regards,
Sebastian
