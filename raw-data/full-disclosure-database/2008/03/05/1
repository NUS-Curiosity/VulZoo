Subject: Re: Hack into a Windows PC - no password needed

The key to the vulnerability: "To use the tool, hackers must connect a
Linux-based computer to a Firewire port on the target machine. The
machine is then tricked into allowing the attacking computer to have
read and write access to its memory. "

I assume this makes it a local login, not a domain login.

"Paul Ducklin, head of technology for security firm Sophos, said the
security hole found by Boileau was not a vulnerability or bug in the
traditional sense, because the ability to use the Firewire port to
access a computer's memory was actually a feature of Firewire."

So does the same capability exist on Macs?
