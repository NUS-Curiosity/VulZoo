Mar 03 22:50:50 <worried>       bunch of skript kiddos with DDoS nets...
this is why ppl will stop posting vulnerabilities to mailing lists, so
the enemy can't use it against their countries
Mar 03 22:51:10 <Biff`> huh?
Mar 03 22:53:22 <worried>       for instance do you think UK/china/iran
hackers are going to keep posting to mailing lists vulnerabilties jsut
so the script kids at the US cyber command can copy and paste the code
to black out our electricity grids etc?
Mar 03 22:53:25
<worried>       http://www.ktbs.com/news/Ad-promote-Cyber-command-9337/
Mar 03 22:54:00 <worried>       we will stop feeding the mailing lists the
"cyber ammo" so the us cyber command can't attack our countries
Mar 03 22:55:25 <worried>       the us cyber command are advertising a cyber
war on news articles, but do they realise what will happen if their is
a cyber war? no will will post to the mailing lists anymore.
Mar 03 22:55:55 <worried>       the us government are the biggest dumb asses
who dont think things through
Mar 03 22:56:24 <worried>       it will stop new techniques getting
publically disclosed etc
Mar 03 22:56:44 <worried>       because nonUS hackers dont want to give the
US gov ideas on how to hack non US countries
Mar 03 22:57:07 <Biff`> we're already in a cyber war.
Mar 03 22:57:23 <worried>       so i hope the fucking us gov cyber command
have good security researchers to find their own vulns and techniques
Mar 03 22:57:49 <worried>       cos their enemies wont post on the mailign
lsits if cities start getting blacked out by US gov
Mar 03 22:59:07 <Biff`> they do.
Mar 03 22:59:18 <worried>       oh have they hired hd moore?
Mar 03 23:00:13 <worried>       trust me the us gov rely on whats post to
the mailing lsits as much as everyone else
Mar 03 23:00:31 <female_>       we are in a cyber war? sheeeesh last night
we were in a trojan war
Mar 03 23:00:35 <worried>       and if they start attacking other nations
when the cyber command is built
Mar 03 23:00:49 <worried>       then non-us hackers will stop posting
to mailing lsits
Mar 03 23:01:06 <worried>       then the whole security community will fuck up
Mar 03 23:01:23 <Biff`> the cyber command is nothing new.
Mar 03 23:01:31 <worried>       it is
Mar 03 23:01:34 <Biff`> It is just a structural reorganization.
Mar 03 23:01:41 <worried>       its more than that
Mar 03 23:01:55 <worried>       this is about attacking nations
Mar 03 23:01:59 <Biff`> you actually think that everything they are
advertising isn't going on already?
Mar 03 23:02:31 <worried>       not on a big a scale as their planning
Mar 03 23:02:53 <worried>       60,000+ cyber command staff in a purpose
built cyber battle center
Mar 03 23:03:53 <worried>       these dorks will bring the end to the
security community as we know it the dumb asses
Mar 03 23:04:17 <worried>       nothing will get publically disclosed if
real cyber war breaks out
Mar 03 23:06:06 <Biff`> it's not going to be as big as you think.
Mar 03 23:06:24 <Biff`> It's going to put a lot of existing jobs and
stations under a central command.
Mar 03 23:07:20 <female_>       a strategic command?
Mar 03 23:07:57 <Biff`> yes.. US Strategic Command will be in the mix somewhere.
Mar 03 23:15:50 <worried>       how many real hackers out of the hundreds of
script kids will they hire
Mar 03 23:16:13 <worried>       there aint that many "elite" hackers out there
Mar 03 23:16:28 <Biff`> that's where defense contractors come in.
Mar 03 23:20:24 <worried>       what do you mean
Mar 03 23:23:00 <Biff`> a lot of talent consults for the government.
Mar 03 23:23:30 <worried>       a chinese defence contractor is going to
give hackers to us so the us can black out chinese infrastructure when
us get angry with china?
Mar 03 23:24:11 <Biff`> there are plenty of chinese foreign nationals
working for the US government.
Mar 03 23:29:36 <Biff`> I'm off to bed. Goodnight.
