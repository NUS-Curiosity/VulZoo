Hey Kern,

I like your level-headed approach, since my initial reaction is (and has been 
for some time) to string worried up with dental-floss until he reaches 
puberty.  Even though I disagree with you, I completely respect your approach 
and intelligent forethought.

Perhaps disagree is even a bit too strong... I agree with you in theory, but 
would submit that the lack of shroud between his "worried" and "n3td3v" 
identities would basically mitigate any cause for concern.  It's kind of like 
saying "Simple Nomad, even though you have been on CNN with you're real name 
I can't call you Mike." (or Mark?  CNN got it wrong ;)   sfirefinch was 
simply calling him by his other name as publicly listed here:

http://n3td3v.googlepages.com/home2

If you didn't know about that posting, reading a few of his FD shows me the 
link between identities.  

I am concerned that n3td3v, or worried, or xploitable, or whatever will get 
the impression that his self-gratifying tantrum makes an impact, furthering 
his abuse of people and lack of respect for others.  There is a problem to be 
addressed in this matter, but the majority of it must be placed on the 
adolescent with a chip on his shoulder.  

So I ask the question... did sfirefinch actually breach privacy?  or did 
worried?

Best Regards to you Kern,
@
