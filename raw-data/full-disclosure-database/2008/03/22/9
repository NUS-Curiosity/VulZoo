Subject: perl underground and tssci security

For those who do not know, perl underground has released the 5th edition of
their e-zine and it can be found here: http://milw0rm.com/papers/194

I would like to thank the perl underground editors for taking my suggestion
[1]
"how long did it take you to write all 40 lines of your 'labs' code? I shall
notify perl underground of your horrendous perl and you shalll be a source
of great lulz in their next production. " and publishing the crap code that
marcin and his company writes. I believe PU summarized it best when they
said:

"# TS/SCI security is a good example of some jerkoffs who want to put
themselves somewhere in the blog
# scene but don't have any content to back them up. So they say "let's put
up four or five really
# shitty scripts, in different languages, to show those blog-reading bitches
that we've got skillz,
# but we're going to be too lame to actually get it right or notice the
mistakes, and nobody will read
# our shit anyways so it's all good"
# Good thing we have talented people to poke fun at, otherwise we'd rip
apart every fucking piece of
# code you penisgrabbers had up there."

Well said PU. I also find it funny that these local projects are now "gone"
and the only stuff on the projects page is external links to other people's
work.
