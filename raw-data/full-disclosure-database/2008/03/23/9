Yes, and convenience is often the enemy of security.

However, with OpenID, all I have to do is figure out how to capture your 
credentials (which does not require that I compromise OpenID), and I can 
own everything that you own.  At least with the disparate systems we have 
now you only get those things where I've been foolish enough to use the 
same credentials.  Even then you have to figure out what those systems 
are.  With OpenID I simply try every site that uses OpenID, trivial to do 
programmatically.

There's a reason I don't use Paypal......

The problem is, I have to trust the OpenID provide to both secure his/her 
systems and hire trustworthy help.  I have to do the same locally, but I 
have a great deal more control and ability to monitor.

And that is a *huge* disadvantage.

Now, there is no doubt that we need better user education.  User *must* 
learn not to trust everything they get in email.  They must also learn to 
use good passwords and not reuse them on every site they visit.  There's 
also no doubt that some sites will do a lousy job of security and end up 
exposing a person's credentials (which is why you should use different 
credentials on every site.)

We also need some sites to do a better job of requiring strong passwords. 
(Some still require only alpha-numeric characters and two few maximum 
characters.)

But the idea that SSO makes sense outside the context of a single entity 
that controls its userbase is misbegotten, in my opinion.  The individual 
*user* should control their credentials, not some "foreign" entity, no 
matter how trustworthy they may claim to be.
