Subject: Re: OpenID. The future of authentication on the
	web?

Many of you have brought up that OpenID is vulnerable
to phishing and have highlighted weaknesses specific
traditional username/password authentication.

This was the main reason I bought up Information Cards
in my original post. I've noticed that Beemba
(http://www.beemba.com) and MyOpenID
(http://www.myopenid.com) have both implemented
Information Cards as an authentication option. 

Good idea?

It seems to me that if you were to rely on Information
Cards as opposed to username/password the phishing
angle is mitigated. Is this not the case?
