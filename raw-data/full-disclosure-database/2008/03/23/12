Beemba doesn't appear to have any online FAQ or help.  MyOpenID points to 
further information which leads to this:

"With OpenID, you don’t have to sign up and create a new account for 
each site that supports OpenID – you can just use the identity you 
already have. Hundreds of millions of OpenIDs already exist, and it is 
likely that you already have one from a service you use."

Nice to know that someone is creating identities for me without my 
knowledge.  With an ethical stance like that, why should I trust them to 
make my ID secure as well?

I don't see any information at all about Information Cards.  Perhaps you 
could provide a link?
