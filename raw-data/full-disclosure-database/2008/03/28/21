Throwaway1,
now that your first argumentative pillar succumbed, you dastardly hide

Convenient and biased interpretations! That's what your law
understanding seems to be all about.

That's it, study:

Let's try not to post off-topic (though relevant) stuff here anymore.


Kofi Annan sent you his best regards,
