Subject: The result why "pangolin is backdoor"

Pangolin really is a backdoor? Let's do this step to make sure:<p>1.Download UPX from upx.sf.net<p>2.In cmd shell, run "upx.exe -d pangolin.exe"<p>3.Upload the new pangolin.exe(actually the origin) to virustotal<p>4.Check the result again<p>I do these, and the result is:<p>http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/b9d55c751d5eed7b34cda3fe708b1bd7<p><p>We can see Kaspersky,Sophos,F-Secure,CAT-QuickHeal,F-Prot,Ikarus,AntiVir,Prevx1,TheHacker,Webwasher-Gateway will not alert any more.<p><p>You judge what is it! Or maybe we should think about what does these Antivirus do??? <p><p>Thanks ;)
