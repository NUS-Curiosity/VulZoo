Hey man, I think if you do not use the chinese email address and do not let anyone know you are chinese, there will be not so many worries, you know, chinese guy can became untrust more easily because they even do say "do not free the Tibet", what a strange thing, especially you are sharing an executable file.
 
OH, chinese man became more evil today.

Subject: [Full-disclosure] What's going on about Pangolin

I've just read the discussion from here, seriously, I don't know what's going on. I've coded it since 2005 and never release it until this year. And I really do not know why it be treated as a backdoor. 

If you think it is a backdoor, so please do a reverse engineering on it. You can capture the network packet, you can list all the strings in it, even you can hook APIs in it. Do anything you like to make sure whether it's backdoor or not. 

BTW, I packeted it through UPX to reduce the size. And some people focused on "http://www.nosec.org/web/index.txt", which is used in ORACLE injection mode when the target database is in intranet so we can use some store-procs to make the target to visit our website then we can receive the internet address that is mapped to outside. Anybody who is good at oracle injection should know this. 

Really, I wanna know why!!!
