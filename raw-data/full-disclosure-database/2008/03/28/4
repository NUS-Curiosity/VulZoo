You can stop right there M.B.
You claim there was no sense in evoking [sic] the UN's authorization of
1990?

That you appear to not understand what the words "Cease Fire" means is your
problem, not mine. Saddam had obligations and failed to meet them. Period.

Neither your understanding nor your approval is required.

Two points:
a) It's been my experience that people who claim to be speaking "real
truth" are generally as full of crap as a Christmas Goose. It's almost as
cliched and ridiculous as "speaking truth to power".
b) The notion that you would hold forth a man who was up to his neck in the
United Nations "Oil for Food" scandal as an arbiter of legality is absurd
to the point of surrealism. MC Escher himself would feel compelled to roll
his eyes and say; "Niggah Please".
