Subject: Massive IFRAME SEO Poisoning Attack Continuing

Following last week's, massive SEO poisoning combined with IFRAME
injections due to input validation flaws at sites with high pageranks,
these are the very latest high profile sites successfully injected
with IFRAMES forwarding to the rogue security software and Zlob
malware variants like the one in the previous campaigns are :

USAToday.com, ABCNews.com, News.com, Target.com, Packard Bell.com,
Walmart.com, Rediff.com, MiamiHerald.com, Bloomingdales.com,
PatentStorm.us, WebShots.com, Sears.com, Forbes.com, Ugo.com,
Bartleby.com, Linkedwords.com, Circuitcity.com, Allwords.com,
Blogdigger.com, Epinions.com, Buyersindex.com, Jcpenney.com,
Nakido.com, Uvm.edu, hobbes.nmsu.edu, jurist.law.pitt.edu,
boisestate.edu

And this is the latest assessment of the situation in terms of the
malware served and the domains/IPs involved :
