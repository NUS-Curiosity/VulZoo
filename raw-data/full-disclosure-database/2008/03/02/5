Synopsis
========

Audacity uses temporary files in an insecure manner, allowing for a
symlink attack.

Background
==========

Audacity is a free cross-platform audio editor.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/audacity     < 1.3.4-r1                   >= 1.3.4-r1

Description
===========

Viktor Griph reported that the "AudacityApp::OnInit()" method in file
src/AudacityApp.cpp does not handle temporary files properly.

Impact
======

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct symlink
attacks to delete arbitrary files and directories with the privileges
of the user running Audacity.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Audacity users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/audacity-1.3.4-r1"
