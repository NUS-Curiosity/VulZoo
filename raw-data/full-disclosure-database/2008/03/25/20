This list is about whatever I want it to be. You see any moderation 
around here?

Everything is political, my friend.

Get your head out of the sand, and let's do something about those 
murderous thugs called the Chinese government.

Did you forget Tiananmen square?

You seen how Falun Gong members are treated?

Did you forget that the Chinese have been attacking USA sites, gov't and 
commercial?

Well, I think it's time to do some more 'Full Disclosure' and start 
disclosing China's infrastructure weaknesses.
