Subject: Re: Free Tibet..

Please, I humbly think that you know possibly nothing about Tibet, the
province of China.

A lot of Chinese people, who used to take western medias as the
representation of good will and perhaps democracy, do feel sick of the
misleading news article pieces produced by such medias on this very
topic of Tibet. If all of your knowledge about the Tibet event comes
from such sources, just ignore them.
