Subject: Re: Free Tibet..

Maybe the relevance of this post is escaping me. Over the weekend, quite a 
few unread FD emails were purged to make the task of catching up a little 
more bearable...

But I'll bite. Regarding China, as they've been liberalizing their economy 
for nearly the last three decades, personal freedoms have gone up, with 
political liberties to follow suit soon enough. If anyone has read Milton 
Friedman's "Capitalism and Freedom," this makes sense. Economic freedom 
begets freedom in the broader sense, be it freedom of the press, freedom of 
religion, or political freedom.

There are enough Cold Warriors in the DoD who can make the case that China 
is our next near-peer military competitor (forget the whole Mutual Assured 
Destruction concept). Their motivation is primarily economic (divert funding 
for big weapons systems projects), as well as political (gaining power & 
influence with tales of the Sino Bogeyman).

Until a later time (next administration?), a grand Sino-American alliance 
will have to wait till politics catches up with Wall St (which has already 
embraced the idea that China is a strategic opportunity).
