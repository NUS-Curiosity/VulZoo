Jerome, I find it odd that you would tell someone to ignore a media
source and then not provide an alternative.

While there are plenty of reasons, and good reasons, to be suspicious of
western media, the facts speak for themselves.

- There was violence in Tibet and a lot of protesters died.

-  The Chinese government said they did send in security forces but they
didn't kill anyone and their forces weren't even armed.

-  Independent sources in Tibet, which are remarkably hard to find right
now, managed to get information out.

-  The Chinese government fesses up days letter and says yes they killed
people, and yes their security forces were armed.

Just what is it you were trying to refute with this post to the list?
