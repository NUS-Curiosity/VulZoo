Subject: Free Tibet..

..with purchase of one country of equal or greater value?

Seriously though, those cocksuckers in the Chinese gov't are at it
again... wait, they never stopped. Murderous freedom hating ways. Just
not right.

How about a bigger target than Scientology this time?

China's got the Olympics coming up, that makes them more sensitive than
usual.

The Dalai Lama can be as peaceful as he wants... more action is needed.
Alot more. Anyone want to pick a fight with the Chinese?
