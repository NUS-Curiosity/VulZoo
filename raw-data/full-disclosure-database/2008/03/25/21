No matter of what you think about Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong or Bratislava.

Unless you have a disclosure to make then don't make it.

Oh, Tibet is under Chinese military control.
Oh, Iraq is under US military control.
Oh, Eastern Jerusalem is an area of conflict.

If you against all odds should have the answer, then please tell us,

Or post at the political boards with all the others who doesn't have a clue.
