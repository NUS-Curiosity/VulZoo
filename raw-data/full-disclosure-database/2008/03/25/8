Subject: Re: Free Tibet..


Hi Jerome,

This is the only time I will participate in this thread.

We all know lots about Tibet and we all know that China invaded Tibet, a 
free country. The Dalai Lama is the true head of state of the Tibet 
government in exile. The Han should stop murdering the people of Tibet and 
leave them in peace.
