It's more of an academic point than anything.  Large companies and
widely recognizable names that have established reputations are more
likely to be taken at their word when they indicate an app they've put
out is a false positive.  

Individuals don't get the same level of social credit, and are more
likely to be put to the question and tested more stringently because
there is no pre-existing relationship with the end user, and thus less
trust and a host of other factors.

The reality, imnsho, is that all applications should be given high
levels of scrutiny by security minded people.  It certainly wasn't my
intent to pick on this particular application, but to make a point about
full disclosure in a much more general sense.
