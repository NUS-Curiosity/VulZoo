SANS hasn't admitted a breach occured yet and they've had 7 days to
come up with the wording.

I haven't seen Joel Esler, the guy who breached my privacy back on
duty yet, but i've seen him and Johannes Ullrich talking on the
internet storm center mentioning podcasts
http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=4202

Why are they announcing podcasts when both Joel Esler and Johannes
Ullrich have a privacy breach still to publically acknowledge and
apologize for?

Maybe they thought Full-Disclosure mailing list members wouldn't
notice if they pretend the incident didn't take place and tried to
sweep it under the carpet?

Johannes Ullrich, you told me you were investigating Joel Esler
internally, so please tell me the findings, so I can paste them onto
Full-Disclosure.
