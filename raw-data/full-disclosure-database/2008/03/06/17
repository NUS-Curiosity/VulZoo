Before we blow this off with a good laugh we should all remember the back 
doors in other network gear.  Even so-called "core equipment" (anyone 
remember the backdoor into the [Nortel] Shasta (later known as "BSN 5000")?

Assuming that any unaudited gear has a backdoor is just common sense.

What religion, please tell me, tells you as a follower of that religion
to occupy another country and kill its people? Please tell me. Does
Christianity tell its followers to do that? Judaism, for that matter?
Islam, for that matter? What prophet tells you to send 160,000 troops
to another country, kill men, women, and children? You just can't wear
your religion on your sleeve or just go to church. You should be
truthfully religious.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
