If your network is so congested that the difference between a min-sized TCP
packet and a min-sized UDP packet matters, you have *bigger* problems...

(In reality, most NICs will refuse to blat out a packet much smaller than
64 bytes or so - there was a number of info-disclosure issues with some
drivers that would try to send a 56 byte packet, and failed to zero out the
8 trailing bytes).
