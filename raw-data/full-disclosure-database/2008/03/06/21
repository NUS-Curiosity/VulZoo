Well it IS a new kid on the block, other systems have already had this 
problem reported.. It would certainly be more interesting if Vista 
wasn't vulnerable though :)

That said, according to the fwohci source in FreeBSD you have to 
explicitly enable this feature and the fwohci man page says it is 
mandatory for SBP. It would not be too difficult to disable it by 
default unless and SBP device is in use. Even in that case it is 
apparently possible to limit the access granted to a particular device 
(eg only allow it for the places you expect the device to write to).
