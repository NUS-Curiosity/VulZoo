Subject: Re: Firewire Attack on Windows Vista

>>Roger, you should note that Adam's "Hit by a Bus" paper includes
information about how Linux users can load their OS' Firewire driver in
a way that should disallow physical memory DMA access, and close this
attack vector. 

What are the implications for firewire device compatibility of doing
this?
