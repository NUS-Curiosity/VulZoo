Isn't it true that a TCP packet is typically 20 bytes, and a UDP packet
about 8? This is minus any additional data that has been added to the
packet. If this is true, then depending on the size of the pipe your sending
the data through, and the amount of congestion there might be, a UDP packet
would more easily and quickly hit its destination.
