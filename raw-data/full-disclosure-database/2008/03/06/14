Subject: Re: Chinese backdoors "hidden in router firmware"

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Quoting PC Pro article: "SecureTest believes spyware could be easily
built into Asian-manufactured devices such as switches and routers,
providing a simple backdoor for companies or governments in the Far East
to listen in on communications."

It seems someone in this security company read "Breakpoint", by Richard
A. Clarke, stole his thoughts and is making claims without any proof
products were actually backdoored just to gain some media attention.
