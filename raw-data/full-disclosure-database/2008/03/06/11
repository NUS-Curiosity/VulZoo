Greetings.

I agree, that the threat does not stop at firmware for routers and
switches.  Even with open source, or dare i type, even more so with open
source, the threat for maliciously modified code exists.  This is not a
new threat, per se, however, it is a growing threat which is fed by more
and more hardware being built/assembled/manufactured/what-have-you in
questionable countries/locations.

This is not isolated to the far east, though the far east is a perfectly
legitimate location for western users to NOT trust.  I would venture to
state that eastern users have already accepted that their products may
have gone 1984 on them.  It does not give me warm fuzzies that the way
the vast majority of production appears, at least one part of most
gizmos comes through the far east.

Without question, a security concern.
