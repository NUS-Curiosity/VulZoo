shut up coderman, this is actually a serious subject.

there was even a .mil report about it that i spammed to the list a not
long back :)

no one paid attention though:

http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=38713&dcn=todaysnews

this is actually a serious subject i wanted securityfocus to cover but
they ignored my e-mails!
i also contacted cnet news at the time and they ignored my e-mails.

pay attention to the security community next time!

we're telling you things we want you to put in your news articles to
send signals to the government but you ignore us.

what's the point of this mailing list being here if the media won't
work with the underground to send messages to the high ups in our
corrupt governments?

fuck the media! :)

Please can you publish this, America deserves to know how stupid Bush admin
 are.

OK, we already knew how stupid they are, but please publish this cnet
and securityfocus editors, its time to get the Bush admin and MI5 back
for spewing all that anti-China propaganda to the media recently.

Bush admin and MI5 are a bunch of incompetent bastards putting our
national security at risk, how dare they put national security at risk
by out sourcing its .mil software to the number 1 cyber enemy, CHINA.

The truth comes out in the end!!!

Its too LOL to be true.

PUBLISH PUBLISH PUBLISH!!!!!!! The American people deserve to know the
truth!!!!!!
