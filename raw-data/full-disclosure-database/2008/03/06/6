Greets.

It does not matter so much if there is no hard proof about the router
firmware containing backdoors set in place by Chinese manufacturers.
~From a security perspective, it is a potential threat which should be
addressed, especially for western networks and those they trust.

It is not too far fetched of an idea.  Google yielded the following
fairly quick: http://slashdot.org/articles/08/02/29/1642221.shtml

If you want to be inundated with reading material on the matter, be
creative, or not too creative, with Google searches having to do with
China and western powers and businesses, specific to information warfare.
