Subject: Re: Free Tibet..

I really do not want to be involved here, because this is a security list,
not Free tibet list.
However, I can not tolerate with this and I'm sick of it.

Just one question: how much do you know about Tibet?

A very good reference you can check

Btw: If you are really interested in this subject, you can start a new
maillist or project.

Thanks
Sowhat
