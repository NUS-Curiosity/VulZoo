Subject: Native American Indians Reassert Control Over
	Tribal Lands -- Re: Free Tibet..


BREAKING NEWS: Native American Indians Reassert Control Over Tribal 
Lands

Because the Native American Indians once possessed the land
that makes up the US, they have decided to reassert control
over those lands...blah..blah..blah, shit, hope the Romans
don't come back, we'll all be screwed then.

Point is China should get out. Tibet was doing fine without
China's blend of communist capitalism. China invaded through
force (yes, the US does this too, I'm not excusing that),
kidnapped the Panchen Lama (where is he anyway?), etc. There
is no free press so forgive those who think China is doing the
right thing -- they know not what they speak. Research what
China is doing in Darfur if you want more evidence.

But, this is a security list, so please protest in person, 
leak some .cn gov documents or do something useful -- you'll
just get flamed posting political rants.
