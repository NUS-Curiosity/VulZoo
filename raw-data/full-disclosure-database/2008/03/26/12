Thank you for your email - if more political postings containing 
"sensitive" keywords show up,
this might make it harder for those directly concerned to read our list.
Maybe the best thing to do would be to educate citizens of a certain 
country
living abroad about the filtering and especially the surveillance 
technology their government uses.
This way, they would know what to do so that their internet activities 
do not get totally restricted or used against them.
I've been thinking about memory sticks that contain desktop firewall 
software, OpenOffice (more secure than MS Office) and other applications 
as a giveaway to students, business people etc.
The only problem are:
- standalone cryptography software is illegal there
- p2p clients are *not* a secure option - as the recording industry's 
lawsuits show, it is rather easy to trace individual users downloading 
specific files.
What are your ideas?
Thank you very much in advance.
Yours sincerely,
Anja Hofmann
