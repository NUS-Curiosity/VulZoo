Hi Adam,
Nice to talking to you.
First, Please pull you head out of your *great education*. Have you
ever read Chinese history books(Note: This is not written by this
government but every dynasty)ï¼Ÿand how many have you read? and please
make clear who is "lack of knowlege".
"Tibet was invaded during the cultural revolution and has been captive
since"??
PL learn more Chinese history and then rave here.
Now I only want to say one words to you that is "I don't want to waste
my words on you".

Thanks
Mr.Rain
