Hey Jun,

Tibet was invaded during the cultural revolution and has been captive since.

Why don't you get an education, then cry foul rather than pin your  
lack of knoledge on anybody.

I live in Canada (PRC West)
I Had a Chinese National try to compare the running over of people  
with tanks to the fact that Americans can not just hop on a plain and  
visit cuba. He called them comparable human rights violations.

Let's add a bit of lead paint and pesticides to this little string too.

Please pull you head out of your government arse, and read news and  
history from outside China. O you can't,,, Never mind.

Will some one post a link to the film Red Violin for this guy their is  
a good part about the cultural revolution during the time China  
invaded Tibet.

I will agree this is a security list and I sift thru enough crap posted here.

Thanks, and FREE TIBET!!!!

PRC Communist, BAD

Tibet peace loving Theocracy Not As Bad
