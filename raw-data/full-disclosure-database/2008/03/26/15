Jun, Jun, Jun,

If your going to go back that far your going to have to redraw many  
lines on the globe. Or is the PRC a special case?

Let's pick a place in recent history as starting point. I'm sure that  
you will find that the PRC is still bad and has no right to hold any  
country captive.

The PRC has improved the quality of life in Tibet since the invasion  
but that is not to say the Dali Lama would not have made the same  
advancements in the same time frames.

The population in the Tibetan region went down from 1953 to 1964 based  
on the PRCs own Census numbers by about 300,000. Kind of makes one go  
Hummm?? Eh?

Then again Mao and the PRC had outlawed most things western while  
rewriting and reshaping the history of China to support it's claim on  
territories throughout the region.

Nope I don't have access, or the ability to read chinese text. You  
have not read them either unless you have access to the original  
parchments.

The PRC has controll of all media you have available to read, see, or  
hear. The truth according to Mao and the PRC party line.

"> PL learn more Chinese history and then rave here." Ditto Buddy, you  
need to realize that you are kept in the dark and feed nothing but  
Bull Shit that supports the PRC party line.

I have no more words for you either. The more you post the more you  
look like a puppet of the PRC.

Good day to you sir!
