Hi!

This is obviously a problem either with Comcasts injecting noise packets or Verizon or a carrier that carries the VOIP call.  This is prevalent with others who subscribe to your service.

 From my experiences with audio recording/speech processing and internet 
telephone applications, there can be a lot of reasons for static apart 
from DoS attacks.
First I would check whether your computer and its audio equipment are 
working properly:
- Do you use simple headsets for making calls? (cheap headsets = bad 
audio quality)
- Are any mobile phones or other wireless devices near your computer 
which could cause interferences?
- Do you have any other applications running in the background that 
access your sound card?
    (For example turning down  internet radio  / mp3 clients while 
making a phone call?)
Concerning your ISP, some ISPs ban P2P applications and some VoIP 
clients are P2P-based. So I would check whether there have been any 
changes to the Terms of Service recently.
Here are some links I found while searching for "VoIP trouble shoot":

Have a nice day!
