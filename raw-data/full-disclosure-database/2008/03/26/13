Missile Heads? Good God... 
You sound almost as stupid as that idiot who called
Tibet a province of China.

Short of global thermonuclear war, nothing is going to change in Tibet in
our lifetimes; and there is nothing the people reading this list can do
about that.

And I want the 3 minutes back that I wasted responding to this stupid
thread, which has NOTHING to do with technology of any kind. There's
nothing anyone can do about THAT either.
