Well . . . worried DOES have a good point . . . I think SANS dropped the
ball on that, BUT I don't know if this is going to be a "media event".
I have had a little dealing with various handlers  (the few I have talked to
seemed nice enough).  But this is common; an employee using a written policy
to basically do something unethical.
The "spirit" of the notice is to protect the identity of the submitter, the
"letter" is regarding the use of the submission form.

SANS has based its value on intelligence gathering.  They unify
an unwieldy field of study (Internet, and computer security).  By trying to
undermine SANS on IRC, worried created a hostile environment to resolve a
perfectly legitimate problem.

You have to use logic, not flame bait.
