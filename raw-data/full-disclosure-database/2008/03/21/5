Interesting.  SQLite is a great piece of software, but it's not very
close to SQL, viz:

sqlite> SELECT 1 = '1';
0
sqlite> 

I wonder how the WebKit folks will bridge this gap, or if the people
behind HTML5 will standardize on whatever SQLite implements.

I'm also a bit surprised that the Javascript folks are suddenly expected
to write their programs in continuation-passing style, without much
syntactic support from the language.  It's like pre-generics Java
typing, but this time for flow control constructs.  Oh well.

What's the alternative?  A combinator library?  A language extension
that only permits static query strings?  String interpolation as
structured objects?  Most approaches require a new Ecmascript revision.
