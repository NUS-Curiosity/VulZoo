[15:49] * Now talking in ##kiddiots
[15:55] <worried> someone actually asked for me? you mean I made a friend
[15:55] <h4x0r> yes worried, I believe your expertise
[15:56] <worried> h4x0r, I am the leetest on the planet
[15:57] <h4x0r> worried, I knew this the moment you /j #kiddiots
[15:57] <kindergartn3r> you rawk!
[15:58] <worried> where there is a will there is a way
[15:58] <worried> i have so much to offer the security industry
[15:58] <kindergartn3r> heh, I said that the minute you stated you wouldn't work for a living
[15:58] <worried> kinder: that's right although I love security I would never make a living from it
[15:59] <worried> I plan on staying in my mom's basement forever and pzwning the world
[15:59] <kindergartn3r> oh yeah?
[16:00] <worried> yup and I will make it a point to never be useful on full disclosure
[16:01] <kindergartn3r> I'm with you in turning full disclosure into fool disclosure
[16:01] <worried> thats good
[16:02] <worried> any idea how I can sound a bit 31337'er?
[16:02] <kindergartn3r> XSS
[16:03] <worried> I invented XSS its old news
[16:03] <worried> in fact little do people know but I created the template for RFC's 1-5000
[16:04] <worried> it was fun

[16:04] <worried> besides my mom doesn't like people knocking on the door
[16:04] <kindergartn3r> what do you do when you need to get laid?
[16:08] <worried> your intelligence is lacking. I suggest you google RFC12692
[16:09] <kindergartn3r> you're the bestest mostest security ninjaest in the world
[16:09] <worried> damn right I am
[16:11] <worried> now that you've admitted this, I will post it to FD as proof of being the bestest
[16:12] <kindergartn3r> just omit the part when you did that little thing to me in your basement?
