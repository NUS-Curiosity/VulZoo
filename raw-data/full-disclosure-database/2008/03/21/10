Its not just about the one line at http://isc.sans.org/contact.html
that says "All submissions are kept confidential. Your submission will
reach all ISC handlers. Your e-mail address will only be used to reply
to your submission."

There is a whole privacy document that's supposed to protect me at
http://www.sans.org/privacy.php

"This privacy statement applies to information collected by web
addresses in the sans.org, sans.edu, giac.org, and other domains owned
and operated by SANS, GIAC, and the Escal Institute, hereafter
referred to collectively as SANS."

His argument that I should have used the form when handlers@...s.org
is at the bottom of the http://isc.sans.org

"(c) 2000-2008 The SANSâ„¢ Institute
SANS Web Privacy Policy: www.sans.org/privacy.php - Web Contact:
handlers@...s.org
report bugs please include debug info (opens new window)
Policy On SANS Trademark Usage"

I didn't bypass anything, the e-mail address I used is at the bottom
of their internet storm center, so what he said was complete bullshit.

My e-mails sent straight to handlers@...s.org is still supposed to be
covered by http://www.sans.org/privacy.php

I will never send intelligence to them again, and I hope this goes out
as a warning to any other underground folks that they don't take their
privacy document seriously.

How can they run a successful intelligence operation at sans if their
informants can't trust them to respect their privacy?

All the best with your intelligence operations sans, hope you are
giving away more e-mails on irc soon!!!

You have just fucked with a major player in the underground with the
biggest google group around of over 4164 members and counting.

The person in question who done this made fun of the wrong person, I
don't take privacy violations likely.
