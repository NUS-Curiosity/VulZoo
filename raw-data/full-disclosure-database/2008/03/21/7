To sum it all up nicely:

Bozo with incredibly inflated sense of self-worth waits with bated breath for 
the world's media to pick up a story that no one but himself would ever care 
about.

News at 11.  Meanwhile, Britney Spears was spotted entering a grocery store in 
West Hollywood with kid in tow........
