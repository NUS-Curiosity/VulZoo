Subject: Wired.com and History.com Getting RBN-ed

Monitoring last week's IFRAME injection attack at high page rank-ed
sites, reveals a simple truth, that persistent simplicity seems to
work. The attack is still ongoing, this time successfully injecting a
multitude of new domains into Wired Magazine, and History.com's search
engines, which are again caching anything submitted, particularly not
validated input to have the malicious parties in the face of the RBN
introducing a new malware, in between the pharmaceutical scams that
they serve on the basis of an affiliation model.
