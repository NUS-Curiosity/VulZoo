Nice find ! But do you realize that this is public since July 07 ?
If not, you may want to read this:

http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=589
and this
http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/4455

All you had to do was add as many "\" as you want at the beginning 
of the filename string. (i.e "\../../../pwn3d.exe")

Also, to overwrite existing files, try to break the connection 
before the final "\xfe", the program will create a notepad2.exe, 
but then it will delete the real notepad.exe. After that, all you have 
to do is loop again to re-create the file with your own content.

I assume you contacted the vendor before disclosing this ?
