Larry,

Are you familiar with ICE or JTAG debugging hardware?
ieee1394 is implemented by default in such a fashion that a ieee1394 port 
can basically be used as a hardware debugger to memory. i.e. any ieee1394 
device can poke/peek the entire _physical memory space_ of any other 
device on the bus.  With that capability you can do anything that could 
be accomplished from the internals of the operating system.

The essential flaw here is that current SBP-2 drivers do not set up a 
proper virtual memory map between the firewire chipset and the host, and 
just expose the entire host's physical address space.  Fixing this 
requires reimplementing a good deal of design and buffering for the SBP-2 
(that's the firewire SCSI block protocol) drivers.

I however, don't know enough about windows drivers and disk access to 
elaborate from there about how hard that will be to fix in the windows 
world.

What people seem to be missing is that this condition is *fixable*, but 
the real impetus may not be there outside of folks from the Trusted 
Computing crowd etc etc.

What points are you trying to stab at for an article?
