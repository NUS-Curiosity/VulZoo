Yeah, I made specific reference to that attack in my message. There's a
big difference between sleep mode and hibernate mode. In hibernate the
system is powered off. Even if the memory has some residual charge I'm
sure it's far less reliable than with sleep. 

Everything I've seen in descriptions of that attack tells me they are
unfairly conflating sleep and hibernate.
