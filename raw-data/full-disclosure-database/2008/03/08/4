Uh... yeah.  So how again does drive encryption help you against this
attack?  Certain forms of 2-factor auth might help you, but all of the
kinds I've seen would still rely on encryption keys in memory to encrypt
any sensitive data on the drive, not to mention the fact that writing to
memory would still bypass that auth.  The funniest is using hibernate...

Once again MS treats a security issue as a PR issue.

How exactly is the Linux solution inferior?  Not just trying to defend
Linux and attack Windows here, but really I don't see how this statement
is true, so you must not understand how it works.  By disabling DMA,
you're just disabling it for that one driver, not all drivers.  In
addition, you can load/unload driver modules at run-time typically.

That would be interesting to find out.  Please do tell if you figure out
how this can be done.

Ok, so they concede it is possible to limit the DMA accesses to specific
(safe) ranges.  I wonder which devices cannot be restricted...

> How much should the average user worry about this? Not very much.

Yeah, I agree it's probably not a big risk right now.  That may change
over time though, as more and more small devices become very
programmable.  You can already hack Linux onto your iPod, which makes a
great cover for casually compromizing machines in an office environment.
The number of small devices which would normally seem benign to end
users, but are capable of being quite evil, will only increas over time.

Good luck with your article,
tim
