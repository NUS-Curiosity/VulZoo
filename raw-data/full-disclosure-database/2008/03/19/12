Subject: Re: agile hacking?

reepex,

you are the only one backing up troth, read on all comments... I don't
bash people. I encourage them and this is present in all my work and
the work behind the GNUCITIZEN umbrella. Not I, but the crowd hanged
him, as well they will hang you for your arrogant, egocentric, foolish
and rather juvenile behavior. I personally don't care about you, nor I
care if you like the work on GNUCITIZEN or even my work. In my eyes
and the eyes of others you follow very basic parasitic social pattern:
making a name for yourself not based on your knowledge but based on
your arrogant, bottomless comments.

You don't lead by example! You are a parasite, a vampire, sucking
blood and energy from those around you. I hardly doubt that anyone can
consider you as a friend or even appreciate your skills and knowledge
when you are nothing more but a vulture.

Comparing the Agile Hacking project with books such as "How to Own a
Continent" (by FX, Paul Craig, Joe Grand, and Tim Mullen...), "How to
Own the Box" (by Ryan Russell, Ido Dubrawsky, FX, and Joe Grand...),
"How to Own a Shadow" (by Johnny Long, Tim Mullen, and Ryan
Russell...), "The Art of Intrusion" (by Kevin D. Mitnick, and William
L. Simon..) and the "Hacking Exposed" series (by some of the most
recognized information security experts such as, but not only, Johnny
Cache, Chris Davis, Stuart McClure, Joel Scambray, Andrew Vladimirov,
Brian Hatch, David Endler...), is nothing but a flattering comment. I
hope that this project achieves and even superseeds their success.
These are some of my favorite books and I have a great respect for
their authors.

You and all others who support your dieing cause and who have
repeatedly attacked what we have build from scratch with far too many
sacrifaces, can laugh now but the simple fact is that you will never
even come close to what we have already achieved and gave to this
community. You and all other Full-disclosure trolls proved to be
untrustworthy, unworthy even creatures. I hope that your real
identities stay well hidden behind your nicknames as I highly doubt
that you will succeed in life. If I were in your place I would have
reconsidered my values. Your and the other trolls comments are not
satire but idiocracy as a fellow GNUCITIZEN reader have pointed out.

Kind Regards,
pdp

founder of GNUCITIZEN, information security research, penetration
tester, life hacker, co-author of two best-selling books, author of
numerous printed publications and online media outlets, active speaker
and opinion former, hacker culture evangelist, founder of Hakiri,
entrepreneur, lecturer, etc...

I am far behind the people I look after for inspiration and guidance
but I am well ahead of you.
