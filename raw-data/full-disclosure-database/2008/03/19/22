Actually attempting to submit the book to a publisher would probably
not work because they're publishing to make money. How can you make
money off a bunch of people noone knows or gives a shit about? The
publisher isn't going to be technically capable of researching every-
thing the book claims unless it's old news. So, because you've got a
ton of random people contributing that don't necessarily have any
valid credentials the publisher isn't going to be confident releasing
material they can't substantially verify. Hell, if I were a contributor
they'd probably burn the manuscript.

If you publish the book "open source" online, you're just another
Phrack knock-off.

Either way, it's been done.
