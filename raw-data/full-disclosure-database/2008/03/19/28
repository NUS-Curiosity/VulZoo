 You are very dense. All the people posting bad about thoth have not seen
his work either. They are mindless sheep following your bad example. Have
you looked at his VMX slides yet?

Listing the authors does not make a book good.  Have you read any of the
books? Hacking exposed is a collection of lame/outdated/fixed techniques
such as Ping of Death. Lets take a look at the table of contents for hacking
exposed edition 5.

Chapter 1: Footprinting ( lol )
Chapter 2: Scanning ( with no mention of how it works only tools )
Chapter 3: Enumeration
Chapter 4: "Hacking" Windows
Chapter 5: "Hacking" Unix

All these chapters do is tell you how to run a bunch of tools looking for
the first outdated service so that you can run a public exploit against it.
If you  want your book to be in the great line of kiddie manuscripts then
you are well on your way.
