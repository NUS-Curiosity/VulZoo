Subject: Re: [full disclosure] agile hacking?

I don't disagree at all with any of your post except the part that no one
has done this before. I think there are tons of communities online that
share information and maybe even document it on a website, from forums to
wikis to expert-exchange type places to exploit archives to mailing list
mirrors to community-driven blogs... or as mentioned, Google as the index.
You might be able to achieve the same thing as original content by taking a
particular subject and the entry on it being just links to 10 other great
resources that cover it well.

By no means am I discouraging the effort, however! Keep us posted on where
to go for more info, even if we're just going to lurk in the shadow and
watch from afar.
