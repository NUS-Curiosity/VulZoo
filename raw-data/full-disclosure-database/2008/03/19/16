If you mind ... please shut up.

If you are worried about the botnet do something ... the easiest thing is to 
shutdown the CC boxes. If you can't ... like me for example find someone who 
can.

Botnets can and are shut down without prior notion to anyone. The notion is 
needed for coordination ...
