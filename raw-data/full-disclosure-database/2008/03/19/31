the target is the distributed hash table routing metric used for
decentralized C&C.  kademlia, chord, and DHT's in general are fragile;
they trade efficiency for resilience against a coordinated attacker,
presuming the redundancy adequate for random (read: not intentional)
failure is sufficient.

if you want to take down storm, take down the C&C.  it will cost you
$100/mo for a dedicated server with modest bandwidth.  implemented the
attack is left as an exercise for the reader...

:P
