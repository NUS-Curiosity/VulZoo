Subject: Re: agile hacking?

I see thoth responded negatively to your project and again you assume that
if someone bashes you that he/she has no skill and is just trolling. This
means you obviously were not as his kiwicon talk or read the slides ( not
that you would understand them )  but it shows how arrogant you are.

you are just another sad leader who has amassed a following of idiots and
when someone speaks out against you act all high and mighty when really they
are better than you.

I also think its funny that you say how its a 'community project' and that
you are uniting all these people together when in truth its a bunch of
clueless kiddies ( I am sure you will get a great article from the kid who
will 'create b0f overfl0wz' as he put it) who follow you while people 'with
a clue' know you are a joke.

Either way if this book somehow gets published it will be another laughing
stock like the rest of your published work.
