cyber crime is now bigger than the global illegal drugs trade, so you
can see why russia don't want to surrender storm worm / rbn easily.

"McAfee CEO David DeWalt says cyber-crime has become a US$105 billion
business that now surpasses the value of the illegal drug trade
worldwide." ---2007

"Global cybercrime turned over more money than drug trafficking last
year, according to a US Treasury advisor. Valerie McNiven, an advisor
to the US government on cybercrime, claimed1 that corporate espionage,
child pornography, stock manipulation, phishing fraud and copyright
offences cause more financial harm than the trade in illegal narcotics
such as heroin and cocaine.

"Last year was the first year that proceeds from cybercrime were
greater than proceeds from the sale of illegal drugs, and that was, I
believe, over $105bn," McNiven told Reuters. "Cybercrime is moving at
such a high speed that law enforcement cannot catch up with it."" ---

"'The right people now know who the Storm worm authors are,'
Alperovitch said. 'It's incredibly hard because a lot of the FSB
leadership and Putin himself originate from there, where there are a
great deal of people with connections in high places.'""

so as you can see this is an extremely complex situation that can only
be solved by getting folks at white house level involved in my
opinion.

for sure though this cyber crime trade is having an affect on the
US/UK economy, and the russian government and its crime lords are
sucking us dry through the back door via the internet, while also
their storm worm and russian business network has the added
capabilities of DDoS attack if ever needed.

and you wonder why US/UK economy is heading towards a full blown
recession? maybe the problem in part is due to american and british
money getting transferred illegally into russian bank accounts by the
day via storm worm and russian business network ventures.

the russian economy is thriving while americas and the british economy
is heading towards recession.

we've got to fix the leak and plug this up, so more of our money isn't
going out of the western economy and straight into the hands of the
russians via cyber crime.

the russians were very clever and much faster than us to realise the
huge revenue to be made out of cyber crime and how easy it is to
channel money out of the hands of western citizens, a lot of the time
without them noticing via phishing attacks.

if you think this is oh just phishing! who cares! think not, this is a
multi billion dollar racket thats within a government's interest to
protect and help thrive.

welcome to russia, your money is being taken out of your hands high-tech styley.

like i say, this needs white house level intervention, because this is
far bigger than any us normal guys in the security community can
solve. the folks behind this have big guns, big politics and big
leaders supporting it. us guys behind our computers can't do shit, not
underground folks, not the professional cyber security circuit.

this is an SOS to the white house (and perhaps whitehall) to help us.

all the best.
