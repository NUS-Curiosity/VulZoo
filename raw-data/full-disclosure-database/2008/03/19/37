Synopsis
========

Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been reported in
OpenLDAP.

Background
==========

OpenLDAP Software is an open source implementation of the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-nds/openldap      < 2.3.41                          >= 2.3.41

Description
===========

The following errors have been discovered in OpenLDAP:

* Tony Blake discovered an error which exists within the
  normalisation of "objectClasses" (CVE-2007-5707).

* Thomas Sesselmann reported that, when running as a proxy-caching
  server the "add_filter_attrs()" function in
  servers/slapd/overlay/pcache.c does not correctly NULL terminate
  "new_attrs" (CVE-2007-5708).

* A double-free bug exists in attrs_free() in the file
  servers/slapd/back-bdb/modrdn.c, which was discovered by Jonathan
  Clarke (CVE-2008-0658).

Impact
======

A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Serivce by sending a malformed
"objectClasses" attribute, and via unknown vectors that prevent the
"new_attrs" array from being NULL terminated, and via a modrdn
operation with a NOOP (LDAP_X_NO_OPERATION) control.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenLDAP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-nds/openldap-2.3.41"
