Michael,

I have no clue how it will go. However, just because no one has done
it and there are too many IFs, it does not mean that we should not
approach this problem. If we manage to find a way to crowdsource all
the information in a timely manner, keep up-to-date with the latest
and be at the time as agile as possible, heck, I don't think that
we've wasted our time. We could even come up with a better system for
managing information different from Wikis, forums, blogs, etc. But
that's part of the challenge and the fun. How can you justify being
called a hacker when we cannot resolve a problem like this one? As I
said, for all of us the gain is more then the lost.

100 people 2 short posts = 200 posts. I can post two things in a
single day. Can you? I think it is a good start. But this is a
community project and without a community it wont work.
