I don't consider myself a 'kiddie' and I've considered contributing to it.
I feel like the old adage of blowing out someone elses flame to make yours
burn brighter applies here.  Reepex, I didn't get a chance to see your
presentation at kiwicon, bit to expensive for an American on a tight budget
to get out there, but if you have a link, I'd love to have a look.  We've
talked before, so I assume the presentation is good since I know you know
your stuff; however, I've also seen some cool stuff come out of PDP and
Gnucitizen... why the need to bash?

Web app hacking may not be the coolest topic in the world to yourself and
many others, but it is something that a lot of companies are concerned with
these days, and with some of the web app attack vectors being used to deploy
other attacks, the lines between these and the risks they present starts to
blur.  I think we've had the web app attack vectors are/aren't a technical
exploit on this forum too many times.

Just my 2 cents for what it's worth.

Nate
