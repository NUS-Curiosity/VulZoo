amen!

the first and last are two of my favorites.  this discussion mirrors
the tension between programmers steeped in the physical architecture
they use and complicated but indispensable concepts like asm
instr/pointers and  (some of) the newer generation familiar only with
high level scripting languages and toolkits that abstract away all
such details.

while the latter can be effective and appropriate for a myriad of
modern development tasks, there is still a world of understanding that
will never be accessible at such higher layers.

there is no point in arguing which is better; these are complementary
skills that the truly proficient will master at both ends of the
spectrum.  this way leads to wisdom.

as for "hacking" tool set tutorials (howto kismet, wireshark,
metasploit, etc), these texts are as satisfying as a dir full of man
pages.  useful references, yes.  fundamentally instructive in theory
they are not.

to each his own...


[i'll add 'Silence on the Wire' to this list of useful texts]
