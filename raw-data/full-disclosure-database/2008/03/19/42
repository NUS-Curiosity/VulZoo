Synopsis
========

Multiple security issues have been reported in ViewVC, which can be
exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions.

Background
==========

ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control
repositories.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/viewvc       < 1.05                              >= 1.05

Description
===========

Multiple unspecified errors were reportedly fixed by the ViewVC
development team.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted URL to the server to
list CVS or SVN commits on "all-forbidden" files, access hidden CVSROOT
folders, and view restricted content via the revision view, the log
history, or the diff view.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ViewVC users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/viewvc-1.05"

==========
