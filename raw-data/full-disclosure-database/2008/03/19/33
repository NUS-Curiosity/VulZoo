note that the encryption based partitioning in storm 2.0 for
segregated C&C is a layer above the DHT routing infrastructure over
which these C&C messages are delivered.

you don't need to attack the shared secret keys, nor the C&C message
payloads, merely the DHT transport required for C&C to function.

protections are implemented :P ]
