I did not give the talk, thoth did. The reason I brought it up is because of
http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/agile-hacking/#comment-116766

background which must be some strange complex where people think anyone who
disagrees with them is inferior.

Yes and we agreed web hacking has its place... the point I made was that you
cannot write 'the best hacking manual ever made' as pdp is touting it while
only covering web hacking and running combinations of different tools such
as kismet/tcpdump that pdp mentined as an example.
