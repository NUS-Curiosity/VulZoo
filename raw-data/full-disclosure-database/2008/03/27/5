Actually, dummy...
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August of 1990 led to a United Nations
authorization to remove Saddam's forces from Kuwait. This military action
was carried mainly by the Americans for entirely practical reasons. The
United Nations halted hostilities and declared that a ceasefire would be in
effect as long as Saddam cooperated fully with United Nations Inspectors
who were looking for an extensive list of banned weapons, which included
but was by no means limited to; chemical, biological and
nuclear/radiological weapons.
After over a decade of continual failure to cooperate, the American
political leadership decided that they could no longer take the same
patient approach that they had taken for the previous 12 years; and resumed
hostilities. After invading Iraq and removing Saddam, American forces
searched for the aforementioned list of banned weapons, and while they
found most of them they did not find stockpiles of weaponized biologicals,
final stage chemicals or nuclear/radiologicals. Whether you believe this is
because Saddam didn't possess them at the time of the invasion or that he
simply did a better job of hiding them than the American's did of looking
for them doesn't change the facts. Nor does your opinion of the current
American administration or your opinion of their actions.

However, the most disturbing part of your post was not that you
demonstrated your ignorance once again... That is basically; your job here.

No, the disturbing part of your asinine post was that you made Saddam's
murderous Ba'athist thugs the moral equivalent of the Free Tibetan People.

THAT needed to be answered, or I would have ignore this post as I
ordinarily do to ALL of your posts.
