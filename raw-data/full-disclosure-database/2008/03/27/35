Subject: Re: Free Iraq

Tempting to give a soap-box response, I'll attempt to give this thread a 
graceful exit by saying that I believe the strategic course I've described 
previously is do-able and a welcomed evolution of the US "maintain the 
superpower status quo" vision that so many in power have. The obstacles 
mentioned can be overcome (less painfully than US troops are currently 
experiencing in Iraq). Currently, our choices are: Iraq-style invasion and 
messy/expensive/painful aftermath OR strategic isolationism (where 
intervention is completely shunned). I've proposed an alternate vision that 
is neither of those.

Whether you agree or disagree, it is a broad strategic approach that I 
espouse, not an emotional or reactionary course of action. Security guru 
Bruce Scheier recently blogged about a security mindset 
(http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html) 
(how's that for an IT security tie-in?). I propose that we (and certainly 
our political luminaries) have a "strategic mindset" in this flatter and 
more globalized world that we live in.
