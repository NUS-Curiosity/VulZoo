The idea behind the United Nations was that of collective security,
where basically if one nation steps out of line all the other
countries respond accordingly. The UN's preferred form of response is
that of a resolution, which is basically a statement made by members
of the UN.

The problem is that these resolutions cannot be enforced by the UN,
and can only be effective if nations choose to act according to those
resolutions of their own free will. Rogue nations prevent this
effectiveness of the UN.

You're citing one example of corruption in the UN. Everywhere you go
there will be some degree of corruption, it's human nature. You can't
assume that the entire UN is corrupt based on one example.
