Subject: Re: The reason why "Pangolin is backdoor"

All right, the language is a big problem ;(
First, about pdf_poc.pdf, sure it is, click here, it is just a POC : http://www.nosec.org/web/index.php?q=node/63

And about zps.exe, pls click here, it is a port scanner, a 8k tool you guys think it is a backdoor? Come on :
http://www.nosec.org/web/index.php?q=zps

And the Demon, pls click here, it is a dns digger, so of cource it'll use DNSQUERYA function:
http://www.nosec.org/web/index.php?q=demon

Anything else? My working is about security, so no wonder anything is about security...... Good luck.

Right, and what about all the other crapware on your "resourceful" site?

Just do it yourself pls, using the "backdoored" pangolin.exe you think and
decompress it, then upload to virustotal, I did not change any bits ;)
