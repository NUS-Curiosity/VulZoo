Subject: Re: Free Iraq

Not commenting on the perceived misunderstanding, but I'll post a couple 
thoughts...

One, I disagree with the "rogueness" of the US (beyond that, the debate is 
semantics, methinks). Having said that, I'm not particularly fond of the 
current administration and I hope the next president expresses greater 
desire toward diplomacy and engagement internationally.

Cuba embargo:
I agree. It's stupid and unncessary. It constricts our ability to expand 
economic connectivity to Cubans (in addition to the restrictions within Cuba 
that are imposed by the socialist regime) at no strategic gain. I hope the 
next administration phases out the embargo that, obviously, has not been 
effective.

I'm sorry, but I think you misunderstood part of my post.
What I meant was that the USA is a rogue nation, just like other
so-called "rogue nations," and is causing the UN to lose its
effectiveness.

I don't doubt that what the USA has done to Cuba is pointless,
ineffective, and strategically wrong.
