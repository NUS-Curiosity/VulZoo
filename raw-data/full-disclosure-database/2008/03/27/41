Iraq war strategic disaster

THE IRAQ WAR is five years old and except for members of the President
George Bush administration, there is little doubt elsewhere that it is
a moral and strategic disaster for the United States.

But what has not yet been fully recognised is that it has also been an
economic disaster.
