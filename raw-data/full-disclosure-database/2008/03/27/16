Legal immigration is voluntary, not an "invasion." Further, countries that 
are able to absorb immigration (like the United States) have benefited in 
the aggregate economic sense.

Contrast that with France. France has had some level of success with 
immigrants... but not much. The car burnings and riots are primarily a 
result of people feeling excluded and unable to find jobs. Yes, "it's the 
economy, stupid!" (not calling you stupid, just borrowing the phrase). If 
the French economy were more dynamic and its labor laws less constricting, 
the unemployed would likely have less trouble finding jobs and being 
productive members of society. Instead, they fester in boredom and 
frustration. Security and economics are not unrelated, and this is but one 
example of that relationship.
