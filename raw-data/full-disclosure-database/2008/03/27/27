A thoughtful reply was posed to my address rather than the list. I'll keep 
the sender anonymous & post my reply since others have posed similar 
concerns:


Excellent point. Initially, a "puppet regime" would be in place to run the 
country on a day to day basis. Actually, I'm more concerned about the 
pertinent country's 1) access to the global economy as well as 2) security. 
Point 2 is obvious enough, so I'll focus on point 1.

Simply stated, countries that have or are moving in the direction of broad 
economic integration with the rest of the world (i.e., that are or are 
becoming more "globalized," to use the vogue term) tend to be more moderate 
in their ideologies, better (or getting better) in their governance and 
governmental transparency, and more economically productive. On that last 
point, I'll take keeping people busy with jobs over the prospect of millions 
of "idle hands."

Economics binds people together, even if they're of disparate cultures and 
beliefs, and gives them a means of constructive, non-violent engagement with 
each other. It leads to idea-sharing that would otherwise be difficult and 
discouraged. It leads to distribution of power away from the central 
government, as people compete constructively in the private sector rather 
than just politically in the halls of power. Oh, and it also increases 
aggregate prosperity in the region, and by extension, across the globe.

Globalization is the answer to Salafist (Sunni extremist)-borne terrorism in 
the long run (or any terrorist ideological movement), as alternate view 
points dilute local/regional extremism and, pragmatically, give people other 
things to do. The same effect occurs in rogue regimes, assuming we (or 
someone) is able to "persuade" the heads of state in those regimes to allow 
exterior connectivity.

The strategic vision that I'm suggesting is that we use our global power 
projection as the initial phase in taking out stubborn regimes. That's a 
small part of the picture, but still a necessary piece.
