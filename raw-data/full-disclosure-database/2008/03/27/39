Sorry to inject some real truth here, guys. 
  
1. Tibet. 
According to Patrick French, a former director of 'Free Tibet Campaign' in London, there is no evidence in Dharamsala about the '1.2 million Tibetan genocide'. (See his Op-Ed piece in the New York Times, March 22, 2008.) 
  
2. Iraq. 
Yes, the UN did sanction the first American campaign against Saddam Hussein. But not the 2003 one. As a matter of fact, the then UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan termed the invasion 'illegal'. 
  
Now, guys, you could resume rehashing the old lies, putting forth partial truth, or inventing new myths.
