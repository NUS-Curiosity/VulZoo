are you telling me RBN isn't protected by FSB? *a government*

RBN and FSB have no political motivation to make an online attack look
like its coming from China just for the sake of tricking the public
into thinking China is a major online threat to society.

however, western super powers do.

whoever is behind this wanted more than gaming passwords, they wanted
the attack highly investigated and known about, we can only speculate
why.

i looked at the bloggers picture and thought *i don't trust this guy,
hes got that look about him*.
