Subject: Re: Is yahoo.com serving malware? [Was: More High
	Profile Sites IFRAME Injected]

*.adrevolver.com is part of the BlueLithium network, which is "a premier
behavioral targeting ad network" which was acquired by Yahoo in mid-2007 - I
wouldn't say "malware" or use the word "attack" (especially considering it's
now a sister company), however unethical or intrusive this sort of thing may
be...

This is almost like the Omniture debacle a couple of months ago (
http://www.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Full-Disclosure/2008-01/msg00202.html,
among many others dating back to 2002/03) which is used for user-tracking in
and around certain sites to check page hits, time spent between clicks,
referring servers, etc.

If this is upsetting you on a personal level, maybe you should try some of
the workarounds, including the ad-blocking extensions in Firefox, or
host-file modifications on Windows systems...?
