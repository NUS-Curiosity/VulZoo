Just because some people look at a large-scale, well-funded, organized
effort and think "government" because that's all they can think of doesn't
make it so.

There are many organized crime syndicates in this world that have larger
annual budgets than many country's total governmental budgets.  Whether such
organizations qualify as de factor governments in the areas they control is
a question best left to the political scientists....
