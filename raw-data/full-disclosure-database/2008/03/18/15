Subject: Re: agile hacking?

Just because you call me troll doesn't mean you should ignore my questions.

 Who is your book aimed towards? You said this will be the ' best hacking
reference/manual/book ever made' . Doesn't that mean it should contain lots
of low level/kernel level exploitation of which you are incapable? Covering
web based stuff doesn't exactly qualify a book as the best hacking reference
ever made.

It seems you are going to write a grand manual for script kiddies and other
non-talented people who like to run scripts and perform XSS.

Also I find it funny you told rzn that you think of more original ideas
everyday then he does when your two 'ideas' for the book were:

1) running kismet and tcpdump at the same time
2) 'How can you write a small .COM virus without a compiler or any other dev
tools?'

Seeing how both of these have been 1000s of times (
http://www.awarenetwork.org/home/iqlord/articles/extreme.coding.txt ) how
are your ideas original or interesting?

Your book is going to be lame and grouped in with the mitnick books, how to
own series, and 'hacking exposed' collection.  I guess this isn't new to you
since only CISSPs liked your previous work anyway.
