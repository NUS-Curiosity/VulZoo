It would look as if yahoo.com is serving malware. I got this little fellow:

http://media.adrevolver.com/{---remove
this---}adrevolver/trace?sip=103&cpy=1205797527644342&bt=AAAEEIGsMo0L
[note that the link has been purposefully broken with "{---remove this---}"]

while hitting yahoo at 4:45pm EDT. As of this time it is still there.

Considering that yahoo.com is one of the top destination these days, I
believe we can expect this attack to be fairly successful.
