Black Hat USA News:
We're very proud to announce a new feature for paid Black Hat attendees
starting with the USA show in August - delegate access to our CFP system!
Paid delegates can now log into our CFP database, read and review our
proposed presentations and share their ratings and comments with Black Hat.

Your ratings will help us create the show you want to attend, and even help
focus presentations as they're being created. We are excited to see what
kind of information we learn about what interests our delegates and what
kind of talks meet their needs best.  We've always said that our delegates
make Black hat the experience it is, and we're glad to have the opportunity
to extend their influence on the final product. To read more about this new
opportunity, go to:
https://www.blackhat.com/html/blackpages/blackpages.html

We're also unveiling an "Un-Track" where attendees create their own mash-up
style presentations - so if you've got something to share with the security
community, this is your moment.

Continuing a popular new BH development, we will also have speaker Q&A rooms
after every presentation to help you follow up with your speaker and network
with likeminded delegates. Still have a question that didn't quite get
answered? Follow your speaker and continue the conversation.

About Black Hat

The Black Hat Briefings are a series of highly technical information
security conferences that bring together thought leaders from all facets of
the infosec world - from the corporate and government sectors to academic
and even underground researchers. The environment is strictly vendor-neutral
and focused on the sharing of practical insights and timely, actionable
knowledge. Black Hat remains the best and biggest event of its kind, unique
in its ability to define tomorrow's information security landscape. 

15 years at the intersection of network security and hacker ingenuity is
what makes Black Hat the one-of-a-kind conference it is, one where the
establishment and the underground are equally at home.

In addition to the large number of short, topical presentations in the
Briefings, Black Hat also provides hands-on, high-intensity, multi-day
Trainings. The Training sessions are provided by some of the most respected
experts in the world and many also provide formal certifications to
qualifying attendees. Arrangements can also be made to bring Black Hat's
trainers to your location for private and customized training.
