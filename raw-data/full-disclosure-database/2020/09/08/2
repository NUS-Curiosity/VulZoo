Vulnerability Summary
-------------------------------------------------
Because Hyland OnBase largely relies on client-side validation, the server-side contains a number of critical XXE injection flaws, allowing remote attackers read and write arbitrary files, as well as run arbitrary commands on the OnBase server. All versions of OnBase were found to be equally vulnerable.

Technical Details
-------------------------------------------------
OnBase server allows XXE injection in multiple methods that accept and parse user-provided XML.

Solution
-------------------------------------------------
Multiple methods within OnBase server accept XML-based input, like for managing and creating users and patients, creating and editing charts and documents, and editing and creating records. Several of these methods were found to allow XXE injection because they fail to ignore the DTD specification, allowing attackers to read and write arbitrary files on the server and run arbitrary commands. Additional methods were found in other parts of the application, especially those tied to server configuration. All instances found required the user to be authenticated, but any authenticated user could call the methods.
