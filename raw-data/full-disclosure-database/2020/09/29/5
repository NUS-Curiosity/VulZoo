Subject: [FD] Critical Information Disclosure on WP Courses plugin <= 2.0.29
 exposes private course videos and materials

WP Courses is a Wordpress plugin allowing to define courses with 
lessons. The course can be:

- accessible to everyone without authentication;
- only available for logged-in users;
- only available for logged-in and paying users.

In the latter case, only when a user is registered to WordPress and has 
bought the product via a third plugin (for example WooCommerce) the 
contents of the lessons are shown.

We have stumbled upon a severe information disclosure vulnerability on 
WP Course <= 2.0.29 that gives an unauthenticated attacker the ability 
to exfiltrate all the content of courses (for example videos links, 
etc...) through the Wordpress REST API (/wp-json).

We have published more details and a root cause analysis in the 
following link: 
https://www.redtimmy.com/critical-information-disclosure-on-wp-courses-plugin-exposes-private-course-videos-and-materials/

A CVE has been requested but not assigned yet.

Kind Regards
Red Timmy Security
