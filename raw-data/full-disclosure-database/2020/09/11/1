Vulnerability Summary

-------------------------------------------------

Because Hyland OnBase largely relies on client-side security, attackers can upload arbitrary files and file types and bypass client-side file type restrictions by directly querying the OnBase server.

Technical Details

-------------------------------------------------

Hyland OnBase allows malicious attackers to directly upload arbitrary files to the OnBase server using file upload methods. The client-side sometimes restricts file types, but the server-side does not allowing attackers with direct server access to upload files of any type including malicious files designed to compromise clients that view the data. OnBase also appears to lack the proper mechanisms to verify that files are of the type claimed and instead relies on file extensions, allowing attackers to upload malicious files whose extensions do not match the actual file type. This allows a second vector for malicious file upload and attacking clients.

Solution

-------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, attempts to notify Hyland of the vulnerabilities have been rebuffed as not being something that they have to fix since fixing vulnerabilities, according to the Director of Application Security, is "creating custom code" and no known fix is in place. It is recommended that users try to mitigate the vulnerability by ensuring that the OnBase server is inaccessible to anyone other than trusted users. Antivirus should be used to scan the file store. No other mitigations are currently available.
