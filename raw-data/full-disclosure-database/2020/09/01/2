Vendor:
Bagisto (https://bagisto.com/)
Affected version:

Introduction:
	Bagisto is an open source shop system based on PHP and Laravel framework
	Vulnerability description:
All Bagisto installations use a default user name ("admin@...mple.com (mailto:admin@...mple.com)") and password ("admin123") until it's changed manually by the shop administrator.

There are installations in the wild which still uses default credentials for admin login.
