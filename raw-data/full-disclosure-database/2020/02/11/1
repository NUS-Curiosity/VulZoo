Subject: [FD] Critical Bluetooth Vulnerability in Android (CVE-2020-0022) â€“ BlueFrag

Hi all,

You can read more here, if you didn't hear about it:

https://insinuator.net/2020/02/critical-bluetooth-vulnerability-in-android-cve-2020-0022/

Looking at the patch, when I understood it correctly, it seems all you need
to send fragmented GAP ACL L2CAP data over HCI:

https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/+/3cb7149d8fed2d7d77ceaa95bf845224c4db3baf

Anybody can confirm/deny? Anybody had success on doing it?

Starting to work on PoC/Demo to crate such a packets:

Don't have a debugable device now though ...

For me crashing would be enough.

If anybody want to help on this, feel free to contact me directly or via
the list/SO.

Thanks,
