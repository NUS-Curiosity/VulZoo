I. Background
----------------------------
Kaspersky Lab is a multinational cybersecurity and anti-virus provider 
headquartered in Moscow, Russia and operated by a holding company in the 
United Kingdom. It was founded in 1997 . Kaspersky Lab develops  and 
sells antivirus, internet security, password management, endpoint 
security, and other cybersecurity
products and services.


II. Description
----------------------------
The parsing engine supports the ZIP archive format. The parsing engine 
can be bypassed  by specifically manipulating an ZIP Archive (File Name 
lenght Field) so that it can be accessed by an end-user but not the 
Anti-Virus software. The AV engine is unable to scan the container and 
gives  the file a "clean" rating.

I may release further details after all known vulnerable vendors have 
patched their engines.


III. Impact
----------------------------
Impacts depends on the contextual use of the product and engine within 
the organisation of a customer. Gateway Products (Email, HTTP Proxy etc) 
may allow the file through unscanned and give it a clean bill of health. 
Server side AV software will not be able to discover any code or sample 
contained within this ISO file and it will not raise suspicion even  if 
you know exactly what you are looking for (Which is for example great to 
hide your implants or Exfiltration/Pivot Server).

There is a lot more to be said about this bug class, so rather than bore 
you with it in
this advisory I provide a link to my 2009 blog post
http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html
