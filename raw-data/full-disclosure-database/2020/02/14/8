Linux below  17.0.605.474

I. Background
----------------------------
Quote: "Unprecedented challenges threaten to undermine the very survival 
of society. Only unprecedented innovation can prevent irreversible 
disasters. This is only possible if we trust the technology that can 
bring us together.

 From our humble beginnings more than thirty years ago, F-Secure has 
grown into a reliable cyber security leader, earning the trust of 
organizations and people around the world."

II. Description
----------------------------
The parsing engine supports the RAR Archive. The parsing engine can be 
bypassed by specifically manipulating a RAR archive.


III. Impact
----------------------------
Impacts depends on the contextual use of the product and engine within 
the organisation of a customer. Gateway Products (Email, HTTP Proxy etc) 
may allow the file through unscanned
and give it a clean bill of health. Server side AV software will not be 
able to discover any code or sample contained within this ISO file and 
it will not raise suspicion even if you know exactly what you are 
looking for (Which is for example great to hide your implants
or Exfiltration/Pivot Server).

There is a lot more to be said about this bug class, so rather than bore 
you with it in
this advisory I provide a link to my 2009 blog post
http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

IV. Patch / Advisory
----------------------------
- For the unix version (IGK) the fix was released on 20th January with 
library version 17.0.605.474
- For Windows the version was already out in December 2019. There were 
also avira's fixes as well.

"We can conclude that January 20th date, since that is when the final 
fixes went out to production."

V. Disclosure timeline
----------------------------

NOV 20 2019 - Report
DEC 20 2019 - Windows fixes released
JAN 20 2010 - Linux fix relesased
