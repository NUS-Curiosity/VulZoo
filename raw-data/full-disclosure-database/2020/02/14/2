CA20200205-01: Security Notice for CA Unified Infrastructure Management

Issued: February 5th, 2020
Last Updated: February 14th, 2020

CA Technologies, A Broadcom Company, is alerting customers to three
vulnerabilities in CA Unified Infrastructure Management (Nimsoft / UIM).
Multiple vulnerabilities exist that can allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands, read from or write to
systems, or conduct denial of service attacks. CA published solutions to
address these vulnerabilities and recommends that all affected customers
implement these solutions.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2020-8010, occurs due to improper ACL
handling. A remote attacker can execute commands, read from, or write to
the target system.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2020-8011, occurs due to a null pointer
dereference. A remote attacker can crash the Controller service.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2020-8012, occurs due to a buffer overflow
vulnerability in the Controller service. A remote attacker can execute
arbitrary code.


Risk Rating

High (cumulative)


Platform(s)

All supported robot platforms (i.e. Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX, and
HPUX)


Affected Products

UIM product versions 9.20 and below are affected. The applicable
component is robot (also known as controller).
The robot versions below 7.97HF8, 9.20HF9 and 9.20SHF9 are affected.


How to determine if the installation is affected

Check for the controller version in IM or AC.  If the version is lower
than 7.97HF8 for UIM 9.0.2, and 9.20HF9 or 9.20SHF9 for UIM 9.2.0, then
it is affected.


Solution

CA Technologies published the following solutions to address the
vulnerabilities:

robot_update patches 7.97HF8 (or above), 9.20HF9 (or above), and
9.20SHF9 (or above)

Note: UIM 8.5.1 users must upgrade robot to 7.97HF8.
