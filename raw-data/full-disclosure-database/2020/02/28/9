I. Background
----------------------------
Quote: "Unprecedented challenges threaten to undermine the very survival 
of society. Only unprecedented innovation can prevent irreversible 
disasters. This is only possible if we
trust the technology that can bring us together.

 From our humble beginnings more than thirty years ago, F-Secure has 
grown into a reliable cyber security leader, earning the trust of 
organizations and people around the world."

II. Description
----------------------------
The parsing engine supports the GZIP Archive. The parsing engine can be 
bypassed by manipulating a GZIP archive (Compression Method). This way 
the User can extract the file but the AV Engine cannot giving the file a 
clean pass.


III. Impact
----------------------------
Impacts depends on the contextual use of the product and engine within 
the organisation of a customer. Gateway Products (Email, HTTP Proxy etc) 
may allow the file through unscanned and give it a clean bill of health. 
Server side AV software will not be able to discover
any code or sample contained within this ISO file and it will not raise 
suspicion even  if you know exactly what you are looking for (Which is 
for example great to hide your implants
or Exfiltration/Pivot Server).

There is a lot more to be said about this bug class, so rather than bore 
you with it in this advisory I provide a link to my 2009 blog post
http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

IV. Patch / Advisory
----------------------------
- For the unix version (IGK) the fix was released on 20th January with 
library version 17.0.605.474
- For Windows the version was already out in December 2019. There were 
also avira's fixes as well.

"We can conclude that January 20th date, since that is when the final 
fixes went out to production."

V. Disclosure timeline
