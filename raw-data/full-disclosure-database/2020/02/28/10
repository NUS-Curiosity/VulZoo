 Malformed Archive Bypass

            From the lets-try-it-this-way Department
Qihoo360 | GDATA | Rising | Webroot | Dr Web  Generic Archive Bypass
________________________________________________________________________

Release mode    : Vendors do not react / Reverse Coordination Attempt
Ref             : [TZO-22-2020] - Qihoo360, GDATA, Escan, Rising, 
Command, K7 Computing, Ahnlab, Dr. Web, Webroot
Status          : Unpatched
Dislosure Policy: https://caravelahq.com/b/policy/20949

1. Summary
==========
Deviating from my Disclosure policy : Situations where the time it takes 
to discover a vulnerability is inferior to the time spend to coordinate 
it call for a new way to approach vulnerability coordination. I call it 
reverse coordination. As these are mostly low risk findings I personally 
do not have any issues with proceeding that way.

2. Description
==============
Qihoo360, GDATA, Escan, Rising, Command, K7 Computing, Ahnlab, Dr. Web, 
Webroot

3. Coordination
===============
Unless Qihoo, respectively GDATA, Escan, Rising, Command, K7 Computing, 
Ahnlab, Dr. Web, Webroot get into touch within the next 21 days, I will 
proceed to publish the vulnerabilities on this very list without any 
further communication attempt. Many attempts have been made.
