Subject: [FD] [SerialTweaker] Interactive modification of Java Serialized
	Objects

Hi, 

We have just released SerialTweaker to modify Java Serialized Objects.

This tool can be used for advanced Java Deserialization attacks, when
existing gadget chains don't work or when there is a whitelist mechanism
in place (like LookAheadDeserialization). In that case we have to work
with the classes that are in the whitelist and thus accepted by the
application. Instead of sending a gadget chain containing classes not
familiar to the application, the idea is to modify the existing
serialized objects that are used by the application during normal
operations.

At Red Timmy Security we have released the code of this project on
GitHub.

You can download the pre-compiled version from ->
https://github.com/redtimmy/SerialTweaker/blob/master/bin/SerialTweaker.jar

The source code is instead over here ->
https://github.com/redtimmy/SerialTweaker

A wider description of how the tool works in our blog ->
