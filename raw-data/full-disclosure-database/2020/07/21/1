=============================================


Vendor description:

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor did not respond to my communication attempts, hence no patch is
available.
A third party patch may be released either if the company will not fix the
product in the next months or at request.
Do not expose the software on WAN. Use ACL to allow or deny access to the
software.



Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. OS Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (RCE) and
Denial of Service (Dos)
(Unauthenticated)
There is an OS Command Injection in eFramework <= 2.9.0 that allows an
attacker a Remote Code Execution (RCE) with administrative (root)
privileges. No authentication is required. The injection point resides on
an *undisclosed* PHP page which can be targeted with either GET or POST
malicious payload.

2,3,4. OS Command Injection RCE
(Unauthenticated <= 2.8.9, Authenticated 2.9.0)
There is an OS Command Injection in eFramework <= 2.8.9 that allows an
attacker to trigger a Remote Code Execution (RCE), with administrative
(root) privileges, through OS Command Injection. No authentication is
required. The injection point resides on an *undisclosed* PHP page.

5. SQL Injection
(Unauthenticated)
There is an SQL Injection in eFramework <= 2.9.0 that leverages to
Information Disclosure. No authentication is required. The injection point
resides in one of the authentication parameters.

6. Path Traversal
(Unauthenticated, with root level access <= 2.8.9, with user level access
2.9.0)
eFramework <= 2.9.0 in its component *undisclosed* has a ../ directory
traversal vulnerability. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to
traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of
the restricted directory on the remote server with administrative
privileges.

7. Administrative Back-door access
(Unauthenticated)
Mida Solutions eFramework <= 2.9.0 in its component *undisclosed* has a
back-door which permits to change the administrative password and access
restricted functionalities. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker
to access the web application with an administrative account and leverage
other vulnerabilities to obtain Code Execution.

8. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
(Unauthenticated)
A Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability was discovered in Mida
Solutions eFramework <= 2.9.0 component *undisclosed*.

9. Stored XSS
(Authenticated)
Multiple Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) were discovered in Mida
Solutions eFramework <= 2.9.0 component *undisclosed*.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
PoC not publicly released.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
Mida Solutions eFramework version 2.8.9 has been tested, which was the
latest version
available at the time of the test. Previous versions may also be affected.

In the first quarter of the year the vendor released a newer version 2.9.0.
However, the latest
version is still vulnerable to the above vulnerabilities.

Vendor response:
------------------------
