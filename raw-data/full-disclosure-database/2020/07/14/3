Subject: Re: [FD] Multiple vulnerabilities found in CDATA OLTs

Hello,

Please note the advisory has been updated: we removed V-SOL as an
affected vendor as we mistakenly included them (V-SOL OLTs were not in
the list in the advisory).

Latest versions are available at:
- https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/2020-cdata-0x00-olt.txt
- https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2020-07-07-cdata-olt-0day-vulnerabilities.html

On a side note, an advisory - Multiple vulnerabilities found in V-SOL
OLTs - will be sent today.


Regards,
