Subject: [FD] Ptrace based fuzzer for fuzzing binaries at high speeds

Hi List,

Would like you to present a ptrace based fuzzer to fuzz (also distributed
across multiple cores) closed sources or open source binaries at high
speed.

Was able to bear other fuzzers incl. AFL with snapshots with this approach.

This is a Work in Progress (WIP), personal and experimental project.

If you would like to contribute, feel free to submit a PR request.

More info in the repository:

https://github.com/marcinguy/fuzzer

Have fun with it. Let me know if you will have any questions or find some
bugs with it.

Thanks,
Marcin
