1. Description

An issue was discovered in Verint Impact 360 15.1. At
wfo/help/help_popup.jsp, the helpURL parameter can be changed to embed
arbitrary content inside of an iFrame. Attackers may use this in
conjunction with social engineering to embed malicious scripts or phishing
pages on a site where this product is installed, given the attacker can
convince a victim to visit a crafted link.

2. Mitigation

Restrict Impact 360 accessibility to internal network only. Verint has not
patched this vulnerability to my knowledge, despite having been made aware
of it over a year ago.

3. PoC

Withheld due to possible legal threat.
