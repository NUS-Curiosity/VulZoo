# CVE: CVE-2019-12784

1. Description

An issue was discovered in Verint Impact 360 15.1. At wfo/control/signin,
the login form can accept POST submissions from external sources. This may
allow attackers to compromise credentials via bruteforce login attempts
through users in the target environment running JS provided by the attacker
(e.g. malvertising) via XHR, and be notified of a successful login attempt
via a unique callback from CVE-2019-12783 to an attacker-owned web server,
even if the site is not accessible to the attacker due to firewall rules or
network configuration.

2. Mitigation

Create firewall rules to drop traffic going to the Impact 360 system with
an external referrer.
Request a patch from Verint. Verint has not patched this vulnerability to
my knowledge, despite having been made aware of it over a year ago.

3. PoC

Withheld due to possible legal threat.
