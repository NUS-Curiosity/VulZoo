I'm sorry, but what's your point?
Looks like you just discovered a documented feature that exists since years.

As long as you attach a Google account to your android device, you give
up control of that device to that Google account.
You can even track or remotely wipe the device (android.com/find).
If the Google account is compromised, the same applies to the device.

Do you have any proof that Google actually used this feature in an
illegal way to remotely deploy malicious software to android users?

Have a nice day

Fabio Bas
