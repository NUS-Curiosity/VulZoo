Subject: Re: [FD] Google's Android: remote install backdoor in Google Play
	Services

Could you please provide more detail.  I am not seeing how this is an
attack.  The Debian apt system which predates the play store seems to work
under the same principle.  You have a core set of default packages and you
can install your own packages from the store, in this case debian apt.  The
debian security team pushes updates which not only install software with
patches but the dependencies as well.  The vulnerability you appear to be
speaking about seems to be a fundamental way the concept of an app store
works, it must include a method of pushing patches as new exploits are
published.  This necessitates pushing any dependencies of the patches.  If
I am not understanding this properly please elucidate.

Thank you,

Michael Lazin
