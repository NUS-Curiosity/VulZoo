Business recommendation:
------------------------
It is recommended to update the SteelCentral Aternity Agent to the latest
version available at the time of the update.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review conducted
by security professionals to identify and resolve all security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
The SteelCentral Aternity agent uses an executable running as a high privileged
Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other
processes. The SteelCentral Aternity Agent distributes functionality among
different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to
enable the processes to cooperate. Because access security is not properly
implemented upon IPC channels, malicious processes can trick application
processes to perform arbitrary actions.

The SteelCentral Aternity User Experience monitoring solution is therefore
prone to a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a low privileged
attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges upon execution of a specially crafted
executable file on a target system. This vulnerability has proven exploitable
and a reliable exploit has been developed.

By using such an exploit an attacker could execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM
privileges. An attacker could use SYSTEM privileges to add users, exfiltrate
information and create and remove arbitrary files.

The following individual vulnerabilities have been discovered and chained
together into an exploit (see proof of concept):

 - Insufficient security on InterProcess Communication channels (CVE-2020-15593)
   Any user in the system is allowed to access the interprocess communication
   channel "AternityAgentAssistantIpc", retrieve a serialized object and call object
   methods remotely. Among others, the methods allow any user to:
   - Create and/or overwrite arbitrary XML files across the system
   - Create arbitrary directories across the system
   - Load arbitrary plugins (i.e. CSharp assemblies) from the
         "Program Files (x86)/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins"
         directory and execute code contained in them ()

 - Directory traversal on plugin load path resolution (CVE-2020-15592)
   The remotely callable methods from remotable objects available through
   interprocess communication allow loading of arbitrary plugins (i.e. CSharp
   Assemblies) from the "Program Files (x86)/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins"
   directory, where the name of the plugin is passed as part of an
   XML-serialized object. However, because the name of the DLL is concatenated
   with the ".\plugins" string, a directory traversal vulnerability exists in
   the way plugins are resolved.

Combining these two vulnerabilities together, privilege escalation from a
low-privileged user to SYSTEM can be achieved.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
Exploit not provided in this advisory.
