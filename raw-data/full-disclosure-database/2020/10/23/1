Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to update publiXone to the latest version (2020.015).


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Account Takeover (CVE-2020-27179)
The password reset functionality can be abused to reset the password of any
user. The token for the password-reset is encrypted and contains the user ID
and a timestamp. The password for the encryption is hardcoded in the
source-code of the Java applet. By using this key, an attacker can create
valid tokens for any user and set the set password to a chosen value.

2) Missing Access Control for API Endpoints (CVE-2020-27183)
In the source-code of the Java applet, several endpoints were identified.
The endpoints are public and don't require authentication. The components
communicate via serialized Java Objects.

Among others, the following actions are available:

- UploadFile
- DownloadFile
- GetUserData
- SendMail
- SetUserData
- CreateDir

3) Unauthenticated File Download (CVE-2020-27180)
Via the IXCopy endpoint, files can be downloaded by specifying a unique
file ID. The ID is iterative and can be enumerated. No authentication is
required to download the files, which are mostly Adobe XCopy files. This
issue is not related to the 'DownloadFile' vulnerability described in 2).

4) Hardcoded AES Keys (CVE-2020-27181)
The web application uses a Java applet for editing marketing materials. In the
decompiled source-code of the applet a hardcoded AES key has been identified.
This can be exploited to accomplish the account takeover, described in 1).

5) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2020-27182)
Several reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been identified.
