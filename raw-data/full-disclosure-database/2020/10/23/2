Subject: [FD] Unicorn Emulator 1.0.2 is out!

Greetings!

We are very happy to announce version 1.0.2 of Unicorn Emulator!

It has been more than 3.5 years since the last major update, and this
version marks 5 year of Unicorn. Such a long journey for an open
source project! That is really exciting to see our magical animal
having more and more impact in both academia community and the
cybersecurity industry.

This version fixes various issues of v1.0.1, adds some new API and
introduces more bindings. For more details, see
https://www.unicorn-engine.org/Version-1.0.2

In no particular order, we would like to thank CatenaCyber and
Grayshift for sponsoring this release!

We also wish to express our sincere gratitude to all contributors, who
generously supported us to maintain Unicorn project!

What is next now? Let us look forward to the next major update:
Unicorn 2! Please contact if you want to support our work.

(For those who do not know, Unicorn is an open source multi-arch,
multi-platform emulator engine, with a homepage at
http://unicorn-engine.org).

Thanks,
Quynh
