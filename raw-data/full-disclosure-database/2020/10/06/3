ASC, Thanks for the follow up.

For your reference (and anyone else out there), I have verified the
exploitability of multiple of your CVEs in later versions of onbase.
Specifically 18.0.0.37.

CVE-2020-25254 - SQL Injection - this appears to be limited to
read-only and often requires more than basic user privileges on
(workview configuration privilege) in addition to a basic user. In EP3
these appear to always require workview configuration privileges,
which I don't have on my configuration yet, so maybe it's patched in
EP3? Probably not, but it demonstrates activity in the right
direction.
CVE-2020-25248 - Path traversal for read access, definitely present.
In EP3 it looks like it requires additional workview configuration
privilege but I suspect it's still present.
CVE-2020-25247 - Path traversal for write access, it's there, but
requires privilege I don't have in my configuration yet. It should be
noted that this is limited to the current resourcePath & if that is on
a separate partition than the binaries location then this may be a
significant mitigating factor to exploit chaining with the proposed
DLL hijacking vulnerability.

The SQL injection has been the most valuable, I haven't been able to
write anything but I have confirmed the ability to dump data.

We have privately provided some examples, but we are being very cautious and do not want to provide proof of concept or other information publicly beyond what our lawyers advised us on already. We would like to point you to the FullDisclosure post "[FD] Navy Federal Reflective Cross Site Scripting (XSS)" (18 September) from another security researcher references our disclosures and states that NavyFederal.org was vulnerable to XSS, citing our work in their timeline, leading us to believe that NavyFederal.org is or was using OnBase.

When we tested 19.8.9.1000, we found that it had fewer instances of SQL injection than 18.0.0.32, but there were still large segments of the software that was vulnerable because they still make use of String.format and string concatenation. Both versions were equally vulnerable to authorization bypass, logging issues, and the other issues.

We did not do as much testing on the webclient and did not use the mobile client because our customer wasn't going to use it. If you are having trouble, first configure your Unity client to proxy traffic through RAT, ZAP, or Burp Suite. We also recommend using CodeReflect, dotPeek, or a similar decompiler and search for things like String.format and their exceptions because it makes it easier to find the vulnerabilities and then create your exploits.
