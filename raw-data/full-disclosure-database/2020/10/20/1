Subject: Re: [FD] Google's Android: remote install backdoor in Google Play
	Services

If I recall correctly, iOS and MacOS work in much the same way. They can
push and remove software from devices at will. There are precedents of
Google and Apple using this power, generally to get rid of malware that
made it past app store detection and review mechanisms.

This isn't anything new and it has been standardized across both major
mobile platforms. Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't legal
implications, I'm simply pointing out it isn't unique to Google/Android and
it isn't a secret.

The ability to remove apps is what gets the most press, but I recall
hearing that both platforms have the ability to add apps as well.
