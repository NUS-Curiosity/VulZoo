Business recommendation:
------------------------
It is recommended to apply the hotfix or update the server component to version
1.0.4.851.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Broken access control
The mobile application connects to the company-specific server, which does
not properly restrict the access to confidential data. Thus, an authenticated
attacker can disclose the company's payroll, personal information of other
employees without having appropriate privileges to do so.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Broken access control
The mobile application's request consists primarily of two parts: an XML message
in the body and its MD5 hash in the query string.

POST /MobileHandler.ashx?MessageHash=43a98be456b0213ce45e23fdf54c58b8 HTTP/1.1
Host: [redacted]
Content-Length: 276

<Message ID="msg1" MessageType="InvokeServiceMessage" Service="Payslip" Method="getMyPayslipMonthInfoForReleaseMany" Language="English" UserCode="user0" TokenID=""><Parameters><String>0000000537</String><DateTime>2020-03-31 00:00:00</DateTime><null/></Parameters></Message>

Analyzing the mobile application reveals the following algorithm to
calculate the hash:

MessageHash = hex_md5(escape(XmlMsg) + TokenID);

Furthermore, the server-side part of the application runs the following logic
to verify the message:
- extract the "UserCode" value from the message
- look up the "TokenID" associated with the "UserCode"
- calculate and compare the hash
- if valid, trust and use the parameters in the message, which serves as
  the real reference (rather than the "UserCode") to the business data.

Given this information, an authenticated attacker can craft a message with
an arbitrary value set (e.g. 0000000537) for the element "Parameters" and
calculate the hash with the attacker's "UserCode" and "TokenID".

As a consequence, the pay slip of another employee (e.g. a higher-ranked
manager) can be disclosed. By iterating the values, the attacker can
reveal the entire payroll data of the whole company.

In the following example an authenticated user "user0" can collect
personal information of "user1", including phone number, emails etc.

POST /platinummobile/Handlers/MobileHandler.ashx?MessageHash=bf62c16cad7a6b27b0fee8e1a21409b7 HTTP/1.1
Host: [redacted]
Content-Length: 203

<Message ID="msg1" MessageType="InvokeServiceMessage" Service="MyAccount" Method="GetMyInfo" Language="English" UserCode="user0" TokenID=""><Parameters><String>user1</String></Parameters></Message>
