We hope this email finds you well.

This year has had its challenges and we had to postpone CarolinaCon 16 
do to unforeseen circumstances. We are planning in the upcoming year to 
host our conference online. We are also pleased to announce that our CFP 
is now open. You can submit prospective presentations here, 
https://cfp.carolinacon.org/cc-online/cfp

We hope that you take the time submit a talk and that you and your loved 
ones enjoy a this holiday season.

~CarolinaCon
