Subject: [FD] survey on reliability of CVSS

The University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Germany) is conducting a research 
study to test the reliability of CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring 
System). If you are currently assessing vulnerabilities using CVSS, we 
would greatly appreciate your participation which contributes to the 
improvement of vulnerability management. This survey takes approx. 45 
minutes:

There has been a lot of critique on CVSS, and we are conducting a 
rigorous experimental investigation of some of the critique points.

The survey will be running till the end of January. Would be great if 
you completed it as soon as possible for you. We spent several months 
developing the survey, and need approx. 300 responses for conducting 
robust statistical analysis.

If you are not scoring vulnerabilities using CVSS, but know people who 
are, we would be very grateful if you helped us and distributed this 
survey to them.

Thank you,

Zinaida
