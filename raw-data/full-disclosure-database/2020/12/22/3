          CVE Name        

      Description     A crash can occur in Asterisk when a SIP 181 response   
                      is received that has a Diversion header, which          
                      contains a tel-uri.                                     
    Modules Affected  res_pjsip_diversion.c                                   

    Resolution  Asterisk now ensures that if  it receives a SIP 181 response  
                with a Diversion header that contains a tel-uri a crash does  
                not occur.
