Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non-persistent cross site vulnerability has been discovered in the
official VestaCP (Control Panel) v0.9.8-26 hosting web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with non-persistent attack vector to compromise browser
to web-application requests from the client-side.

The cross site security vulnerability is located in the `period`
parameter of the `./list/rrd/` and `./list/rrd/image.php?/rrd/la/` modules.
The injection point is located in the period parameter and the execution
occurs in the `Graphs` module. The request method to inject the
malicious script code is GET and the attack vector of the vulnerability
is non-persistent on client-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session
hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external
redirects
to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected
application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] ./list/rrd/
[+] ./rrd/la/

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] image.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] period


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerabilities can be
exploited by remote attackers without account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the cross site web
vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The cross site web vulnerability can be resolved by an encode or escape
of the vulnerable period parameter context in the get method request.
Sanitize as well the output location of the content to resolve the point
were the script code code executes.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the cross site scripting web vulnerability in the
vesta cp web-application is estimated as medium.
