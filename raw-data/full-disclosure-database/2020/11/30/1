Subject: [FD] Etherify 4 - jumping air gaps with real ethernet hardware

Hello,

Another amusing etherify hack, this time not with raspberry pis, but with 
normal laptops.

The implementation is deliberately very primitive (shell scripts, uses 
native system tools). The data is transmitted via very slow morse code 
(QRSS CW), which can be decoded visually on a spectrogam. This way one can 
judge the signal/noise ratio by eye.


Description: https://lipkowski.com/etherify4

Demo: https://youtu.be/aHbgMt0w4Cc

scripts: https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify


This isn't 100% related to security but some of you might find this hack 
amusing. It could be used to jump air-gaps or as a simple soft-tempest 
demo.


Have fun :)

Jacek / SQ5BPF
