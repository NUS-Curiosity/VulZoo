Subject: [FD] Etherify - bringing the ether back to ethernet

Hello

I've published a short description how to transmit radio signals using the 
ethernet interface, for example by changing the interface speed, or by 
loading the interface with packets.

The implementation is deliberately very primitive (shell scripts, uses 
native system tools). The data is transmitted via morse code, so that one 
can judge the signal/noise ratio be ear, and decode by ear (which is much 
better. an average human operator easily outperforms all software i've 
tried).

demo: https://youtu.be/ueC4SLPrtNg

scripts: https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify

This isn't 100% related to security but some of you might find this hack 
amusing. It could be used to leak some data from a system which is not 
connected to a public network via electromagnetic emanations or as a 
tempest demo.

Have fun :)

Jacek / SQ5BPF
