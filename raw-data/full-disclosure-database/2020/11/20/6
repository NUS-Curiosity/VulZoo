KL-001-2020-008 : Barco wePresent Global Hardcoded Root SSH Password

Title: Barco wePresent Global Hardcoded Root SSH Password
Advisory ID: KL-001-2020-008
Publication Date: 2020.11.20
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-008.txt


1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Barco
     Affected Product: wePresent WiPG-1600W
     Affected Version: 2.5.1.8, 2.5.0.25, 2.5.0.24, 2.4.1.19
     Platform: Embedded Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
     CVE ID: CVE-2020-28334


2. Vulnerability Description

     The Barco wePresent device has a hardcoded root password hash
     included in the firmware image. To our knowledge the password
     hash has not been cracked and published; it is possible this
     could occur at any time. This combined with KL-001-2020-004
     (CVE-2020-28329), KL-001-2020-005 (CVE-2020-28330), and
     KL-001-2020-007 (CVE-2020-28331) could be used in a simple
     and automated exploit chain to go from unauthenticated remote
     attacker to root shell.


3. Technical Description

     In looking at the unpacked firmware, a root hash was quickly
     identified in the /etc/shadow file on the device. It is the
     only account in the /etc/shadow. The device does not prompt
     the administrator to set a new root password, therefore this
     password is hardcoded and exists across all devices.


4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     The vendor has released an updated firmware (2.5.3.12) which
     remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
     notes are available at:
