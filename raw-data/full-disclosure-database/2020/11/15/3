Nothing or everything, depends on how you see it.
On default install there is only 1 active user, which is the person installing the system.
This person can see everything (is part of sudo group). The rest of the world can see nothing.

Then, and that is important, the person installing must know how to secure.
If you want to have multiple normal users and services, like web- and mailservices, you have to take extra care on securing the system.

Things like setting the rights, acl’s, sticky bits, etc are topics for linux beginners training!
Do take time to secure a system (any system).

Too many times a see the www directory structure as 777, 775 or 755, where 700 or 750 is also working.

So ?

For most systems that’s ok, when having aware users (with clue)
For systems with unaware (clueless) people you have to do more system management. But that’s a general thing in my opinion.
