Subject: [FD] Scope of Debian's /home/loser is with permissions 755,
	default umask 002

On Debian /home/loser is with permissions 755, default umask 0022

(If you don't understand the numbers, this means a lot of
files are world readable).

On multiuser machines this sucks much.

Question: How much sensitive data can be read on default install?

Partial results:

1. mutt (text email client) exposes ~/.mutt/muttrc,
which might contain the imap password in plaintext.

2. Some time ago on a multiuser debian mirror we found a lot of data,
including the wordpress password of the admin.

3. Anything created by EDITOR NEWFILE is readable, unless the directory
prevents. This include root doing EDITOR /etc/NEWFILE

Debian said won't fix:
