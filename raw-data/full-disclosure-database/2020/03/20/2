=====[ Detailed
description]==========================================================

A Local Privilege Escalation issue was discovered in Avast Secure Browser
76.0.1659.101.
The vulnerability is due to an insecure ACL set by the
AvastBrowserUpdate.exe (which is
running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) when AvastSecureBrowser.exe checks for new
updates.
When the update check is triggered, the elevated process cleans the ACL of
the Update.ini
file in %PROGRAMDATA%\Avast Software\Browser\Update\ and sets all
privileges to group Everyone.
Because any low-privileged user can create, delete, or modify the
Update.ini file stored in this
location, an attacker with low privileges can create a hard link named
Update.ini in this folder,
and make it point to a file writable by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Once
AvastBrowserUpdate.exe is
triggered by the update check functionality, the DACL is set to a
misconfigured value on the
crafted Update.ini and, consequently, to the target file that was
previously not writable by the
low-privileged attacker.
