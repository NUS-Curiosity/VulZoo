Subject: [FD] New version of Hyperion PE runtime crypter

Hi,

We've just released version 2.3 of our PE runtime crypter, hyperion.

[ CHANGELOG ]

- rejects unsupported .NET executables
- preserves GUI/Commandline PE flag
- has a lower AV detection because static stuff was removed and
  64 bit output file size was reduced by 4 kilo bytes


[ DESCR ]

Hyperion is a runtime encrypter for 32-bit and 64-bit portable executables.
It is a reference implementation and bases on the paper "Hyperion: Implementation of a PE-Crypter".


[ LINKS ]

- Tool @ http://www.nullsecurity.net/tools/binary.html
- Papers/slides available @ http://nullsecurity.net/papers.html
- Added in BlackArch Linux (pacman -S hyperion-crypter -> /usr/share/windows/hyperion-crypter)


cheers,
noptrix
