These utilities are just the anchor; the very point is that Microsoft ships
SUPERCEEDED and VULNERABLE versions of the Visual C++ 2005 runtime with
(certain versions) of Windows and other products, against their own
recommendation:

"Same old sin"!
This does neither justify Microsoft's nor the 3rd parties BAD behaviour,
which puts users/customers at risk!
And the arguement is NOT about "older" components, but either end-of-life
or superceeded components: the former may have unknown or unpublished
vulnerabilities, while the latter have known and published vulnerabilities.

JFTR: the MSVCRT shipped with Windows 7 is in the latter category!

Not only Microsoft repeats the mantra "keep your software up-to-date" over
and over again, but doesn't live it!

That's just the icing on the cake.

stay tuned
