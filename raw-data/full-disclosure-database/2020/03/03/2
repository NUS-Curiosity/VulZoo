Subject: [FD] XSSer v.1.8[3] - "The HiV€!" released

Hi FD,

I am glad to present a new release of this tool:

  - https://xsser.03c8.net

---------

"Cross Site "Scripter" (aka XSSer) is an automatic -framework- to
detect, exploit and report XSS vulnerabilities in web-based
applications. It provides several options to try to bypass certain
filters and various special techniques for code injection."

---------

XSSer has pre-installed [ > 1300 XSS ] attacking vectors and can
bypass-exploit code on several browsers/WAFs:

 - [PHPIDS]: PHP-IDS
 - [Imperva]: Imperva Incapsula WAF
 - [WebKnight]: WebKnight WAF
 - [F5]: F5 Big IP WAF
 - [Barracuda]: Barracuda WAF
 - [ModSec]: Mod-Security
 - [QuickDF]: QuickDefense

 - [IE]: Internet Explorer
 - [FF]: Mozilla's Gecko rendering engine, used by Firefox/Iceweasel
 - [NS-IE]: Netscape in IE rendering engine mode
 - [NS-G]: Netscape in the Gecko rendering engine mode

---------

This release (v1.8.3) called "The HiV€!" has added this new changes:

 * Modified/Updated: anti false positives checkers
 * Added: internal 'headless' browser: gecko/firefox engine
 * Modified/Updated: --reverse-check (GET/POST) (local/remote)
 * Removed: --reverse-open
 * Modified/Updated: DOM attack (added vectors: 13)
 * Modified/Updated: GTK+
 * Added: Requirements
 * Updated: Documentation
 * Updated: Website
 * [...]

---

"I have advanced considerably all the options related to --reverse-open,
so that the tool, once discovered a vulnerability, tries to establish a
tunnel between the target and XSSer. In this way we can certify 100%
that a vulnerability is exploitable..."

+ POC [HTTP POST/REMOTE): https://xsser.03c8.net/xsser/thehive7.png
