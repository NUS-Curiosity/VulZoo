Subject: [FD] New tool: nullscan v1.0.0 - A modular framework designed to
 chain and automate security tests

Howdy,

We've just released nullscan v1.0.0, a modular framework designed to
chain and automate security tests. It's a beast and highly recommended
to learn and use it. :)

Here are some details:

[ Description ]

A modular framework designed to chain and automate security tests. It
parses target definitions from the command line and runs corresponding
modules and their nullscan-tools afterwards. It can also take hosts and
start nmap first in order to perform a basic portscan and run the
modules afterwards. Also, nullscan can parse a given nmap logfile for
open tcp and udp ports and again run the modules afterwards. All results
will be logged in specified directories with a clean structure and a
HTML report can subsequently be generated.
