Yes, partially: this vulnerability allows unprivileged users
a) to bypass "on-demand" scans of files downloaded from the internet
   or other computers (which are initiated by the attachment manager),
b) to load an arbitrary DLL whenever a program calls the attachment
   manager or the IOfficeAntiVirus interface to initiate an "on-demand"
   scan;
"realtime" scans initiated via the file system filter driver of the
anti-malware platform are NOT affected.
