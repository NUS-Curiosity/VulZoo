Subject: Re: [FD] Defense in depth -- the Microsoft way (part 64): Windows
 Defender loads and exeutes arbitrary DLLs

Does this mean that unprivileged users can defeat WindowsDefender,
even when that is "enforced" by managers? Surely that would be a
vulnerability! I am not knowledgeable about Windows management,
but the pages


https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/configmgr/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-protection

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/configuration-management-reference-windows-defender-antivirus

suggest that enforcement of WindowsDefender is a supported feature.

Thanks, Paul
