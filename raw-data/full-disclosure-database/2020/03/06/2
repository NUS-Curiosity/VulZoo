Subject: [FD] Buffer overflow in pppd - CVE-2020-8597

Hi list,

I looked into Buffer overflow in pppd (CVE-2020-8597) some more. Great bug.
Feel free to take a look if this interests you. I kind of simulated the bug
quickly.

Didn't follow the exploitation path. I can imagine you will have to beat
Stack Canaries on most of the systems. So not that scary. You should still
patch though.

Thanks,
Marcin
