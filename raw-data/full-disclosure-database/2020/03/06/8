Subject: [FD] Script Injection Vulnerability Remediated

A script injection vulnerability was discovered by a penetration tester hired by Prosper and later by a security professional. Thanks to Paul Oâ€™Neil at CyberScout for his responsible disclosure and assistance in confirming this vulnerability.



For the attack to be successful, the attacker needed to be logged into prosper.com<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprosper.com%2F&data=02%7C01%7Csbaker%40prosper.com%7C7b23dc89e8394767025f08d7befc24a0%7C924fb1d22d664b62aeca6517836f3b2f%7C1%7C0%7C637187862469813924&sdata=g7V%2ByRdKPP3UNH%2Fqr0XLa%2FvAlqGoMT4StOEsHCtB%2FsY%3D&reserved=0> and could potentially save scripts that would run against their account.   The Prosper information security team checked the database for persisted attacks and detected some benign proof of concepts.  Monitoring alerts were created to detect further attacks. Developers then implemented input validation to prevent further attacks from being saved to the database.  Encoding was added as a defense in depth measure such that saved attacks would not work. In addition, Prosper has enabled Content Security Policy headers site-wide to whitelist domains that are approved for use in the context of our site.
