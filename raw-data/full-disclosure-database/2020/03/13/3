========================================================================
Vulnerability 1 - Security restriction bypass
========================================================================
Vulnerability Type:    Incorrect Authorization [CWE-863]
CVE-ID:                t.b.a.
CVSS Base Score:       5.6
CVSSv3.1 Vector:       AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
CVSS Impact Subscore:  5.2
CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 0.4
========================================================================

Description
-----------
A security restriction bypass vulnerability has been discovered by
HackerOne user hoangn144. Revive Adserver, like many other applications,
requires the logged in user to type the current password in order to
change the e-mail address or the password. It was however possible for
anyone with access to a Revive Adserver admin user interface to bypass
such check and change e-email address or password of the currently
logged in user by altering the form payload.


Details
-------
The attack requires physical access to the user interface of a logged in
user. If the POST payload was altered by turning the "pwold" parameter
into an array, Revive Adserver would fetch and authorise the operation
even if no password was provided.

========================================================================
Vulnerability 2 - Open Redirect
========================================================================
Vulnerability Type:    URL Redirection to Untrusted Site
                       ('Open Redirect') [CWE-601]
CVE-ID:                t.b.a.
CVSS Base Score:       4.2
CVSSv3.1 Vector:       AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
CVSS Impact Subscore:  2.5
CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 1.6
========================================================================

Description
-----------
An Open Redirect vulnerability was discovered and reported by HackerOne
user hoangn144. A remote attacker could trick logged-in users to open a
specifically crafted link and have them redirected to any destination.


Details
-------
The CSRF protection of the "/www/admin/*-modify.php" could be skipped if
no meaningful parameter was sent. No action was performed, but the user
was still redirected to the target page, specified via the "returnurl"
GET parameter.
