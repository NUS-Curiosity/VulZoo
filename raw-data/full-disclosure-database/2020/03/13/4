Subject: [FD] CarolinaCon is POSTPONED

After careful deliberation and discussions, our team has decided that it
would be in the best interest of the local community to postpone the
upcoming CarolinaCon conference because of the on going situation with
Coronavirus. Due to the nature of the conference, we do not believe that
we can accommodate a virtual conference with such short notice. We will
provide an update for future conference date and location as soon as we
know.

This was a hard decision to make and we apologize for any inconvenience
created by this decision. If you have any questions on concerns, please
let us know.
