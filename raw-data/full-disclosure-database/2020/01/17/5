Hi, A patch to fix this issue is available to customers and detailed in the following public advisory at https://fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-19-296.
We can confirm that in addition to the automatic replies, emails were sent to Mr. Klaus on December 5th and December 24th.
However, after some investigation we have learned that the emails were not successfully delivered.
We offer our sincere apologies to Mr. Klaus and have acknowledged his work in the advisory.
