award-winning security products and threat intelligence for people,

Recognized by industry, respected by vendors and evangelized by our 
customers, Bitdefender is  the cybersecurity company you can trust and 
rely on."

II. Description
=================
The parsing engine supports the RAR archive format. The parsing engine 
can be bypassed by specifically manipulating an ZIP Archive (GPFLAG) so 
that it can be accessed by an end-user  but not the Anti-Virus software. 
The AV engine is unable to scan the archive and issues the file a 
"clean" rating.

I may release further details after all known vulnerable vendors have 
patched their products.


III. Impact
=================
Impacts depends on the contextual use of the product and engine within 
the organisation of a customer. Gateway Products (Email, HTTP Proxy etc) 
may allow the file through unscanned and give it a clean bill of health. 
Server side AV software will not be able to discover  any code or sample 
contained within this ISO file and it will not raise suspicion even  if 
you know exactly what you are looking for (Which is for example great to 
hide your implants or Exfiltration/Pivot Server).

There is a lot more to be said about this bug class, so rather than bore 
you with it in this advisory I provide a link to my 2009 blog post
http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

IV. Patch / Advisory
=================
If you are an enterprise customer I would suggest to reach out to 
Bitdefender to discuss how you can be notified about patched 
vulnerabilities within their products. Some releases may requires binary 
updates that cant be pulled from the auto-update.

amsiscan.dll >24.0.14.74

For Users of the OEM Partners (G-Data, Vipr, etc) I would suggest to get 
in contact to ensure these vulnerabilities are patched or not present in 
their offering. I would also suggest discussing how you can be made 
aware of future patches.
