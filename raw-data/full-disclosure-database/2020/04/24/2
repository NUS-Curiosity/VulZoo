Subject: [FD] jQuery < 3.5 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Hi list,

Timmy Willison recently released a new version of jQuery. jQuery 3.5 fixes
a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the jQueryâ€™s HTML
parser. The Snyk open source security platform estimates that 84% of all
websites may be impacted by jQuery XSS vulnerabilities.

Masato Kinugawa found a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the
htmlPrefilter method of jQuery, and published an example showing a popup
alert window in the form of a challenge. (
https://xss.pwnfunction.com/challenges/ww3/)

I think this bug got too little attention in light of its possible impact.

Below is a CodeQL query that can find user controlled values passed to
html() which can be abused to perform Cross-Site Scripting.

Please check your projects, submit responsible disclosure to projects that
might be affected.

Thanks,
Marcin
