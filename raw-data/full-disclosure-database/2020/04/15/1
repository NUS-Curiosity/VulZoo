Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities has been
discovered in the official DedeCMS v5.7 SP2 UTF8  web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject
own malicious script codes with non-persistent attack vector to
compromise browser to web-application requests from the client-side.

The cross site scripting web security vulnerabilities are located in the
`filename`, `mid`, `userid`, `templet` parameters of the  `tpl.php`,
`mychannel_edit.php`, `file_manage_view.php`, `sys_admin_user_edit.php`,
`makehtml_homepage.php` files.  The request method to inject
the malicious script code is GET and the attack vector of the
vulnerability is non-persistent on client-side.

Remote attackers are able to inject own script codes to the client-side
requested vulnerable web-application parameters. The attack vector of
the vulnerability is non-persistent and the request method to
inject/execute is GET. The vulnerabilities are classic client-side cross
site
scripting vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability
results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks,
non-persistent external redirects to malicious source and non-persistent
manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] tpl.php
[+] mychannel_edit.php
[+] file_manage_view.php
[+] sys_admin_user_edit.php
[+] makehtml_homepage.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] filename
[+] mid
[+] userid
[+] templet


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without
privileged user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1. Parse the content to disallow html / js and special chars
2. Restrict the vulnerable paramter input to prevent injects via get
method request
3. Secure the output location were the content is insecure sanitized
delivered as output


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the client-side non-persistent cross site scripting
web vulnerabilities in the different modules are estimated as medium.
