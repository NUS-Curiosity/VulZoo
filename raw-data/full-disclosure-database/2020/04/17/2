Technical Details & Description:
================================
An insecure session validation web vulnerability has been discovered in
the official SMACom v1.2.0 mobile ios web-application.
The vulnerability becomes visible through insecure transmitted session
credentials like passwords or keys.

The vulnerability is located in the session handling of the `password`
authentication parameter of the wifi photo transfer module.
Users can setup there pin for authentication to access the wifi user
interface. The web-server is not secured by ssl and transmits
the `password` for the wifi authentication in plain-text. Remote
attackers with network access privileges or on public wifis access
are able to read the authentication credentials and followup requests
with the password via man in the middle attack. The password
is transmitted as plain-text and is used in the visible session
parameter requested on each GET index attempt.

Next to that we want to mention as well that the authentication is not
protected against any bruteforce attempts which allowed us
to quickly crack any 4-6 digits pins from the default generator within
minutes.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in mobile wifi
application file-system compromise and information leaks.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Function(s):
[+] Auth

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] password


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with network
access without privileged application user account.

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the insecure session validation web vulnerability
in the mobile ios web application is estimated as high.
