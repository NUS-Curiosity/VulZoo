Subject: [FD] Exploiting java deserialization vulnerabilities in crypto
 contexts - a java applet case-study

Hi,

regardless of being a deprecated technology, there are still many legacy applications relying on java applets out there. A bit of time ago we were involved in an atypical web application penetration test.

The difficulty consisted in the fact that the java serialized payload responsible for triggerring the vulnerability was located inside the authenticated part of a digital certificate, signed client-side with a private key stored in a HSM module.

In case you are interested, the full story is here: https://www.redtimmy.com/web-application-hacking/how-we-invented-enumjavalibs-while-finding-a-java-deserialization-bug-and-achieving-rce/
