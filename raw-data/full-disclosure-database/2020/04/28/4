Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in the
official Transfer Master v3.3 mobile ios web-application.

The denial of service vulnerability is located in the delete post method
request on the files path. Remote attackers can
manipulate the ui by sending special crafted requests to cause a null
pointer error that crashs the wifi web-server.
The attacker changes the file delete request to a null path which
results in a null pointer that crashs the application.

Successful exploitation of the denial of service vulnerability results
in a wifi web-server ui crash and freeze.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The denial of service vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers
with wifi network access without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Install and start the local ios app
2. Open the wifi share option to start the web-server
3. Move to the front ui
4. Tamper the https session and reply by deleting the files path with
(null) as empty quote
5. The web-server crashs and the wifi ui becomes unavailable by a blank
screen that responds with not found
Note: Service still alive but finally unavailable cause of a null
pointer issue
6. Successful reproduce of the denial of service vulnerability!
