Technical Details & Description:
================================
A denial of service web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official mobile ios web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to crash or freeze the
application process or its components.

Attackers are able to transmit special crafted chat messages to trigger
a validation error that is able
to crash the mobile ios application process. The error occurs due to the
transmit of the message body content.
On delivery all connected clients to the chats are crashing at the same
time.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The denial of service vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers
without user interaction or privileged user accounts.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the web vulnerability follow
the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the web-application
2. Open the chat module on the buttom of the app index
3. Insert payload and transmit via send to all users
4. All app clients do crash with an uncaught validation exception
