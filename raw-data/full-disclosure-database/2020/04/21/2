Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
Multiple persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities has been
discovered in the official Sky File v2.1.0 mobile ios web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector to compromise browser to
web-application requests from the application-side.

The cross site vulnerability is located in the 'createFolder' module.
Remote attackers with access to the ui via wifi are able
to inject own malicious persistent script code to compromise the
web-application or user credentials. The request method to
inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results session hijacking,
persistent phishing, persistent external redirects  and
application-side manipulation of the web context of the affected and
connected device module.


1.2
A directory traversal web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official Sky File v2.1.0 mobile ios web-application.
The web vulnerability allows an attacker to unauthorized change the path
or directory to access sensitive application data.

The directory / path webvulnerability is located in the local ftp server
configuration and path validation with the insecure
access permissions. Normally the anonymous user account is only able to
move inside the main app folder but not above to the
web-server and root application files. In case of the issue remote
attackers are able to connect with anonymous user account
credentials to the wifi ftp server. After that the attacker can use a
misconfiguration in the ftp server of the app path to
transmit a `/null//` path commands after CWD and CDUP navigation via ftp
client. Thus allows the attacker to finally
unauthorized access the main root application path.

Successful exploitation of the directory traversal vulnerability results
in unauthorized file system access and information disclosure.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
1.1
The persistent script code inject vulnerability can be exploited by
remote attackers with wifi network access with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the web vulnerability follow
the provided information and steps below to continue.

1.2
The directory traversal web vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers with wifi network access without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the web vulnerability follow
the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce ...
1. Open the ftp preview the visible folders
2. Jump back to the the following path
/private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/A9124FFE-16D8-413B-83B7-4018B69AEB45/
3. Include the payload /(null)// and refresh via list command
4. You are now placed in an empty folder without permission to move
5. Add to /(null)/../ to the path and refresh the client
6. Path traversal successful to access the main app root path (./) that
is normally not accessable
7. Successful reproduce of the path traversal web vulnerability!

Security Risk:
==============
1.1
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability
in the createfolder input field is estimated as medium.

1.2
The security risk of the directory traversal web vulnerability in the
mobile ios web application is estimated as high.
