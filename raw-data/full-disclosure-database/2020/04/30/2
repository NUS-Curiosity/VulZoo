Technical Details & Description:
================================
A directory traversal web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official Super Backup v2.0.5 ios mobile web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to change the application path
in performed requests to compromise the local application
or file-system of a mobile device. Attackers are for example able to
request environment variables or a sensitive system path.

The directory-traversal web vulnerability in the app is located in the
`list` and `download` module with the `path` parameter.
Attackers are able to change the path variable to request the local list
command. By changing the path parameter the validation
mechanism runs into a logic error that turns back the possibility to
request different pathes outside the basic import/export
folder. Thus way the attacker injects for example local path environment
varibales to compromise the local ios web-application.

Exploitation of the directory traversal web vulnerability requires no
privileged web-application user account or user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in information
leaking by unauthorized file access and mobile application compromise.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The directory traversal vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with
access to the wifi interface in a local network without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability
follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
