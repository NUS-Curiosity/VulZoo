Product Description
==================

RouterOS is the operating system used on the MikroTik's devices, such as
switch, router and access point.


Description of vulnerabilities
==========================

These two vulnerabilities were tested only against the MikroTik RouterOS
stable release tree when found. Maybe other release trees also suffer from
these vulnerabilities.

1. The cerm process suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption
issue. By sending a crafted packet, an authenticated remote user can cause
a high cpu load, which may make the device respond slowly or unable to
respond.

2. The traceroute process suffers from a memory corruption issue. By
sending a crafted packet, an authenticated remote user can crash the
traceroute process due to invalid memory access.


Solution
========

Upgrade to the corresponding latest RouterOS tree version.
