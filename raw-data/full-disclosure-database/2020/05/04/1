Technical Details & Description:
================================
An information disclosure web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official File Explorer v1.4 mobile ios web-application.

The local file explorer application can be protected with a local pin.
Any time the user opens the app, the pin is required
for the auth to access to private file explorer data. The protection
form is attached to process after the main form with
for example the list in the local application context. Normally the pin
must popup ahead to the local file index but in this
case is processed afterwards. Thus allows a local attacker with physical
ios device access to bypass the security mechanism
to preview files (names, size & co) and access the protected data. In
case of the attack the information can be accessed
that earlier then the protection mechanisms captures the attempt.

Successful exploitation of the local information disclosure application
vulnerability results in unauthorized data access.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The information disclosure vulnerability can be exploited by local
attackers with physical device access without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Install the local application
2. Open the settings and setup a pin to protect
3. Move to the local web-server via wifi and start it
4. Upload some files for the index dir listing to preview
5. close the app and open it back by restart
Note: Now the pin should appear
6. Push a folder path or file that becomes visible and hold it
7. Push home again
8. Way free to edit and preview the files
9. Successful reproduce of the local vulnerability!


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent cross site scripting web
vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as medium.
