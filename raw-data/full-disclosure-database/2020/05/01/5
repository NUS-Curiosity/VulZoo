Subject: [FD] TP-LINK Cloud Cameras NCXXX SetEncryptKey Command Injection

Vulnerability title: TP-LINK Cloud Cameras NCXXX SetEncryptKey Command Injection
Author: Pietro Oliva
CVE: CVE-2020-12111
Vendor: TP-LINK
Product: NC260, NC450
Affected version: NC260 <= 1.5.2 build 200304, NC450 <= 1.5.3 build 200304
Fixed version:    NC260 <= 1.5.3 build_200401, NC450 <= 1.5.4 build 200401

Description:
The issue is located in the httpSetEncryptKeyRpm method (handler for
/setEncryptKey.fcgi) of the ipcamera binary, where the user-controlled
EncryptKey parameter is used directly as part of a command line to be executed
as root without any input sanitization.

Impact:
Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to remotely execute commands as root
on affected devices.

Exploitation:
An attacker would first need to authenticate to the web interface and make a
POST request to /setEncryptKey.fcgi. Commands to be executed with root
privileges can be injected in the EncryptKey parameter.

Evidence:
The disassembly of affected code from an NC450 camera is shown below:

httpSetEncryptKeyRpm:

0x00491728   lw a0, -0x7fd4(gp)
0x0049172c   nop
0x00491730   addiu a0, a0, 0x3344        ; "echo %s > %s/%08X"
0x00491734   lw a1, (EncryptKey_param)   ; Attacker controlled string
0x00491738   lw a2, -0x7fd4(gp)
