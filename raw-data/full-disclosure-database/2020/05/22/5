Subject: [FD] [IAIK JCE] Timing Attack Side Channel in DSA Implementation

IAIK JCE is a provider for the Java Cryptography Extension that,
according to the vendor, "supplements the security functionality of
the default JDK". It is a commercial product developed by Stiftung
Secure Information and Communication Technologies:
https://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/about-us/

The way that some of the computations involved in the signature
generation are carried out introduces a side channel that leaks timing
information about the ephemeral number k.

Full details about the vulnerability are available here:
