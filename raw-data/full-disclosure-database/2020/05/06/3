Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered
in the official OpenZ v3.6.60 ERP web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector to compromise
browser to web-application requests from the application-side.

The persistent vulnerability is located in the `inpname` and
`inpdescripción` parameters of the `Employee` add/register/edit
module in the `menu.html` file. Remote attackers with low privileges are
able to inject own malicious persistent script code as
name or description. The injected code can be used to attack the
frontend or backend of the web-application. The request method
to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the
application-side. The attack can be triggered from low privilege user
accounts against higher privilege user accounts like manager or
administrators to elevate privileges via session hijacking.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external
redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected
application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Employee

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Mitarbeiter Name
[+] Beschreibung

Vulnerable File(s):

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent web vulnerability can be exploited by low privileged web
application user account with low user interaction.
