Technical Details & Description:
================================
A command injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official POS PHP v17.5 web-application.
The vulnerability allows to inject own device specific commands or
variables to compromise the local system.

The vulnerability is located in the devicename values. Any time a chat
is being opened the device name is above the
chat communication of each message. Thus allows a participant of the
multi wifi / bluetooth chat to inject own device
specific commands via devicename variable to stable compromise the chat.
Afects can be the execute of script code,
device specific commands or local crashs because of loops. Also thus way
an attacker can redirect the victim to
uncover the location or identity.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of
affected application modules.

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Qik Chat

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Devicename (iOS Settings)

Affected Module(s):
[+] Wifi / Bluetooth Chat Room


Note: The chat is marked as anonymous chat but the device name and
device values are transmitted in the chat
communication which allows to unmask adresses.
