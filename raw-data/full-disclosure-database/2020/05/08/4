Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql-injection vulnerability has been discovered in the official
creative zone web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject or execute own sql
commands to compromise the dbms
or file system of the application.

The remote sql injection web vulnerability is located in the id
parameter of the about.php panel file.
Remote attackers are able to inject and execute own malicious sql
commands as statement to compromise
the local database and affected management system. The request method to
inject/execute is GET and the
attack vector is client-side.

Exploitation of the remote sql injection vulnerability requires no user
interaction or privileged
web-application user account. Successful exploitation of the remote sql
injection results in database
management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] about.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
