Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered
in the official Tiny MySQL console web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with non-persistent attack vector to
compromise browser to web-application requests from the client-side.

The cross site scripting vulnerabilities are located in the `table`
parameter of the `tinymy.php` file. The request method
to inject the malicious script code is GET and the attack vector of the
vulnerability is non-persistent on client-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session
hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external
redirects to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of
affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] table


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The non-persistent web vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers without user account with low user interaction.
