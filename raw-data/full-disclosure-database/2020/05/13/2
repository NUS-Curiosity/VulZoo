Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in
the official Sellacious eCommerce Shop CMS (2020 Q1).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector to compromise
browser to web-application requests from the application-side.

The cross site web vulnerabilities are located in the all the adress
input fields of the `Manage Your Addresses` module.
Remote attackers are able to register a low privilege user account to
inject own malicious script code to the adress
information page. The execution of the script code occurs each time the
adress information is used in the web ui of
the ecommerce application. The request method to inject is POST and the
attack vector is persistent on the application-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of
affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Manage Your Addresses

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Full name
[+] First name
[+] Middle name
[+] Last name
[+] Company
[+] PO Box
[+] Address
