Subject: [FD] [KIS-2020-07] openSIS <= 7.4 (Bottom.php) Local File Inclusion
 Vulnerability

--------------------------------------------------------------
openSIS <= 7.4 (Bottom.php) Local File Inclusion Vulnerability
--------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

https://opensis.com/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 7.4 and prior versions.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the /Bottom.php script:

36.	if(clean_param($_REQUEST['modfunc'],PARAM_ALPHA)=='print')
37.	{
38.		$_REQUEST = $_SESSION['_REQUEST_vars'];
39.		$_REQUEST['_openSIS_PDF'] = true;
40.		if(strpos($_REQUEST['modname'],'?')!==false)
41.			$modname = 
substr($_REQUEST['modname'],0,strpos($_REQUEST['modname'],'?'));
42.		else
43.			$modname = $_REQUEST['modname'];
44.		ob_start();
45.		include('modules/'.$modname);

User input passed through the "modname" request parameter is not 
properly sanitized before being
used in a call to the "include()" function at line 45. This can be 
exploited to include arbitrary
local files and potentially access otherwise restricted functionalities 
or execute arbitrary PHP
code with the permissions of the webserver.


[-] Solution:

No official solution is currently available.
