Subject: [FD] [KIS-2020-06] openSIS <= 7.4 Incorrect Access Control
	Vulnerabilities

-------------------------------------------------------
openSIS <= 7.4 Incorrect Access Control Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

https://opensis.com/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 7.4 and prior versions.


[-] Vulnerabilities Description:

The application prevents unauthenticated access to its functionalities 
by including
the 'RedirectIncludes.php', 'RedirectModules.php', and 
'RedirectRootInc.php' scripts,
which implement the access control logic by using the following code:

if(!$_SESSION['STAFF_ID'] && !$_SESSION['STUDENT_ID'] && 
strpos($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'],'index.php')===false)
{
     header('Location: ../../../index.php');
     exit;
}

This can be easily bypassed by appending /index.php at the end of the 
URL, and can
be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to potentially access any 
application
functionality which should require the user to be authenticated.


[-] Solution:

No official solution is currently available.
