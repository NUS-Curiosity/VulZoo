*CVE-2020-11680
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11680>*

*Original Disclosure*
https://www.securitymetrics.com/blog/attackers-known-unknown-authorization-bypass

*Description*
The application does not perform an authorization check before
functionality is performed.  Low privileged users are prevented from
browsing to pages that perform Administrator functionality using GET,
however, functionality can be performed by directly crafting the associated
POST request.   This can be exploited to modify user accounts, modify the
application, etc.  Combined with the reported CSRF, CVE-2020-11682, any
user of the application can be used to grant Administrator access to a
malicious user.
-------------------------------
*CVE-2020-11681
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11681>*

*Original Disclosure*
https://www.securitymetrics.com/blog/attackers-known-unknown-authorization-bypass

*Description*
Credentials are returned in cleartext in the source of the SMTP page.  If a
malicious user compromises an account. or exploits the CSRF to gain access
to the application,  the associated SMTP server/account could also be
compromised.
-------------------------------
*CVE-2020-11682
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11682>*

*Original Disclosure*
https://www.securitymetrics.com/blog/where-did-request-come-from-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf

*Description*
The application does not properly prevent CSRF; the
__RequestVerificationToken, which is included with state changing requests,
is not verified by the application - requests are successful even when the
token is removed.
