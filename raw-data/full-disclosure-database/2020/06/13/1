Subject: [FD] TheBigIndexer - Index services and leaks over the ipv4 internet

Hi,

I'd like to share my new current project with you all :

https://leaks.nobody.run

It's a search engine indexing open hosts on the internet. It focuses on
listing the databases and table names and keeps history of every successful
connection.

New database software support is added on a regular basis.

It currently includes :

- mysql
- redis
- mongodb
- elasticsearch
- cassandra
- kafka
- couchdb
- mssql
