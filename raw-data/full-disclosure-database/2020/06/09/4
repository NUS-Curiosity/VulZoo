Subject: [FD] WebUntis: Stored XSS (Filter Bypass)

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
WebUntis 2020.12.1 - (Authenticated) Cross Site Scripting

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
WebUntis is a tool for schools and universities to deliver electronic timetables to their students. Depending from the activated modules it does also contain sensitive information within the integrated class-register and grade-book. Furthermore it supports private messaging.  

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
The private messaging component contains a persistent XSS vulnerability within the message body which allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim user's browser.

IV. History
-------------------------
The issue has been reported back in December 2019 to Untis GmbH. Against my advisories the vendor tried to fix the issue by implementing a Cross-Site-Scripting filter. Public (full) disclosure was on 22.03.2020. It turned out that the filter is not sufficient and can be easily bypassed.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
Send a new private message to any user within WebUntis containing the following message body:

<img src="test.jpg" / onerror="alert('XSS')">

Reading the message either on senders or on recipients account will cause the script to execute.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
The attacker is able to execute any JavaScript in the logged in users context. PoCs to manipulate grades and to steal API/OTP Tokens for full access using the mobile app exist.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
WebUntis <= 2020.12.1 (currently unfixed)

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Avoid using private messages.
