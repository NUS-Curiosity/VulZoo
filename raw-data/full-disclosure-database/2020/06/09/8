Subject: [FD] Web Application Firewall bypass - part 3

Hi
we have published the part 3 of "How to hack a company by circumventing 
its WAF for fun and profit". We basically show how the usage of a single 
character can be abused to skip common checks performed at layer 7 by 
network devices and security appliances.

Also another case where F5 Big-IP WAF is bypassed by means of SSRF is 
shown.

Full story here:
