Subject: [FD] Keystone Assembler Engine 0.9.2 is out!

Greetings,

We are very happy to announce a stable release, version 0.9.2, of
Keystone Assembler Engine!

This version fixes some important bugs inside the core of Keystone,
added some new bindings, and made various improvements, without
breaking compatibility. All users of Keystone are encouraged to
upgrade to v0.9.2.

Find more information on this release at

(In case you do not know, Keystone is an open source framework of
assemblers, which support multi-architecture, multi-platform &
multi-binding)

Thanks,
Quynh
