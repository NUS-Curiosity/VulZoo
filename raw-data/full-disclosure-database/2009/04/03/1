    http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20090325.txt

Description:
    Previous versions of OpenSSL were vulnerable to denial of
    service (crash) that could be caused when SSL enabled
    applications called the ASN1_STRING_print_ex function to print
    a BMPString or UniversalString.
    
    Additionally, previous versions of the OpenSSL package in rPath
    Linux 2 did not provide a unique shared object version compared
    to rPath Linux 1.  The m2crypto package has been rebuilt
    to depend on this new shared object version.  In certain unusual
    cases, updating from an operating system or software
    appliance based on rPath Linux 1 to a version based on
    rPath Linux 2 could fail the update.  Specifically, this would
    happen if the rPath Appliance Platform Agent was added to the
    list of critical updates.
