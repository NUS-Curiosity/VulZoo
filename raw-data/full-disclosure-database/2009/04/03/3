Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflows might allow for the execution of arbitrary
code when performing base64 conversion.

Background
==========

The GLib is a library of C routines that is used by a multitude of
programs.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/glib      < 2.18.4-r1                       >= 2.18.4-r1
                                                         *>= 2.16.6-r1

Description
===========

Diego E. PettenÃ² reported multiple integer overflows in glib/gbase64.c
when converting a long string from or to a base64 representation.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to perform a
base64 conversion via an application using GLib, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GLib 2.18 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/glib-2.18.4-r1"

All GLib 2.16 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/glib-2.16.6-r1"

==========
