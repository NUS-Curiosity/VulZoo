Synopsis
========

An untrusted search path vulnerability in Gnumeric might result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The Gnumeric spreadsheet is a versatile application developed as part
of the GNOME Office project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/gnumeric     < 1.8.4-r1                    >= 1.8.4-r1

Description
===========

James Vega reported an untrusted search path vulnerability in the
GObject Python interpreter wrapper in Gnumeric.

Impact
======

A local attacker could entice a user to run Gnumeric from a directory
containing a specially crafted python module, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Gnumeric.

Workaround
==========

Do not run "gnumeric" from untrusted working directories.

Resolution
==========

All Gnumeric users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/gnumeric-1.8.4-r1"
