Not exactly a hall-of-shame sort of mailing list, but we have
something similar at:
http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general

Or if you are only interested in Linux kernel-related security-relevant bugs:
http://search.gmane.org/?query=eugene+teo&author=&group=gmane.comp.security.oss.general&sort=date&DEFAULTOP=and&xP=Zeugen%09Zteo&xFILTERS=Gcomp.security.oss.general---A

Btw, Linux distributors only send out an advisory if they have fixed
something. As for the CIFS vulnerability, as Marcus has mentioned, a
fix is still being worked on. You can keep track of the progress here:

Thanks, Eugene
