Synopsis
========

An error in OpenSSL might allow for a Denial of Service when printing
certificate details.

Background
==========

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/openssl      < 0.9.8k                          >= 0.9.8k

Description
===========

The ASN1_STRING_print_ex() function does not properly check the
provided length of a BMPString or UniversalString, leading to an
invalid memory access.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to print a
specially crafted certificate, possibly leading to a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8k"

References
==========
