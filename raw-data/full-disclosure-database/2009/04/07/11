Subject: Opening Intranets to attack by using Internet
	Explorer [paper]


Hi

I just released a new paper:

Opening Intranets to attack by using Internet Explorer

Abstract
This document covers the topic of hacking Intranet websites through various unconventional means. Technical details shed light on the impact of default security configuration settings within Internet Explorer can be leveraged to attack internal Intranet websites remotely (from the Internet as well as remote users on the same LAN segment).

Enjoy.
