Subject: .NET Framework Rootkits

Hello,
Attached are the presentation + whitepaper I'm going to talk about at BlackHat conference next week in Amsterdam, titled ".NET Framework Rootkits - Backdoors inside Your Framework".

The main threats of Framework level rootkits are

 *   Hidden malware
 *   Applications behavioral changes
 *   Insider threats (such as developer backdoors)

Although the focus is on the .NET Framework, it is a general concept that is relevant to other platforms such as Java, PHP,Flash, Dlavik (Google Android) and more.

For more information, such as the ".NET-Sploit" tool used to demonstrate those attacks please visit

More info on the following Blackhat conference can be found here: https://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-europe-09/bh-eu-09-schedule.html

Regards,
Erez.
