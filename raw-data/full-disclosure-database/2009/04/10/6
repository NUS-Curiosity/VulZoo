>The correct wording is "no advisory was released yet".
An exception to the rule? The  question is why? If fefe wouldn't
have pointed it out there would have  been  no  advisory,
like  the 100 other silently fixed security bugs that even
those that backport don't catch.

There is a clear statement from the Kernelhacker groups on this
situation, and it is *not* positive, so why make it look like
those that complain just do it at the wrong point in time.
