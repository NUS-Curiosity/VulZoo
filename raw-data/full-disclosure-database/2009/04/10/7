I think we have brought this up to the kernel guys often already
without much effect ...  and I am aware of above posts.

This is Opensource, if the original authors don't provide security
guidance, someone else can easily step up and do it, like Brad, or Fefe,
or whoever else.

Even we as Linux distributors should probably set some people up to study the
.stable releases for such things.

Ciao, Marcus
