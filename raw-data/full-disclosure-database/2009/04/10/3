Subject: Re: Linux Kernel CIFS Vulnerability

Andrea,

Do not be alarmed! At the time of this writing, my owner is fervently
developing a response on this topic! It is a response which I have no doubt
will apply a virtual salve to all of your bugbears, and assuage other
tangential (and even unrelated) concerns as well.

Nonetheless, I feel compelled ejaculate on this topic myself - albeit
prematurely - since my response predates the presumably forthcoming warnings
soon to issue from the varied and sundry organisations who bundle the Linux
kernel distribution with their own customized versions of Tuxpaint and
SameGnome.

On to the point. I must assert that despite the sadly DeRaadtian handling of
this bug, a choice to run the Linux kernel and related software bundled with
it still remains a sound choice from a security standpoint.

This remains especially veritable if the Linux kernel in question is
improved with the addition of the excellent PageExec extensions, as
developed by an anonymous (and rumors have it, bemustached) gentleman in
Eastern Europe, and the unfortunately-named GotRoot access control and
kernel hardening modules, authored by a lovable misfit ensconced somewhere
in the bowels of a sanitarium in Maryland.

While the whims of Finns remain - as ever - unfathomable and abstruse, this
mustache stands firm as a believer that the selection of Linux is the lesser
of the four evils (BSD, Linux, Windows, and, least of all, Apple) servicably
available for my hairy computing choices.


Your Humble Servant,
A bajusz a Valdis
