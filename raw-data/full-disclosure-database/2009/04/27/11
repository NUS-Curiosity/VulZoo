Subject: About HSM

Hi,

 

First of all sorry for my poor English. I've been working with security for
many years now, but I never had any experience with HSM (hardware security
model) before. Since I started to look the available solutions on the
market, I came up with two different types: PKI HSM and EFT (or EMV) HSM.

 

I'm quite ok with the functionalities of the first one, but what I can't
find more (good) information is about the second type and the real
differences between their crypto algorithms (I mean what exactly are the
differences).  I'm also in a big doubt about the products from Safenet and
Thales, and why they have such a big difference in their prices?

 

I googled a lot searching for vendor-independent information on HSM, but
couldn't find any good stuff.

 

 

Thanks in advance,

-klaw
