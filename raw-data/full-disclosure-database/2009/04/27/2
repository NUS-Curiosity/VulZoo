I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quote: "Avira AntiVir is a reliable free antivirus solution, that constantly 
and rapidly scans your computer for malicious programs such as viruses, 
Trojans, backdoor programs, hoaxes, worms, dialers etc. Monitors 
every action executed by the user or the operating system and reacts 
promptly when a malicious program is detected.

The protection experts have numerous company locations throughout 
Germany and cultivate partnerships in Europe, Asia and America. 
Avira has more than 180 employees at their main office in Tettnang 
near Lake Constance and is one of
the largest employers in the region. There are around 250 people 
employed worldwide whose commitment is continually being confirmed 
by awards. A significant contribution to protection is the Avira 
AntiVir Personal which is being used by private users a million 
times over.

AV-Comparatives e.V. have chosen Avira AntiVir Premium as the 
best anti-virus solution of 2008"


II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The parsing engine can be bypassed by a specially crafted and formated
CAB archive. Details are currently witheld due to other vendors that are 
in process of deploying patches.

III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~
A general description of the impact and nature of AV Bypasses/evasions
can be read at : 
http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

The bug results in denying the engine the possibility to inspect
code within the CAB archive. There is no inspection of the content
at all and hence the impossibility to detect malicious code.
