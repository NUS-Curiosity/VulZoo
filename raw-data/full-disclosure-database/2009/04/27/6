Subject: SumatraPDF <= 0.9.3 Heap Overflow PoC


The overflow occurs at the following location:

mupdf/mupdf/pdf_function.c:1167

    obj = fz_dictgets(dict, "C0");
    if (fz_isarray(obj))
    {
        func->n = fz_arraylen(obj);
        for (i = 0; i < func->n; ++i)
            func->u.e.c0[i] = fz_toreal(fz_arrayget(obj, i));
    }

func->n is used without being checked first. There are a few integer
overflows elsewhere in the code as well.
