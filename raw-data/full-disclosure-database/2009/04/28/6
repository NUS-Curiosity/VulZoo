Vulnerability Description

-------------------------

Certain Precidia Ether232 devices contain memory overwrite and
authentication flaws.

 

By making malformed GET requests to the built-in web server on certain
Precidia Ether232 devices, it is possible to arbitrarily overwrite
memory on the device and cause unknown impact.

 

Solution Description

--------------------

At this point in time, Precidia Technologies has not provided a firmware
upgrade addressing the memory corruption flaw. As a workaround, Precidia
Technologies suggests that users disable the web server on the device
through the serial or telnet configuration interface.

 

Tested Systems / Software (with versions)

------------------------------------------

Precidia Ether3201-232 w/ firmware 3.00.250

Precidia Ether232 Duo w/ firmware 5.00.02

Other versions are believed to be vulnerable.
