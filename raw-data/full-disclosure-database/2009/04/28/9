Subject: one shot remote root for linux?

Sometimes news finds us in mysterious yet obvious ways.

HD set a status which I noticed on my twitter:

@hdmoore reading through sctp_houdini.c - one-shot remote linux kernel
root - http://kernelbof.blogspot.com/

I asked him about it on IM, wondering if it is real:
"looks like that
but requires a sctp app to be running"

Naturally, I retweeted.

Signed,
