Subject: Re: Firefox 3.0.8 remote DoS: 0-day exploit

...sigh....

This is https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=456727, which I
reported to Mozilla in September of 2009. It is a NULL ptr DoS, there is no
"exploit" in the sense of executing arbitrary code, just a "repro" that can
trigger a crash. The repro provided by Carl is the exact same repro I
provided to Mozilla.

Incidentally, Carl has report this exact same bug before:
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Jan/0219.html. This is how the repro
got on milw0rm in the first place (http://milw0rm.com/exploits/8091). Aditya
K Sood later submitted the repro (slightly modified) to milw0rm as his code
as well (http://milw0rm.com/exploits/8219).

Some say plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, so I guess I'll start
obfuscating my repros into ASCII art that says "SkyLined" to prevent any
more people from flattering me.

Cheers,
Sky
