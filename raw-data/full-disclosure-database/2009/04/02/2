	Deadline April 7 	2009)

HI Drago,
i didn't get a respose for my earlier mails. I would like to submit my talk
"Recent Advancements in SQL Injection Injection Exploitation Technique". I
gave this talk earlier at OWASP Appsec Au 2009, where it was very well
received. The talk has a number of demos which makes it very enjoyable.
Lemme know if you wish to include this. I am based in London.Here is the
full agenda:

Abstract

 This talk will cover different aspects of SQL Injection techniques and will
highlight why every SQL Injection is unique. Starting with the very basics
the talk will get more and more complex and will discuss exploiting SQL
injections which seem to be un-exploitable. Numerous examples will be
presented when the SQL Injection vulnerability will go undetected even by
leading scanning software costing $$. A very common vulnerability will be
shown along with a google dork which will return several "top" websites
vulnerable. Further, a new technique of exploiting SQL Injection in Oracle
to hack internal networks will be discussed. The Talk will also discuss a
number of SQL injection tools and will prove why tools can still not replace
a human pen tester.

 Outline:-

 *What is SQL Injections (yawn...)
*Type Of SQL Injections (yawn...)
*Identifying SQL injections (Identification.......time to wake up..)
*xp_cmdshell is disabled, wtf....(exploitation)
*whats xp_cmdshell alternative on mysql and oracle..(Exploitation)
*Blind SQL Injections (exploitation/identification)
*Deep Blind Injection (exploitation/identification)
*Time Delay Functions & beyond (exploitation)
* UTF7 encoding, magic quotes etc.
*Avoiding Time Delay Functions (exploitation)
*Convert Time Dealy to blind Injections (Exploitation)
* Injection in order by,group by and limit clause (Exploitation
.&.Surprise!!)
*Out Of Band Channels (Exploitation)
*Using Oracle's SQL Injection(UTL_HTTP) to own internal SQL server (
Exploitation)
*Exploiting Internal hidden networks (Exploitation)
* Can your tool detect these

 Why should you include this talk:-
 1. As more and more injection tools are available in the market, this talk
will help the audience choose the right tool for the right injection.

 2. The oracle's utl_http method to sploit internal networks is cutting edge
and no-one has ever talked about it, in the context i will talk.

 3. Its fun, everyone loves sql injection, and its not a talk, its all demo
and people will love to see the oracle sql injection returning a shell from
a ms-sql server.


 About me:-
I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 2005, and after working for NII Consulting
for about a year i have shifted to U.K, where i work for Portcullis Computer
Security. I have been a speaker at many conferences and my articles and
advisories are available on various security websites.I also own the website
www.notsosecure.com .

 /* I will probably rewrite the bio later */

 Thanks
Sid
