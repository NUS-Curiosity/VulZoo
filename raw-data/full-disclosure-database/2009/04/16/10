1) Affected Software 

* Danske Bank Danske e-Sec Control Module ActiveX control 
  (DanskeSikker.ocx) version 3.1.0.48.

Impact: System compromise
Where:  Remote

====================================================================== 
3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Danske Bank Danske
e-Sec Control Module ActiveX control, which can be exploited by
malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by a boundary error in DanskeSikker.ocx
within an error logging function. This can be exploited to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow by passing overly long input to certain
methods when the ActiveX control has been initialised in a specific 
manner.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when e.g.
visiting a malicious web site.

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Set the kill-bit for the ActiveX control.

The vendor is reportedly working on a fix.
