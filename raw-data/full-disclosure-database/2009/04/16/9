Oh Anthony,

Why do you rip off other peoples work and claim it as your own? ...

Do you think we live under a rock and don't know this technique has been
around for a long time? See the comments on
http://www.darkreading.com/security/vulnerabilities/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=216500687for
a better idea...

You are a joke and a cancer on this industry. You steal others work, try and
claim it as your own in order to drive sales to your company.



Fuck you and die, you motherless cunt.
