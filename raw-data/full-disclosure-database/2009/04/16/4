Subject: KON-BOOT for Windows and Linux (Password
	Bypassing Utility for Forgetting Heads)

Hello,

As one of my past projects for KryptosLogic[1] Kon-Boot was moved to Windows
platforms. So now it provides support for Microsoft Windows systems and also
the Linux systems covered in previous releases. Kon-Boot for Windows enables
logging in to any password protected machine profile >>> without without any
knowledge of the password <<<. This tool changes the contents of Windows
kernel while booting, everything is done virtually - without any
interferences with physical system changes. So far following Windows systems
were tested to work correctly with Kon-Boot (however its quite possible
other versions of listed Windows systems may be suitable as well):

Currently supported Microsoft windows systems:
+ Windows Server 2008 Standard SP2 (v.275)
+ Windows Vista Business SP0
+ Windows Vista Ultimate SP1
+ Windows Vista Ultimate SP0
+ Windows Server 2003 Enterprise
+ Windows XP
+ Windows XP SP1
+ Windows XP SP2
+ Windows XP SP3
+ Windows 7


Kon-Boot also works with virtual machines like VMware or VirtualPC.

No special usage instructions are required for Windows users, just boot from
Kon-Boot CD/Floppy, select your profile and put any password you want. You
lost your password? Now it doesnt matter at all :-)


You can download Kon-Boot Windows&Linux version from the project website:

You may use this software only for personal, legal and non-commercial
activity.


best regards,
