Subject: Introducing RMBSS - "Risk Metrics Budgetary
	Scoring System"


Infiltrated Research Group is proud to introduce RMBSS "Risk Metrics
Budgetary Scoring System". A synergy of best practices frameworks
that synchronizes industry known security frameworks for more
thorough Risk Assessments and Analysis. The concept was born out
of the need for Information Security Managers (CSO's/CIO's/CISO's)
to realize value added security metrics. While our initial version is in its
preliminary stages, we're confident that our improved methods of
security correlation events in an architecture will guarantee proven
actionable security results.
