4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered three vulnerabilities in UltraISO, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's 
system.

1) A boundary error when parsing CIF files can be exploited to 
overflow a global buffer by tricking a user into opening a specially 
crafted CIF file.

2) A boundary error when parsing C2D files can be exploited to 
overflow a global buffer by tricking a user into opening a specially 
crafted C2D file.

3) Insufficient validation when parsing GI files can be exploited to
overflow a global buffer by tricking a user into opening a specially 
crafted GI file.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

5) Solution 

Update to 9.3.3.2685.
