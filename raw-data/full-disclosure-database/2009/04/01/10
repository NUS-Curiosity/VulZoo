Call For Papers

    The EUSecWest 2009 CFP is now open.

    Deadline is April 7th, 2009.

EUSecWest CALL FOR PAPERS

    LONDON, U.K. -- The third annual EUSecWest applied
    technical security conference - where the eminent figures
    in the international security industry will get together
    share best practices and technology - will be held in
    downtown London at the Sound Club in Leicester Square
    on May 27/28, 2009. The most significant new discoveries
    about computer network hack attacks and defenses,
    commercial security solutions, and pragmatic real world
    security experience will be presented in a series of
    informative tutorials.

    The EUSecWest meeting provides international researchers
    a relaxed, comfortable environment to learn from
    informative tutorials on key developments in security
    technology, and collaborate and socialize with their peers
    in one of the world's most most important technology
    hubs and scenic cities. The timing of the conference
    allows international travelers to travel to Berlin for
    FX's Ph-Neutral on the weekend, and Rennes the 
    following week for SSTIC.

    We would like to announce the opportunity to submit
    papers, and/or lightning talk proposals for selection by
    the EUSecWest technical review committee. This year we
    will be doing one hour talks, and some shorter talk
    sessions.

    Please make your paper proposal submissions before
    April 7th, 2009.

    Some invited papers have been confirmed, but a limited
    number of speaking slots are still available. The
    conference is responsible for travel and accommodations for
    the speaker (one speaker airfare and one room). If you 
    have a proposal for a tutorial session then please email 
    a synopsis of the material and your biography, papers 
    and, speaking background to secwest09 [at] eusecwest.com . 
    Only slides will be needed for the paper deadline, full text 
    does not have to be submitted - but will be accepted if 
    available. 

    The EUSecWest 2009 conference consists of tutorials on
    technical details about current issues, innovative
    techniques and best practices in the information security
    realm. The audiences are a multi-national mix of
    professionals involved on a daily basis with security
    work: security product vendors, programmers, security
    officers, and network administrators. We give preference
    to technical details and new education for a technical
    audience.

    The conference itself is a single track series of
    presentations in a lecture theater environment. The
    presentations offer speakers the opportunity to showcase
    on-going research and collaborate with peers while
    educating and highlighting advancements in security
    products and techniques. The focus is on innovation,
    tutorials, and education instead of product pitches. Some
    commercial content is tolerated, but it needs to be backed
    up by a technical presenter - either giving a valuable
    tutorial and best practices instruction or detailing
    significant new technology in the products.

    Paper proposals should consist of the following
    information:
     1. Presenter, and geographical location (country of
        origin/passport) and contact info (e-mail, postal
        address, phone, fax).
     2. Employer and/or affiliations.
     3. Brief biography, list of publications and papers.
     4. Any significant presentation and educational
        experience/background.
     5. Topic synopsis, Proposed paper title, and a one
        paragraph description.
     6. Reason why this material is innovative or significant
        or an important tutorial.
     7. Optionally, any samples of prepared material or
        outlines ready.
     8. Will you have full text available or only slides?
     9. Language of preference for submission.
    10. Please list any other publications or conferences
        where this material has been or will be
        published/submitted.

    Please include the plain text version of this information
    in your email as well as any file, pdf, sxw, ppt, or html
    attachments.

    Please forward the above information to secwest09 [at]
    eusecwest.com to be considered for placement on the
    speaker roster, or have your lightning talk scheduled. If
    you contact anyone else at our organization please ensure
    you also cc the submission address with your proposal or
    it may be omitted from the review process.
