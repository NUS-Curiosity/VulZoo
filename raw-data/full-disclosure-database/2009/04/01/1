   Extended support for ESX 3.0.2 Update 1 ends on 2009-08-08.
   Users should plan to upgrade to ESX 3.0.3 and preferably to
   the newest release available.

3. Problem Description

 a. Updated OpenSSL package for the Service Console fixes a
    security issue.

    OpenSSL 0.9.7a-33.24 and earlier does not properly check the return
    value from the EVP_VerifyFinal function, which could allow a remote
    attacker to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a
    malformed SSL/TLS signature for DSA and ECDSA keys.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-5077 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch

    ESX            2.5.5     ESX      affected, patch pending

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 b. Update bind package for the Service Console fixes a security issue.

    A flaw was discovered in the way Berkeley Internet Name Domain
    (BIND) checked the return value of the OpenSSL DSA_do_verify
    function. On systems using DNSSEC, a malicious zone could present
    a malformed DSA certificate and bypass proper certificate
    validation, allowing spoofing attacks.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-0025 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch
    =============  ========  =======  =================
    VirtualCenter  any       Windows  not affected

    hosted *       any       any      not affected

    ESXi           3.5       ESXi     not affected

    ESX            3.5       ESX      affected, patch pending
    ESX            3.0.3     ESX      ESX303-200903405-SG
    ESX            3.0.2     ESX      ESX-1008408
    ESX            2.5.5     ESX      affected, patch pending

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 c. Updated vim package for the Service Console addresses several
    security issues.

    Several input flaws were found in Visual editor IMproved's (Vim)
    keyword and tag handling. If Vim looked up a document's maliciously
    crafted tag or keyword, it was possible to execute arbitrary code as
    the user running Vim.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-4101 to this issue.

    A heap-based overflow flaw was discovered in Vim's expansion of file
    name patterns with shell wildcards. An attacker could create a
    specially crafted file or directory name, when opened by Vim causes
    the application to stop responding or execute arbitrary code.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-3432 to this issue.

    Several input flaws were found in various Vim system functions. If a
    user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to execute
    arbitrary code as the user running Vim.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-2712 to this issue.

    A format string flaw was discovered in Vim's help tag processor. If
    a user was tricked into executing the "helptags" command on
    malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed with the
    permissions of the user running VIM.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2007-2953 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch

    ESX            3.5       ESX      affected, patch pending
    ESX            3.0.3     ESX      ESX303-200903403-SG

    ESX            2.5.5     ESX      affected, patch pending
