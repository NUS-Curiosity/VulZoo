You're not correct, sorry.  Or maybe you're just confused about the
question... 
  I don't know of any AV products running on the host operating system that
will scan within a virtual machine.  You have to run AV on the virtual
machine itself in order for anything downloaded to be scanned/cleaned.

  What products do you claim that only have to be installed on the host
machine?

That is simply not true.  AVs can see inside VM images, and scan the files.
The user can also install the AV inside the VM, which will also see the
files.
