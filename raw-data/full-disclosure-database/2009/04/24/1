http://www.mseclab.com/index.php?page_id=148

Published:
2009-04-23

Updated:

Vendor:
Samsung


Vulnerability Details
---------------------
Class:
Authentication Bypass

Remote:
Yes

Local:
No

Public References:
Not Assigned

Affected:
Samsung M8800 Innov8
Samsung SGH-J750

Not Affected:
Unknown

Description:
Affected devices do not perform proper authentication of incoming SMS
Provisioning messages.

The following behaviors have been verified on affected devices:

1.Source of provisioning message is never displayed to user.

2.Unauthenticated SMS Provisioning messages, where SEC and MAC
parameters are not present in the message, are accepted. User is not
made aware that the received provisioning message is not authenticated.

3.Authenticated SMS Provisioning messages, where SEC and MAC parameters
are present in the message, are accepted, but the parameters are not
used for performing the security checks.

More specifically:

USERPIN authenticated provisioning message: device installs the received
configuration without performing any message authentication. PIN Code is
never asked to user and is not required for completing the installation.
The installation is correctly performed and the configuration is
installed as default.

NETWPIN authenticated provisioning messages: device installs the
received configuration without performing any message authentication.
Sender does not need to know the correct IMSI value in order to let the
device accepts the message as correct. The configuration will be
installed regardless of the MAC value present in the message.

By sending provisioning messages in one of the above specified ways, an
attacker could pose as a legitimate trusted source and entice a victim
into installing a malicious configuration.
Such an attack could lead to the hijacking of mobile data connections
originated  by the device.
