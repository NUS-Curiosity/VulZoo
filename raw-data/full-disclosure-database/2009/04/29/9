         First International Alternative Workshop on Aggressive
Computing and Security

                                 The no-limit workshop

     "Enhancing security with the attacker’s mind – Orthodoxy and self
confidence are weaknesses"
          "There is no such thing as forbidden knowledge, only forbidden
use of knowledge"

                                        iAWACS

                                ESIEA - Laval - October 2009

Thinking security can not be done without adopting a preferential mode
of thought of the attacker.
A system cannot be defended if we do not know how to attack it. If the
theory is still an interesting
approach to formalize things, the operational approach must be the
ultimate goal: to talk about
security is meaningless if we do not actually do security. In recent
years the major security
conferences in the subjects preferred to select papers according to
fashion topics, conforming to
something like orthodoxy and organize selection as beauty contests. As a
result excellent yet
unorthodox scientific papers are often rejected and sink into oblivion.
The first international
Alternative Workshop in Aggressive Computing and Security (iAWACS'09)
aims to focus on this vision and
to allow researchers and specialists to present relevant research works,
with interesting results and
operational (theoretical and/or applied) in the field of security. The
different points of view, away
from unconventional fashion and orthodoxy are particularly welcome. The
aim is also to promote
discussion of ideas around these topics.

Articles submitted will be selected according to the following criteria:
# Interest and scientific/technical correctness/accuracy,
# New results,
# Operational quality

Regarding this last point, the authors should give all information and
conditions for reproducibility
of results they intend to present. This may include, during the
selection phase by the reviewers,
assessments based on challenges to the authors by the reviewers. iAwacs
is not just another hackers
workshop where the last exploit is disclosed. The aim of the conference
is to make security concepts
evolves through both the attacker’s view AND a thorough formalization
backed by experimental results.

The main topics covered (list not exhaustive) are:
# Cryptanalysis techniques
# Steganalysis techniques
# Malicious cryptography
# Advances computer virology techniques (malware, backdoor…)
# Active security product analysis and testing
# Active security auditing
# Mathematical concepts and applications with respect to the attacker’s view
# Cyberwarfare techniques
# Cryptographic and steganography techniques
# Invisible trap/bacdoor techniques in algorithms and applications
# Implementation attacks
# Interception/eavesdropping techniques
# Forensics and anti-forensics techniques
# Tempest and anti-tempest techniques
# InfoOps techniques
# Satellite hijacking

Articles should be submitted in electronic format, preferably in LaTeX
format, in English. Submission
of Word/OOwriter documents is accepted. The address for submission is
iawacs2009@...ea.fr. Submissions
under hidden identities or aliases are not allowed.A technical challenge
will be organized during the
conference. Attendees who want to participate must register on site. For
this first edition, the theme
we have chosen is "Evaluation against active antivirus software to
evaluate their resistance to
removal by a malicious code." All results will be shared with publishers
of antivirus concerned. The
technical details of the challenge will be announced later.

Important dates :
# Submission deadline: July 15th, 2009
# Notification deadline: August 20th, 2009
# Final manuscript submission for inclusion into the proceedings:
September 20th, 2009
# Conference dates: October 23rd – 25th, 2009

The conference proceedings will be published with ISBN by the Presses
Techniques ESIEA. They will be
given to registered participants at the conference and can then be
bought on the conference homepage.
The conference will be held at Ecole Supérieure en Informatique,
Electronique et Automatique, in Laval
from Friday 23rd to Sunday 25th, 2009 morning. Each author will have 45
minutes of speaking time, each
presentation will be followed by a technical discussion between speakers
and listeners. Laval is nice
medieval city located 250 km west from Paris and can be reach by high
speed train (TGV) from Paris
International Airport. Conference registration amount to 400 euros
(includes coffee breaks, lunches,
cocktail reception, social events on Friday evening and Saturday
evening, the conference, shuttle bus
between the hotels and the conference venue).
