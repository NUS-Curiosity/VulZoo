Valdis,
Being overly verbose and using a plethora of asterisks does not enhance
the validity of your statement. I didn't bother reading your statement
due to its unnecessary length. Simply focus less on speaking for the
"community" and confine your scope to your personal opinion. Thanks.

Sincerely,
D
