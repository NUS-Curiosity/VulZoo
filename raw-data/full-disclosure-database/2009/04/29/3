Subject: Anti virus installations on Windows servers

Did some searching, the internet does not seem to know who is the best 
anti virus.

    They like ESET Nod32 Antivirus 4

    They like McAffee Antivirus, but they also like Nod32 and Kaspersky

As security professionals that need decent protection, what is your 
virus solution?

Is it a different answer for your server and your desktop?
