Subject: SQL Injection in Rogue Anti-Malware Group's
	Control Panel

Dear Full-Disclosure,

Since F-Secure, Kaspersky, Symantec, SecurityFocus and Secunia apparently
don't care about fake anti-virus authors, I'm giving you this awesome, yet
simple flaw that will give you access to their main control panel.

========
!background
========
I originally found this while doing some very basic reversing of the hoax
antivirus called MalwareRemovalBot.

The affiliate group that controls many rogue anti-malware software has a SQL
injection vulnerability in their control panel that hosts all their sites.
This control panel, is also hosted on a domain that is controlled by the
rogue group. On the control panel, resides a user list, malware search,
definition search, settings, statistics, archives, various databases, and
TODO lists. The group is frequently featured on the F-Secure Weblog at
http://www.f-secure.com/weblog
Details follow below:

The main control panel for the group:

With the 'trivial' SQL injection flaw:

Password: ' OR 1=1--

There are also other PHP flaws that were on the 2squared.com domain,
however, I could not exploit them. Such as this:

Have fun eXpl0iting,

Sad nobody gives a shit when somebody could actually take this shit down,
legitimately.
