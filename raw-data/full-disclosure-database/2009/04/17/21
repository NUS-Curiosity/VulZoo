Subject: Re: dev mem injection

Mark,

I will not presume to speculate as to the intent of Mssr. Lineberry or on
the veracity of his claims (indeed, the posted diffs speak very well for
themselves), beyond confirming, as Dr. Spengler has, that GRSec indeed has
contained protections against spurious writes to /dev/mem and /dev/kmem
since the beginning of this millenium. [1]

Still, I must rise to the defense of Anthony's fabulous and highly-regarded
mustache [2] [3].

Anthony's mustache is quite well respected among the security mustache
community, a sine qua non of facial hair accoutrement that is beyond
reproach! Such fine bristles! Such symmetry! So well framed with a matching
unruly mane! So nicely peppered with a fine yellowy nicotine patina from the
ever-present Newport burning to its south! Truly, a mustache to be
remembered in story and song.

If Anthony has been led astray by the lure of hacker fame and its requisite
trappings (Asian girlfriends, ready access to Ritalin, and Syngress
authorship), I assure you, his mustache had little to do with it.

I have sent missives to Anthony's mustache through various means (I believe
its wearer is currently somewhere near a hashish bar in Amsterdam), and have
also sent inquiries to the greater Los Angeles security mustache community,
to be delivered upon the mustache's return to the United States.

It is my fervent hope that Anthony's mustache will weigh in on this matter
shortly, and clear up any misunderstanding.



[1] I understand other LSM-enabled kernel security projects integrated
similar /dev/mem protections as well, once requisite SELinux compatibility
updates (to support hooking via SMM) were made to CIPAV and other CIA and
NSA-managed rootkits.

Your Humble Servant,
De Mustache van Valdis
