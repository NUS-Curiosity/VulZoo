Subject: BH USA CFP closing next Tuesday

Hey guys, just a reminder that the CFP for Black Hat USA is closing next Tuesday.

I'll post the first batch of acceptances next week.. some really solid stuff this year from hacking ATM machines and lock picking forensics to Injecting agents into VM guest OS and myths of Extended Validation SSL certificates.
