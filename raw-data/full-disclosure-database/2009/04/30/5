If the teacher is doing anything that a condom actually makes a difference,
he's doing something wrong, and the condom is the least of the problem.

Similarly, if your security design has anti-virus actually making a difference,
that means your security design is almost certainly wrong.

No, if he keeps it in his pants like he's supposed to, he doesn't need to worry.

But if he gets his jollies with a hot glue gun, he's welcome to do so  on his
own time.
