 muxatmd Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.15.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 15, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

IBM's AIX is a Unix operating system based on System V, which runs on
the PowerPC (PPC) architecture. For more information, visit the product
web site at the following URL.

http://www.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in IBM Corp.'s
Advanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) could allow an attacker to gain
root privileges.

The set-uid root binary "muxatmd" concatenates the calling program name
with the static string ".pid". The destination buffer passed to the
function call used for concatenation is a static-sized stack buffer.
Since no bounds checking is performed, a stack-based buffer overflow
can occur when a long program name is given.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code
as root. An attacker would need to construct a malicious application
that runs the "muxatmd" program with a malformed parameter.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in IBM
Corp.'s AIX version 5.3 (5300-09-02-0849). Other versions may also be
affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Removing the set-uid bit from the "/usr/sbin/muxatmd" binary will
provide a workaround for this issue. However, this will make the
program unusable for non-root users.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

IBM has released a patch which addresses this issue. For more
information, consult their advisory at the following URL:
