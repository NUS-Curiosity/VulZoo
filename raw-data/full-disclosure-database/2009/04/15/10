4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in the Oracle BEA
WebLogic Server plug-ins for web servers, which can be exploited by
malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.

The Oracle BEA WebLogic Server can be configured to receive requests
via an Apache web server. In this case, a plug-in is installed in the
Internet-facing web server that passes the request to a WebLogic
server. 

The Apache web server may be configured to accept SSL connections and
forward the request to the WebLogic server along with any SSL-related
information. If the SSL client supplies a certificate (and the Apache
server is configured to accept it), then the certificate is passed to
the WebLogic plug-in via an environment variable.

The vulnerability is caused by a boundary error when parsing 
certificates and can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer 
overflow by supplying a specially crafted certificate.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Apply patches released by the vendor.
