Subject: SniffJoke 0.3 release and request for feedback

Some days ago I've relased this:

SniffJoke is a "connection scrambler" for Linux with the purpose of
preventing packet sniffers from reassemble network sessions of the user.
The "sniffer evasion" technology is well known since almost 10 years.
SniffJoke implements the most efficents techniques. Using a local fake
tunnel it is able to manage outgoing and ingoing packets without
disturbing the kernel. With the local web interface the user can easily
start/stop and configure SniffJoke. At the moment, Wireshark, the most
famous packet analyzer, is unable to correctly reconstruct TCP flow
mangled by SniffJoke. I would like to update the list of victim
sniffers, so please send me a report if you test SniffJoke with other
network protocol analyzers.
