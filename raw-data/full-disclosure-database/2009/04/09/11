4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Ghostscript, which 
can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the included 
jbig2dec library while decoding JBIG2 symbol dictionary segments. 
This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a 
specially crafted PDF file.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
