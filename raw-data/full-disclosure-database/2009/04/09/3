Addendum:  Read  the  reasoning  behind  it here, it is so funny you'd
think it must be a joke or something. His logic is in essence: once we fixed
a security bug it is no longer a security bug and not worth a mention.
It is clear that that guy never managed a single network that had more
than  200  servers  nor has *any*  real  enterprise  experience in terms of
security.
