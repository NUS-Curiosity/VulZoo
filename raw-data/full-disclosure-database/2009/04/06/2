Subject: News paper article > who is the greatest Hacker?

Hello all - please excuse the off-topic ride.

I need for a NP article a list of top-five actual hackers ( I mean Hacker, not security expert ;)).
A sort of wall of fame, only screen name.
Would one be kind enough to make replie directly to my mailbox, to limit
the list pollution?

Thanks.
