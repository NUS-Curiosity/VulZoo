TPTI-09-02: VMWare VMnc Codec Open-DML Standard Index dwSize Heap Overflow
Vulnerability
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-09-02
April 6, 2009

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2009-0910

-- Affected Vendors:
VMWare, Inc.

-- Affected Products:
VMWare, Inc. VMWare Server
VMWare, Inc. VMWare ACE
VMWare, Inc. VMWare Player
VMWare, Inc. VMWare Workstation

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of multiple VMWare products. User interaction
is required in that a user must visit a malicious web page or open a
malicious video file.

Upon installation VMWare Workstation, Server, Player, and ACE register
vmnc.dll as a video codec driver to handle compression and decompression
of the fourCC type 'VMnc'. This format is used primarily by Workstation
to capture remote framebuffer recordings of sessions within a virtual
machine. The resulting video is stored within an AVI container file.
While playing back such files the function responsible for handling
ICM_DECOMPRESS driver messages implicitly trusts a size value while
decompressing a frame. Specifically, the dwSize element within an
Open-DML standard index RIFF chunk is used as an argument to a memcpy
into a static heap buffer. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary
code on the host system under the context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:
VMWare, Inc. has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
