I recognize most of those as security updates.  Are you on the
ubuntu security announce list?  It looks like everything installed fine.
Since it installed the openssh-client, you may want to turn off the bits
for:

/usr/bin/ssh
/usr/bin/scp
/usr/bin/ssh-add
/usr/bin/ssh-agent
/usr/bin/ssh-keygen
/usr/bin/ssh-keyscan
/usr/bin/sftp
/usr/bin/ssh-vulnkey
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id
/usr/bin/ssh-argv0
