Time line
''''''''''
    * 14/03/2009 : Send proof of concept, description the terms under which I cooperate and the planned disclosure date. There is no security adress listed at [1] and hence took the industry standard security contacts addresses secure@ and security@. secure@...st.de, secure@...il.com, security@...il.com security@...st.de

      No reply.

    * 10/04/2009 : Resending specifying this is the last attempt to disclose reponsibly. This time two known contact adresses that were previously used to report vulnerabilities were used: secalert@...st.com, vlk@...st.com

      No reply.

    * 17/04/2009 : Release of this advisory and begin of grace period.

    * 17/04/2009 : Avast replies quoting the mail sent on the 14/03/2009 and claims that this is a non issue because the POC would not correctly decompress.

    * 17/04/2009: Reply that the POC works as expected and asked why there has been no reaction to previous notifications.

      No reply.

    * 20/04/2009: Asked for patch timeline and affected version

    * 20/04/2009: Avast replies that all versions and all product ranges are affected, however "There's currently no plan to release a special patch for this as our risk assessment makes it a very low priority issue."

    * 20/04/2009: Replied that Avast can assesses the risk to loose customers and money; not the entire cumulated risk their customers run in specific environments.
