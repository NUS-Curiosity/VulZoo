Subject: udev exploit - SECURITYFOCUS.COM edits your
	exploits

Hello people for some reason someone on securityfocus.com thinks he or
sheÂ´s a genuis.
The exploit at
http://www.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Full-Disclosure/2009-04/msg00204.html
and
http://downloads.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities/exploits/34536.sh
differ so much that the exploit is even not compilable.
Look at the inserted EOF's ..

Dirty little security industry.
Use the exploit at full disclosure and forget about the other.

Cherrio,
kcope
