Subject: Re: Virtual Machine Trojans: a new type of threat?

Hi there,
	A very important point is, according the VMware recommendation, to get a better performance we should insert the vmware files on the exception of AV, on the other hand, we (Trend Micro) are developing a new AV to work direct on the VMWare Kernel (linux).

	Regards,

You do not need "root access" or a virtual machine to craft a custom-made
trojan. This means we can simplify the question as follows: Can antivirus
prevent an arbitrary piece of malicious code from entering the network?

And the answer is simple: No, it cannot. Stop fastening screws with a
hammer. It has never worked.
