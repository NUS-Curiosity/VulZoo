Synopsis
========

Multiple errors in LittleCMS allow for attacks including the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

LittleCMS, or short lcms, is a color management system for working with
ICC profiles. It is used by many applications including GIMP and
Firefox.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/lcms      < 1.18-r1                         >= 1.18-r1

Description
===========

RedHat reported a null-pointer dereference flaw while processing
monochrome ICC profiles (CVE-2009-0793).

Chris Evans of Google discovered the following vulnerabilities:

* LittleCMS contains severe memory leaks (CVE-2009-0581).

* LittleCMS is prone to multiple integer overflows, leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-0723).

* The ReadSetOfCurves() function is vulnerable to stack-based buffer
  overflows when called from code paths without a bounds check on
  channel counts (CVE-2009-0733).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted file containing a malicious ICC profile, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application or memory exhaustion, leading to a Denial
of Service condition.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All LittleCMS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/lcms-1.18-r1"
