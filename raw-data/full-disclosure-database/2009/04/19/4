Subject: Advanced Oracle Sql Injection

Hi guys:

Sometimes we meet Oracle database when we do web sql injection testing. All
we do is to dump some data in the db. But you know what? Actually, we can do
more and more operation of it, just like:
1?Fast data dumping even cannot use union select
2?Dump server information like : db name, sid, real internet ip address,
user list, user hash and so on.
3?Execute PL/SQL
4?Privilege escalation
5?Crack user password
6?Execute system command
7?Install oracle rootkit
8?and so many others

Maybe you could say it cannot execute multi-sql through a single query.
Don't worry. There is a demo at
http://down2.nosec.org/swf/pangolin_oracle.html, you can watch it and learn
a lot of things about Oracle sql injection.

Please visit http://www.nosec.org for more information. Good luck ;)
