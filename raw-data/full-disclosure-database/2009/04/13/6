Package        : imp4
Vulnerability  : Insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CVE-2008-4182 CVE-2009-0930
Debian Bugs    : 500114 500553 513266

Several vulnerabilities have been found in imp4, a webmail component for
the horde framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-4182

It was discovered that imp4 suffers from a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack via the user field in an IMAP session, which allows attackers to
inject arbitrary HTML code.

CVE-2009-0930

It was discovered that imp4 is prone to several cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks via several vectors in the mail code allowing attackers
to inject arbitrary HTML code.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-4etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2-4, which was already included in the lenny release.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4.2-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your imp4 packages.
