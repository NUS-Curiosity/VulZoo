Ironically, all their fancy methods for "detecting fraud" discuss 
cross-checking the SSN of the applicant, when in fact, the SSN isn't 
even required to process a passport application (although the IRS can 
technically fine you $500 if you don't).

Ever actually READ the back of the passport application? The relevant 
information is at the top of page 3
http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100004.pdf

Heck .. you can get a passport without any ID *at all* if you bring a 
"family bible record of your birth" and somebody that can vouch for your 
identity (see page 2 of the above application).

Oh .. and the funniest thing of all on the application .. bottom of page 4 :

"The electronic chip must be read using specially formatted readers, 
which protects the data on the chip
from unauthorized reading."
 
"specially formatted" .. meaning anything from this list? :
