	vulnerability in Sun Delegated Administrator

Hi,

In the last CORE's advisories I've seen the following credits:

>
> 7. *Credits*
>
> This vulnerability was discovered by the SCS team [3] from Core  
> Security
> Technologies.


Does this "SCS team"'s guy have a name ?
Even in a football match 'the team' wins the match, but the GOALS are  
made by somebody that deserves the credits.

Peace,
   Sergio
