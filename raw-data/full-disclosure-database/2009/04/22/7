Disclosure Policy : 
http://blog.zoller.lu/2008/09/notification-and-disclosure-policy.html


Affected Products:
- JVM Version 6 Update 1
- JVM Version 6 Update 2

I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dictionary.com : "The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is software that converts 
the Java intermediate language (bytecode) into machine language and executes it.
The original JVM came from the JavaSoft division of Sun. Subsequently,
other vendors developed their own; for example, the Microsoft Virtual 
Machine is Microsoft's Java interpreter. A JVM is incorporated into 
a Web browser in order to execute Java applets. A JVM is also installed in a 
Web server to execute server-side Java programs. A JVM can also be installed 
in a client machine to run stand-alone Java applications."

II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please understand that no details will be given, too many bad guys
would use it for drive-by attacks. At this point in time (old + 
fixed) there is really no need to.


III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~
Memory corruption due to a write attempt to a user controlable offset.
i.e exploitable. The Java VM is reachable through every major browser.
