Subject: conficker.c - ccTLD strange attractor

I have publish a smart analysis about the first 20days of April 2009
ccTLD (country code top level domain) generated by the algorithm used
by worm for pseudo random domain name generation.
The following chart show the frequency for each ccTLD. I discovered a
sort of attractor for some ccTLD such as AG, BO, LC, HN,LC, PE, and
TW. A singular point is for DJ ccTLD domain. For more information
http://extraexploit.blogspot.com. This kind of analysis I think and
that is useful for get evidence as indicator of conficker.c activities
inside your corporate network.

Feedback are well come.

Regards
