Subject: Extremely important posting on my blog on the
	latest in XSS!!!11

Hello participants of Full-Distortion.

I know you have nothing better to do than to read my emails, so let me
tell you about these extremely important postings on my blog on the
latest and greatest XSS vulnerabilities there are!!!

I have found 3 (in words: three) web sites which are vulnerable to this
extremely rare but overly critical XSS exploit which you can see here:

XSS:

smtp://localhost/?HELO=<iframe
src="http://iamanidiot.websecurity.com.ua.hk.cz/>

I just wanted to let you know. You better fix that if you have it, too.
It is extremely critical. Of and did I advertise my blog yet? The
website is http://iamanidiot.websecurity.com.ua.hk.cz/!!! Come and bring
traffic to my website, you know I MustHavePublicity!


Best wishes & regards,
