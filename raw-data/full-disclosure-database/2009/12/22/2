Subject: Bypassing SEHOP

Hi,

Damien Cauquil and I have recently published a paper about SEHOP bypassing.
You can find the paper here: http://www.sysdream.com/articles/sehop_en.pdf

This paper explain how to bypass the SEHOP protection implemented by Microsoft on every recent version of Windows (2008, Vista and 7) whith some conditions.
The described technique has been tested succesfully on Windows 7.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,

LE BERRE St√©fan.
