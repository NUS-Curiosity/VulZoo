Subject: Bug in RealPlayer Plus 11

It's possible to execute a local aplication when using RealPlayer Plus 11 Browser. The problem resides in the file rp*****.exe which is loaded everytime a page is viewed. 
 
Redirecting this filename with IFEO or overwriting the file makes it possible to execute already installed malware.
 
Note: This is material for new worms since they are on every boot nowadays.
