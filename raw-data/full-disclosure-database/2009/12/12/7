:) Good one Valdis. That is what I was exactly trying to do.

#1. If his intent was good, he would have sent it to the vendor and to the
US Cert.
#2. His aim is to get money:
      a. Instead of selling it directly to black market and not getting any
returns, or having some legal agency stepping onto his doors he could as
well sell it to these companies.
      b. These companies DO NOT sell stuff to BLACK MARKET. Straighten your
facts before you accuse any of the below:
zdi,idefense,securiteam,immunity,etc. They have better things to do than to
sell it off to the bad guys.

Besides, many people have that kind of a notion only because there are many
hollywood movie fanatics out there, who suspect every single entity around
you.

Thanks for your creative response though :). You really cracked me up :)
