It most definitely IS the answer. Just because the average user
doesn't know how to do it doesn't mean it isn't the answer. They
shouldn't be entering their credit card info and other personal data
onto a machine which may still be infected. If they can't do it they
need to pay someone who can.

And nobody should be buying software that doesn't come with install
disks. That is just setting yourself up for failure. I know those
people do. And they are getting their personal info stolen too.
