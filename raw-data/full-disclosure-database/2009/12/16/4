Oops, Milan - you did it again.

You remind me of those IRC users that feel the need to publicly announce
that they're placing someone on IGNORE... and then never actually do it,
because then the ignored user might say something mean about them and the
IGNORing user wouldn't be able to make their awesome comeback.

If your grammar and syntax are as bad in programming languages as in
English, you must be a real liability to employ.
