	eBusinessSuite - Multiple Vulnerabilities Allow Remote Takeover

I do not believe there are CVEs for these issues.

According to the correspondence with Oracle, this was never published
(otherwise we would not publish it.)

Oracle's main claim is that this interface was removed in Oracle 12,
however, we still encounter this vulnerability with many of our customers
using the Oracle eBusiness Suite.

Anyway you can figure out what are the CVEs for the two Oracle confirmed
issues?
