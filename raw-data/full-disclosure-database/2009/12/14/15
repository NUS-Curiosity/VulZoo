Subject: Google Chrome 3.0.195.33 leaks DNS data queries
	outsitde of proxy if dns pre-fetching is enabled

Google Chrome 3.0.195.33 has DNS pre-fetching feature enabled by
default. If a user is using Chrome with a proxy, the DNS queries must
go through the proxy by design, but with the DNS pre-fetching enabled
they are still sent to the system's configured DNS cache.

This seems also true for the SOCKS proxy in Chromium regardless of
whether DNS pre-fetching is enabled or not as shown here:

http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29914

I have not verified the SOCKS proxy issue.

This presents a serious risk for the users of the services such as
Tor, as their DNS data and the little anonymity they have with tor is
leaked outside and in the clear.
