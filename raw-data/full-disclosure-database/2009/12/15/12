Package        : asterisk

Security support for asterisk, an Open Source PBX and telephony toolkit,
has been discontinued for the oldstable distribution (etch).
The current version in oldstable is not supported by upstream anymore
and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes for these
and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we need to
drop our security support for the version in oldstable. We recommend
that all asterisk users upgrade to the stable distribution (lenny).
