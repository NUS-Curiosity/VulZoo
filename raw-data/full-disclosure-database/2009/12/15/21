They're not, but many still use the browsers' proxy features hoping
for more anonymity and avoidance of data sniffing. Most users are not
security experts. They are not able or are not allowed to use VPNs and
such.

It's pointless from the viewpoint of a security expert, not an
everyday computer user that uses these features thinking it's harder
to sniff traffic. Application bugs like this still need to be
disclosed and fixed. No?
