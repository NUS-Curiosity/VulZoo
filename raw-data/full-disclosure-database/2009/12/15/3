that is why #1 at top of big red WARNING box about using Tor properly says:
https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en#Warning
"1. Tor only protects Internet applications that are configured to
send their traffic through Tor â€” it doesn't magically anonymize all
your traffic just because you install it. We recommend you use Firefox
with the Torbutton extension."

the only way to avoid DNS leaks despite most application configuration
is a transparent Tor proxy that intercepts all DNS and TCP at the
network layer and performs a redirect to the Tor Tcp and DNS Ports.
(see man page.)

RTFM FTW
... but never hurts to point out the obvious i guess...
