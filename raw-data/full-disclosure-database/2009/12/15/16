Subject: CarolinaCon-VI/2010 - Call for Papers/Speakers

InfoSec professionals, h4x0rs, script kidz, posers, and government spies:

"CarolinaCon" is back yet again!  Yes, for about the price of your average
movie admission with popcorn and a drink, YOU are invited to join us for
yet another intimate and informative weekend of technology education.


What is this "CarolinaCon"?

CarolinaCon is an annual Technology Conference whose mission/purpose is 
to;
- Enhance local and global awareness of current technology issues and
developments,
- Provide affordable technology education sessions to the unwashed masses,
- Deliver varied/informative/interesting presentations on a wide variety
of InfoSec/hacking/technology/science topics, and
- Mix in enough entertainment and side contests/challenges to make for a
truly fun event


When/Where is CarolinaCon?

This year's event will be held on the weekend of March 19th-21st, 2010.
The event will mostly occur at a Holiday Inn in Raleigh, NC.  Raleigh is 
about 30 minutes from Durham, Chapel Hill, and Research Triangle Park.


Who develops/delivers CarolinaCon?

CarolinaCon is proudly brought to you by "The CarolinaCon Group".  The
CarolinaCon Group is a non-profit organization registered in the state of
NC, dedicated to educating the local and global communities about
technology, information/network/computer security, and information rights.
The CarolinaCon Group is also closely associated with various "2600"
chapters across NC, SC, TN, VA, LA, DC, and NY.  Many of the volunteers 
who help develop and deliver CarolinaCon come from those chapters.


What events will be at CarolinaCon?

CarolinaCon is mainly about the talks/presentations/demos.  Alongside of
those we'll surely have several other technology-related 
contests/challenges, as we've had in past years.  Details on other events 
will be announced soon.


Who will be presenting which topics this year?

That's where YOU possibly come in.  If you are somewhat knowledgeable in
some interesting field of technology, hacking, science, etc., and are
interested in speaking/presenting at CarolinaCon, we invite you to submit
your proposal (in brief) for our review.  If you're interested in
presenting please send;
- your name or handle,
- the topic/presentation name,
- estimated time-length of presentation, and
- a brief topic abstract
....via e-mail to:
speakers <at> carolinacon.org

*NOTE: All submissions are due BY January 29, 2010!  Please be timely in 
submission if you're committed to being part of the elite cadre of 
presenters.  We value diversity, so please don't hesitate to propose your 
ideas no matter how outlandish.

Unfortunately as a non-profit dedicated to affordable education (our 
admission cost is still holding tight at $20), we've made very little 
profit each of the past years and are still trying to invest in the basic 
A-V gear needed to put on the event.  So we can't afford to pay anyone to 
speak nor cover any related expenses yet (sorry).

However if you do speak at the Con, you will receive;
- free Con admission for you and one guest,
- a free Con t-shirt,
- minimal fame, glory, and possibly notoriety, and
- mad props from our staff and attendees


I'm excited and I want to present!  What do I do know?

If you're interested in speaking, send the 411 requested to:
speakers <at> carolinacon.org
(BY/BEFORE January 29th 2010)

And if you're interested in attending, watch this space for more details:

...and don't forget to mark the dates on your calendar!

Peace,
Vic
