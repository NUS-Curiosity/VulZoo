Not bullshit at all. Taking the points in reverse order:

(b) Note that 'many apps" means "mostly avoid", not "totally avoid".   You run
any app that's not DNS-proxy aware, you just leaked and whoever you're using
Tor to avoid is now potentially pounding on your door. Sure, the difference
doesn't matter if you're using Tor to be a cool wanker. But if you're using
Tor because it *matters*, "98% of apps get it right themselves" is a big
*fail*. You really want to enforce 100% correctness whether the app is
correct or not. (Stated in another way - sometimes DAC just doesn't cut
it, and you really *do* want the added complication of MAC).

(a) If you have a better way than a Tor proxy to avoid DNS leaks from
programs that don't DNS-proxy themselves, feel free to actually *tell*
us what it is, rather than just babble "they aren't the best way". Given
you got the *other* point totally wrong, we have no reason to believe a
content-free 'not the best way' unless you actually have an evaluatable
statement like 'XYZ is better'.
