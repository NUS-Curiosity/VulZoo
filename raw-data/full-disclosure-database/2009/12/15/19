Subject: Re: Google Chrome 3.0.195.33 leaks DNS data
	queries outsitde of proxy if dns pre-fetching is enabled

The point is besides the fact that you can configure Chrome to proxy
through Tor or anything else, Chrome is not supposed to leak DNS -
it's  a bug that Firefox currently does not have for instance. Many
users use proxies to avoid corporate and other firewalls, and to
prevent leakage of information a suppressive government will throw
them in jail for - China for instance. Tor just makes a good example.
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR UNWITTING USERS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS BUG. They may
be thinking that Chrome is safe for proxies.

The other OT issue about Chrome is of course even despite you using a
proxy the right way all the real information about you will be found
on Google's servers anyway because Chrome has a lot of hidden
information collecting eggs that Google won't talk about. The company
has decided that privacy does not matter long time ago. And if it does
matter for you - well according to Google then you are a criminal.
