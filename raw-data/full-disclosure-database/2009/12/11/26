Research grant ideas for 2010:

1) Replacing not only the computer, but victim's entire apartment,
with cardboard cutouts to intercept passwords,

2) Substituting victim's spouse with a conspicuously German lookalike,

3) Destroying all quantum-superposed universes in which the password
is *not* known to the attacker, in order to emerge in one where it is.

4) ???

5) Profit.
