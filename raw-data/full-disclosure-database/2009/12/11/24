Subject: Re: Brilliant attack "bypasses" bitlocker

P.S. - while poking fun at "is" rather than "are," I did not mean for my statements to suggest that Dan had qualified the nature of this "attack" as "brilliant."  That was my own language making fun of the attack, and not suggesting that Dan or el Reg was somehow making such a comment.

The other attacks not mentioned may very well be l33t, but I found the aforementioned attack funny.  Just wanted to make that clear.

This "method" is almost as bad as Dan's grammar ;)

"Among the methods discussed is what they call a "hardware-level phishing attack," in which a target machine is replaced with a counterfeit one that provides precisely the same messages and prompts that the original machine would have produced. The imposter machine captures user input and relays it to the attacker, who then uses it on the real machine."

I love the old, "replace the computer with an exact duplicate while they are not looking and get them to type in their passphrase" trick.   Certificates anyone?
