/me sheepishly acquiesces to Dan publically.

Dan is right, I am wrong.  After consulting our resident grammar expert, I have been corrected.  My apologies to Dan for incorrectly attributing a grammatical error to his piece.  I was going to bet on it too ;)

"Methods" is an object in the sentence. I think what's confusing you is
that it comes ahead of the subject, which is "attack."
