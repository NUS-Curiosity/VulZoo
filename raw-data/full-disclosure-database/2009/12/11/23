Subject: Brilliant attack "bypasses" bitlocker

This "method" is almost as bad as Dan's grammar ;)

"Among the methods discussed is what they call a "hardware-level phishing attack," in which a target machine is replaced with a counterfeit one that provides precisely the same messages and prompts that the original machine would have produced. The imposter machine captures user input and relays it to the attacker, who then uses it on the real machine."

I love the old, "replace the computer with an exact duplicate while they are not looking and get them to type in their passphrase" trick.   Certificates anyone?
