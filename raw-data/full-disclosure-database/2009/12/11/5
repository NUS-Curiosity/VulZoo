Subject: Re: TLS / SSLv3 vulnerability explained (New ways
	to leverage the vulnerability)


BID 36935
ERRATA:  The  previous trace POC was renamed to 36935-3.c on securityfocus
and had a small error in it. It is now fixed and available here. I'd like
to ask repositories to update.

File available here:
