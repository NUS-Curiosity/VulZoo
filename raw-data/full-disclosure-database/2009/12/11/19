Subject: Re: IE 0day for sale

Bids for what?  An "exploit?"  What does it to?  How does it do it?  What context does code run (assuming code runs).  What do you have to "trick" the user into doing?  Do you actually think people are going to offer you something based on what you've outlined here?  So far the only bullshit is what we've read - Valdis' post is perfectly valid.

Mr. Valdis Kletniesks,
I'll provide proof only for serious bidders. As I said, no bullshit please.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof - so convince us that
you in fact have one.
