-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node
Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the ovalarm.exe CGI application. If the
OVABverbose POST variable is set, this process takes the value of the
Accept-Language HTTP header and copies it without any length checks into
a 0x100 byte stack buffer. By providing a large enough string this
buffer can be overrun leading to arbitrary code execution.

Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
