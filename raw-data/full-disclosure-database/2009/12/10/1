Subject: Revenge of the Computer Nerds

But the real action (and the evidence for chicanery) is in the
computer code obtained from the CRU. Our own computer guru Marc
Sheppard, writing for American Thinker here and here, was one of the
first to offer an accurate diagnosis of this fraudulent method of
computer programming. Analyzing the code, as Marc has indicated in his
work, is a complex business. As he pleads in one article, "please bear
with me while I get a tad techie on you."
