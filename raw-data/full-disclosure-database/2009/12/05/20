 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2009:272-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libmikmod
 Date    : December 5, 2009
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in libmikmod:
 
 libmikmod 3.1.9 through 3.2.0, as used by MikMod, SDL-mixer, and
 possibly other products, relies on the channel count of the last
 loaded song, rather than the currently playing song, for certain
 playback calculations, which allows user-assisted attackers to cause
 a denial of service (application crash) by loading multiple songs
 (aka MOD files) with different numbers of channels (CVE-2007-6720).
 
 libmikmod 3.1.11 through 3.2.0, as used by MikMod and possibly other
 products, allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) by loading an XM file (CVE-2009-0179).
 
 This update fixes these vulnerabilities.

 Update:

 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
