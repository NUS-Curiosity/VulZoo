	Feds ‘Pinged’ Sprint GPS Data 8 Million Times Over a Year

If you read the article, that 8 million figure is the number of
samplings, not the number of requests or the number of subscribers
monitored.  The article says that they can get data every 3 minutes
over a 60 day period, which is 28,800 samples.  Diving that into 8
million gives you 278 individual subscribers, which is probably much
lower than the number of subscribers actually monitored.  If you
monitor a subscriber for 10 days (a typical number), you get 1667
subscribers monitored, a drop in the bucket of the 48 million
subscribers that Sprint claims it has.

Nothing to see here, I think ... move along, move along... ;)
