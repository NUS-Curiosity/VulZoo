Subject: Re: Feds 'Pinged' Sprint GPS Data 8 Million Times
 Over a Year

Except that if you look at the report, you see that one request was made just 37 seconds after the first, yet only 6 were made in the hour.  So who really knows?  They can obviously request whatever they want when they want.  Also, based on what the reported statement was, anyone with a logon can request location information for a sprint number - there was no mention of some back-end auditing process that ensures that only numbers with a valid search warrant are available; and I'm doubtful that is case since it is a nationally based system.  

This is what anonymous phones are for.

If you read the article, that 8 million figure is the number of
samplings, not the number of requests or the number of subscribers
monitored.  The article says that they can get data every 3 minutes
over a 60 day period, which is 28,800 samples.  Diving that into 8
million gives you 278 individual subscribers, which is probably much
lower than the number of subscribers actually monitored.  If you
monitor a subscriber for 10 days (a typical number), you get 1667
subscribers monitored, a drop in the bucket of the 48 million
subscribers that Sprint claims it has.

Nothing to see here, I think ... move along, move along... ;)
