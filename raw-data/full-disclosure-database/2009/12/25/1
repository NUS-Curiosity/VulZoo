Subject: DECAF patched and re-enabled

DECAF was disabled days ago by the authors at decafme.org.  It 
looks like some people over at soldierx.com have patched the binary 
to re-enable it and remove the phone home functionality.  The full 
story is at http://www.soldierx.com/news/DECAF-hacked-and-re-
enabled-SX and the files are at
