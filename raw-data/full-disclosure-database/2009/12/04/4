 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2009:157-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : perl-Compress-Raw-Zlib
 Date    : December 3, 2009
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been found and corrected in perl-Compress-Raw-Zlib:
 
 Off-by-one error in the inflate function in Zlib.xs in
 Compress::Raw::Zlib Perl module before 2.017, as used in AMaViS,
 SpamAssassin, and possibly other products, allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (hang or crash) via a crafted
 zlib compressed stream that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow,
 as exploited in the wild by Trojan.Downloader-71014 in June 2009
 (CVE-2009-1391).
 
 This update provides fixes for this vulnerability.

 Update:

 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
