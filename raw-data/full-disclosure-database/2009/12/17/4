Hello. List.

 

I��m pentesting IPTV.

 

Our IPTV network structure is this.

 

Monitor - IPTV - VDSL modem - ISP

 

So, for packet manipulation

I have to ARP spoofing or change network structure 

 

Monitor - IPTV - attacker - VDSL modem - ISP

 

But, I don��t know IPTV SetupBox(STB)��s netmask and gateway address.

So I wanna make this network

 

Monitor - IPTV - attacker - VDSL modem - ISP

 

Attacker is a computer.

This computer have two NIC.

Two NIC only transmit and receive packet. They have no IP address.

I wanna manipulate this packet��s field

 

Do you know how make this network?

Do you know tools that manipulate every packet (http, rstp, igmp, etc,.)?

 

Thanks

KIM
