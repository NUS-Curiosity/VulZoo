Subject: [tools] hostmap-0.2.1 released

Hello,

I am glad to release hostmap version 0.2.1.
In this version there are a lot of bug fixes and some new features.

= Introduction =

hostmap is a free, automatic, hostnames and virtual hosts discovery tool
written in Ruby and licensed under GNU General Public License version 3
(GPLv3). It's goal is to enumerate all hostnames and configured virtual
hosts on an IP address. The primary users of hostmap are professionals
performing vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.


= Changes =

Some of the new features include:

    * Fixed handling of Errno::ECONNRESET in SSL certificate plugin.
    * Upgraded net-dns to latest version from git repository.
    * Fixed traceback on Mac OSX due to net-dns bug.
    * Added check to enumerate host names with DNS TLD expansion.
    * Added --print-maltego to get output in Maltego XML format.
    * Fixed the exception handling architecture, now unknown exceptions
that can be raised on not supported system are handled.
    * Fixed traceback on FreeBSD due to raising of different exceptions.
    * Added Metasploit auxiliary module in extra folder.
    * Added validation of -t option, if it isn't an IP address hostmap
is stopped.
    * Added enumeration plugin timeout, by default at 10 minutes. Can be
changed with user supplied --timeout option.
