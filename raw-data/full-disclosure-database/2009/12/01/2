I'm going to assume this is a serious question.

You could start with the people enriching themselves off of carbon credits.  Al 
Gore, for one obvious example.  You could continue with the people that think 
the entire world should be ruled by a bureaucracy called the UN.  You could go 
on with the "scientists" who get millions of dollars worth of grants to "study" 
the problem and propose solutions.

Are there people on the opposing side who benefit from what you call 
scaremongering?  Of course there are.  But the claims of the global warming 
crowd are unsupported by the data (not *their* data, because they have clearly 
skewed it to support their claims, as is proven both by their emails and their 
program code) but by the real data, unmassaged.
