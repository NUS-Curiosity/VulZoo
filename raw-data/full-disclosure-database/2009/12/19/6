Thank you this excellent research!

Given your contributions in this area, I was hoping you could offer me
some advice: I recently stumbled upon an XSS flaw on a page with
vaguely turquoise background. I am not sure whether to classify this
as a separate class of a web vulnerability, or merely a novel
extension of well-established XSS attacks against sky blue targets?

Sincerely,
