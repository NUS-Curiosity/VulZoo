Or to those who feel software developers should be compensated for
their time and efforts. It's why some of us buy new copies of OpenBSD
when they make a release, or why some of us have a purchased copy for
each production device we deploy. It's the reason we have a valid,
purchased license of Windows [XP Pro | 7 Ultimate | whatever previous
version] for each machine that's running it. If we're using and
benefiting from the code, why shouldn't the developers get
compensated?

Not everyone has the same feeling of entitlement and greed that you
just displayed and I daresay that neither makes us "lawsuit
vulnerable" nor "thick".

Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the
citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a
double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows
the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the
blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have no
need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry,
infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of
their rights unto the leader and gladly so - Unattributed, post 9/11
