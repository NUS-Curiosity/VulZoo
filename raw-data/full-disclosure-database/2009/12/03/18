 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2009:107-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : acpid
 Date    : December 3, 2009
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 The daemon in acpid before 1.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (CPU consumption and connectivity loss) by opening
 a large number of UNIX sockets without closing them, which triggers
 an infinite loop (CVE-2009-0798).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to prevent this.

 Update:

 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
