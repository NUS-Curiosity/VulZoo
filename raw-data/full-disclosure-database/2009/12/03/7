Subject: Open-Source Effort to Hack GSM

http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/open-source-effort-to-hack-gsm

.."Karsten Nohl, chief research scientist with H4RDW4RE, a Sunnyvale, 
Calif.-based security research firm, is mounting what could be the most 
ambitious attempt yet to compromise the GSM phone system, which is used 
by over 3 billion people around the world. Others have cracked the A5/1 
encryption technology used in GSM before, but their results have 
remained secret. However, Nohl, who earned a Ph.D. in computer science 
at the University of Virginia and is a member of Germany's Chaos 
Computer Club (CCC), intends to go one big step further: By the end of 
the year, he plans to make the keys available to everyone on the 
Internet."...
