Subject: XSS in WebMathematica

Hi list


I tried to follow the RainForest Puppy Policy, but Wolfram 
didn't respond to my email within 5 days.

In some installations, the MSP script of webMathematica is vulnerable to 
reflected XSS. Just insert a backslash after the script name MSP, which is 
normally located under the "webMathematica" folder:

http://www.example.com/webMathematica/MSP\<script>alert('a')</script>

Oh and of course a local path disclosure:
http://www.example.com/webMathematica/MSP

You can find victims with this Google search string:

inurl:"/webMathematica/" -wolfram.com

Most victims are universities and high schools all over the world, from Finland, 
Switzerland, Czech Republic, Russia, America and Japan.

Don't forget that a lot of universities are part of Microsoft's MSDN and the students
can download nearly all Microsoft software for free. This could be an interesting exploiting
scenario.

cheers
floyd
