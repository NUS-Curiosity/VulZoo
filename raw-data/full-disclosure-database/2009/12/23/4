in the RegistryInfo.input file.

==== Windows Password Guessing ====

For Windows password guessing to occur, there must be a matching

you attempt to guess passwords. WinScanX options -c, -r, -u, and -S can be
used to generate <hostname>.users cache files.

The passwords that are attempted for each user account are included in the
Dictionary.input file.

The following can also be used in the Dictionary.input file:

<username>   -- The name of the current user
<lcusername> -- The name of the current user in lower case
<ucusername> -- The name of the current user in upper case
<blank>      -- A blank or null password
