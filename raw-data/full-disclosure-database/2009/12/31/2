Hardly news. If you can inject arbitrary HTML into a web page, there are plenty of ways (many of them easier or more flexible than this) you can get it to run Javascript:

- <script> tags, obviously

- Binding other events that'll trigger without an event, like onLoad

- CSS (either inline, in a <style>, or loaded from another site with <link rel="stylesheet">) containing any of:

  * Background images loaded with the javascript: protocol
  * expression() (MSIE only?)
  * -moz-binding

- Embedded objects (say, Flash, using ExternalInterface)

None of this is considered particularly novel at this point.
