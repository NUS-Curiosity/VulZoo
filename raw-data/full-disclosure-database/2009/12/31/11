Dear rubenalves@...ul.pt<mailto:rubenalves@...ul.pt>:

I'm part of a mailing list that received this message from Pedro.  I read your warning at the bottom, and am not really sure if I am the intended recipient or not, so I'm not sure if I should delete it or not.  Pedro said to send requests to you, so I am.  I'm sure we all here would like to make sure that we conform to your warning.
