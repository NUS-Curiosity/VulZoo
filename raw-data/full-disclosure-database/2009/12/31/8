Hey,
we are selling last adobe u3d 0day's exploit. It works on Adobe Acrobat <=
9.2 . works on Windows XP with Service Pack 0/1/2/3 and also on Windows
Vista with Service Pack 0/1/2 and on Internet Explorer 6 & 7 . So as you
know, it bypasses DEP and ASLR mitigations.
As a proof to make you sure, you can watch the video of this exploit:
