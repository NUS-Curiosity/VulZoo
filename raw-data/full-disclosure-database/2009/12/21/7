Subject: Re: Reading Mission Control Data out of Predator
	Drone video feeds

The screenshot of the UAV is a UAV video I found on the internet. I am
not sure if this is actually a predator drone.
It looks like it has firing capabilities tough and has embedded data
in the video as predator drones have.
I also dont have any satellite connection available here.

Regards,

kcope
