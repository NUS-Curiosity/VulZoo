Subject: Data Type Conversion Attack

*Introduction*



This test allows attackers to discover local installation paths in websites
using PHP in which the error messages hasn´t been completely blocked. The
idea is to use the http parameters to perform an explicit data type
conversion to generate a non-managed exception which shows the local
installation path on the web server.



*Local Path disclosure*



Let´s suppose a PHP code running on a web server like following:



*Dca.php*

*<?php ***

*$vuln= $_GET["var"] +1;***

*?>***



As can be seen, this program receives a numeric parameter which is used to
perform a mathematical function. The normal way to call this program is
something like:



-       *http://www.testserver.com/dca.php?var=1<https://owa.informatica64.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=03bb620597674e25acf80fef5ea71825&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.testserver.com%2fdca.php%3fvar%3d1>
*



In order to force an implicit data type conversion the following syntax in
the calling http parameters can be used:



-       *http://www.testserver.com/dca.php?var[]=1<https://owa.informatica64.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=03bb620597674e25acf80fef5ea71825&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.testserver.com%2fdca.php%3fvar%255b%255d%3d1>
*



This syntax will force the PHP engine to convert the parameter into an array
structure. If the *display_errors* parameter in the *php.ini* configuration
file is enabled then an error message like the following will be showed up:



*Unsupported operand types in C:\server\htdocs\dca\dca.php on line 2*



This behavior is due to the fact that there are not an implicit transform
for adding operation in array structures. In my personal research I found
out that there are a lot of PHP functions which usually applied to http
parameters that causes the same behavior dumping the error messages as shown
giving to the attacker more information that strictly necessary.
