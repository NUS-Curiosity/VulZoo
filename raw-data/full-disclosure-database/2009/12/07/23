	Climate-Gate:A SysAdminâ€™s Perspective

That certainly is a long way to express what a lot of us had suspected all
along - that the leak of the CRU emails wasn't the result of a bold and
heroic hacker, but was like the vast majority of other leaks in business and
government.  Someone thought the leadership's position regarding the climate
e-mails was wrong and took independent action.
