BSDCAN 2010 has been announced and I believe they start accepting
presentation proposals in two weeks; travel money wouldn't be
necessary and I'd even bring a camera to document that you are,
indeed, two different people :)

Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the
citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a
double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows
the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the
blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have no
need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry,
infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of
their rights unto the leader and gladly so - Unattributed, post 9/11
