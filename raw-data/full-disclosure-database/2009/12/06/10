Feel free to substitute your own choices of sites that look at claims made
publicly, and compare them to the actual original sources. And remain open
to the idea that perhaps fact-checking groups appear biased because a majority
of the people just making up shit that needs debunking are on one side of
the aisle.

Do you want to contend that Glenn Beck's statement was in fact correct?

And yes, Beck is a frequent flier there:
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/personalities/glenn-beck/
How many of those claims were, in fact, correct? And does it do the public
a service for Beck to make totally false claims for the sake of ratings?

Now over at Factcheck:

http://factcheck.org/2009/12/truth-on-the-cutting-room-floor/
Care to try to claim that the original video was in fact correct and accurate?

http://factcheck.org/2009/10/inoculation-misinformation/
Do you in fact have information that the H1N1 virus is a "depopulation
conspiracy", or any of the other misinformation debunked here?

Look Paul - at some point you're going to have to admit that at the current
time, a significant chunk of the Republican party is completely unhinged (death
panels, birthers, and all the rest), and any pundits inciting that lunacy
are doing more damage to public discourse than any bunch of scientists.
