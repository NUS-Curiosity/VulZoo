Did we loose site of the methods used to expose the frauds at work? And how fucking cool it is that people with those skills and talents can have that kind of impact in the world?

My question is, what is next?

Rock on!

Deliberately lying to the public in order to push a political and
ideological agenda that is unsupported by the scientific data is quite
unscientific of them.  They are not scientists and have lost all their
credibility as such.  They should be unable to continue performing
scientific work and barred from ever doing so again.  Watching these
people go into damage control and spin mode is the epitome of
hilarity.

Let them go into politics, which is clearly where these charlatans belong.

>>From the InfoSec perspective, this shows why people with something to
hide fear those that have the power to expose them.  Cue mandatory
registration of anyone with "information security" skills to ensure
the technocracy is no threat to the oligarchy - or their lies.

Sadly, their agenda will succeed sooner or later regardless of the
facts as the money and power behind this movement is an unstoppable
force.
