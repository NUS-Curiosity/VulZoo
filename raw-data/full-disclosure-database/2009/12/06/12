You cannot be serious.  If you seriously believe that both sides don't 
make stuff up all the time, then you're either inattentive or blind.  All 
politics is bullshit.  You should know that.  For example, the Democrats 
have been running around insisting that there is no provision in the 
healthcare bill to fund abortion, yet you can read it for yourself.  They 
also claim there is no provision to find people who don't purchase 
insurance, yet you can read that in the bill yourself as well.

The sooner you and others learn that both sides lie equally and you have 
to do your own research, the better off this country will be.  The truth 
often lies somewhere in between the claims of both sides.

So now I have to defend Glenn Beck?  Why?  What does he have to do with 
me?  And would it surprise you to know that I don't follow him or any of 
the other so-called pundits?

We could play the yeahbut game all day, but you and I both know that leads 
nowhere.

Yeah, like the left doesn't have its own share of unhinged people - the 
911 truthers, the Bushitler crowd, the Michael Moore contingent (there is 
no bigger liar on the planet), the anthropomorphic global warming crowd, 
the let-give-terrorists-constitutional-rights crowd,  etc., etc.  The 
problems are the same on both sides.  The fact that you can't see that 
says a lot more about you than it does about either side.

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
