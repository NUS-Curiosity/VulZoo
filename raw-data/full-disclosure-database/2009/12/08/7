 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2009:327
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : clamav
 Date    : December 8, 2009
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in clamav:
 
 Unspecified vulnerability in ClamAV before 0.95 allows remote
 attackers to bypass detection of malware via a modified RAR archive
 (CVE-2009-1241).
 
 libclamav/pe.c in ClamAV before 0.95 allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (crash) via a crafted EXE file that triggers a
 divide-by-zero error (CVE-2008-6680).
 
 libclamav/untar.c in ClamAV before 0.95 allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted file that
 causes (1) clamd and (2) clamscan to hang (CVE-2009-1270).
 
 The CLI_ISCONTAINED macro in libclamav/others.h in ClamAV before 0.95.1
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) via a malformed file with UPack encoding (CVE-2009-1371).
 
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the cli_url_canon function in
 libclamav/phishcheck.c in ClamAV before 0.95.1 allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted URL (CVE-2009-1372).
 
 Important notice about this upgrade: clamav-0.95+ bundles support
 for RAR v3 in libclamav which is a license violation as the RAR v3
 license and the GPL license is not compatible. As a consequence to
 this Mandriva has been forced to remove the RAR v3 code.
 
 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
 
 This update provides clamav 0.95.2, which is not vulnerable to these
 issues. Additionally klamav-0.46 is being provided that has support
 for clamav-0.95+.
