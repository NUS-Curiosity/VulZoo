CVE-2009-3844

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerability installations of HP Application Recovery Manager.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the handling of requests to the OmniInet
process listening by default on TCP port 5555. The OmniInet process uses
a custom protocol for handling requests. When handling MSG_PROTOCOL
(0x010b) packets arbitrary user supplied data is copied to the stack
without proper bounds checking. Successful exploitation of this
vulnerability can lead to remote code execution under the SYSTEM
context.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
