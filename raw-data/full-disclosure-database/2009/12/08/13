 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2009:093-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : mpg123
 Date    : December 8, 2009
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been found and corrected in mpg123:
 
 Integer signedness error in the store_id3_text function in the
 ID3v2 code in mpg123 before 1.7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via an ID3 tag with a negative encoding value.  NOTE:
 some of these details are obtained from third party information
 (CVE-2009-1301).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.

 Update:

 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
