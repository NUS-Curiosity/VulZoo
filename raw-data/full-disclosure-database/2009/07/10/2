Subject: Evading Windows Secure Keys

In Windows, you have to press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to log on.  The
rationale here is that only the kernel can intercept these; if you
were to write a log-on program that hides the desktop, then when you
convince the user to press CAD it will just ask them if they want to
lock their computer.

I asked a friend today if he recalls how to up a key in VB.  He
couldn't remember how, but does remember using that to up CTRL so when
you push CTRL-ALT-DEL windows sends CTRL, ALT-DEL to the application
(note that ALT-DELETE-CTRL, activated in that order, doesn't get the
attention of the Windows kernel).  He had done this a long time ago
to... yeah.  Get people's passwords with a fake log-in box.

I've been unable to verify that this works or find the correct API
call to raise a key.  Anyone have any comments?
