The Disclosure War Continues.

Dear Paul,

Our individual security does not only pertain to what we control, but
what other's control as well. Also, the information we use to protect
our slice of the internet is disseminated by a community. So it's not
really nomadic at all, as you imply.

However, this is how anti-sec would like it to be. Any hacker who
would advocate discretion of discovery should consider the fact they
too, in this system, will miss out on possibly novel or innovative new
research. This seems to oppose hacking as well as progression, and
instead reveal a very immature desire to control an environment which
thrives on change.

Now to relieve any cramping you may have from reading a post with such
serious undertones, feast your eyes on this: http://tinyurl.com/ncksbj
