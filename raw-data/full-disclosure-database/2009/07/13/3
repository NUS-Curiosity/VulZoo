And if this small circle includes anti-sec, then they have a lot less
competition from the rest of the skiddies on the net.

I think it is indeed about the money... If you combine the two points
above (this in just my opinion, and I could be vastly wrong, but that's
nothing out of the ordinary. ;] ), then maybe anti-sec wants all those
vulnerable hosts to themselves.
With the lack of competition from the skiddies they could amass quite a
large number of compromised hosts, which they could then rent out to
spammers/etc. like any other botnet.

Because, obviously, they've threatened to rm everyone who stands between
them and world domination^W^W^W^W^W^Wpublishes exploits. And, naturally,
because they are so great and powerful, everyone will immediately
comply.


...or just laugh and go about their business as ususal. ;)
