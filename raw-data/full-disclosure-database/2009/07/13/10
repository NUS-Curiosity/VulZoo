A secure internet is:


i) One where all vulnerabilities are kept quiet to only be exploited by
those that discover them.*

ii) One where there is no privacy and every action is logged tracked and
traced by governments.(And we all know that governments have only the
interests of the people at heart)

iii) One where there is no anonymity and every action can be traced to
an identity and physical street address.

iv) One where DPI is applied to every packet tx'd/rx'd.

*Thus only the elite few would be able to create mischief, steal or
secure as opposed to just about anyone smart enough to run the
metasploit frame work or read a full disclosure list.

A secure Internet is the end of the internet as a useful resource for
the oppressed.

Long live the wild West. One can only secure that which one controls, so
who's going to step up and control the internet? Will the technology
ever be there to do so? And do we really need another Wyatt Earp?

I don't know enough to answer these questions, but thanks to full
disclosure I am smart enough to cover my own ass. So keep them coming
because without them I wouldn't be.

I like the Internet the way it is, which self respecting anarchist wouldn't?

btw I am a noob to IT security and this list(my first post), however I
don't expect mercy should anyone rip holes in my observations.

PS long live the English language...

Acr0nym.
aka MrX
aka dozens of other nyms for security by obscurity does have it's place.
