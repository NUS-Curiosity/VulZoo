It really seems like the first attribute of your "secure internet"
kind of diminishes the value of, well, everything else to follow. But
just in case...

Why assume the government and private sectors are all ethical? Almost
once a month there is another abuse of power story leaked to the
press. And the ratio of known/unknown cases of abuse is probably
pretty depressing. If you've ever worked at an ISP or a telecom you're
well aware of this.

Given the current state of tcp/ip technology, routing, wireless, etc.
It's a bit of an ideal to eliminate anonymity on the internet. But
again, the same point applies.

Let's say you're forced to scan the microchip implanted in your wrist
to access the internet from your local coffee shop. It's now possible
for the clerk ringing up your copy of 2600 to come to your house and
rape you at gunpoint. Erotic? Absolutely. Secure? Nope.

Even if deep packet inspection were applied to every packet, you still
have things like encryption and obfuscation. Not to mention general
cunning.

None of the things you listed mandate that anyone be intelligent to
cause mischief. The cycle would just continue. Innovative research
would be spread and utilized, for better or worse, by the community.
Which, sadly, includes a few "anti-secs" (zing).

As the saying goes:
"When a woman reaches orgasm with a man she is only collaborating with
the patriarchal system, eroticizing her own oppression" - Sheila
Jeffrys

Basically what Sheila is saying is that to be oppressed is a choice.
And as such, the possibility to rebel against it always exists.
Oppression has been a rather good catalyst for hacking so far. And I
can't even tell you what anti-patriarchal rants have done for my sex
life.

In this case, Wyatt Earp would be the government. http://www.eff.org/

Well, personally I found your post quite informative. Keep up the good work.
