Synopsis
========

An error in git-daemon might lead to a Denial of Service via resource
consumption.

Background
==========

git - the stupid content tracker, the revision control system used by
the Linux kernel team.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-util/git      < 1.6.3.3                            >= 1.6.3.3

Description
===========

Shawn O. Pearce reported that git-daemon runs into an infinite loop
when handling requests that contain unrecognized arguments.

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted
request to git-daemon, possibly leading to a Denial of Service (CPU
consumption).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All git users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/git-1.6.3.3"

References
==========
