Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP daemon allow for local
privilege escalation, information disclosure or Denial of Service
attacks.

Background
==========

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /   Vulnerable   /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/apache      < 2.2.11-r2                  >= 2.2.11-r2

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Apache HTTP
server:

* Jonathan Peatfield reported that the "Options=IncludesNoEXEC"
  argument to the "AllowOverride" directive is not processed properly
  (CVE-2009-1195).

* Sander de Boer discovered that the AJP proxy module (mod_proxy_ajp)
  does not correctly handle POST requests that do not contain a request
  body (CVE-2009-1191).

* The vendor reported that the HTTP proxy module (mod_proxy_http),
  when being used as a reverse proxy, does not properly handle requests
  containing more data as stated in the "Content-Length" header
  (CVE-2009-1890).

* Francois Guerraz discovered that mod_deflate does not abort the
  compression of large files even when the requesting connection is
  closed prematurely (CVE-2009-1891).

Impact
======

A local attacker could circumvent restrictions put up by the server
administrator and execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
user running the Apache server. A remote attacker could send multiple
requests to a server with the AJP proxy module, possibly resulting in
the disclosure of a request intended for another client, or cause a
Denial of Service by sending specially crafted requests to servers
running mod_proxy_http or mod_deflate.

Workaround
==========

Remove "include", "mod_proxy_ajp", "mod_proxy_http" and "deflate" from
APACHE2_MODULES in make.conf and rebuild Apache, or disable the
aforementioned modules in the Apache configuration.

Resolution
==========

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.2.11-r2"
