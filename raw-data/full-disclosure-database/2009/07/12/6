There are approximately three functions in Win32 making it possible
to interfere with keyboard input: keybd_event, SendInput, and
SetKeyboardState. I recall I was playing with them a very long time ago
and, indeed, I was able to do strange things with modifiers (Shift et al.)
but I do not recall whether it was possible to inhibit Ctrl+Alt+Del.
