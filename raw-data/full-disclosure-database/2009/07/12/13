Synopsis
========

An integer overflow in multiple Ralink wireless drivers might lead to
the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

Background
==========

All listed packages are external kernel modules that provide drivers
for multiple Ralink devices. ralink-rt61 is released by ralinktech.com,
the other packages by the rt2x00.serialmonkey.com project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /        Vulnerable        /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  rt2400              <= 1.2.2_beta3                    Vulnerable!
  2  rt2500          <= 1.1.0_pre2007071515                Vulnerable!
  3  rt2570                <= 20070209                     Vulnerable!
  4  rt61                <= 1.1.0_beta2                    Vulnerable!
  5  ralink-rt61           <= 1.1.1.0                      Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     5 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Aviv reported an integer overflow in multiple Ralink wireless card
drivers when processing a probe request packet with a long SSID,
possibly related to an integer signedness error.

Impact
======

A physically proximate attacker could send specially crafted packets to
a user who has wireless networking enabled, possibly resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

Workaround
==========

Unload the kernel modules.

Resolution
==========

All external kernel modules have been masked and we recommend that
users unmerge those drivers. The Linux mainline kernel has equivalent
support for these devices and the vulnerability has been resolved in
stable versions of sys-kernel/gentoo-sources.

    # emerge --unmerge "net-wireless/rt2400"
    # emerge --unmerge "net-wireless/rt2500"
    # emerge --unmerge "net-wireless/rt2570"
    # emerge --unmerge "net-wireless/rt61"
    # emerge --unmerge "net-wireless/ralink-rt61"
