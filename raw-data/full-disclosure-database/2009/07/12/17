There is not even a bit of logic out there..believe me! 
I suggest you to visit the anti-sec blog and read there their 
statements.

Here something from the anti-sec blog:
''A secure Internet is an Internet without freedom, without 
privacy, and without anonymity.....Sadly, the political systems of 
the first world have been perverted by an evil which ensures that 
none who do not share its nature hold office.''

They want the total internet anarchy and personally i believe these 
guys they lost it.
