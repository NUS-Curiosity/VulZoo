Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in Cyrus-SASL might allow for the execution of
arbitrary code in applications or daemons that authenticate using SASL.

Background
==========

Cyrus-SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/cyrus-sasl      < 2.1.23                       >= 2.1.23

Description
===========

James Ralston reported that in certain situations, Cyrus-SASL does not
properly terminate strings which can result in buffer overflows when
performing Base64 encoding.

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated user might send specially crafted packets to a
daemon using Cyrus-SASL, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the daemon or a
Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cyrus-SASL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/cyrus-sasl-2.1.23"
