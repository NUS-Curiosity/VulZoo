The internet isn't something you secure.  You secure that which you can 
control.  You leave the rest up to others who have control over their 
part.  And you block or blacklist those you choose not to connect to 
because of their lack of security.  So the anti-sec bozos are free to be 
as insecure as they want to be and to exercise their freedom, privacy and 
anonymity in their world.
