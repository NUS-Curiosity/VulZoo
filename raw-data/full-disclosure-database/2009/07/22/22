Subject: Re: [Mailing list Vulnerability] Troll exploit of
	mailing lists and newsgroups

I'm not sure you understand the purpose.

Full disclosure is a toll feed bag.  A hacker soap opera of magic,
mystery, and intrigue.
Seriously, when you subscribed were you expecting an 0day factory?
Serious security research discussions?  Some retard help forum?  Those
all exist in other places.  Full disclosure is the TV show I watch
while my coffee cools down.  If it didn't have so many damn
commercials it would be perfect.
