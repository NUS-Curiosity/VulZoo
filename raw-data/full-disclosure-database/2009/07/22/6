I'm sorry, log time reader of FD, it's a great mashup of hilarity and vuln
disclosure. But this takes the cake. I can't sit silent for this one:

Are you OUTSIDE your mind? 4chan? and not even 4chan.org, an archive site.
This is the "very core" of the "White Hat" being? If this is truly a 'agent
of AntiSec' which I highly doubt, you must be selecting low hanging fruit
and finding any possible way to associate it with those you hate.

I hope those who are in Anti-Sec if there really is such a thing, come and
hunt you down... and that's the way it is... for July 21st, 2009
