ZDI-09-046: Novell Privileged User Manager Remote DLL Injection
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-09-046
July 21, 2009

-- Affected Vendors:
Novell

-- Affected Products:
Novell Privileged User Manager

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems running vulnerable versions of Novell's Privileged User Manager.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the unifid.exe service which binds on
port 29010 for a protocol providing RPC-like functionality encapsulated
over SSL. This protocol allows a client to make a method call into a
module. The 'spf' RPC call is implemented unsafely allowing remote
attackers to load arbitrary modules over the network resulting in code
execution under the context of the service.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
