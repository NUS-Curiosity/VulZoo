Update/Changes :
----------------

Backround :
~~~~~~~~~~~
+ I failed to include details about the nature of the bug (DOM), 
the root cause is a DOM flaw and not a Javascript flaw as the 
Backround info might have lead to think.

Thanks James Schend for the heads up.

+ The bug was present in a 9 year old version of Netscape - draw your own 
conclusions.

Patch availability :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Seamonkey 1.1.17 and SeaMonkey 2 (soon to be Beta) have been patched

Affected Products :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Blackberry 8800/probably all (null ptr exception, browser crash)
Thanks to "528-0444" for the Report.
+ Google G1 latest (Firmware 1.5, Kernel: 2.6.27-00393-g6607056, Build: CRB43)
(Browser crash) 
Thanks Scott Fraser for the Report.
