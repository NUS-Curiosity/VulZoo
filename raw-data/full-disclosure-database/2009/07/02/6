Subject: Re: radware AppWall Web Application Firewall:
	Source code disclosure on management interface

Radware team has completed analysis of the reported issue, concluding
that no AppWall customer using the product  according to Radware
deployment recommendations would be exposed to vulnerability as a result
of this issue. This is due to the facts that this issue exists only on
the management interface that is recommended to be connection to
internal LAN only, and that it does not allow performing any actions
that would influence machine functionality.
 Nevertheless, in order to enforce our commitment to deliver top
security solution to our customers, Radware will supply a fix for this
issue within its upcoming AppWall release.
