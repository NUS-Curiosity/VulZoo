Looks like it's something "Green". His new email is @ engineecology.com.

Hey, look on the bright side: the rush of cash chasers with no true
understanding or love for computer tech that flooded the industry and
wrecked it in the '90s are moving on to "green" tech. Now we'll have a
smaller, but more competent, industry.

Of course, we're also about to have the same massive misallocation of
capital that happened in '95-'00; only to "green" stuff. Expect to see
lots of "Green' businesses with business models as valid as "pets.com".
