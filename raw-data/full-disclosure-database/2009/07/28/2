Subject: Re: AntiSec Lamers Exposed

Very nice detective work and protecting the freedom of speech. Congrats. 
I hope your information is solid and credible enough to pursue a 
criminal charge. I'm sure there are a lot of angry people who will 
happily testify against them

As we speak, the lamers are wiping their hard drives or disposing of the 
equipment :(

Nice work!
