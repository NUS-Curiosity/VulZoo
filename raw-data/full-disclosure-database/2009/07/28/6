Subject: [TOOL] MS OffVis

OffVis examines security hacks by digging into Office binary files. The 
Microsoft Office Visualization Tool (OffVis) was originally created for 
Microsoft security researchers and anti-malware software makers to help 
them identify and write detection signatures. Today Microsoft has made 
it available to the public.
