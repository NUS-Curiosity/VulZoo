Subject: AntiSec Lamers Exposed

Antisec claims to be such super hackers yet the idiots go around posting
shit on the net with their lame domains that they registered with their
real names thinking they can just get whois protection and talk shit with
them and no one find out the original information.

Here is the first, mr. pimpingj or should I say Jason Michelin. He owned
a lame hosting business that failed miserably called hr-development.net
and currently owns the copyandpaste.info which appears to be hosted on
his home computer.

Original whois before whois privacy for copyandpaste.info

Phone number is correct as well as address, way to go Mr. Super hacker.

The ring leader of these faggots, the Romeo thinks he is untouchable
since he lives in Saudi Arabia. He uses an invalid whois now and will
soon lose his lame ass darkmindz.com domain from it. I will also mention
too - another failed project from this group of haters and lamers.

This is just the beginning, me and many others will not rest until these
faggots are completely exposed.

The FBI as well as ythe owners of imageshack have already been informed
of this info and much more. Imageshack will defintely be pursuing charges
on these idiots as they can actually claim over $5k in damages.

It is just a matter of time before we all see "Imageshack hackers
arrested" in the news.

No one is untouchable. You think this is all we have? Think again. You
kids are going down.
