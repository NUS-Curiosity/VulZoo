Subject: Re: AntiSec Lamers Exposed

Hi there,

First of all i dont care about antisec, antisex, anti-sec, n3td3v trolls,
and anti-se*
But i'll be speaking only about FACTS :

You have to prove by A+B, that this man {who ever he is} was really behind
his computer while this crime was done, and that his computer wasn't
compromised by someone, and this is a real pain in the ass to prove. that's
why so many cyber-criminals can escape so easily from justice.

Your only chance would be, in this case would be to have a scared personne
confessing  his crime under pressure, unless that, good luck you need more
than a whois and some logs.

Regards
