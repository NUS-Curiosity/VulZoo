there are children at risk. you're a monster to sell out and censor 
for a corporation when children are having their brains scarred by 
some whacko. and google, you are evil.

this is about an employee at google, inc. (mountain view, ca) named 
leslie hawthorn who believes she's beyond all reproach. and google 
is doing nothing about it.

What the hell is going on? They're trying to cover this scandal up 
to save themselves. So much... I feel so hopeless and angry.

this is my kid you twisted scumbags

so much anger... corporate cover ups... all for your selfishness 
and greed. i feel like my brain is going to burst

the cost of google's lawyer to censor information on leslie 
hawthorn's activities
??

the cost for hawthorn to fly around the world in a year
??

the cost of a child's mind when he reads "fuck master" and "weekend 
warrior" on okcupid from an adult he/she trusts
priceless.

..............................

the hawthorn golden formula:

- drugs "sometimes"
- hang out with freebsdgirl/randi harper (former carder, meth 
addict according to google search results)

- fly to destination
- schmooze
- smoke outside

denial: #LIG

hotel room
- okcupid: infers her behavior as slutty. where is this legal to 
mention in front of 13 year old kids in ghop.

won't go into this. it's disgusting.

- law enforcement comes to visit me. *gulp* "we were wondering 
where in the us code it was ok to introduce children to this 
activity. is this how you and google socialize with the floss 
community? explain how terms like fuck master is ok to introduce to 
13 year olds."

15 minutes later
"my ego i need to let people know im still alive"
- tweeeeet: watching big lebowski #LIG (www.twitter.com/lhawthorn)

- get google to censor up information and allegation of wrong 
doing. hide. cower.

- show children that she's a "fuck master"
- put children in front of an okcupid where she recommends the 
"weekend warrior" lifestyle

- schmooze people in floss
- i need a @#$%ing cigarette

#LIG

drugs "sometimes" #LIG
child endangerment #LIG
im gonna lose my job for introducing children to drugs and sex. #LIG

oh wait google seems to embrace censorship and endangering the 
innocence of youth.

this is how i envision her life to be. my opinion after careful 
review of the facts. i am aware human beings like this one have 
defense mechanisms. and it doesn't take a psychologist to realize 
she's bordering being delusional, living in this orwellian like 
censorship scheme, to in my opinion, hide child endangerment by 
their employees.

could this be the playful beginning to a new era corporate child 
abuse and data mining?

welcome to 1984. c'est la vie
