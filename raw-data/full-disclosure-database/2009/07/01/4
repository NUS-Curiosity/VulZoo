                   VMware Security Advisory

Advisory ID:       VMSA-2009-0008
Synopsis:          ESX Service Console update for krb5
Issue date:        2009-06-30
Updated on:        2009-06-30 (initial release of advisory)
CVE numbers:       CVE-2009-0846
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   Service Console package krb5 has been updated to version
   krb5-1.2.7-70.

2. Relevant releases

   VMware ESX 3.5.0 without patch ESX350-200906407-SG

3. Problem Description

 a. Service Console package krb5 update to version krb5-1.2.7-70

    Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to
    provide strong authentication for client/server applications by
    using secret-key cryptography.

    An input validation flaw in the asn1_decode_generaltime function in
    MIT Kerberos 5 before 1.6.4 allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors
    involving an invalid DER encoding that triggers a free of an
    uninitialized pointer.

    A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a network service
    using the MIT Kerberos library, such as kadmind or krb5kdc, by
    causing it to dereference or free an uninitialized pointer or,
    possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
    running the service.

    NOTE: ESX by default is unaffected by this issue, the daemons
    kadmind and krb5kdc are not installed in ESX.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-0846 to this issue.
 
    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
