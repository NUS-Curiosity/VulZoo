Well... this assumes that all they're trying to do is take down the
websites and cause disruption with no ultimate purpose.

Let's say milw0rm gets owned. There are multiple backups of the site--
intentional or not-- that exist around the Internet. If milw0rm was
owned, the actual defacement and destruction of the site would really
be insignificant-- the database of vulnerabilities would still exist
in one way or another. Meaning in the grand scheme of things, they've
done absolutely nothing for their movement. Or, if they have done
something, it was only for $HOURS, or $DAYS even. Even moreso, let's
assume they're successful and milw0rm never returns. Much like
filesharing sites and applications, three would rise in their place.
Again, this assumes the sole purpose of the take-down of milw0rm is to
do just that-- take it down and disrupt the public dissemination of
exploit code.

However, just think about the power of the statement alone if the
event actually happens: "milw0rm got owned." Remember the outcry that
happened when milw0rm was *intentionally* going offline? How much more
powerful a message do you think it would be, how much *quicker* would
the message spread if instead of intentional disconnection it was
malicious defacement?

Granted, I feel I may be romanticizing the situation more than it
really merits (mainly because I find this entire situation just so
goddamn entertaining). But tearing down an effigy of the opposition--
even if temporarily-- can be significant for how a movement appears in
the eyes of others.

...the verbosity of this e-mail makes me feel like an InfoSec flunky. Gross.
