I would like to opt out on the milw0rm termination / wipage.  Secondly
when hackforums.net comes back online and are owned by anti-sec, can I
be moved to the bottom of the list if opting out isn't possible?  If
there are only 2 targets on the list, can you insert 5 to 6 targets in
between hackforums and milw0rm bumping it down a few notches.  If
hackforums.net doesn't ever come back online, do I get stuck in limbo
waiting until they get wiped free card?  If so hackforums.net please
stay offline, thanks.
