I doubt that .. for several reasons.

1. The DEA likes to announce their successes, so there'd be a press 
release about it.
2. Junk like that is in places like 4chan, et.al. all the time .. just 
to make k1dd13s crap their pants.
3. Google of the hostname provides no links to actual drug sales at all 
.. just a bunch of IRC chat logs. If it actually had been used for that, 
it'd be in tons of spam links.
4. Hosting provider is Linode.com, a VPS colo.
5. The "real" DEA banner (http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/dea_banner.jpg) was 
edited with Photoshop to produce the one on that site : "wget -proxy=on 
-O - http://narc.oti.cz/dea_banner.jpg |strings |head -3"

JFIF
Ducky
Adobe

But as always .. click on links in email at your own risk. Use TOR+wget 
if you want to be careful.
