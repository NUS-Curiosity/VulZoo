 Hackforums.net and Milw0rm.com - New Apache 0-day exploit uncovered

Fun fun, one of the best web defacements, and the scariest I seen in awhile.
Apparently these guys sold coke and heroin online...

This website is under investigation

This web site belonged to a recently prosecuted criminal pharmaceuticals
dealer and is being used as a tool in an investigation to catch online
pharmaceuticals buyers.

Your IP, **********, has been logged. Your ISP, **********, will be
contacted, your contact information subpoenaed, and you may be personally
contacted by a DEA agent.

By the way, it seems that the site is infected with... NetBus, if you can
believe it! Who has used that since 1998?

>Why take down harmless hackers websites? Please do the world a favor
>and take down some actual evildoers like companies who sell controlled
>substances to children online.  Take down this drug sales website
>please http://narc.oti.cz
