Subject: a simple race condition and how you'd solve it

A friend recently demonstrated on his blog a simple race condition he 
encountered. He also challenged folks to solve the problem.

There's an interesting discussion in the comments which is worth a quick 
read.

Also, maybe someone here will come up with a cuter idea?
