Subject: Re: radware AppWall Web Application Firewall:
	Source code disclosure on management interface

Dear Shaked  Vax,

 Are  you  sure  Radware  Team have analysed reflected attack via user's
 browser  (AppWall  administrator visits malcrafted page, page redirects
 his request to AppWall) before excluding remote vector?
