Subject: zf05 Best blog pwnie award

Dear zf0,

It is a great honor to be acknowledged with this awesome award. It is
true that occasionally I stuck with _more_ serious issues than those
discussed in my blog and therefore my blog-posts decrease or are just
being lame.
It was really entertaining seeing all those people getting owned in just
one issue of your unique zine. Also, since you include an email I had
sent to mubix once, I have to clarify that it was written in like 5
minutes or so. It has a few mistakes and during the conclusion, the
"security theater" is -of course- referring to the security industry.
Thanks to anyone involved to get this amazing zine out and also to
"dude" who brought it to my attention really fast. Also thanks to
everyone who considers security as pure fun! :P
Keep it real ZF0!

Happy coding,
some guy on the internet
