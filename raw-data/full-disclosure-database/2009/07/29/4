First off FaGeO. No one cares about the laughable targets you have
picked, People care because you are trying to push your lame agenda on
people. And you are not even hitting the right targets to do this.
Although noteworthy, do you think 99.9% of the people who seen that image
even gave 2 shits about it or even knew what it was.

You retarded anti disclosure thing is ridiculous. You dont want exploits
released for one reason - you want to be one of the only ones on the net
with the exploits and get whatever god lick feeling you get from it.

Full disclosure and exploit posting will NOT stop. You have not even hit
any relevant or notable target to get that message across. All you have
done is hacked a few shitty no name hosting companies, a dead forum, etc;
None of them had to do with true full disclosure or the scene. So what
you have done so far is simply a joke

Me and others have just began on exposing your lil punk asses. BTW, how
is your fag buddy pimpingj doing now that his REAL info is public? See
how long it takes him to give over server logs where you posted your
bragging about these so called super hacks.

Ok, so think you are untouchable, continue doing exactly what you are
doing - being lame and eventually they will get you,

Go hack some other dead forum or no name hosting site to make us tremble
in our boots some more as it seems all you can do.
