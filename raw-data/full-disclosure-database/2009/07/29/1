So wait, no one cares about antisec actions because of there lame
hacks, but yet:

>>This is just the beginning, me and many others will not rest
until these faggots are completely exposed.

Let me rethink about it, hmmmmmmmm...

We are LAME and no one gives a shit about our cause and yet you are
dedicating your life into exposing us?!

HRDev was a -hosting- company, you cannot get anyone arrested there

Keep on thinking you will get me arrested, I will just keep proving
you wrong.
