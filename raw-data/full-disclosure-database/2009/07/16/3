 desktops? windows xp, windows server 2000/2003/2008?etc.?

Yeah sure no problem,

But first we need your full name and address, your banks name and
address, your mothers maiden name, the names of your pets and all the
numbers from your credit card.
If you can post all those details to this mailing list we will be only
to pleased to help.
