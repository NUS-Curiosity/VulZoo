So basically, you are legion, for you are many?  If that is true, then  
you can be infiltrated just like any other organization/society/cult.   
Is it that you are so sex-depraved as a result of living in your mom's  
basement and running Noobuntu on a Pentium III that gives you a  
burning desire to troll us all with this charade?  It will only be a  
matter of time before someone leaks inside information revealing Anti- 
Sex to be the weak troll group as we all suspect.

Why hasn't blackhat-forums.com brought their site back up yet?  Only a  
complete dolt couldn't delete the .htaccess undoing the 501 you set  
up.  Either this Jesse Labrocca is a pseudonym of an insider who is  
going along with your little charade, or he is an easy target.  If  
Anti-Sex is as vast as you lead us to believe, then pick on someone  
your own size, buddy.  We will only eat crow when you own up to pwning  
milw0rm.  Also, whois blackhat-forums.com.  Is Jesse Labrocca a  
pseudonym for Chris Morganti in Melbourne Australia?

And who are the Canadian Allstream customer and the Brazilian who ran  
a Metasploit scan on me for a couple of hours yesterday after I  
challenged you to pwn my website http://narc.oti.cz?  I am sure they  
won't appreciate me divulging their IPs: 189.78.142.169 and  
142.161.169.106.   Also, for your enjoyment, here is a list of hosts  
that vuln-scanned or visited http://narc.oti.cz after my full-d post  
yesterday: http://pastebin.ca/1496587
