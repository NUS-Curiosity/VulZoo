 Hackforums.net and Milw0rm.com - New Apache 0-day exploit uncovered

Travis,

Our conversation is now not really related to full disclosure, it is
more philosophy of information dissemination.
And I, much as I mentioned in my last post, I agree with your views on this.

I was pointing out that we all need a starting point and an occasional
guide through the abyss, and a rock solid foundation on which to base
our own investigations.
The works of great thinkers provide this, be that great thinkers like
Aristotle, Newton or skilled hackers - el8, dikline? Without the public
exposure of their ideas we would still be struggling in the dark... Not
that the human race is basking in the light, but that is another discussion.

I did mention I had a problem with the propensity of step by step guides
and tutorials that allow our most ignorant and ill-educated (for want of
a better term)
fellow beings to fulfill their base desires for control, dominance and
mischief. And yes I see how those who offer a panacea to such activity
delight in the availability of such information.
But the thing is, even altruistic people can access this information and
expand, build upon and apply it to a more useful and less destructive
purpose. It allows for quick response and rapid mitigation from those
charged with defending systems, though not having the necessary acumen
to do so without such guides. Again as I mentioned previously a double
edged sword. Not all of those charged with defending IT systems from
attack are wise enough to do so without such step by step insight into
how the enemy will attack.

Knowledge and wisdom to me are in themselves a admirable goals, but many
IT security specialists have too many corners to cover to have the time
to be expert in all areas. Full disclosure narrows that gap between the
talented hacker and the hard pressed system admin.

I would however, like to see much more information and step by step
guides to securing systems freely available rather than tutorials on how
exploit said systems for control and gain.
