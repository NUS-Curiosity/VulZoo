Strictly speaking, any site that gives a flying f**k in a rolling donut
about their availability should be doing this *anyhow*, even if they aren't
worried about getting hacked.

Statistically, you're more likely to hear the sound of a disk drive head going
into oxide-plow mode or the click-click-click of a dead servo platter than you
are being hacked.  And you're gonna want backups then.

And no, doing RAID isn't a cure-all.  If there's a fire, all the disks burn. If
there's a plumbing leak upstairs that spills zillions of gallons of water
through your hardware, all the disks spark and short out. Plus, I've seen
enough RAID controllers take a crap all over all the disks far too many times
in my career.
