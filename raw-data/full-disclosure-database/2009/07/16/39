Subject: Anti-Sec - We're not really Anti-Sec! Sorry
	Hackforums. It was all a big joke by anonymous!

Yes, that's right, we're not really Anti-Sec.
We have no 0-day exploits.

We did not hack ImageShack or Blackhat-forums or Astalavista. That was the
real Anti-Sec whomever they are.

It was all a big joke.

But our goal was achieved.

We caused a huge stir on Hackforums.net. We've made them look like utter
fools.

Geez, some of them are like "Let's go to the authorities! Mummy and Daddy I
wanna go to authorities because my hacking forum has been threatened." What
a bunch of wimps. You're on a hacking website. You've gotta expect these
things. It's all part of the deal.

We've proved one thing...none of you on Hackforums.net should be there...not
even Jesse Labrocca. He should spend more time with his family rather then
worry about a silly little hacking forum. Or maybe spend more time on your
money-making business. Silly person.

Sincerely,

Anonymous People
