Hi kcope,


Which proof of concept are you talking about? I can't see it on the mailing list from your mailaddress..

And, of course 127.in-addr.arpa is a bit weird when the standard says:
1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa. (even though most programs will do without 1.0.0).

If you think about IP-addresses, can you just write 127 instead of 127.0.0.1, No. But can you write 127.1 instead of 127.0.0.1? Yes. (Though 127.1 is not really fulfilling the standardizations I guess but it works on Winbl0wz).


Best regards,
MaXe

Hello again,
the default setting of 127.in-addr.arpa is a bit weird

try
./bind <ip> localhost
