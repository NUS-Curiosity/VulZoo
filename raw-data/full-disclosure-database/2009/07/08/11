There's also the ominous anonymous comment left by a fellow on a blog:
http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=6742

The significant stuff: "Expect the SSH exploit to be made public
before BH/DC. I have proof that I can't share (sorry), that this
exploit does exist, does not work against current versions of SSH, and
is actively being used by members of the anti-sec movement."

Signs seem to be pointing to hoax, old exploit or non-exploit, though.
Unfortunately there's really not quite enough information to make an
assessment yet, IMHO.
