Subject: Re: Oops! About xscreensaver 5.01

Hello again,
The described xscreensaver vulnerability affects Opensolaris (11 for
sure, maybe 10 also)
xscreensaver 5.01 builds ONLY. I could not reproduce the vuln on
FreeBSD or Linux.
(This is getting boring I know, have a nice day)

Thanks and Best Regards,

Nikolaos Rangos
