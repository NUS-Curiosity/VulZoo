I hope you realize that a fair number of whitehats actually *do* want people
to get fearful enough to actually create secure stuff, because the more secure
deployable stuff that's out there, the less time we have to spend on security.
A lot of us have more job responsibilities than just security, and for us,
it's a lot more gratifying to spend a day doing something that enables a user
to get more done, than spending a day doing things that usually result in
a user being able to get *less* done.

Quite frankly, if every computer system suddenly became secure, I'd not be
out of a job.  There would still be a quarter acre of supercomputers and
servers and petabyte-scale disk systems across the hall, in need of all the
other things a sysadmin needs to do besides just security. And most of those
are more *fun* than security, too.

Besides, I can get more bragging rights out of "I helped build the third
fastest supercomputer in the world" than I can from "the third most secure
computer".
