Subject: Re: [Rumor] SSH (non)0-day

Not to incite the riot that always follows this type of comment, but
this attach does not match 0-day requirements. It is only for older
versions, meaning that if you patched your OpenSSH two or three months
ago when they released the patches for a security issue that was not
yet in the wild then you would not have an issue with this supposed
0-day. It is only a 0-day if you failed to follow patching procedures
or were not paying attention to the original patch several months ago.

Please oh trollers, troll away. But can we please move on to real
topics. You guys are making me miss NetDEV and his useless
conversations on this list.

I am worried that if it is an OpenSSH 0day how much damage should I
expect.
However SANS doesn't seem to think it's real.
