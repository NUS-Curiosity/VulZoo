I personally find that it's more appealing and spookier to say
"cyberwar" if you want to pass through - I don't know - your agenda,
your budget. Nothing says "We're underfunded" from contractors more than
"cyberwar". Remember, many quotes come from many-a-DoD-contractor. Keep
that in mind, when the sayings slash quotes shift from "Korea is
e-nuking us" to "we can neither confirm nor deny" or "we simply don't
know" you have to look at who's talking:

"In the dozens of instances that I worked over the past decade, I cannot
recall a single instance in which someone intending to attack came from
the source it appeared to have come from," said Dale W. Meyerrose,
former chief information officer for the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence. "Most attackers in cyberspace try to mask who
they really are." (NY Times)

“The code is really pretty elementary in many respects,” he added. “I’m
doubting that the author is a computer science graduate student.” Jose
Nazarrio

I put my money on Arbor's view. Remember, earlier this year according to
media and government, China was all the rage. Budgets were passed and
ironically all the Chinese hackers in the world retired. Think about
that for a minute or two. It could make a good episode of "Where are
they now?" In the interim, politics will be what politricks will be:

echo "China's cyberattacking us! We're simply underfunded" |mail -s
