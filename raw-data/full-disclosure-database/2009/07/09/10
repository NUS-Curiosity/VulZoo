Agreed.

Even if you *do* believe the secer site, look at the particulars. It's
a brute force. Properly configure your ssh servers (including
rate-limiting, possibly port knocking, key based authentication and
user@...t allow
statements) and file this under a non-issue.

Of course this is all theoretical so far so I suppose everyone is free
to wring their hands and gnash their teeth as much as they wish over
this.

Original CC recipients cut  because I'm the guy that can't remember
which addresses are subscribed to which lists.
