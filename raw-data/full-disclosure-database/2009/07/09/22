I find completing sentences with "As prophesied in ancient scripture" does
that to bosses too.

The problem is that most of what we've seen has been more properly described
as 'cyber-espionage' or 'cyber-border-skirmish'.  But most journalist's eyes
glaze over if there's more than 7-8 letters in the word, so we're stuck with
them using 'cyberwar'.

Content of type "application/pgp-signature" skipped
