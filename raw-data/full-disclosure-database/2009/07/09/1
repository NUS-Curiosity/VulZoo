Details.

IBM Lotus Sametime is an enterprise instant messaging and web conferencing 
application. During an application penetration test Sense of Security 
identified a user enumeration vulnerability when trying to connect to the 
Sametime server using the Sametime Connect Client. This occurred as a result 
of varying response times depending on whether or not a valid user name is 
supplied.

The client takes significantly longer to display the 'Invalid logon' error 
message when a valid username (and invalid password) is provided (5-8 
seconds). This is a result of additional information exchanges occurring 
between the server and client.

When an invalid username (and password) is supplied, the error is displayed 
almost instantaneously (1-3 seconds).

This can be used to enumerate valid user names.



Solution.

The vendor has advised that IBM is looking to eliminate this behaviour 
completely in a future release.
