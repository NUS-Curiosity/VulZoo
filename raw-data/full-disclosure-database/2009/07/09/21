I'll respectfully disagree- the entire concept being defined as
"cyberwar" is based on the assumption that cyber attacks will be
government sponsored.  I'd argue that a 'guerilla' style organization
sowing havoc on the internet can be just as effective as a 'cyberwar'
operator as a government could be, maybe more so.

So while 'cyberwar' may be an alarmist term, just because it's not
from a government doesn't mean it's not a war-type activity.  The real
question is, just like the 'war on terrorism' - who are the operators
in the war?

Tech folks haven't even come to an agreement on what would really
constitute a 'cyberwar', so it's not surprising that the media
definitely isn't capable.
