The problem isn't that people fail to understand how the Internet works
(they do fail at this, but that's not the problem).  The problem is how
exciting it is to use terms like "cyberwar."  In the words of a prominent
researcher:

   if [people shouting "cyberwar"] want to be taken seriously, they need
   to start releasing proof to the mailing lists and name specific
   intelligence agency's who are conducting the Cyberwar. I don't think
   there is a cyberwar, there will be intelligencers probing the networks
   for secrets, thats not a cyberwar. Cyberwar is something completely
   different [...] Cyberwar *could* be real, *look at this*. Although
   the truth is, we haven't seen a Cyberwar yet, it's still in the
   imaginary dream book stage.

Regardless of one's understanding of the Internet, getting to say "cyberwar"
is just too tempting for lots of people to resist.
