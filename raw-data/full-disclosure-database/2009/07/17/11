Subject: Blog post about anti-sec postings on Full
	Disclosure

I have written a blog post about the recent spat of "anti-sec" postings
on Full Disclosure.  Shortly thereafter, some one from an IP address in
Italy starting trying directory traversal attacks on my blog.

Read more about it here: http://www.cybersec.eu/?p=181

I will forward the information to his ISP as well.
