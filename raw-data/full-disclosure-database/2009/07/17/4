Subject: The Anti-Sec Movement - Clarrifying what it
	means. Our Targets Remain HackForums.net and Milw0rm.com

Dear Reader,
In light of recent events, we have decided to clarify exactly what the
Anti-Sec Movement is, and who we really are. Firstly, Anti-Sec is NOT an
individual clan or group; as the name implies, we are a movement - a protest
against White Hat Hackers and Full-Disclosure, if you will. Much like the
numerous protests against wars and other such major events that occur
similtaniosly around the world at times. With this foundation securely
explained and in place, we can move on.

Secondly, the sector of the Anti-Sec Movement who have made public threats
against Hackforums.net and Milw0rm.com are not in any way affiliated with
the Anti-Sec who have recently attacked public and innocent websites such as
Imageshack.

Thirdly, contrary to our previous statement, we do possess some major 0-day
exploits. Vulnerabilities we have developed exploit code for include
services such as Apache and LiteSpeed. Let us make it clear IMMEDIATELY that
we do not intend to use our newfound and previously undisclosed exploits
against ANY website or server that is not in some way hacking related. If
any such attacks occur against public websites NOT a part of the hacking
community, our hand is not part of it.

Fourthly, and most importantly, HackForums.net is still our number one
target and it WILL be compromised. It will be done in such a way, it will
almost appear non-existent. Furthermore, members of the Anti-Sec Movement in
OUR sector are currently mastering SQL Injection attacks using exclusive
materials.

Blend in.
Get trusted.
Trust no one.
Own everyone.
Disclose nothing.
Destroy everything.
Take back the scene.
Never sell out, never surrender.
Get in as anonymous, Leave with no trace.

You never know who is part of the Anti-Sec movement...betrayal strikes at
every turn...who can you trust?...are you already compromised?...melt into
the shadows...

Sincerely,

-anti-sec
