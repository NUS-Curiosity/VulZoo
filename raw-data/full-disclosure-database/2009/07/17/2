Subject: Linux 2.6.30+/SELinux/RHEL5 test kernel 0day,
	exploiting the unexploitable

Title says it all, exploit is at:
http://grsecurity.net/~spender/cheddar_bay.tgz

Everything is described and explained in the exploit.c file.
I exploit a bug that by looking at the source is unexploitable;
I defeat the null ptr dereference protection in the kernel on 
both systems with SELinux and those without.
I proceed to disable SELinux/AppArmor/LSM/auditing

Exploit works on both 32bit and 64bit kernels.

Links to videos of the exploit in action are present in the exploit 
code.

Greets to vendor-sec, 
-Brad
