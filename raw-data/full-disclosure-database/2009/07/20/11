Subject: A brief message on the topic of Anti-Sec

Hi,

My name is DeadlyData. I enjoy long walks on the beach, getting 
pizzas delivered to my house when my d0x were dropped, and having 
anal sex with my buddy Sean/TD Debug. My 1337 hack group The 
Defaced (thedefaced.org) has been making threats and being homo-
erotic on F-D. I'm sure you've seen the email from 
anti.sec.movement@...il.com that said "Please check out our website 
at: http://romeo.copyandpaste.info/" Well, that is RoMeO's website 
(a TheDefaced admin!) dedicated to posing as a 1337 blackhat haqr. 
He's got cool things on there like portions of phrack zines, anti-
sec ownages (that were done by the other anti-sec factions. You 
think we can hack? GOOD JOKE!!!), some zines from the olden days, 
and a speech by our buddy strayfe/n3w7yp3 (we love his dick, but we 
don't think he likes us ;( We lub you strayfe!). I just wanted to 
let you all know that our group has no 0days. Don't waste your time 
reading anti.sec.movement@...il.com's bullshit. Just worry about 
the other anti-sec factions. Ok? Well, then have a nice day and 
don't hold your breathe waiting for the OpenSSH 0day. 0pen0wn.c 
(http://www.nopaste.com/p/aDTdT5s1C) was it!

Sincerely,
 DeadlyData
