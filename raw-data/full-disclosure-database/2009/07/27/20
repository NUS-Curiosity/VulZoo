Subject: Re: Fredrick Diggle Security - Shameless
	promotion of services to Matasano

Travis wonders when Fredrick Diggle has time for his highly trained
and effective security enterprises knowing that he spends most of his
time grooming monkeys and feeding giraffes, which is very difficult to
do when the monkeys decide to start an inter-species war because the
giraffes are blocking their sunlight.

Unless, of course, you've trained some of the brighter monkeys on how
to use metasploit... Looking for investors?
