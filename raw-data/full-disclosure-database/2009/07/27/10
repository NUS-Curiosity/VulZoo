Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco 1500 Series, 2000 Series, 2100 Series, 4400 Series, 4100
Series, 4200 Series, Wireless Services Modules (WiSM), WLC Modules
for Integrated Services Routers, and Cisco Catalyst 3750G Integrated
Wireless LAN Controllers are affected by one or more of the following
vulnerabilities:

  * The malformed HTTP or HTTPS authentication response denial of
    service vulnerability affects software versions 4.2 and later.
  * The SSH connections denial of service vulnerability affects
    software versions 4.1 and later.
  * The crafted HTTP or HTTPS request denial of service vulnerability
    affects software versions 4.1 and later.
  * The crafted HTTP or HTTPS request unauthorized configuration
    modification vulnerability affects software versions 4.1 and
    later.

Determination of Software Versions
+---------------------------------

To determine the WLC version that is running in a given environment,
use one of the following methods:

  * In the web interface, choose the Monitor tab, click Summary in
    the left pane, and note the Software Version field.
   
    Note:  Customers who use a WLC Module in an Integrated Services
    Router (ISR) will need to issue the service-module
    wlan-controller 1/0 session command prior to performing the next
    step on the command line. Customers who use a Cisco Catalyst
    3750G Switch with an integrated WLC Module will need to issue the
    session <Stack-Member-Number> processor 1 session command prior
    to performing the next step on the command line.
   
  * From the command-line interface, type show sysinfo and note the 
    Product Version field, as shown in the following example:

    (Cisco Controller) >show sysinfo 
    
    Manufacturer's Name.. Cisco Systems Inc.
    Product Name......... Cisco Controller
    Product Version...... 5.1.151.0
    RTOS Version......... Linux-2.6.10_mvl401
    Bootloader Version... 4.0.207.0
    Build Type........... DATA + WPS
    <output suppressed>
    

Use the show wism module <module number> controller 1 status command
on a Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series/7600 Series Switch if you are using a
WiSM. Note the software version as demonstrated in the following
example, which shows version 5.1.151.0.

    Router#show wism module 3 controller 1 status
    
    WiSM Controller 1 in Slot 3

vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) are responsible for system-wide
wireless LAN functions, such as security policies, intrusion
prevention, RF management, quality of service (QoS), and mobility.

These devices communicate with controller-based access points over
any Layer 2 (Ethernet) or Layer 3 (IP) infrastructure using the
Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP).

This security advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities in
the WLC family of devices.

  * Malformed HTTP or HTTPS authentication response denial of service
    vulnerability
    An attacker with access to the administrative web interface via
    HTTP or HTTPS may cause the device to reload by providing a
    malformed response to an authentication request.
   
    Note:  The vulnerability can be exploited only via the
    administrative web-based interface; Web Authentication features
    are not affected.
   
   
    This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsx03715 and
    has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
    CVE-2009-1164.

  * SSH connections denial of service vulnerability
    Affected devices may be susceptible to a memory leak when they
    handle SSH management connections. An attacker could use this
    behavior to cause an affected device to crash and reload.
   
    Note:  A three-way handshake is not required to exploit this
    vulnerability.
   
    This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsw40789 and
    has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2009-1165.

  * Crafted HTTP or HTTPS request denial of service vulnerability
    An attacker with the ability to send a malicious HTTP request to
    an affected WLC could cause the device to crash and reload.
   
    Note:  The vulnerability can be exploited only via the
    administrative web-based interface; Web Authentication features
    are not affected.
   
    This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsy27708 and
    has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2009-1166.

  * Crafted HTTP or HTTPS request unauthorized configuration
    modification vulnerability
    An unauthorized configuration modification vulnerability exists
    in all software versions prior to the first fixed release. A
    remote, unauthenticated attacker who can submit HTTP or HTTPS
    requests to the WLC directly could gain full control of the
    affected device.
   
    Note:  The vulnerability can be exploited only by submitting such
    a request to an IP address that is bound to an administrative
    interface or VLAN.
   
   
    The vulnerability is documented by Cisco Bug ID CSCsy44672 and has
    been assigned CVE ID CVE-2009-1167.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Impact
=====

Successful exploitation of the denial of service (DoS)
vulnerabilities may cause the affected device to reload. Repeated
exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.

An unauthenticated, remote attacker may be able to use the
unauthorized configuration modification vulnerability to gain full
control over the Wireless LAN Controller if the attacker is able to
submit a crafted request directly to an administrative interface of
the affected device.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.comw/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

The SSH connections denial of service vulnerability identified by
Cisco Bug ID CSCsw40789 may be remediated by disabling SSH on the
affected device. This workaround requires subsequent management of
the device to be performed using the HTTP/HTTPS web management
interface or the serial console of the device.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in the
network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin
companion document for this advisory, which is available at the
following link:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20090727-wlc.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing, or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound by
the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
================================

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
