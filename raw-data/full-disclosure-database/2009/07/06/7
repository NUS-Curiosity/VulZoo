Subject: Oops! About xscreensaver 5.01

Hello list,
Just to clarify, I tested some operating systems against the
xscreensaver vulnerability
I posted yesterday.
It affects at least xscreensaver 5.01.

It does not affect recent versions as reported
by the Debian bug tracking people, this is confirmed.

Sorry about not catching this.

Best Regards,
/nr
