Subject: HTTP Verb Tampering

hey guys,

i need some help with a HTTP Verb Tampering attack!
by using this attack i already gained access to a folder secured by 
.htaccess - my problem at the moment is:

HOW TO DOWNLOAD FILES BY USING HTTP Verb Tampering?

GET, POST and HEAD methods are excluded via .htaccess is there any 
other method or http verb which allows me to download files without 
having to gain "real" admin status?

thanx for your help,
sincerely, 
s0ul
