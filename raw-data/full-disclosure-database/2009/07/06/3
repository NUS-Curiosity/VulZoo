2. Technical Description

PDM files are used to store essential information about a Photo DVD 
Maker Professional Project (in XML format). The software performs 
inadequate check for the length of a File_Name tag. This results in a 
critical buffer overflow error when set with an overly long value.

In order to exploit, a hacker might create a specially crafted “.pdm” 
file and trick users into using it. If successful, hackers can perform 
local attack, inject viruses, steal sensitive information and even take 
control of the victim’s system.

3. Solution

Rating this vulnerability high severity and due to the fact that the 
vendor hasn’t released any patch against this vulnerability, Bkis 
recommends that users should not open any untrusted PDM file.
