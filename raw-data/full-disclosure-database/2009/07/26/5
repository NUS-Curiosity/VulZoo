Subject: [Tool] sqlmap 0.7 released

Hi,

I am glad to release sqlmap version 0.7.

Introduction
============

sqlmap is an open source command-line automatic SQL injection tool.
Its goal is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection
vulnerabilities in web applications. Once it detects one or more SQL
injections on the target host, the user can choose among a variety of
options to perform an extensive back-end database management system
fingerprint, retrieve DBMS session user and database, enumerate users,
password hashes, privileges, databases, dump entire or user's
specified DBMS tables/columns, run his own SQL statement, read or
write either text or binary files on the file system, execute
arbitrary commands on the operating system, establish an out-of-band
stateful connection between the attacker box and the database server
via Metasploit payload stager, database stored procedure buffer
overflow exploitation or SMB relay attack and more.


Changes
=======

Along all the takeover features introduced in sqlmap 0.7 release
candidate 1, some of the new features include:

* Adapted Metasploit wrapping functions to work with latest 3.3
development version too.
* Adjusted code to make sqlmap 0.7 to work again on Mac OSX too.
* Reset takeover OOB features (if any of --os-pwn, --os-smbrelay or
--os-bof is selected) when running under Windows because msfconsole
and msfcli are not supported on the native Windows Ruby interpreter.
This make sqlmap 0.7 to work again on Windows too.
* Minor improvement so that sqlmap tests also all parameters with no
value (eg. par=).
* HTTPS requests over HTTP proxy now work on either Python 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6+.
