Subject: Breaking: antisec and n3td3v responsible for
	Matasano hacking

GREAT BRITAIN - n3td3v/antisec is proud to announce official 
partnership with antisec ("the scene")

In England, we care about intelligence. There is no better way to 
do intelligence then to compromise computers. We are clearly 
superior at security.

We eat up the competition. Matasano looked like and easy target of 
nubs. So they were subsequently pwned.

Never disrespect our skillz

We official claim responsibility for these actions.

You can twitter us @ www.twitter.com/n3td3v

Freenode in #n3td3v 

We are extensively funded by www.infowars.com and Alex Jones. Watch 
the infowarrior with Jason Bermas for the latest in intelligence.

Alex Jones is NOT related to any federal authority and is not a 
provocateur. Obviously!

Enjoy blackhat/defcon. Hope you have a nice year!
