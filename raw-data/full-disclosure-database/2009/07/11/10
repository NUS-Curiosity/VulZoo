Uh oh, Is that you Chris Silva?

I'm doubtful all the rage is over some images.

I can only imagine you're sad the 04/09/09 source is being dropped;(

I know, We all are. That is besides the huge lulz incurred on all of
#compton and #antisec by posting the inane (and largely useless)
comments in Retina for our amusement, I think the time has come
to man up a bit on your part.

Oh, Whats that? Its illegal in the state of california not
to report breakins that could endanger private data?

Sometimes I guess people need a little motivation.

Don't blame me though, That stuff has been making the rounds on undernet
for quite some time.


In the event its not more pandering from eEye (Admittedly unlikely)
(Inb4 Lawsuits on blackhat forums).
Thats even worse, Then its just some internet toughguy trying to
posture so he can save face.

Though I appreciate the sentiment here with Antisec
You know the "We're super big bad guys, the government doesn't care".
I have a feeling I'm going to have to call your bluff.

Wasn't this the exact same response to the ownage of BlueBoar back in the day?

"WE WILL HUNT YOU DOWN EL8, YOU WILL PAY, WE ARE GOVERNMENT BLAH
BLAH BLAH"

Please, Spare me the pleasantries.

El8 and related groups shattered your worldview.

And that was a shortlived and ultimately fairly tame voyage.

Also, Since when has romeo become the spokesperson for Antisec?
Thats like saying textfiles is the spokesperson for Anarchy and
clandestine LSD production.

So, In short, Be well Dr. Antiantisec, Do good work, and be sure to
keep Pidgin or NTP listening!
