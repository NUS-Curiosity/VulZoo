1. Summary

   Update for Service Console packages udev,sudo, and curl

2. Relevant releases

   VMware ESX 4.0.0 without bulletin ESX400-200906411-SG,
   ESX400-200906406-SG, ESX400-200906407-SG.

3. Problem Description

 a. Service Console package udev

    A vulnerability in the udev program did not verify whether a NETLINK
    message originates from kernel space, which allows local users to
    gain privileges by sending a NETLINK message from user space.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-1185 to this issue.

    Please see http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1011786 for details.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 b. Service Console package sudo

    Service Console package for sudo has been updated to version
    sudo-1.6.9p17-3. This fixes the following issue: Sudo versions
    1.6.9p17 through 1.6.9p19 do not properly interpret a system group
    in the sudoers file during authorization decisions for a user who
    belongs to that group, which might allow local users to leverage an
    applicable sudoers file and gain root privileges by using a sudo
    command.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-0034 to this issue.

    ESX            2.5.5     ESX      not affected

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 c. Service Console package curl

    Service Console package for curl has been updated to version
    curl-7.15.5-2.1.  This fixes the following issue: The redirect
    implementation in curl and libcurl 5.11 through 7.19.3, when
    CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION is enabled, accepts arbitrary Location
    values, which might allow remote HTTP servers to trigger arbitrary
    requests to intranet servers, read or overwrite arbitrary files by
    using a redirect to a file: URL, or execute arbitrary commands by
    using a redirect to an scp: URL.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-0037 to this issue.
