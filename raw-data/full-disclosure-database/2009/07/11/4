Wow.  Those of you who actually believe in and have ideals based in this
anti-sec movement should do some tard-wrangling.  A future created by
anti-sec sure looks great!  Michael Jackson - Good Singer/Performer, OJ
Simpson - Good runningback, Hans Reiser - Good Programmer,  Anti-sec - Good
Hackers.
