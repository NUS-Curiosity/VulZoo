Subject: Re: imageshack - pwned for anti-sec.

As annoying as full disclosure can be to some of us who manage  
multiple sites for a wide range of customers using packages such as  
phpbb, wordpress, etc. (and subsequently fall victim to mass attacks)  
I do believe that the only way to assure that we write secure code and  
use secure practices is to have complete and reaponsible full  
discolsure. History is the best way to make a more secure future.
