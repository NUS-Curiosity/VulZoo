Subject: GIF89A - Maximum expected value of LZW Minimum
	Code Size

Hi,
 
What is maximum value that can be used for "LZW Minimum Code Size" for
GIF89A images?.
My guess is 11 decimal as the maximum output code value is FFF (12
bits).
 
It seems that this field can be used to generate buffer flows in remote
machines.
 
Thanks
