Subject: AntiSec is DEAD

AntiSec is no more. Too gay. Too lame. Too over.

We didn't have a nice run, either. We hump each other until one of 
us shits a 0day. Then, we run outside, like a dog, and eat it. Big 
fucking deal. Wooo-hooooo!

We threaten to show you 0days and none show. We fake logs of us 
destroying data but they are from virtual machines. We hide in our 
own shitty apartments because we our lives are a mess. Done for 
doesn't even describe us. Dead is what we are.

AntiSec has been short lived because it clearly was ran by retards. 
Gay, sloppy, homosexual, no-talent fools.

Rest in Unrest, SHITBAGS.

AntiSec died today. Let every other anti-industry whore movement 
die with it.

Kapeesh?
