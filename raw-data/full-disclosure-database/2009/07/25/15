Blah.. its the same fag punchline every time:

"We will audit your shit and own your shit and shit on what you 
own!@#"

Nobody cares, really. You can't own individuals, all you do is hack 
lame ass servers that are low hanging fruit any ways. Obviously you 
can't hack at all or we wouldn't have stolen antisec@...hmail.com 
and still be insulting you through it.

That is some real lulz!!!!

We don't need to do anything to take you down, you pussies don't do 
anything serious enough to harm the industry in the first place. Is 
metasploit.com still up? Of course. What about offensive-sec? How 
about even blackhat.com? I guess those targets are too hard or the 
real reason is you run them you white hat pieces of shit.

Go blow yourselves up on the internet. Woops, you'll keep doing it 
again. Year after year, attracting more and more followers for your 
no-show cause. Lame.
