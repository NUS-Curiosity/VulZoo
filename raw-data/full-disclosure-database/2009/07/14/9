Thanks for the insight to those who responded.

And yes I was being sarcastic, I trust government(s) to do what they think is best to stay in power and control the populace, just as I trust corporations to do what ever it takes to gain and maintain a monopoly. I think there maybe more rocking horse shit than altruism out there.

As for a secure Internet this *may* only ever be possible if all governments join hands, break bread together, and agree on technology, standards and international/global law. So it's not going to happen in my lifetime or the life times of my great, great (repeat ad nauseum) great grand children either. Especially since most government standards come in pairs.
