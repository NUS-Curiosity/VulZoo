If you have a windows mobile device, it may be bugged.

The government is listening, and we are too.

Blackberries.. poof.

Encryption ciphers.. so last halloween.

We dig and dig until we strike gold.

And here it is.. the one and only...

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/fennec-1.0a1.en-
US.linux-i686.tar.bz2

We upload where we see fit.

Timestamps.. so Internet-explorerish.

If you look hard enough you'll find a 0day. 0day source warez.

Like we said, we own a windows mobile device and an ice scream 
machine.

Bubbles, bubbles.. float on top of water. Eat hotdogs to win the 
lotto.

Buy me a blackberry for christmas pops!
