Subject: Re: Whitepaper

Hi all;

I have published a new white paper titled HTTP Headers Manipulation.

This article discusses the nature of HTTP headers manipulation attacks and
attempts to evaluate the risk and mitigation techniques for the penetration
tester and security professionals.

If you are interested to read it, you can find it on my blog

Best Regards
