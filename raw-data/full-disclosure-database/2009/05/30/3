Subject: Re: Whitepaper

Hi Jared,

Regarding 'The Digital Examination Process: Closing Gaps with New
Technology',et al. From the page: "This paper introduces new
technology called Crucial Vision that addresses this widespread need."

It seems to me that if Crucial Security wants to reach the widest
audience with its revolutionary technology, the company would simply
publish the paper(s) rather than try and mine the data with a 'Request
Resource'.

I can't speak for others, but I navigated away at precisely the moment
I was presented with 'Request Resource'.

Jeff
