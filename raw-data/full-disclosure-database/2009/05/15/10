iDefense Security Advisory 05.14.09

May 14, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Oracle Corp.'s Outside In Technology is a document conversion engine
supporting a large number of binary file formats. Prior to Oracle's
acquisition, the software was maintained by Stellent Inc. The software
appears to have originated from "QuickView" for Windows 98, but later
spun off. It is used by various software packages, one of which is
Motorola Inc.'s Good Mobile Messaging Server. For more information,
visit the vendors' sites at the URLs provided below.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in
Oracle Corp.'s Outside In Technology, as included in various vendors'
software distributions, allows attacker to execute arbitrary code.

These vulnerabilities exist in the handling of an optional data stream
stored within various files. Both issues are integer overflows, and are
within the same function.

Within the vulnerable function, an integer value is read from the
Microsoft Office file. This value is later used in several arithmetic
integer calculations. Since no validation is performed, integer
overflows can occur. The result is the allocation of a buffer that is
too small to hold the data that is subsequently read from the file. A
heap buffer overflow occurs, leading to an exploitable condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows attackers to execute
arbitrary code. In order to exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker
must somehow supply a malformed document to an application that will
process the document with Outside In Technology. Likewise, the
privileges gained will also depend on the software using the library.

In the case of Good Mobile Messaging Server, an attacker can send an
electronic mail message with a specially crafted Office document
attachment to a user. When the user chooses to view the document, the
vulnerable condition will be triggered. Upon successful exploitation,
the attacker will gain the privileges of the "GoodAdmin" user. This is
a special user account which, in some configurations, may be a member
of the "Administrator" group. Regardless of the user's "Administrator"
status, the user will always have full privileges to "Read" and "Send
As" all users on the Microsoft Exchange server. This could allow an
attacker to conduct further social engineering attacks.

Other software packages using Outside In were not investigated.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities using the
follow versions of Outside In on Windows Server 2003. Multiple modules
were confirmed to contain the vulnerable code; vsmpp, vspp97, vsvisio,
vsw6, vsw97, vsxl5. Other modules may also be affected.

  8.1.5.4282
  8.1.9.4417
  8.2.2.4866
  8.3.0.5129

Additionally the following versions of Good Mobile Messaging Server for
Exchange ship with vulnerable versions of the affected modules.

  4.9.3.41
  5.0.4.28
  6.0.0.106

All versions of Outside In, including versions for operating systems
other than Windows, are assumed to be vulnerable. Additionally, all
software that includes or uses Outside In is assumed to be vulnerable.
Earlier versions, including those branded with other names, are
vulnerable as well.

V. WORKAROUND

In order to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, iDefense
recommends using file system access control lists (ACLs) to prevent
reading the affected modules.

For Good Mobile Messaging Server, Good Software recommends deleting the
GdFileConv.exe file and restarting the Messaging Server.
