iDefense Security Advisory 05.14.09

May 14, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Oracle Corp.'s Outside In Technology is a document conversion engine
supporting a large number of binary file formats. Prior to Oracle's
acquisition, the software was maintained by Stellent Inc. The software
appears to have originated from "QuickView" for Windows 98, but later
spun off. It is used by various software packages, one of which is
Motorola Inc.'s Good Mobile Messaging Server. For more information,
visit the vendors' sites at the URLs provided below.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in Oracle
Corp.'s Outside In Technology, as included in various vendors' software
distributions, allows attacker to execute arbitrary code.

This vulnerability exists when handling specific records within a
specially crafted Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file. Within the
vulnerable function, an integer value is read from the file. This value
is later used in an arithmetic integer calculation. Since no validation
is performed, an integer overflow can occur. This results in the
allocation of a buffer that is too small to hold the data that is
subsequently read from the file. A heap buffer overflow occurs, leading
to an exploitable condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary
code. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must somehow
supply a malformed document to an application that will process the
document with Outside In Technology. Likewise, the privileges gained
will also depend on the software using the library.

In the case of Good Mobile Messaging Server, an attacker can send an
electronic mail message with an Excel spreadsheet attachment to a user.
When the user chooses to view the spreadsheet, the vulnerable condition
will be triggered. Upon successful exploitation, the attacker will gain
the privileges of the "GoodAdmin" user. This is a special user account
which, in some configurations, may be a member of the "Administrator"
group. Regardless of the user's "Administrator" status, the user will
always have full privileges to "Read" and "Send As" all users on the
Microsoft Exchange server. This could allow an attacker to conduct
further social engineering attacks.

Other software packages using Outside In were not investigated.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability using the follow
versions of Outside In on Windows Server 2003.

  8.1.5.4282
  8.1.9.4417
  8.2.2.4866
  8.3.0.5129

Additionally the following versions of Good Mobile Messaging Server for
Exchange ship with vulnerable versions of vsxl5.dll.

  4.9.3.41
  5.0.4.28
  6.0.0.106

All versions of Outside In, including versions for operating systems
other than Windows, are assumed to be vulnerable. Additionally, all
software that includes or uses Outside In is assumed to be vulnerable.
Earlier versions, including those branded with other names, are
vulnerable as well.

V. WORKAROUND

In order to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, iDefense
recommends using file system access control lists (ACLs) to prevent
reading the affected module.

For Good Mobile Messaging Server, Good Software recommends deleting the
GdFileConv.exe file and restarting the Messaging Server.
