Subject: Re: Howto Simulate a BotNet ?

No no no, this is a list of knowledge.
If Mark wants to simulate a botnet, firstly he needs to learn how to
do it for a generic purpose network.

Mark, try "ns-2", the best of its kind, and learn how to simulate and
tune bot entities, according to your needs.


Regards,
