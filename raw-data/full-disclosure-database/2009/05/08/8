Team SHATTER Security Advisory

Oracle Database SQL Injection vulnerability in LT.ROLLBACKWORKSPACE

May 4, 2009

Risk Level:
High

Affected versions:
Oracle Database Server version 10gR1

Remote exploitable:
Yes (Authentication to Database Server is needed)

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martínez Fayó of Application Security Inc.

Details:
Oracle Database provides the "LT" PL/SQL package that is part of the Oracle Workspace Manager component (DBMS_WM public synonym). This package has a SQL Injection instance in ROLLBACKWORKSPACE procedure. Dependening on what Oracle Workspace Manager release is installed, this PL/SQL package is owned by SYS (on older releases) or by WMSYS (on newer releases). A malicious user can call the vulnerable procedure of this package with specially crafted parameters and execute SQL statements with the elevated privileges of the package owner, depending on the system configuration it can be SYS or WMSYS.

Impact:
By default [WM]SYS.LT has EXECUTE permission to PUBLIC so any Oracle Database user can exploit this vulnerability. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute SQL commands with SYS or WMSYS privileges.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
Restrict access to the [WM]SYS.LT package.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update April 2009 available at Oracle Metalink.

CVE:
CVE-2009-0978
