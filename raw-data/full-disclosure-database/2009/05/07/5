I totally agree that captive portal based wireless access is a poor
security practice and have been advocating so[1] for quite some time.
But do you plan to release an advisory every single time you find one
somewhere ? The fact that it sits in a plane, hotel, airport, train does
not make a big difference...

And by the way, speaking specifically of planes, this general issue has
already been raised something like 3 years ago[2]...
