Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflows in FreeType might allow for the remote
execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

FreeType is a high-quality and portable font engine.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/freetype     < 2.3.9-r1                    >= 2.3.9-r1

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy reported multiple integer overflows in the
cff_charset_compute_cids() function in cff/cffload.c, sfnt/tccmap.c and
the ft_smooth_render_generic() function in smooth/ftsmooth.c, possibly
leading to heap or stack-based buffer overflows.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted font file, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application,
or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FreeType users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/freetype-2.3.9-r1"
