Subject: Vulnerability Assessment

Hi all,

I have not done VA for a couple of years and now need again to do this
for a medium size company. Nessus became commercial (also if it is
possible to use it for limited activity). Some other free/OS software
went commercial. I am not going to do full pen-test, just want to
check for patching and high level vulnerability.

What is your experience with OpenVAS? Looking at the site is has a
limited number of Vulnerability Check compared to nesssus.

What software can I use for VA (the network is windoze in large parte
with some services implemented on Linux)? My choice are Free or very
cheap software.

Thank you.
Mamo
