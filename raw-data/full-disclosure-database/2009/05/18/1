Subject: Who is destroying our internet?

Whenever a major service goes down people speculate whether it was hacked or
not. This past week we saw Google go down.... And now Avsim was killed
by hackers.

While these two events are not related in anyway, I am wondering why people
don't create backup off site or don't plan normal failsafe's when there site
is as big as Google (we have seen a few popular sites die because of this
mistake)
