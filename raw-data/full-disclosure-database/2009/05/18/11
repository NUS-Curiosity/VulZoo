Subject: DEFCON London - DC4420 - this Thursday 21st May
	2009

yep, what it says on the tin:

we will be meeting this Thursday, 21st May, same time, same place:

time / date:

    18:00 for 19:30
    Thursday 21st May 2009

location:

    Sound Club
    1 Leicester Square,
    London,
    WC2H 7NA

http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=1+Leicester+Square,+Westminster,+London+WC2H,+United+Kingdom&sll=21.826091,75.608125&sspn=0.013824,0.027874&ie=UTF8&cd=1&geocode=FTT-EQMdeAH-_w&split=0&z=16&iwloc=A

this is the NW corner of the square... if you stand facing the Empire
Cinema/Casino, it's two doors to the left...

confusion/faq:

   yes, it's a nightclub.
   no, there is no clubbing / loud music / scantily clad women / poles.
   no, there is no charge at the door - tell the bouncer you are there 
for dc4420 and they will let you in.

tube:

    Leicester Square on the Piccadilly and Northern Lines.
    Piccadilly Circus on the Piccadilly and Bakerloo Lines.

bus:

food :

   food is available at the venue - see the menu at:

   http://www.dc4420.org/files/soundclub/soundoflondon_menu.pdf
   or http://www.dc4420.org/files/soundclub/soundoflondon_menu.jpg

although last month's meet at the club threw up some interesting 
problems, we have been promised they have *all* been fixed... yes, that 
means no flickering lights, working speakers at the back of the room, 
and, most importantly, much cheaper beer/drinks and plenty of food! oh, 
and Guinness. :)

and finally, the talks, which we are limiting to 2 to allow for more 
drinking/socialising:

this month Christer is going to try to knock some learnin' into our poor 
simple heads with his introductory talk in what he promises will be a 
series, so strap your spare neuron in and check out:

   "the techniques of vulnerability discovery (Part 1)"

    - how to get root with the least amount of effort.

and if that doesn't sink in, then perhaps this will help, from Andrew:

   "Exploiting Real Neural Networks for Fun and Profit"

This is a rather controversial talk by a barmy ex-neuroscientist now 
working in InfoSec for nearly a decade. It attempts to cross the bridge 
between carbon and silicon computing from a somewhat hackish 
perspective. To avoid any confusion, these are the topics that would
_not_ be covered:

   - social engineering of any kind, spare for hardware "social 
engineering"  :-)

   - AI or artificial neural network modeling: all networks discussed are
very real

   - "bioinformatics" in the common understanding of the term (so, no 
Perl scripts and gene databases)

   - DNA computing (the majority of entities covered during the talk are
actually typical Von Neumann machines)

And these are the topics that would be covered, subject to timing and
interest of the audience:

   - wetware networking: routing protocols and domains of the human brain

   - route determination and coincidence detection: how filling up our 
internal routing tables is done ?

   - building up receptor-based biological supercomputers specifically
suitable for symmetric ciphers cracking

   - what can be learned about network security from real neural networks
damage and death

   - practical wetware overclocking and cognition enhancement drugs

scary stuff.

as always, full details here:

see you Thursday!

cheers,
MM
