I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quote: "BitDefenderâ„¢ provides security solutions to satisfy the protection requirements 
of today's computing environment, delivering effective threat management for 
over 41 million home and corporate users in more than 100 countries. BitDefender, 
a division of SOFTWIN, is headquartered in Bucharest, Romania and has offices in 
Tettnang, Germany, Barcelona, United Kingdom, Denmark, Spain and 
Fort Lauderdale (FL), USA."


II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The heuristics can be bypassed by a special formatted PDF "container", this
leads to the bypass of malicious PDF files, old or new. This is not a 
bypass that relies on archive structures but relies on evading certain 
code paths in the AV engine "through various means".


III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~
To know more about the impact and type of "evasion", I updated the 
description at http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

Interestingly this opens the possibility to evade at scan time and
run-time.


IV. Disclosure timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

             I cooperate and the planned disclosure date.
