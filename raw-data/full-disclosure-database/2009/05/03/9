	“Cross-Site Scripting” vulnerability in MyBB 1.4.5

That's the problem with XSS, it isn't just one. I've seen XSS that in
turn injects PHP code in to an admin panel that in turn led to RCE.
I've also seen XSS that led to session hijacking that in turn led to
XSS which ultimately led to mass client exploitation.

The bad guys have been using these multi-staged attacks for quite some
time. http://www.coresecurity.com/content/understanding-multistaged-threats
agrees with me.

XSS is particularly nasty because it runs in the client. It is no
longer just cookie stealing, but mass client exploitation, RCE, SQL
injection, CSRF, and so on. It is even used to pivot in to the
internal network, as is the case with MS09-002 (I think that's the
one, someone please correct me if I'm wrong). Entire frameworks have
been built around just XSS. For example BeEF and Jikto.

This is why Jacques Copeau said that the XSS could lead to CSRF and then RCE.
