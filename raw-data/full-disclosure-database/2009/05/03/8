Grabit <= 1.7.2 beta 3 NZB file parsing stack overflow

Impact:        Remote code execution
Version:     <= 1.7.2 beta 3

Description

Grabit is a popular Windows usenet client designed for downloading 
binary files. It has support for NZB files, which a user would usually 
acquire from an external source. Version 1.7.2 beta 3 is vulnerable to a 
stack overflow when parsing DTD references in NZB files. Earlier 
versions are vulnerable as well. Reliable exploitation is pretty 
straightforward.

Fix

I reported this to the author a while ago. He has now released version 
1.7.2 beta  4, which fixes the bug. It can be downloaded at
