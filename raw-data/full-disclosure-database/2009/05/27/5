Subject: Re: Addendum : [TZO-26-2009] Firefox (all?)
	Denial of Service through unclamped loop (SVG)

Hi Jim,

Read again:
Affected : All Firefox versions that support SVG.

Then think about what version of Firefox you are using.

JP> Using FF2.0.0.20 and the file does not result in loss of use. All
