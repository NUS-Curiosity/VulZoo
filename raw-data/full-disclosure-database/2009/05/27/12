	(all?)	Denial of Service through unclamped loop (SVG)

Silly me. Since 
1. There was no version specific information provided by the OP (I looked for that) -and-
2. you tell me that "SVG [whatever that is] (including circle) was originally implemented in Firefox 1.5" -and-
3. There is no documentation that SVG has /not/ been removed from Firefox -and-
4. FF1 has been end-of-life'd, 

what was I thinking???
