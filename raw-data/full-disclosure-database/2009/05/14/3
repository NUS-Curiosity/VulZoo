Subject: Troj/Qbot-B

Group:

I have seen a couple incidents involving Troj/Qbot-B -- have others
recently encountered this virus?

Known alias are:
    * Backdoor.Win32.IRCBot
    * W32/Sdbot.worm
    * Backdoor:Win32/Qakbot.gen!A

Any details and insights about this virus would be most helpful.

Specifically, any hacking tools installed upon gaining remote control
of system?  Whether remote control is possible with this virus?  The
mechanism of control (ie. IRC issued instructions)?

Best regards, Robert Hudock
