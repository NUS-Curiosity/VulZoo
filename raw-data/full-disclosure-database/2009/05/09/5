Ref         : [TZO-20-2009] - AVG generic ZIP bypass / evasion
WWW         : http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/avg-zip-evasion-bypass.html
Vendor      : http://www.AVG.com
Status      : Patched (with engine build 8.5 323)
CVE         : none provided
Credit      : t.b.a
OSVDB vendor entry: none [1]
Security notification reaction rating : good
Notification to patch window : +-28 days 

Comment:
Interestingly at AVG, the support department handles the security
notification response, which strangely seemed to work out this time. I guess when
procedures and awareness are in place it doesn't matter that much. 
(You loose the "bouncer effect" for irrelevant reports though). I'd recommend
to designate one person to be responsible to security related issues, and "train"
the others to forward to that person (even in case of doubt if security or not)
if you choose to have support department handle security notifications.

I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quote: "Founded in 1991, with corporate offices in Europe, the US 
and the UK, AVG is focused on providing home and business computer
users with the most comprehensive and proactive protection against
computer security threats.

With more than 80 million active users around the world, the AVG 
family of security software products is distributed globally through 
resellers and through the Web and supports all major operating 
systems and platforms."


II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The parsing engine can be bypassed by a specially crafted and formated
ZIP (Filelenght) archive.

III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~
A general description of the impact and nature of AV Bypasses/evasions
can be read at : 
http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

The bug results in denying the engine the possibility to inspect
code within RAR and ZIP archives. There is no inspection of the content
at all and hence the impossibility to detect malicious code.
