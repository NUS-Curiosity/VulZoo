iDefense Security Advisory 05.12.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 12, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft PowerPoint is a presentation program that comes with Microsoft
Office. For more information consult the vendor's site at the following
URL.

http://office.microsoft.com/powerpoint

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple stack based buffer overflow
vulnerabilities in Microsoft Corp.'s PowerPoint could allow an attacker
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerabilities exist within the importer for PowerPoint 95 format
files. This functionality is contained within the PP7X32.DLL.

The vulnerabilities occur when reading sound data from a PowerPoint
file. In both cases, a value representing a record length is read in
from the file. This value is then used to control the number of bytes
read into a fixed size stack buffer. There is no check performed to
ensure that the buffer can hold the number of bytes specified, which
results in a stack buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the file. To
exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker needs to convince a user to
open a malicious file. After opening the file, no further interaction
is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

Since the vulnerabilities are stack based buffer overflows, and it is
possible to overwrite SEH handlers stored on the stack, exploitation is
relatively simple.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities in Office
XP SP3, and Office 2000 SP3.

V. WORKAROUND

Use the cacls program to deny access to the DLL containing the
vulnerable code, PP7X32.DLL. This will prevent the vulnerable DLL from
loading in PowerPoint, which will also prevent users from importing
PowerPoint 95 files.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Microsoft has released a patch which addresses this issue. For more
information, consult their advisory at the following URL:
