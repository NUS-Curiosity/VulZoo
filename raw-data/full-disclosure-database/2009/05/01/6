This question is a kind of non-sequitur because you have not told us
what kind of binaries are uploaded, where do they come from, what is 
the server supposed to do with them.

Let me fill the gaps myself for the sake of demonstration: Users compile 
their own programs for some obscure kind of embedded computer and upload 
the resulting binaries to a server that is supposed to archive them for 
future reference. Should these binaries be scanned by an anti-virus?
What do you think?
