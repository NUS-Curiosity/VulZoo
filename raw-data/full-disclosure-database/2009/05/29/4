Subject: FFSpy Buster : Duarte Silva announces that the
	security of most software allowing plugins such as vim, emacs,
	gnome, eclipse, etc. is flawed

Duarte Silva, the creator of the so-called FFSpy PoC seems to be
suggesting that the plugin mechanism of most software which allows a
user to run a plugin in the context of the user running the software
is flawed.

First of all, here is the lame PoC for those who want to read it:
http://myf00.net/?p=18 You can see a few comments where people are
trying to ask how exactly the attack is carried out. However, Duarte
has been giving lame responses such as: "True. But is also interesting
to see that there isn’t nothing to ensure the user the plug-in isn’t
changed."

In his wrap up blog at http://myf00.net/?p=97 he seems to suggest that
the existing plugin or add on mechanism of most software is flawed. Do
read his comments at the end of the blog.
