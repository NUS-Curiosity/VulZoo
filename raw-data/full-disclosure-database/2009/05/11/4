Not useless at all.  I'll bet you that if you go look at banks that have
gotten hacked, at least 75 to 80 percent of them have "we thought the firewall
was secure by default" or similar failure.

You remember that little hack at TJX?  You think anybody actually *checked*
that they were deploying wide open unencrypted wireless, or somebody just
saw "supports WPA2" on the box and said "good enough, it's got WPA2, it's
secure"?

Even if you actually *find* a product that really *is* "secure by default"
out of the box, in practice there's usually *so* many configuration knobs
that can break that security that any "secure by default" is long gone
by the time you actually deploy...
