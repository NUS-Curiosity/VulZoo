Subject: Re: FFSpy, a firefox malware PoC

On the iPhone a new app came out called MobileSpy. Designed
to secretly record all activity on the iPhone. OMG The iPhone now has
spyware etc..... No
the user must 1. Jailbreak his phone 2. Download and install the Mobilespy
application.
Recently a person told me that stupidity is a capital crime. We see that
evermore here. These days we are worried about drive-by downloads. Spyware
in the form of Mozilla Firefox has been an issue for a while.
