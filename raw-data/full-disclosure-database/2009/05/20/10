Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 05.20.09: IBM AIX libc
 MALLOCDEBUG File Overwrite Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 05.19.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 19, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

IBM's AIX is a Unix operating system based on System V, which runs on
the PowerPC (PPC) architecture. For more information, visit the product
web site at the following URL.

http://www.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a file overwrite vulnerability in IBM Corp.'s
Advanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) could allow an attacker to
overwrite arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code.

The AIX libc implementation of malloc includes a debugging mechanism
that is initiated by setting the MALLOCTYPE and MALLOCDEBUG environment
variables. This debugging feature writes to a user-specified log file
under certain conditions. There is a gap in time between the checks to
see if the file is a symbolic link and the process of opening the file.
If an attacker can change the file to be a symbolic link to another file
within this time frame, it is possible to cause a set-uid binary to
write to files owned by privileged users.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary
files and execute arbitrary code as root.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in IBM Corp.'s
AIX version 5.3. Other versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND
