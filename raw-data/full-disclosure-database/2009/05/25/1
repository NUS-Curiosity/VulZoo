So, how does someone manage to edit the overlay file?

Are they going to use some javascript from a malicious website to edit
the overlay file of an addon? Or are they supplying a malware addon as
a normal addon in the firefox addon download page? Or is the attacker
manually editing the addon on another user’s system by gaining access
to that system?

I don’t see any point in this. It is as good as some person taking
some code from somewhere, editing it with some malware code and
resuppplying it and saying “hey, I am not a verified author. you can
now download and install my malware addon”.

Any code out there can have mal addon. I doubt there is anything
special in this. If it is open source, it is the user’s job to check
the codebase for such malicious code.
