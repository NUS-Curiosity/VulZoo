As stated in section 7 (Limitations) my unpacker will not be much help when 
unpacking a virtual machine based protector like Themida / VMprotect.

I know ap0x did some cool antidebugging tricks before :-) Anyway i see there 
are a lot of custom unpackers (on his website) for a lot of known packers - 
however i'm unable to see a one generic one (?) - well still excellent 
things. On the side note deroko (yo man) did some cool underground unpacking 
stuffs, however most of his stuffs (i belive) is still unpublic so i cannot 
refer to them much.

Regarding Quickunpack, to be honest I have never used it but i surely will 
give it a try. Thanks.
