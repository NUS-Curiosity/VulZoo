Subject: Re: PAPER: Generic Unpacking of Self-modifying,
	Aggressive, Packed Binary Programs

Hi Piotr,

Any information with regards to how MMMBoB performs when trying to
unpack a bit more obfuscated/aggressive packers like Themida / VMprotect ?

----

On a side note:
I  see  often that some generic unpackers are rarely cited/referenced,
although they are interesting and perform astonishingly well.

Here are two generic unpackers I think deserve some exposure too :

- RL!unpack
  http://ap0x.jezgra.net/unpackers.html
  (tested against 101+ packers/mods)

- Quickunpack
