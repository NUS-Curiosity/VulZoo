Very unlikely. If your OS has got more holes than a piece of Emmentaler
malicious code might exploit one of them to circumvent or disable
detection even before your antivirus gets a chance to scan it. You lose.
Game over.

Let me check: Can antivirus prevent an arbitrary piece of malware from
causing harm? No--it is impossible even in theory (see Rice's theorem). 
Can OS with a strict MAC policy prevent an arbitrary piece of malware from
causing harm? Yes--it is not easy but it is certainly possible.

Primo: "A worthwhile added value" might be very far from "optimal".
Secundo: Does "however deployed" includes "defunct"?
Tertio: User experience?!
