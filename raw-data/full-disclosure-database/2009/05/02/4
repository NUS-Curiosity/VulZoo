I agree Frank, and so I wrote "By clicking a recent version (so I believe, I can't trace and test various versions) of a PayPal Donation button...".

It doesn't happen in ALL of the donation buttons. I also believe this happens mostly in button codes created by the PayPal site and less or at all in donation buttons/forms manually created by the beneficiary at its own site, and I think the site you linked to is made just with this kind of manual code.

May be not true for every paypal donation form.
If you click on following site on the doante button
  http://www.art-stream.org/donate.php#donate-now
there is no email address in the page source.
Or I don't get the point.
