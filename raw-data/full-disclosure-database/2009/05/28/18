Hi Travis,

With all due respect:

Ok I will take the strawman :

The impact is Denial of Service.

Ignoring  that  this  discussion is of *any* interest to anybody
or even for this overly stupid problem :
- 9 hours for 300+ megabytes
- x minutes for x bytes

Only a few bytes of "k" leads to the compromises of the private key.
(DSA).  Does  this  matter,  not  really.  It's your key anyways. Does
something  "leak" to somewhere were it's not supposed to be, no. Memory
is just not correctly freed.

I'm sure that if you were to familiarise yourself with the some of the
rudimentary concepts involved in dynamic memory allocation you will
understand their decision.
---
Yep,   I  am  an  ignorant  idiot,  can  we move on now ? If *you* can't
imagine a setup or extreme border case where (as example) entropy that
is being collected is indirectly affected, be it in quality of entropy
or size, then clearly *I*  must  be  the idiot that doesn't understand the
concept of memory allocations.

---
Rest assured, there is zero possibility that a memory leak can result in
"reduced entropy, weak key material etc" as you mentioned in email.
----
If you want to discuss further I'd recommend to take it off list.

General comment: I am  interesting  to  see  the  kind  of feedback I
get  when  posting an Firefox bug as opposed to bugs of other vendors.
It's almost like you hit a little boy and everybody steps into for
his defence.

Anyways, too much noise for such a stupid, near irrelevant but.
