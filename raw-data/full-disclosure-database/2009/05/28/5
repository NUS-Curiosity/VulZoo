<http://blog.bkis.com/?p=704>

1. General information

PRTG Traffic Grapher is a network monitoring solution, which helps 
manage and classify bandwidth usage of a network by providing accurate 
results about network traffic and usage trends in graphs and tables. The 
software also supports SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). PRTG 
Traffic Grapher is available at http://www.paessler.com.
