Takes a real genius to Google query your way into SQL injections..

Oh look, I can site:orange.co.uk inurl:id!!!1111oneone... am I as cool
as you 'kids' are?, oh wait.. I need to install my sqlmap and let it
run and output the shit for me, cause I am so eleet.. -_-'

Seriously, pr0j3ct m4yh3m? atleast that served a purpose, people who
were involved in it had a goal, your goal is to... show hackersblog
that you had a vuln before they did? ( which you found thro google
query and exploited using sqlmap ).

YOU fucking _suck_, YOU should be ashamed, ranting about whitehat scum
and hackersblog for couple of SQL injections, damn that was the end of
the blackhat world for real yo..
