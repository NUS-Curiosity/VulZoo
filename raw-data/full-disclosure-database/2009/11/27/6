Subject: Microsoft Windows TCP/IP Timestamps Code
	Execution Vulnerability

Hi list,

Has anyone more details about this vulnerability?. The advisory just say:
"The vulnerability exists due to the TCP/IP stack not cleaning up state
information correctly. This causes the TCP/IP stack to reference a field as
a function pointer when it actually contains other information"
I'd like to know a bit more in order to test it and make some research.

Regards,

Ivan.
