Almost al the competent people there have a vested interest in maintaining the
status quo. You'd have to tread really carefully to find the few people who are
both competent and have terrorist leanings - especially since all the people
you're looking fore are probably already on the payroll of some organization or
other that probably doesn't have any problem with "make the too-nosy guy into a
corpse".

And not all those ruthless organizations are black hat, some are white hat. ;)
