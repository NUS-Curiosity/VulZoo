Subject: Facebook Police

Another interesting article about cops pretending to be teenage girls so they can try and view pictures of kids drinking (or something else) to then arrest them.   Facebook policy requires the use of one's real name to sign up, but they let the police use fake names, steal other people's pictures and pretend to be them, while trying to engineer people into letting them be friends.   This is what the Wisconsin police are doing with taxpayer money - sitting around trying to find pictures of 19-year-olds with beers in their hand on Facebook - rather than tracking down and arresting rapists in Chippewa Falls.   Go cheese heads.
