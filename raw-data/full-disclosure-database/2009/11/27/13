Subject: Re: Microsoft Windows TCP/IP Timestamps Code
	Execution Vulnerability

Binary diffing?. Stop spamming.
We already know that it's a timestamp issue. Do you have any idea to start
some research/test?. I was reading the RFC 1323 and a paper about TCP/IP
implementation in Windows 2003 Server but it seems to be very reliable. I
mean, how windows implemented it to lead to code execution?.
