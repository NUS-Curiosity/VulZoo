Subject: GCHQ supplier pans government file-sharing plans

One of the companies that supply intelligence technology to the government has criticised UK plans to monitor file-sharers.

Detica told ZDNet UK on Thursday that government plans to force ISPs to identify unlawful file-sharers were not proportionate.

"If the government chose to go down that route, we would come out strongly against," said Detica media accounts director Dan Klein. "It's not necessary or proportionate."

Detica, a BAE subsidiary, provides technologies that are used by the intelligence services and law enforcement to gather intelligence. While targeted monitoring of potential terrorists was proportionate, said Klein, using similar technologies for civil infringements was unnecessary.
