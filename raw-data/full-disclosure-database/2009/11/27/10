interesting. who else is reporting this? are warehouse parties
illegal? have there been allegations of minors? allegations of drug
use?
the article didn't seem to indicate anything but confiscating of
laptops as the only crime. i vagly remeber seeing something bout the
crack down on
warehouse parties to begin due to the usage of narcotics and such and
that they were illegally using warehouses without permits.

other then that only thing that comes to mind is "its almost christmas".
