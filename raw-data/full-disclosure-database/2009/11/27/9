Subject: Re: Facebook Police

 "Facebook policy requires the use of oneâ€™s real name to sign up, but
they let the police use fake names.."

Sure the policy says that but a lot of people are changing their names
on a daily basis (ok maybe not daily). And majority of those changes
are
just for fun, but never the less they are against the policy. What
about those people? Only way to verify or check someone's name is
through IP (ISP). And that can't be done
by will.. It must have some legal grounds...

Let me get to the point, I'm sure that police is violating some some
kind of human rights or even law's (?)
