My guess is that there's some code in there that should have said:

if packet.hdr.type = TIMESTAMP  {
     option.callback = timestamp_handler;
     option.data = packet.hdr.timestamp_data;
} else {
     option.callback = NULL;
}

and some other code that did this:

if (option.callback) { *option.callback(option.data) };

but somebody forgot that else field, so .callback was random trash. Since
it was non-NULL random trash, the 'if' was true, and we end up calling through
a trash pointer.  Now if you have a way to control the value of option.callback
(possibly 'option' is an malloc structure), and uou can force re-use of
the area by including multiple TCP options on a christmas-tree packet...

I can't prove that's the case here, but that's the general model for quite a
few "oh fuck we called through a bad function pointer".  If it isn't that, it's
probably a use-after-free where some other function has re-allocated the
storage and done the fandango on the bits.

> Binary diffing?. Stop spamming.

Suggesting doing a binary diff at this point wouldn't be spamming at all - it
would tell you *exactly* where the missing 'else foo=NULL' was. The fact
that we don't have W2003 servers falling over left right and center would
indicate that it's probably some odd corner case involving multiple TCP
option fields and other similar (a bad multiply-nested 'if/then/elseif/then/if/
else/elseif/then/else', nested case statements, etc.  And at that point,
you're going to need either the source or a good binary diff to see where
it went astray. :)
