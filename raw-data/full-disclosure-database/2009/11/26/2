Indeed, I seem to recall that in the decision of the German high court (the country where bureacrats are maybe the most advanced in understanding technology) there was a reasoning to that effect, e.g. arguing that the contents of computers fall under the freedom of thought, since you use them to put down your everyday thoughts.  I could be mistaken about the fact though, but the line of thought is really interesting: to recognise in the legal system the fact that in practice we became cyborgs: our neural circuits are interrupted and wired to our notebooks.  Not a new thing, that one about using notebooks, of course (that changed happened a long time ago), but still widely unrecognised. 8-/
