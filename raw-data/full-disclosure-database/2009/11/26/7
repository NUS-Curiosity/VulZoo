Some lessons to learn:

1) Backups are important.  If nothing else, buy a 500G USB SATA disk drive and
dump your machine to it once or twice a week.

2) Always mount a scratch monkey. (Bonus points for the silverbacks who get the
reference).  A crash-n-bun test system, or at least a throwaway VMware with a
'revert' button.

3) If something is doing nothing but a 'system()' call on a string of hex constants, you
probably want to do the following first:

a) See what 'printf("%s", hexconstant)": produces
b) Understand why you don't want to just do "printf(hexconstant);'

4) You should have read the whole thread, not just snarfed up the exploit.
Often, first posts of new exploits are buggy and the rest of the thread has
useful bugfixes.  In this case, the thread almost certainly had several
indignant posts just like yours. ;)
