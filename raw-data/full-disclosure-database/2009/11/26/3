Subject: Re: need advice on adtmt cookie

As far as I can tell, admt is a name of an ad-delivery network, and the admt
that McAfee is detecting is the name of the tracking cookie that it uses.
As far as risk goes, I'd say it is no more risky than any other tracking
cookie.  Delete it if you want, but it hasn't really caused any issues for
me.
