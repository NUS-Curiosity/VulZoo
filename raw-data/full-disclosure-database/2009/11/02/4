Subject: Reminder for DeepSec 2009 Conference

== DeepSec In-Depth Security Conference 2009 "TripleSec" ==

This is a reminder for the third DeepSec conference, taking place between
17th and 20th November at the Imperial Riding School Renaissance Hotel.

== Schedule ==

The schedule of all presentations can be found on our web site:
https://deepsec.net/schedule/

Random speaker and content from the schedule:

Karsten Nohl from H4RDW4RE will present the latest development on his project
to break A5/1 with the help of pre-computed tables as announced at HAR 2009.
Karsten Nohl says, that a public PoC on cracking GSM"s encryption is
necessary to raise awareness about the risks of sending sensitive information
over GSM networks. In March 2008 the finalisation of A5/1 rainbow tables was
announced but never released in public, the first academic attacks date even
back to 1997. Today it is believed that agencies and well-funded
organizations have access to efficient A5/1 crackers. Publishing a practical
attack in public will give a better awareness about the situation of an
encryption scheme that was designed and developed in the 1980ies and still
used today.
