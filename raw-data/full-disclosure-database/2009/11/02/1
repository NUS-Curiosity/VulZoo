Fionnbharr,
laurent is blackhat peace of spit asshole, and you're an attention seeker.
Everyone knows, the only remote bug you can find is  an xss or even better a

laurent will find some nastie stufft as always, but will totally screw up at

Your troll sucks fionnbharr davies no one cares about you, and will, you're
like dropped tcp packet.
