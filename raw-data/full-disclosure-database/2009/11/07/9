No, actually I don't.  I just did a lousy job of wording it.

That's only true if they can get the paperwork done and obtain the warrant 
within 72 hours.  Otherwise, at the 72 hour mark all monitoring must 
cease.  And guess who knows that?  We don't exactly keep our operational 
strictures secret, you know.  And to think that terrorists aren't aware of 
the rules within which we operate is to display profound ignorance.  They 
have taken clear advantage of our restrictive Rules of Engagement in Iraq 
and Afghanistan to inflict more casualties on us than we might otherwise 
have suffered.

Remember they first have to gather sufficient data to convince a judge 
that they have sufficient probable cause to conduct the surveillance.  And 
they have to do that separately for every device the terrorist might use. 
(That's been changed now, but even that some of the privacy advocates are 
opposed to.)  Then they have to put a legal brief together, obtain the 
Attorney General's approval and signature and then contact the court for 
the warrant.  Then the court needs to read the brief, and if the judge has 
questions, they must obtain the answers to those before they can get the 
warrant.

It's not quite the same as dropping by Human Resources to pick up a copy 
of your Benefits Handbook, as you imply.

Yes - political enemies and activists - not terrorists.

It seems particularly peculiar to me that people get all hot and bothered 
about this issue given that a plausible scenario has a terrorist in 
Pakistan contacting a party in the United States (sleeper cell?  lone 
actor?) who may or may not be a US person, and that the intent of the 
monitoring is to find out what they're doing or planning to do so that we 
can prevent terrorist acts, not to convict US persons of a crime.

As I've pointed out now several times, it's analogous to people that get 
all hot and bothered by the fact that admins have access to the data on 
their computers.  You, of all people, know what a bogus concern that is. 
Admins could care less about the data on your computer, much less have the 
time to go rummaging around through all that data looking for something 
interesting.  They just wish you quit getting your computer infected all 
the time.

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
