You say that claims about the NSA conducting warrantless wiretaps against US
citizens are unsubstantiated.  That is totally and blatantly false (
http://is.gd/4PcWV).  The linked article clearly states, "Mr. Bush's
executive order allowing some warrantless eavesdropping on those inside the
United States - including American citizens, permanent legal residents,
tourists and other foreigners - is based on classified legal opinions that
assert that the president has broad powers to order such searches, derived
in part from the September 2001 Congressional resolution authorizing him to
wage war on Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, according to the officials
familiar with the N.S.A. operation."

And, in case you don't believe the other article, here (http://is.gd/4Pd1C)
is a Congressional Research Service article that goes into more detail about
the legal rationale behind the warrantless wiretapping program.

As the two links above show, the warrantless wiretapping program is real,
and was at least active throughout the term of the Bush administration.
Whether it is currently active is a matter that can be debated, but the fact
such a program existed and did spy on American citizens is well
substantiated.

As your own signature states, "It is as useless to argue with those who have
forsaken reason as it is to give medicine to the dead." Part of using reason
is acknowledging when there is substantiated evidence for the opposing point
of view.
