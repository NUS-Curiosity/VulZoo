Actually Paul, you have that bass-ackwards, and it's important.

They are allowed to start wiretapping immediately, and then have 72 hours
*after they already started listening* to find a FISA court judge and
do the paperwork.  So yes, the terrorists don't wait for a warrant, and
the NSA doesn't need to wait either.

So let's see.. You're the NSA. You develop a person of interest.  You start
wiretapping the crap out of this guy.  You now have 72 hours to call the FISA
judge you almost certainly have on speed-dial. The request will almost
certainly be granted (one source list 18,761 FISA warrants requested from 1978
up to the end of 2004, of which *4* were rejected - but then granted after
modification).

But even *that* is apparently too onerous.  The only reasonable conclusion is
that you wanted to wiretap people that even the fairly lenient FISA rules
wouldn't get you a warrant. And that's important, because the entire reason the
FISA court was created in 1978 in the *first* place was because Nixon got
caught using government agencies to illegally spy on political enemies and
activists.
