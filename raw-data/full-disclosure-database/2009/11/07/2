Not being privy to the process, I couldn't even say if the approval 
process is that high.  I'm not inclined to believe it simply because some 
reporter or secret source claimed it to be true.  You, of course, live 
with the absolute certainty that you know the truth and no other possible 
explanation is plausible than the one you believe.

I think this subject matter is far too complex for you to understand.  You 
require simple explanations for everything.  The government is always and 
wholly evil.  People who reveal secrets that they've sworn not to reveal 
always tell the truth.  Etc., etc.

Human nature doesn't change when you get hired by the government.  Motives 
will be the same as they are in every other field of endeavor.  Or do you 
seriously believe that as soon as one receives their first payroll check 
from Uncle Sam that they immediately become part and parcel of the evil 
empire?

BTW, it isn't the government that is about staying in existence so much as 
it is the politicians.  Change that, and you can change the government. 
Or is that to hard a concept to follow?

Math wasn't your long suit, huh?

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
