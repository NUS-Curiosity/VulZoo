Subject: Troopers 2010 security conference, CfP

Once more, it will be Troopers time.


This year, again,  _everybody_ involved in the event (speakers and attendees) enjoyed themselves and could significantly gain knowledge (and/or network with other researchers). We had great presentations, a number of interesting tools saw the light of earth and - as was the case in 2008 with Francisco's and Federico's Evilgrade - some groundbreaking stuff was presented at Troopers for the first time at all. 

Next year's Troopers edition will be held in the beautiful city of Heidelberg (on 03/10 and 03/11 2010) and will feature two tracks, one on attack techniques and security research, the other focused on management aspects of the infosec world.
To get an idea of the event pls look at www.troopers08.org [in 2009 we've been partnering with another event and subsequently changed the format, we'll get back to the initial structure in 2010].


Our call for papers addresses security researchers interested in sharing their knowledge with other researchers and a high level audience. We would like to invite everyone with special knowledge in breaking security in whatever area or practical experience in securing complex information systems to present their skills, tools or experience.


Speaker Privileges
==================

We will cover the flight costs (limited to EUR 500 for speakers from Europe and US$ 1500 for speakers from other continents) and three nights of accomodation. 

"Fresh Headz"
=============

Given an appropriate subject and technical level we're happy to welcome "fresh speakers" (not seen in various places before) and we're happy to help you with setting up your talk (or getting over your pre-talk excitement).


Submissions
===========

We are mainly interested in talks on

Virtualization Stuff
Embedded Devices
Industrial Networking
Security in Carrier Environments
Secure Coding

Obviously heavy vendor-pitching will not be welcomed warmly and we reserve the right to ask for modifications of confirmed talks if we have the impression there's too much of that in a talk. If you have to offer another "Web 2.0 cross browser unicode overflow" talk you may submit it. However chances will be bigger if you have some more innovative stuff to talk about...



CFP submissions [to cfp@...opers.de] must include the following information: 

1) Brief biography including list of publications and papers published previously. 

2) Proposed presentation title & synopsis/description.

3) Contact Information (full name, alias, handle, e-mail, postal address, phone, country of origin, special meal requirement, smoking habits ;-).

4) Employment and/or affiliations information. 
 
5) Why is your material different or innovative or significant?

Please note that all speakers will be allocated 55 minutes of presentation time + 5 minutes Q+A. Any speakers that require more time must inform the CFP committee in the course of the submission.

By agreeing to speak at Troopers10 you are granting ERNW GmbH the rights to reproduce, distribute, advertise and show your presentation including but not limited to http://www.troopers.de, printed and/or electronic advertisements, and all other mediums.
