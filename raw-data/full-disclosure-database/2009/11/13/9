I'm not a fan of software patents, but this seems to be a meaningful
difference. Apps aren't written for Windows to request privilege
elevation and a system which handles it automatically is a better one.

And as the article says, the claim in the subject line of this thread is
nonsense. It's obvious to anyone who reads the patent, which is a very
short one.
