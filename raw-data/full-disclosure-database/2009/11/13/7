Total propaganda, if you read it properly you will see.. Ms will not ever own or patent the sudo command. They offer a list of accounts which will be needed when elevated privileges are required.. Sudo doesn't do anything like this at all..

Long live Unix commands, down with the cmd.

This doesn't sound like it would cover sudo to me, or even a GUI-wrapper for sudo.  While I am not a patent attorney, I have been hacking on sudo for the past 15+ years.

My reading of the patent indicates that it is geared towards GUI-based environments where the user may need to perform some action (such as setting the clock in a control panel) that requires increased privileges.  The actual "invention" appears to be that the user is able to perform an action as a different user without having to type in the name of that other user when authenticating.  One example given in that patent is the ability to click on a name in a list of privileged users as opposed to having to type in a user name.

Sudo simply doesn't work this way.
