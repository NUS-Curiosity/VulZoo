Subject: JTTF/FBI informant "snitching" on security
	professionals in Bay Area

Greetings Full Disclosure,

For the past few weeks I've been facing a professional dilemma. 
Should I out someone who at one time fellated me? Should I trouble 
my colleagues with drama only 5% will care about. I'll take the 
gamble, as there are odds 100% may reap entertainment from such 
undertakings.

It has come to my attention that one "Hepkitten" is an informant of 
the United States Government.

She has attended Defcon a few times. You may recognize her face. 
You may have had her face on your genitals (Yes, this is the one).

She resides in San Francisco, California. Lives with her kids. She 
is on the FBI payroll and has been for at least 2 years.

At the behest SF FBI and JTTF -- no less - she has spent the past 
few years successfully infiltrating security/activist groups. She 
has also acted as anarchist provacateur.

She has guaranteed immunity from prosecution.

I would like her docs submitted to my desk immediately.

Salt the Earth,
