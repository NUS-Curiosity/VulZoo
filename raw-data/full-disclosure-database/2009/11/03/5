If you are about to exploit this bug with ollydbg and a /SafeSEH scanner
plug-in which could be found at:

http://www.openrce.org/downloads/details/244/OllySSEH

I think you may need to change line 516 of ollysseh.c from *free(lpDD);* to
*else free(lpLCD);* and re-compile it. Or you may find your ollydbg
crashes once it runs the original OllySSEH.dll plug-in.

Thanks,
M. Yanagishita
