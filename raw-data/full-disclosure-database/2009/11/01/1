Subject: Dark side of bookmarks

Hello participants of Full-Disclosure!

After my articles about different attacks via redirectors - Redirectors: the 
phantom menace (http://websecurity.com.ua/3495/) and Attacks via closed 
redirectors (http://websecurity.com.ua/3531/), here is my new article. This 
time about attacks via bookmarks. In article Dark side of bookmarks 
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3643/) I'll tell you about risks of bookmarks in 
browsers.

There are possible next attacks via bookmarks:

1. Spam.
2. Phishing.
3. Malware spreading.
4. DoS attacks.

You can read the article Dark side of bookmarks at my site:
