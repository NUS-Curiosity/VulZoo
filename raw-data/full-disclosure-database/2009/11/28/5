Are you kiddin me? Double, triple dare you to start chanting "Allah"
"kill the infidels".

We promise to write you once you arrive a Guantanamo Bay. Call me a
"sub human", conspirator, right-wing nut, or whatever. I feel like a
pawn in a big chess game and I am not the one playing. I think spy
movies reveal many "true" things not shadow of things. I think there
is somethin buried in the corner of the Whitehouse. That Ben
Franklin's glasses will be found, and Big Brother is not a charitable
organization. I've been on E-bay, have a paypal account, three email
address, have kids that download music, use a debit card, given my SS#
out a million times. Therefore, I am F'd.

Ok, I'm shutting my puter off now.
