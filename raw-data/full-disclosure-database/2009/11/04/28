What's "pure evil" about exploiting the ease by which one can spread
misinformation? If anything, it exposes how willing even a community
like this is to believe a single blogpost and spread it around without
truly confirming its origins.

I was trolled, I have lost. Feel free to admit it yourself instead of
calling this prank "pure evil."
