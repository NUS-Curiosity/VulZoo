You're new here, aren't you? :)

We're talking here about the FBI, which has had problems with their abuse
of surveillance from J Edgar Hoover's early years up to the recent problems
with abuses of NSLs.  And you expect us to believe they'll toe the line
when using this surveillance ability?

Oh, and how much time did J Edgar spend in jail for his illegal wiretaps?
And how much time will anybody spend in jail for the NSL abuses?
