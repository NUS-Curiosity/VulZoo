No, it's the same issue.  If the agents were acting within the law, it wouldn't
be an illegal wiretap.

So "illegal wiretap will get the perpetrators jailed" should read "illegal
wiretap *may* get the perpetrators jailed, depending on the whim of the DA
and the political climate at the time".

J. Edgar Hoover went to jail for the maximum sentence for his illegal
surveillance of a Nobel Peace Prize winner, right?

George W Bush and company went to jail for the maximum sentence for their
self-admittedly illegal surveillance without FISA warrants, right?

Oh, they didn't even get indicted, much less jailed?  Yeah. That's what I thought...
