No one in the Bush administration ever "self-admitted" to illegal surveillance 
nor has it ever been proven in court that there *was* any illegal survelliance. 
Stop reading the New York Times.  There are good arguments for the wiretaps 
being illegal, and there are equally good arguments that they were not.  Until 
it's challenged in court and decided one way or the other, calling the wiretaps 
illegal is nothing more than an opinion.

Please cite one proven instance where surveillance was done on anyone without a 
FISA warrant - and lefty blogs filled with hyperbole don't count.

You should worry a lot more about the loss of your freedoms from people like 
Barney Frank than you ever should about FBI surveillance.
