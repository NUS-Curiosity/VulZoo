Subject: How Prosecutors Wiretap Wall Street

The answer is both more mundane and more alarming. Prosecutors are
using the FBI's massive surveillance system, DCSNet, which stands for
Digital Collection System Network. According to Wired magazine, this
system connects FBI wiretapping rooms to switches controlled by
traditional land-line operators, internet-telephony providers and
cellular companies. It can be used to instantly wiretap almost any
communications device in the U.S. â€” wireless or tethered.
