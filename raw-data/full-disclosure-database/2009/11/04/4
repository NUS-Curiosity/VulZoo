Of course, without a warrant they can't wiretap anything.  Furthermore 
every warrant to wiretap has to be accompanied by evidence that justifies 
the warrant and signed by a federal judge who agrees that there is 
sufficient cause for the wiretap, and illegal wiretaps will not only get 
your case thrown out of court but your butt thrown in jail as well.

But other than that, it's really troubling....
