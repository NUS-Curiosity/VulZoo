So what? Ban the IP address. Admittedly a childish comment but the site is hardly one that is frequented by children.
imho Mr K. Greenbaum should be fired and sued.

And Mr Holstein you seem to be using your quote above out of context...

Compliance with Legal Process
We may disclose personal information if we or one of our affiliated companies is required by law to disclose personal information, or if we
believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with a law or some legal process, to protect or defend our rights and property, to
protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our web sites or to protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public.

INAL, however I ask where is the legal process in this matter?
