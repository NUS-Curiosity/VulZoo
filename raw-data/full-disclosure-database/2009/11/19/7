Seriously.  Get professional help.

If you're a male in your 20's and think you're being followed, it's much more
likely you're suffering from paranoid schizophrenia than you've actually become
important enough to be followed.

Writing about yourself in the third person is waaaay totally creepy, too.

Man, bet he wishes he'd been PGP-signing his postings to make it a lot
more difficult to post forgeries. ;)

Wow, even his biggest-security-scene-in-the-world group turned against
him?  Ya know - if everybody keeps telling you the same thing, maybe
it's not them, it's you.

Dood. *Take* *your* *meds*. ;)

I suspect that if you don't even understand what 'underground' means,
you're not going to get many calls from MI5, 6, or 7.

Interesting, since (a) MI7 has been long defunct and (b) it
was the War Office's offices for censorship and propaganda.

In other words, MI7 was the War Office's troll and anti-troll efforts.

We've not often seen such subtle self-reference in posts relating to
n3td3v - usually it's a sledgehammer...
