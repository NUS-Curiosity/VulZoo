Subject: Meet Kurt Greenbaum, Director of Social Media,
	St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Reports commenter to employer.

I smell a lawsuit coming on for our friend Greenbaum.

"ReadWriteWeb has an article up today discussing an incident in which a school employee lost his job after leaving a comment on the website of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper. After the school employee responded to the newspaper's poll of 'the strangest thing you've ever eaten' with a feline-inspired vulgarity, Kurt Greenbaum, the site's director of social media, tracked down the commenter's identity through his IP address and reported him to school officials. When confronted, the school employee resigned from his job."

The comment in question:

"I have eaten many different animals (or at least parts of them), including rattlesnake, crocodile, alligator, iguana, turtle, and many different molluscs, arthropods, echinoids, and whatnot from sea or river. I have also eaten squirrel, bear, dog, and cat. So, I can say I have eaten pussy, and you can interpret or misinterpret it any way you want. Oh, and woof-woof, too."

Chilling free speech? It must invade the privacy of the poster to call his place of work over a comment like this.

What Greenbaum did was against the privacy policy of the site:

    "We will not share individual user information with third parties unless the user has specifically approved the release of that information"

So should people who run newspaper blogs call up the place of work to report they said an innuendo about cats?

I'll be the first to say it. Kurt Greenbaum is a miraculous hypocrite who's career has basically been ruined. 

He may as well be like Chris Hansen and expose pedophiles. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CgUXWIOLLw
