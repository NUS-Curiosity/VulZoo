-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a
malicious document.

The specific flaw exists when parsing a document containing a malformed
PivotCache Stream. The application will utilize the iCache value of an
SXVI record to seek into a list of objects. While setting an attribute
of that particular object, the application will corrupt memory which can
lead to code execution under the context of the currently logged in
user.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
