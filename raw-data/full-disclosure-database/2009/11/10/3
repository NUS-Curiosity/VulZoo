This is double plus good! You are a double plus good duckspeak!
Oh, by the way, I got a mail from anonymous who claims that he/she/it
DISCOVERED a series of important DoS of Intenet Exploder which, in every
Fool-Disclosure participant's opinion, may greatly enhance the importance of
your achievement.

Useful as the information was, I cannot reply nor hear from him/her/it
again. All I know is, according to his/her/its last mail which remains in my
inbox, he/she/it lived in stone age and his/her/its parents are cousins.

Double plus sincerely yours,
Have T. Perish
