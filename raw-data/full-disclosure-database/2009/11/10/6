Itâ€™s a bailment if I give a package to an agent to deliver somewhere too, but in that case the bailment

Ends when delivery occurs.

The only "property" in a tweet or email is intellectual property, and that remains the property of the sender... in my jurisdiction, at least, which isn't even a US one.

Also, this is the most pathetic nerd-fight I have seen for many a year.

I fail to see how that applies.  The law of bailment basically means that
you continue to own a possession, the physical possession of which you
*temporarily* grant to another party.  (Allowing someone to drive your car,
for example, but expecting them to return it when they're done.)

When you send a twitter or email, etc., you don't have any intention of
continuing to possess the "property".  The reason you sent the
communication is so that someone else could *receive* it from you, not so
they could "watch" it for you temporarily.  When you send a letter to
someone you don't continue to possess the letter.  The recipient does.
