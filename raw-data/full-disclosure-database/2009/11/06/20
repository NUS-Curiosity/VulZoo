Taunting other people's english skills work better when your own english isn't broken :)

It's true, Laurent is a blackhat. I am glad the security community at large is accepting this fact. This matter has been passed onto his soon to be employers.

Aside from that I'm not trolling, just speaking my mind. Something you're obviously familiar with doing. Can't we be friends? I mean, you don't like that Krakow Labs person either. It's can be the icebreaker in our internet relationship. We can have and eDinner and discuss interesting topics like your broken english and terrible comparisons.

Eventually though our love with wither and we'll stop mIRC32ing together so much. It'll happen slowly at first, taking 30+ mins to reply to a query, but it'll quickly grow much like our mutual ambivalence. Until one day I'll care about you as much as a dropped like a UDP packet.
