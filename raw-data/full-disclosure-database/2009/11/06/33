I had to do a similar thing when doing a spam-appliance "vendor 
shakedown" .. what I did was setup a subdomain

eg: test.mycompany.com

and then create email IDs within that subdomain that had valid mailboxes

eg: bob@...t.mycompany.com, suzie@...t.mycompany.com, etc.

and then I used Google to search for "free offers" and "work from home", 
etc. and entered those IDs on about 100 different sites. There's tons of 
sites out there that you can sign-up for "hundreds of free offers" and 
whatnot.

Within days I was getting hundreds of messages per day for each ID.

Note .. they have to be valid mailboxes because you frequently need to 
reply to the "activation" email to make them work. You could setup a 
little script to wget any links in emails received and do "-O /dev/null" 
with the results .. but I just had all the accounts configured on a test 
machine in thunderbird so I could view what came through and the 
resulting "junk summary" emails.

The advantage of doing it as a subdomain (or just register another test 
domain) is that you can make the traffic go away entirely by deleting 
the DNS record.
