Don't bother.  Paul couldn't see the obvious if someone whacked him in the head with it.  An artifact from the 1950s era where government can do no wrong.  He needs to see everything for himself to believe it.  Of course, that means that Paul probably believes the world is flat, that the Sun revolves around the Earth, and that we were born about 6000yrs ago...

Paul, someone should put you on display in the Smithsonian.
