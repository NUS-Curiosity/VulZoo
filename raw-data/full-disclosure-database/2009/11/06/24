What privileges did the user who performed the select have?

INTO OUTFILE is a dangerous routine (as you've clearly demonstrated), but that 
privilege must be specifically granted to a user before it's possible to 
execute it.  No sensible administrator would grant the FILE privilege to a 
webserver application's database acccount.  (Usually SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE 
should be enough.)

OTOH, if you've found a way to execute FILE without having that privilege 
granted to the account, you've uncovered a serious problem.
