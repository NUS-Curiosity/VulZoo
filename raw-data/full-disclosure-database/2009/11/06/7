What do you say to the 99.99% approval rate?  Are the FBI and other enforcement agencies just that good or is there a rubber stamp at work here?

What an idealistic view.  How quant.  I suppose you believe in truth, justice, and the American way as well.  This is 2009.  Wake up, Paul.  The government is about one thing -- staying in existence.  Given your stance on other topics, I'm surprised you don't realize this.

We aren't talking about the NSA.  Try to keep up.  The NSLs are issued by the FBI.

No question they dropped the ball.  Am only surprised that you didn't expect as much.

This isn't about me, Paul.  Despite your attempt to divert the discussion.

Wow.  How did you pull that fact out of your ass?  Nobody mentioned violating their oaths of office...except you.  more diversionary bullshit.

I, along with my employer, pay for my health care.  That's another thing you're wrong about.
