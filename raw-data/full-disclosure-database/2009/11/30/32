No, Valdis.  There *is* no saving us.  We are hostage to our environment, and 
nothing we do or don't do will change that.  We can make less or more of an 
impact on our environment by being good stewards, but in the final analysis one 
large metorite or one Kracow can change the earth's environment in less time 
than it takes us to think about what we can do to improve it.

Ask the people of New Orleans how much good their levees did them.  Or the 
people around Mt. St. Helens how much all their preparations helped.

It is only man's hubris that makes him think that he can change the earth's 
environment in any significant way, for better or for worse.

Note that I am *not* saying that we should do whatever we like.  I firmly 
believe we should do the best we can to take care of the earth to the best of 
our capabilities.  But to think that we could stop the oceans from rising ten 
feet by controlling our emissions is the heighth of arrogance and foolishness. 
We could bankrupt the world economy and the oceans would still rise ten feet, 
if that's what's going to happen (not that I think for one minute that they 
will.)
