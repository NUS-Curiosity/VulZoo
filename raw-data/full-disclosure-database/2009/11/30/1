"Scientists" are caught red-handed manipulating data to serve their 
purposes, on an issue that is critical to the economic well-being of the 
world, and the best you can muster is "sad"?

It's no wonder that the global warming scam has managed to survive 
repeated negative revelations.

One wonders what it will take to make people angry.
