A picture of a beer can in someone's hand does not prove it contained anything, much less
beer. I have sometimes left glasses of things like apple juice with a bit of ice cream
foam on top in church (when the organist needed a drink) or spoken of such. I also recall
a lot of guys when I was in college making statements about their drinking and/or sexual
prowess which turned out to be exaggerated. (I also remember kids in jr. high smoking
cornsilk cigarettes in public to show off...or at least holding them to their mouths with
a burning end. Claim was they tasted awful.)

A beer or for that matter whiskey bottle might just as well contain tea. A picture by itself
even when not tampered with does not necessarily show what it's cracked up to...
You get suspicion, nothing more. And much less if making photos well documented to be
of faked circumstances gets popular. Remember all the email signatures on the net with
"NSA bait" phrases?

Actually, I'm not sure what the issue is here.  Facebook is a public forum.  Underage drinking is an illegal act.  If
you post evidence of yourself committing an illegal act to a public forum, the police are free to come and arrest you,
and use the pictures that you posted as evidence against you.

The only complaint here seems to be that the police violated Facebook's Terms of Service in "friending" these underage
drinkers and gathering evidence against them.  However, I'm not sure how that's illegal in any way.  If it were,
undercover investigations and sting operations of all sorts would be illegal.

As I see it, these are kids who were caught out in their own stupidity, for doing something that they know to be
illegal, and then posting pictures.  Now these same kids are whining because the police were marginally more tech-savvy
than they assumed.
