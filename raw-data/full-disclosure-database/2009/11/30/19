No ever stated that the climate wasn't changing.  It always is.  And there's 
nothing man can do to change that.  One major volcanic eruption does more 
damage to the climate than billions of people driving cars worldwide and in 
much less time.

That would should be good stewards of the earth goes without question.  That we 
should do everything reasonable to reduce or eliminate pollution goes without 
question.

But the scam that the global climate is changing so dramatically that we need 
to take urgent action and spend trillions of dollars worldwide to address the 
problem has been repeatedly exposed to be just that - a scam.  Since these 
particular "scientists" are the leading proponents of the man-made global 
warming theory and the driving force behind the UN's IPCC reports, that 
particular theory is called into serious question if not damaged irretrievably.

Recent evidence shows that the globe is again cooling, a natural process that 
these fakers want to hide, because it runs counter to their claims, threatens 
their income stream and makes a mockery of their demands for immediate action 
to prevent the supposed coming disaster.
