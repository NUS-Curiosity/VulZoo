First, I'm neither British nor based in the UK, despite my Email 
address and this is not a defense of the UK position, which sucks.

You say "our" -- you mean the USA??

If so, then you are really behind on your reading.  The US has almost 
exactly the same laws in place thanks to some of the weasel words in 
the Patriot Act and its friends.

I'm continually surprised how ignorant of this so many US folk are.
