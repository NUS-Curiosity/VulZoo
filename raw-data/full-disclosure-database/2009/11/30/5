Subject: Oracle exploit for CTXSYS.DRVXTABC.CREATE_TABLES
	and others

Hi!
I've just released the working exploit for CTXSYS.DRVXTABC.CREATE_TABLES
injection on Oracle DB 9i/10g (CVE-2009-1991)

You can find the code on my site, http://rawlab.mindcreations.com

In particular,

Classic SQL injection:
http://rawlab.mindcreations.com/codes/exploit/oracle/ctxsys-drvxtabc-create_tables.sql

Cursor injection:
http://rawlab.mindcreations.com/codes/exploit/oracle/ctxsys-drvxtabc-create_tablesV2.sql

Into the site you can find exploits for COMPRESSWORKSPACETREE,
REMOVEWORKSPACE and MERGEWORKSPACE injections (SYS.LT) too.
