I don't think that you got it right. In my point of view you were banned,
because you were trolling the bad way. It had nothing to do with you making
a point.

 so they setup a bunch of aliases on here to provoke me into "troll style",

These people were actually real poeple, not aliases. You trampled on our
nerves.

No, actually you gave us enough reasons not to take anything serious that
you mentioned.

Man, it's just a bit of babbling.. This happens everywhere. But your
reaction shows that you have a desperate problem with yourself. You take
everything as an attack against you and you see conspiracies all over. In
short: "You're a paranoid idiot".

Anyways - someone one this list told you months before, that people applying
for such jobs must keep this for themselves. :-) So - good luck.

I mentioned it before. You're paranoid and you're talking about your sick
illusions instead focusing on the topic you have addresses in the first
sentences. This makes you a troll. You just want to get reactions, you want
us/me to answer you. Now here's more attention, again...
Just read your fucking email again. You want to say something about
cyber-war. Instead you talk about yourself and your,, uhm.. "thoughts"(?)

I openly post with my real name to criticize and still would be using my

It would be great if you'd accept that the FD-Community voted against your
attention-whore-behaviour. Your posting shows, that you still didn't get the
point.

no one cares.

Actually you should have been thinking about it. We all knew it. Now that I
told you, you can accept it.

I don't remember reading any valuable posting of you, disclosing stuff. But,
still, the point is that you've been banned for selfish trolling.

Take care.  (And don't forget the meds)

I seen your conversation today with the fake n3td3v. You seem to think
I was a troll? I can tell you when I was on the list I was nothing to
do with trolling. I ask you to stop replying to people pretending to
be me and I ask you not to call me a troll when you know im not one.
