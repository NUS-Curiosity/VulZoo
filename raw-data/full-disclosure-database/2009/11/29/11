Nevertheless how fake and phoney these Scientists are we shouldn't
(again) take the easy route of ignorance.

It is a fact that we as industrial countries pollute more and more. And
that CO2 emissions are not ideal. Some of you might ride push bikes in
city centres and probably know how bad pollution can be for your health.

As we are part of nature and does harm to us, it will harm all others,
including the planet. (Allthough I don't like to personalize planets,
that's daft)
