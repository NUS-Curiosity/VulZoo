What has Al-Qaeda got to do with The Mossad planting fake car bombs in Tel Aviv?

According to Reuters it was nothing to do with Al-Qaeda and was a test-run to target Arab guerrilla leaders.

"The Mossad chose Tel Aviv port for a “model run” — Israeli spooks’ term for a rehearsed operation in a safe area that closely resembles the real target’s environment."

"So: What foreign ports look most like Tel Aviv’s, and which Arab guerrilla leaders frequent them?"
