	internal disk paths

Hi Juha-Matti,

Thanks for contributing to this thread. I did play a lot with the pdf
queries and the simple query you mentioned gives many false positives (on
google's first page, it gives 3 false positives and on bing's search, it
completely fails). So, I would still advise to use "filetype:pdf file c (htm
OR html OR mhtml)" (without quotes) which works well for both google and
bing.

Your suggestion to expand the query for further reconnaissance sounds very
interesting. Like "winnt" dir is good to identify w2k/nt4 systems, "users"
dir for vista/win7 and "documents and settings" for winxp, etc. E.g. query
"filetype:pdf file c documents and settings (htm OR html OR mhtml)" without
quotes.

Cheers,
Inferno

The local path is being disclosed with a simple query too without putting
.HTM/.MHT to the string:
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=filetype%3Apdf+file+c

Another issue is the disclosure of user names - you can simply find the
author's full name John Smith from the pdf document and see that his user
name is josmith
(C:\Documents and Settings\josmith\Desktop\Misc)

By simply checking some documents from the same domain you'll see that this
company's user names are in this format:
John Smith - josmith
Kate Allison - kaallis
James L. Parker - jalpark
(not real-life examples)

And a query filetype:pdf file c winnt tells that a company is using W2K or
NT4.
