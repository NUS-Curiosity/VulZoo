Subject: need advice on adtmt cookie

Since using the virtual software McAfee web and email scanner I have
noticed a lot of blocks of the adtmt cookie (seen as an unwanted
program) but see alot of these blocks on FaceBook. I have googled but
only seem to find "bad", "how to get rid of adtmt.exe" ect. Could
someone shed light on the security risk of this? If I am blocking it
because I am surfing through the McAfee web scanner what is happening
or what are folks open to who see this or click it?
