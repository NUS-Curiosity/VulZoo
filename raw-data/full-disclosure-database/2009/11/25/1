I don't think bash is a good choice for writing this kind of exploits.
My Python script is using threads to make the attack more effective.

BTW, this is not the only proof of concept published until now.
There are at least 2 more exploits published for this vulnerability.
Even my python script got leaked somehow on packetstorm.
It was bound to happen sooner or later.
