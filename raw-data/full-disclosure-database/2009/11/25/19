If you don't understand the code well enough to realize what it's doing,
then you deserve getting whacked for running some random shit you found
on an anonymous mailing list.

PS: "I send this file to have your advice", Loveletter.txt.vbs, etc. Oh
.. and I hear 4chan has a bunch of cool pictures you can rename from
.jpg to .js and get free porn for life.

(the only time I remember this actually being funny was when somebody
did one that mailed the contents of /etc/passwd .. and somebody else
took the time to make a passwd file that when run through jtr said
something like "you're so lame for decoding this")
