Subject: Some shit going on in seclist

I guess this is an email list. This guy -* Day Jay, has put up this
vulnerability up on seclist, stating that it relates to microsoft iis 6.0,
when it actually deletes the user's home folder. This is total shit, and if
you (Day Jay), think that this is ultral33t, know that you suck, and you're
pretty good at that.
