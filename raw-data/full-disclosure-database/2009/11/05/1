Its evil. Making people believe that someone is dead, publicly, and placing obituaries online shows no regard for the thoughts & feelings of the person being trolled or the others who may read them. 

In a community where whispers and hear-say can even get SANS to look for an OpenSSH 0day "doing-the-rounds", spreading 'misinformation' about a well-liked individual who worked on a project for the community is unpleasant - making out they are dead is just horrible.

There are people at the end of the computers. Don't ever forget it.
