This snooping on US citizens via illegal wire taps could be tested. Appear to plan a terrorist outrage, engage in telephone conversations
regarding the planting of bombs in shopping malls or the detonation of a fuel tanker at a large sports event. Then sit back an wait for the FBI,
CIA or other law enforcement agency to kick in your door. Of course it could be that monitoring systems currently in place are
searching/listening for certain keywords and once flagged a warrant is then applied for. But whatever the case, if an armed response team kick
down your door at 4:00am, you can be sure your telephone conversations were monitored.

I am personally of the opinion that the law only applies to those that are caught if they are a criminal, and cannot be covered up if they are a
law enforcement officer.
