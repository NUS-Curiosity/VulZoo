OK, so in your opinion we should sit back and accept the legal theory that "I'm
the President, and as Commander in Chief I can give orders contrary to the
usual 4th Amendment restrictions" (note carefully that there was *NOT* an
actual formal declaration of war made - Congress merely authorized the use of
force. Many constitutional law experts seem to think this makes a difference).

So it is OK if as President, he decides to suspend habeus corpus?

If it's *not* OK, how do you intend to complain once your corpus can't
be habeased any more?

"The price of freedom is eternal vigilance" -- Thomas Jefferson.

In other words, the time to raise a fuss is *before* they go down the
slippery slope, not once they're 3/4 of the way down and in an uncontrolled
slide.

"When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a
cross." -- Sinclair Lewis, 1935

And that's why we raise a fuss.  You may wish to read Naomi Wolf's "Fascist
America in 10 easy steps":

And that's why we raise a fuss.
