Subject: Re: WordPress <= 2.8.5 Unrestricted File Upload
	Arbitrary PHP Code Execution

The same thing was discussed on WP-Hackers list[1] and it was found
that the problem was introduced by Option +Multiviews[2]...
And also someone point that Option +Multiviews is enabled by default
on cpanel/whm[3] based servers therefore lots of cheap (and not so
cheap) shared hosting providers introduce this behavior that could
potentially be harmful not just to wordpress but any software that
handles uploads and respect the uploaded file extensions.
