Sudo has always defaulted to running commands as root.

It's very possible that I am not doing a good job of explaining my
interpretation.  As I see it, the invention is about providing the
user with a list of privileged users with the appropriate rights
to perform the action in a GUI when the user tries to perform an
action that they don't have sufficient rights to do.  If you read
the patent in question, in all its TIFF glory (what do they have
against text?) they list a number of possible scenarios.

Sudo doesn't contain any logic to try and figure out what user a
command should be run as in order for it to succeed (and no, root
isn't always the right answer, especially when NFS is in the picture).
