Umm... my check of my 'sudo' manpage says that the '-u username' is
optional, and I don't remember having to use '-u root', so it's supported
doing it without having to type the target username for years...

Unless I'm misunderstanding your interpretation of the invention and how
it compares to traditional sudo usage?
