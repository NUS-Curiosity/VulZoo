Unfortunately, that's exactly what *did* happen.  Although for *home*
users, the 'ISP' is the person to complain to, for organizations that run
their own networks (like many businesses and schools, etc) the proper place
to complain is the network management of that organization.   He contacted
the admins of the school's network, and said "One of your users is being
a bozo".  The admin found the user and it resulted in the user resigning.

(Remember - in this case, contacting the school's network provider would
*not* have found the user, because the network provider just provides
a connection and bandwidth.  Any login records/etc are at the *school*,
not the provider).
