Vladis .. not sure about that school since it was K12, but in both your 
case and mine .. we *are* the ISP (insofar as we have our own ASN and 
valid info on whois).

If K12 is done there like I've seen in a lot of other places, they 
probably have a consortium that provides connectivity and each 
institution has a CIDR block within the consortium's AS .. and I'm sure 
the school had some web-nazi appliance that made it a few-clicks of a 
mouse to figure out "whodunit".

Also .. as to the legal matters .. the instructor in question would have 
been in a much better position if he'd been fired rather than resigning. 
Granted, he probably quit because he knew he *would* be fired .. but 
it's hard to argue "unlawful termination" when you quit on your own 
(IANAL, etc.).
