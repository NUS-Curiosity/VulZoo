Subject: Remote DoS condition in harbour.pl

Versions of harbour.pl (up to and including build 1941) are vulnerable to a
remote Denial of Service attack.

Spamming "zeroes" (null packets) to port 1207 results in a large portion of
system resources being tied up.

Please update to build 1945 as soon as possible.
