Someone has apparently written one in bash:

If testing for IT security issues wasn't practically illegalized in
Germany I might even have done it myself.

This script wasn't so effective when I tested it here, but it did work
after I spawned a couple processes. It takes it quite a while to prepare
the requests, though, and without the randomization stuff and with
>=python this could probably be done much faster.
