Subject: New Paper: MitM Attacks against the chipTAN
	comfort Online Banking	System

Abstract
========
ChipTAN comfort is a new system which is supposed to securely authorise online
banking transactions by means of a trusted device. It is assumed that chipTAN
comfort specifically protects against man-in-the-middle attacks. Such attacks are
currently putting bank customers who are using the iTAN system at risk. RedTeam
Pentesting examined chipTAN comfort and showed that even when using this sys-
tem, man-in-the-middle attacks can compromise online banking security.
