Subject: UK jails schizophrenic for refusal to decrypt
	files

The first person jailed under draconian UK police powers that
Ministers said were vital to battle terrorism and serious crime has
been identified by The Register as a schizophrenic science hobbyist
with no previous criminal record.

His crime was a persistent refusal to give counter-terrorism police
the keys to decrypt his computer files.
