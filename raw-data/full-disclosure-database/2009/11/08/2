Sure.  I agree with that.  I think it's also important that law 
enforcement activities have much more stringent requirements than military 
intelligence has.  The former is directed toward citizens, the latter 
toward enemies the military has to deal with.

Of course.  I've never said they didn't.  In fact I've stated that people 
in government have the same range of motives that people not in government 
have, including the seven deadly sins, if you will.  But I've also pointed 
out that they are not totally evil either, as some seem to think.  There 
are also good people in government just as there are in every other walk 
of life.

Therein lies the rub.  Whose property are the bits on the wire?  Once 
you've clicked on send, be it email or im or twitter or whatever, does 
that transmission still belong to you?  I would submit that it does not, 
and that the privacy laws that protect you and your house and belongings 
can no longer be sensibly applied.

Even you send a "private" email, to whom does it belong while it's in the 
process of transmission?

Really?  To whom does your response to me belong?  What about the email 
you send to a friend?  A stranger?  And twitter posts?  Blog comments? 
Etc., etc.  Does it really make sense to extend your privacy rights to 
those things that you have sent into the public domain?  And how do you 
draw the line legally at what the government can look at without a warrant 
and what they must get a warrant for when they can't even know what's on 
the network without first connecting to it to look?  Should we forbid them 
to ever connect simply because something they could potentially see is 
"private"?  And is it really private?

And if they already have a warrant to monitor all communications of a 
known terrorist, what happens when those communications include a US 
person?  All they allowed to monitor since they already have a warrant, 
even though they don't have one for the US person?

I completely agree.  I also think the definitions need to be much clearer, 
so that intelligence people understand exactly where the fences are.  And 
I don't think a warrant should be required unless a US person is the 
*target* of the monitoring.

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
