Hello participants of Full-Disclosure!

After the article Dark side of bookmarks (http://websecurity.com.ua/3643/),
Iâ€™ll draw you attention to another aspect of security which concerned with
web browsers. This time about attacks via homepage function. In article Dark
home (http://websecurity.com.ua/3660/) I'll tell you about risks of homepage
function in browsers.

There are possible next attacks via homepage function:

1. Spam.
2. Phishing.
3. Malware spreading.
4. DoS attacks.
