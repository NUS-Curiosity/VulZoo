Subject: DoS vulnerability in Internet Explorer

Hello participants of Full-Disclosure!

I want to warn you about Denial of Service vulnerability in Internet
Explorer. Yesterday I already informed Microsoft.

This attack I called DoS via homepage.

DoS:

http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2009/IE%20DoS%20Exploit10.html

With this exploit in IE6 the browser blocks, so it's become impossible to
use it and it's only possible to close it (via Task Manager).

With this exploit in IE7 the browser freezes after click on the link .

Vulnerable versions are Internet Explorer 6 (6.0.2900.2180), Internet 
Explorer 7 (7.0.6000.16711) and previous versions (and possible next 
versions too).

I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3658/).

Best wishes & regards,
MustLive
