Cisco Security Advisory: Transport Layer Security Renegotiation
Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20091109-tls

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20091109-tls.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2009 November 9 1600 UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

An industry-wide vulnerability exists in the Transport Layer Security
(TLS) protocol that could impact any Cisco product that uses any version
of TLS and SSL. The vulnerability exists in how the protocol handles
session renegotiation and exposes users to a potential man-in-the-middle
attack.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20091109-tls.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Cisco is currently evaluating products for possible exposure to these
TLS issues. Products will only be listed in the Vulnerable Products or
Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable sections of this advisory when a final
determination about product exposure is made. Products that are not
listed in either of these two sections are still being evaluated.

Vulnerable Products
- -------------------

This section will be updated when more information is available.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
- ---------------------------------

The following products are confirmed not vulnerable:

  * Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client

This section will be updated when more information is available.

Details
=======

TLS and its predecessor, SSL, are cryptographic protocols that provide
security for communications over IP data networks such as the Internet.
An industry-wide vulnerability exists in the TLS protocol that could
impact any Cisco product that uses any version of TLS and SSL. The
vulnerability exists in how the protocol handles session renegotiation
and exposes users to a potential man-in-the-middle attack.

The following Cisco Bug IDs are being used to track potential exposure
to the SSL and TLS issues. The bugs listed below do not confirm
that a product is vulnerable, but rather that the product is under
investigation by the appropriate product teams.

Registered Cisco customers can view these bugs via Cisco's Bug Toolkit:

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be
bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for software
upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
- --------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's worldwide
website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
- -------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through prior
or existing agreements with third-party support organizations, such
as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should
contact that support organization for guidance and assistance with the
appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or fix
is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it is
deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
- -----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service
contract, and customers who purchase through third-party vendors but are
unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale
should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance
Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to a
free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested
through the TAC.
