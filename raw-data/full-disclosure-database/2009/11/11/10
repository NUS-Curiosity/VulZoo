       Title:  HP ProCurve Web Management Interface Multiple XSS
Release Date:  2009-11-11
 Application:  HP ProCurve Switch Management Interface

Description:
------------

HP ProCurve Networking Switches use a web based Management Interface to
control and configure the devices. Under the 'Security' -> 'SSL' portion
of the application, an attacker can inject HTML or JavaScript into the
'Organization Name' and 'Organization Unit' fields. The information supplied
by the attacker is stored by the switch and rendered in the browser of
subsequent visitors. Additionally, an attacker can inject script into
various fields related to the SSL certificate. Not only does this create
a cross-site scripting scenario, an administrator cannot change the
fields back using the 'Use Installed Cert' interface, rather she must
create a new certificate to remove the old entry.

Product Details:
----------------
