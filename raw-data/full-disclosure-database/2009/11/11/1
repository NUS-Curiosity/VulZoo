Subject: Spying on Americans: Obama Endorses Bush Era
	Warrantless Wiretapping

In a Court filing late Friday night, the Obama Administration
attempted to dress up in new clothes its embrace of one of the worst
Bush Administration positions--that courts cannot be allowed to review
the National Security Agency's massive, well-documented program of
warrantless surveillance. In doing so it demonstrated that it will not
willingly set limits on its own power and reinforced the need for
Congress to step in and reform the so-called 'state secrets'
privilege. (Kevin Bankston, "As Congress Considers State Secrets
Reform, Obama Admin Tries to Shut Down Yet Another Warrantless
Wiretapping Lawsuit," Electronic Frontier Foundation, November 2,
2009)
