That's good news.  Once updating issues are resolved and Xorg becomes as good 
as Mac and Windows graphics (it's almost there now - it just doesn't quite have 
the "pop" or "wow factor" of Macs), the obstacles to migration (for the 
consumer) will be availability and the knowledge that an alternative exists. 
At that point I think we'll see Microsoft's market share begin eroding badly.
