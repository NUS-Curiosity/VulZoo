It is entirely what the escalation behavior is. My objection to Vista is 
two-fold: Clicking OK instead of entering a password. As I have argued 
before, there really is a difference between clicking OK and entering a 
password. That brings me to my second objection. Vista puts up more 
escalations than Ubuntu, further exacerbating that difference. Your point 
about using a password to log into domains might be valid, but only in 
limited instances, as I would hope that the department that set up the domain 
would have its users not running as administrators.

We basically agree on the main point: Separate user and administrator accounts 
are better. I wonder if Microsoft will start enforcing that?
