To be fair, Linux has come a very long way in that regard. I purchased 
an Asus Eee 900 with Linux preinstalled, and everything worked right out 
of the box. Flash, Java, OpenOffice, the works. It was a vindication of 
my view that the real obstacle to Linux on the desktop isn't the user, 
but rather the OEM.

With low-cost, low-power netbooks becoming more prevalent, OEMs are 
finding that the cost of the Windows license begins to take up a rather 
high percentage of the overall cost.  Therefore, many are preinstalling 
and preconfiguring Linux. At the same time, consumers are finding that 
application incompatibilities don't really matter for them, since the 
Linux equivalents are able to handle data coming from a Windows box with 
a minimum of fuss.
