That's a big difference. Entering a password counts as more of a deterrence. 
Having seen my co-workers on their home machines, it's pretty clear that it's 
too easy to click OK without thinking. Entering a password, especially when 
the prompt doesn't occur as often as the UAC prompt is a more significant 
action. Personally, I prefer arrangements where the administrator uses a 
separate password. Not only do you need a password, but it's a different one. 
It's seldom used. The end user probably has to go look it up. I'm not a big 
fan of sudo.
