First off, I want to second what Rohit said below.  I have a 901 and it
came that way as well.  Granted I've hacked the shit out of it and now
it's running something else and very well at that, but by default they
are super easy machines to run.  And everything just works.

IMO - the Linux graphics are equivalent with Windows.  Mac though,
that's another thing.  Ubuntu did good to try to add a lot more "pretty"
into their desktop with the last release, to specifically compete with
Mac, but Mac still owns that beast.

Mac's really are something else to look at.  But I'd never own one.  ;p
 I like Apple as much as I like Microsoft.

Y'all have a great weekend.  :)
