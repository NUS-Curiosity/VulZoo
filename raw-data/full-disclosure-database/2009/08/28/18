Understood. I also understand you can set up Vista to use normal users. My 
objection is to Microsoft's default behavior.

There is a difference between being able to do something, and enforcing it. 
The OS on my machines will not allow a person to run an administrative 
desktop. It enforces the separation between the administrator and a normal 
user by requiring the creation of at least one normal user at install. Only 
that normal user can log in. Microsoft encourages the opposite behavior by 
default. I know of no Vista home user who runs as a normal user.

I guess it's good we had this conversation; I got to meet someone who sets up 
Windows properly on his personal machines. ;)
