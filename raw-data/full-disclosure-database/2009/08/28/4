Nice to see intelligent dialog on Full-Disclosure, eh?  ;)   

Yes, but the point is that it is the *same* username and password set up initially.  The true 'administrator' user on Vista is disabled by default, and though the user you set up initially is a member of the administrators group, it also requires that each action (needing admin privileges) must escalate in the same way; the method used is configurable by the user, but set to a confirmation dialog box rather than a password.  

At this point in the game, it's all fundamentally the same, with each OS having its own nuances.  It's when I see people responding to the "Mac commercial" type hyperbole of having to use UAC for every function, and how all they have to do is click "OK" (thus showing that they are running as admin which they shouldn't do, but certainly can) when I have to respond.
