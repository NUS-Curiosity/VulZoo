Granted, the default behavior on Mac/nix requires the admin password and not just a confirmation, but at the end of the day, it's all the same.  I actually like being able to change the behavior to suit my environment, which I can do with Visa/Win7.  

In regards to Ubuntu, that isn't necessarily correct.

Yes, the first user is setup and given access as a sudoer, but that is
all.  When you log in, you are logging in with user priveleges and have
to escalate each time, for each independant act that requires system
modification.
