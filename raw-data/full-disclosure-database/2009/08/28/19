This now makes more sense after further reading the following from you:

Oh, now that's cool.  I didn't know that.  The "force to create a normal user and only use that" was not something I was aware of.  

What's the OS?  So, even if you wanted to, you couldn't log on as administrator and just do whatever you needed to?  I'm not sure if I like that, but I assume this is customizable behavior, yes?
