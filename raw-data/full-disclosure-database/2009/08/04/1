Subject: PHP Fuzzer Framework Insecure File
	Creation/Execution Vulnerability

PHP Fuzzer Framework Insecure File Creation/Execution Vulnerability
I. BACKGROUND

PFF is a popular fuzzing suite developed by a team of highly 
skilled developers
at a classified government funded information security research 
center.
http://www.setec.org/~calcite/code/pff/ 

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an insecure file creation method allows an 
attacker to 
execute arbritrary code with the privileges of the user running the 
affected 
application.

III. ANALYSIS

PFF uses a default location for output files before execution by 
the php intepreter.
This location can be owned by another user. An attacker can then 
use the time between 
creation of the output file and execution of the file by the php 
binary to replace
the file with a one containing the attacker's payload.

IV. DETECTION

All versions are affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Use a location not writable by another user for storage of PFF 
output files.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Vendor was uninterested in fixing the issue.
