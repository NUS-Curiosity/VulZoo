Probably because PFF is usually run from a laptop or single-user workstation,
and you need a shell on the system already for this exploit to work. So it's
really not a big deal unless you're an insider who shouldn't have been trusted
with an account on the machine in question, or you've also got *another*
way to get access to the box.

Bonus points for using inotify.. but...
