Synopsis
========

Dynamic Update packets can cause a Denial of Service in the BIND
daemon.

Background
==========

ISC BIND is the Internet Systems Consortium implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/bind     < 9.4.3_p3                           >= 9.4.3_p3

Description
===========

Matthias Urlichs reported that the dns_db_findrdataset() function fails
when the prerequisite section of the dynamic update message contains a
record of type "ANY" and where at least one RRset for this FQDN exists
on the server.

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted
dynamic update message to the BIND daemon (named), leading to a Denial
of Service (daemon crash). This vulnerability affects all primary
(master) servers -- it is not limited to those that are configured to
allow dynamic updates.

Workaround
==========

Configure a firewall that performs Deep Packet Inspection to prevent
nsupdate messages from reaching named. Alternatively, expose only
secondary (slave) servers to untrusted networks.

Resolution
==========

All BIND users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.4.3_p3"
