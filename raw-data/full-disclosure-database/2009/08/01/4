Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in OpenSC.

Background
==========

OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart cards.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/opensc      < 0.11.8                           >= 0.11.8

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in OpenSC:

* b.badrignans discovered that OpenSC incorrectly initialises private
  data objects (CVE-2009-0368).

* Miquel Comas Marti discovered that src/tools/pkcs11-tool.c in
  pkcs11-tool in OpenSC 0.11.7, when used with unspecified third-party
  PKCS#11 modules, generates RSA keys with incorrect public exponents
  (CVE-2009-1603).

Impact
======

The first vulnerabilty allows physically proximate attackers to bypass
intended PIN requirements and read private data objects. The second
vulnerability allows attackers to read the cleartext form of messages
that were intended to be encrypted.

NOTE: Smart cards which were initialised using an affected version of
OpenSC need to be modified or re-initialised. See the vendor's advisory
for details.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenSC users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/opensc-0.11.8"
