No, problem. It is only necessary to include stdlib.h because malloc
is implicitily defined (gcc complaint). Anyway,  your POC work as
aspected. Thanks. In this days it is difficult to see a true exploit
in a mailing list. The fact that bug was discovered from someone else
is not important : you have rewritten in another language, so it is
only your work.
