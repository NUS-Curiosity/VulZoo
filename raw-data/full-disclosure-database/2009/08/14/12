It looks incomplete, I don't see PF_ISDN or PF_IUCV, for example.

But this general approach looks fine, and is actually what Red Hat have
reccommended to their customers.

Obviously if you don't use redhat, you should check what else your
distribution provides.

If you know you don't need PF_INET6, then it should be fine. You would most
likely know if you needed the others.

Thanks, Tavis.
