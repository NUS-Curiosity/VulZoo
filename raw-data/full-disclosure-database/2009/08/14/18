Poor Linus can't catch a break.  Just like 3 weeks ago some guy named
Brad Spengler was ripping him a new one:

  "(Really there should have been a CVE for the lack of 
  -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks instead of pretending the only problem 
  was /dev/net/tun.  As the commit to add it showed (and at least 10 other 
  commits to the kernel this weekend) lots of other code was affected, so 
  someone not applying a fix for a CVE mentioning only /dev/net/tun 
  because they don't have the code for /dev/net/tun compiled in, is going 
  to be missing out on a number of fixes)."

Of course, getting a CVE for that issue would have forced disclosure of the bug
too, quite possibly before the vendors were ready to ship updated kernels.
In general, you *can't* have both "flag fixes as security issues right up
front before vendors have a chance to backport" and "don't screw over the
vendors and users".

So how do you suggest that Linus could have handled this in a manner that
didn't screw over vendors and users?

Out of curiosity, did *you* did your due diligence and didn't release that
exploit until you had verified that all the vendors had updated kernels ready
to ship? :)
