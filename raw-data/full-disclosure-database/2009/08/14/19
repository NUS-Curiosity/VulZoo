Subject: Re: BART

Hello auto793094@...hmail.com,

As I've previously mentioned, I did not write the first (very boring,
uninteresting, technically incorrect) email.

It is certainly the case that BART uses stored value cards. BART admits
this if you ask them. However, basically everything else in that email
is nonsense in the context of BART.

Best regards,
Jacob
