Can you elaborate on, "to a whitelisted (localdatabase) site"?

None of the rules defined in the Web Authentication Layer or Web
Access Layer have a "whitelist" attribute. In the list of available
actions for the Web Authentication Layer there's: "Do Not
Authenticate", "ForceAuthenticate1" and "Deny." In the Web Access
Layer list of available actions there are a couple dozen options, none
of which are labeled "whitelist" or "whitelisted."

Also, I'm not sure what you mean by "localdatabase". Internal http
traffic shouldn't hit the proxies...

Using an 8100-C with SG05 5.2.4.3.
