Hi Everyone, 

We received a lot of emails from different people asking us what 
happened to our blog at http://secreview.blogspot.com. What 
happened is we decided to shut down operations because we don't 
have time to keep doing reviews. We also don't have time to redo 
reviews which is needed to keep the reviews fair. We all have full 
time jobs and recently have been traveling a lot.

We started secreview because we wanted to expose security companies 
for what they really were. But now because we can't do it any more 
we don't think its fair that only some companies get reviewed and 
others don't. So we deleted the blog (but we have 90 days to bring 
it back if people want it).

If we do bring it back, we will probably not do any more reviews 
and we will leave it up just because. Do people want the blog to be 
recovered or do they want us to keep it dead?
