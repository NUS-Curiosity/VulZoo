I'm saying that the world's malware authors, in their race to stay 
ahead of AV, are engaging in an uncoordinated, slow-motion DDOS of 
the world's AV systems.  They are flooding the blacklists, and this 
flooding is accelerating.  If it continues, the world's AV systems 
will be useless, as will be the machines they are protecting.

Note, I have NOT gone off and compiled some stats, I've just noted an 
existing trend, and extrapolated it.  Here's an article from 2005, 
again, the numbers suggest an exponential curve. 
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/05/mcafee_avert_report/

The biological metaphor does suggest that Microsoft would take some 
kind of evasive action, and I think their only option is to license 
unix, just as Apple did (although Apple did it for different 
reasons).  Doing this will solve many problems, they can keep their 
proprietary interface and their reputation, and possibly even their 
licensing and marketing models, while under the hood, unix saves the 
day.  They will need to eat some very humble pie, a few diehards 
might jump from Redmond's towers, and the clash of cultures will 
toast some excellent marshmellows... but they will save their 
business.  Do they have a choice?  Malware numbers are suggesting 
they don't.

Licensing the solution suits Microsoft's business model (much easier 
for them to buy in a fix than build one, they tried that already), 
they did in fact do it many times previously, starting with a certain 
product called MS-DOS, and it means they can keep their customer 
base, they just sell them an upgrade which is in fact a completely 
new system - again, just as Apple did with OSX.

Actually, I think the simplest thing for them to do would be to buy 
Apple, then they can rebadge OSX, instead of reinventing it.
