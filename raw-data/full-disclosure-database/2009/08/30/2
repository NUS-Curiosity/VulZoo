Subject: Re: windows future

I'm not saying malware will frighten users away, I am saying that 
malware will leave them no choice but to leave.  This is not a 
decision users make, they will not be able to buy a Windows computer, 
as they will no longer work.  Sure you can turn them on, but that's 
all.  Once you load up your AV, you'll have no RAM left to load 
Notepad.  Your CPU will be constantly processing AV updates and your 
disk will fill with AV sigs.  The machine will be unusable.

Also, there are software-imposed limits to malware filtering, as well 
as the hardware limits I mentioned earlier, I can only think of one 
right now, and that is 32-bit integer math, I'm pretty sure once the 
number of mutations gets a bit past 2 billion, there will be problems 
with this, possibly mitigated, at a significant cost to performance, 
by using double integers, or by using 64-bit integers and dropping 
support for 32-bit machines (again, long term these approaches will 
also be exhausted).

Whitelisting ... my guess is that there will be trillions of 
legitimate pieces of code, and this list will also grow too large for 
the average computer to handle.

However, as noted in my other mail to Rohit, I think that before 
these limits are reached, Microsoft will bite the bullet and drop in 
a unix core.

Social engineering: yes, point taken, although, someone is still 
cranking out binaries, as per the original link I posted: 
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/13/malware_arms_race/ ... and to 
be honest, it doesn't matter if it's only one guy who pumps out 
trillions of mutations, it's still gonna DOS the AV.

I'm not commenting on Windows vs unix vs Mac, I didn't mean to start 
that thread, I'm just commenting on Windows, and how it appears to be 
holding a one-way ticket to oblivion.  Is that an iceberg, dead 
ahead?  The numbers are telling us that it is.

PS. Have you seen PC-BSD? :) http://www.pcbsd.org/ ... it's FreeBSD + 
KDE + sexy installer ...
