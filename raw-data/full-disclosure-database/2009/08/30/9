There is no censorship on Full-disclosure. Oh, we banned n3td3v didn't we? Wooooops.

Hi Neohapsis,

The mail to Full-disclosure on Mar 20, 2009 has been edited on the 
archives of Neohapsis:

http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2009-03/0326.html

Every occurrence of "Inquira" has been redacted. Since the original 
disclosure suggests the vendor was contacted, and chose not to reply, it 
is curious that their name would be removed from your archive.

Could you explain why, or at the very least share what I suspect was a C&D 
style letter demanding their name be removed?

I ask because other archives do not redact their name for whatever reason:

Subject: [Full-disclosure] Inquira: Multiple Vulnerabilities

Bonjour,

During a recent penetration test, we discovered and worked with
Inquira to close numerous web-based issues.  The vendor has not
replied back about a formal release of these issues, so I am posting
this notice here to inform customers to check for an update for their
products.  You can contact Inquira via the link below.

http://www.inquira.com/

Additionally, it is also advised that customers change the default
passwords used by the affected software.  For instance, the default
Apache Tomcat administrator account details are listed below and
should probably be added to publicly listed default password databases
(phenoelit, etc).

Vendor: Inquira
Products: (multiple)
Username: inquira
Password: inquira123

Cheers,
