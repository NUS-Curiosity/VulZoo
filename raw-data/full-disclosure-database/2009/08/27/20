It is somewhat Vista's (or Windows') fault if the default user is also the 
administrator by default. Yes, knowledgeable people will know to set up a 
separate user account, but in a home environment such people are few and far 
between.

In my own "business" situation, I am the computer goto guy. Our equipment 
isn't capable of Vista. When I arrived it ran XP Home. It took about a year, 
but we migrated to something more open source, and to an OS that insists on 
regular user accounts by default.
