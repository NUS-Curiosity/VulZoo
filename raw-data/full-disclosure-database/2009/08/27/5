NOTICE: If you have any rejection to this. You're have every right
to confess.

Over 500 Trillion micro-zenny of damage has been caused by n3td3v

United Kingdom, MI7 Headquarters - The security intelligence
community has been rocked by information late last Tuesday that
n3td3v has changed his named to InfoSecAlertNet. This is the
premier place on the internet to get the latest in intelligence.

Our latest recon and undercover plants find these are the new URL's
for the underground movement:
 - http://twitter.com/InfoSecAlertNet
 - http://groups.google.com/group/InfoSecAlertNet/topics
 
This comes after false accusations are made of n3td3v on the
information super highway. We are all shocked by this chain of
events.

I'm sure that the n3td3v/InfoSecAlertNet movement will rekindle the
need for security for a betterment of all humanity.

In other news: the Federal Bureau of Investigation is hot on the
tail of Andrew Weevlos. Weev is a person who apparently was
appointed a Seer or Prophet by God. He is in the process if leading
a flock of netizens to overthrow what they perceive as the "ZOG"
(Zionist occupied government).

He reports he was burglarized allegedly by the FBI. He has not been
charged with a crime beside $3000.00 traffic ticket in California
(Future home of Governor Meg Whitman!)
