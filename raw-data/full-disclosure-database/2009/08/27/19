I definitely agree, vis a vis the doctor analogy. I haven't run 
anti-virus software for quite a while now, because viruses spread so 
quickly even daily definitions updates aren't enough to stop them.  A 
properly locked down firewall, along with good browsing, installation, 
and patching habits are what I rely on to stop infections.

To go with a third biological analogy - antivirus is like an antibiotic. 
It stops the infection once the bacteria has already taken root in your 
system. Well, these days, most of malware is resistant to antivirus 
software. So, we have to rely on good computer hygiene to keep us safe.
