But that's the same on my Mac and Ubuntu distro too.  The first user is the admin.  Granted, the default behavior on Mac/nix requires the admin password and not just a confirmation, but at the end of the day, it's all the same.  I actually like being able to change the behavior to suit my environment, which I can do with Visa/Win7.  

So the point is really moot, and it all comes down to the same thing I've been saying for what seems like (because it is) years now.  Stop blaming the OS (whichever one you pick) and take responsibility for your installs.  You've said it yourself... you are basically saying that the people you work with are too stupid to read a prompt, or to create and use a normal user account.  This will change if they install Mac OSX or Ubuntu?

What are you running that creates a "regular" user first by defaut?  And I'm confused.  You say most of the people you work with would unquestionably click the UAC (presumably "OK") but now you say you aren't even running Vista where you work.  These people can install and use your open source solution and create normal users but can't do the same on Vista?  Or are you just assuming that they can't even though they don't use it?  What's your point exactly?
