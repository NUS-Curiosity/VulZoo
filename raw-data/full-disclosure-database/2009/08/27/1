Subject: Intelligence Report: n3td3v went into cybercrime
	underground

*All people mentioned here are innocent until proven otherwise.*

Andrew Wallance / antisec / ureleet better known as n3td3v has been
a hallmark of some of the largest blackhat intrusions known to man.

Billions of dollars in damage to critical network infrastructure
was rung up solely by his hands.

It appears n3td3v has went underground:

Where am I supposed to get my latest in intelligence?

n3td3v needs to get a new lawyer, because now everyone in security 
thinks in n3td3v has gone underground to unthinkable cybercrime.

OK So let it be known if n3td3v doesn't come back we're going to 
have no choice to label him as a terrorist and enemy of government.

This lie has been fabricated and sponsored by JTTF (A coalition 
between FBI, local police and private security individuals with 
former military intelligence experience). If you have a complaint 
please give us your full name so we can investigate you. Removing 
yourself from the terrorist database is easy as clearing your 
credit report, for instance.
