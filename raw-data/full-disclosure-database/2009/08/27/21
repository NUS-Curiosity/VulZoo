While running as a user (as opposed to root) does help, it doesn't 
obviate the need for education and good computer hygiene. After all, all 
of the information and most of the programs your users are running 
manage to go just fine without root access. Unless you've really 
strictly locked down the workstations, its still quite possible for 
malware to gain access to data or computing resources (e.g. CPU time, 
network bandwidth) without completely "owning" the computer.

The one big advantage of non-privileged accounts is that they're easier 
to clean up if they do get infected with malware. After all, its a lot 
easier to backup and wipe a single account than it is to wipe and 
restore an entire system. However, I'm not sure how much of an advantage 
that is to someone whose goal is to *prevent* infection, rather than 
mitigate them after they occur.
