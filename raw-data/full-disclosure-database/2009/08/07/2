Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash Player allow
for attacks including the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Adobe Flash Player is a closed-source playback software for Flash SWF
files. Adobe Reader is a closed-source PDF reader that plays Flash
content as well.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /   Vulnerable   /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-plugins/adobe-flash     < 10.0.32.18            >= 10.0.32.18
  2  app-text/acroread              < 9.1.3                   >= 9.1.3
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Adobe Flash Player:

* lakehu of Tencent Security Center reported an unspecified memory
  corruption vulnerability (CVE-2009-1862).

* Mike Wroe reported an unspecified vulnerability, related to
  "privilege escalation" (CVE-2009-1863).

* An anonymous researcher through iDefense reported an unspecified
  heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-1864).

* Chen Chen of Venustech reported an unspecified "null pointer
  vulnerability" (CVE-2009-1865).

* Chen Chen of Venustech reported an unspecified stack-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2009-1866).

* Joran Benker reported that Adobe Flash Player facilitates
  "clickjacking" attacks (CVE-2009-1867).

* Jun Mao of iDefense reported a heap-based buffer overflow, related
  to URL parsing (CVE-2009-1868).

* Roee Hay of IBM Rational Application Security reported an
  unspecified integer overflow (CVE-2009-1869).

* Gareth Heyes and Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported that the
  sandbox in Adobe Flash Player allows for information disclosure, when
  "SWFs are saved to the hard drive" (CVE-2009-1870).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF
file or web site containing Adobe Flash (SWF) contents, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application, or a Denial of Service (application
crash). Furthermore, a remote attacker could trick a user into clicking
a button on a dialog by supplying a specially crafted SWF file and
disclose sensitive information by exploiting a sandbox issue.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=www-plugins/adobe-flash-10.0.32.18"

All Adobe Reader users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/acroread-9.1.3"
