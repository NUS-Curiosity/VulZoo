Injection Vulnerabilities
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-09-059

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2009-1978

-- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

-- Affected Products:
Oracle Secure Backup

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary commands
on vulnerable installations of Oracle Secure Backup. User interaction is
not required to exploit this vulnerability but an attacker must be
authenticated.

The specific flaw exists in the handling of various variables to the
script property_box.php used in the administration server running on
port 443. Due to improper filtering of user data a specially crafted
request could lead to arbitrary commands being executed under the
credentials of the SYSTEM account.

-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
