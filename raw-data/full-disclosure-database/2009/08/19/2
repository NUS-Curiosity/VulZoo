 researcher n3td3v

n3td3v is neither black-, white-, purple- or anything -hat, just a troll.
i follow this list since 4 years and everything i read about n3td3v was 
just a bunch of crap.

just like the kids in school that have no friends and keep bugging 
others for their lost live.

so stop trolling with your fake-account, its worthless, senseless and 
useless AND OFF-TOPIC.
