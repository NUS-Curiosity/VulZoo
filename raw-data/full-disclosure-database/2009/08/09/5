Hi,

I know my request has 99.999% risks not to be accepted but i want
to chat with some members of antisec (silc seems a good way ?  /0\)
My aim is only to chat, have fun, i'm an individual and not
affiliated with any movement, company, service (hard to beleive,
but if i was would i say that ? yes probably/ so it's stupid.. :D)
Anyway i'd have real pleasure to laugh and chat with peoples
interested in security, and this movement i think is really smart
(honestly).
I'm desapointed beacause i'm interested in security and never
thought about the consequences of fd, and the born of antisec.

Please contact me by mail indicating the way to chat with you (irc
chan/silc) if possible.

Keep on going like that !


Thanks in advance to answer, probably to tell no, but hopefully to
say well, comeon'in
If you're not able to invite me to chat, feel free to give me the
path for a young padawan (url/links/chat) to have real good info
(especially on Summer of Hax or good security teams).



Sincerely yours
Milton

(you probably receive same mail from hotmail, i'll use this
one@...hmail better)

PS: Jessica Simpsons is hawt or Jessica Biel hawter or definitively
Jessica Alba ?
Feel free to answer :D
