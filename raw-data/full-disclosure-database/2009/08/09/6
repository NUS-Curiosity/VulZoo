Since, heck, we have so many lovely fans :))))))) We feel as if we 
(me) shud insult the white@...b movement (ching chang unholy mother 
fuckers) with another blatant remark about their anti-anti-
homosexual behaviours.

According to the provisions of the Law no. 105/1992 regarding the 
regulations of the international private law, a person’s civil 
status, capacity and family relationships are subject to the 
national law.

The national law is the law of the state whose citizen the 
individual is; it regulates the status of the Romanian citizens, 
irrespective of whether their residence place is within the county 
borders or abroad.

The civil status documents give proof of a person’s birth, marriage 
or death; they are registered in the best interests of both the 
state and the individual and envisage the protection of the 
fundamental rights and freedoms.

In Romania the Law 119/1996 and the application methodological 
norms regulate the civil status regime.
