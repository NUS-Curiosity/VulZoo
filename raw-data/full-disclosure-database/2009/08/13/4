                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                               IMF 2009

                      5th International Conference
           on IT Security Incident Management & IT Forensics

                      September 15th - 17th, 2009
                          Stuttgart, Germany

              Early Registration Closes on September 1st!

========================================================================

Information and communication technology is more and more becoming an
integral and in most cases even a vital part of life.  The worldwide
economy, public administration, health care, education and even personal
life depend on working IT.  Constriction of the availability of its
service, loss of confidentiality or alteration of data processed, or
loss of integrity of the IT infrastructure usually lead to serious or
disastrous consequences.  Hence security plays an increasingly important
role for operators and users of IT systems and infrastructures.

The establishment of static security measures like policies, standards,
and guidelines slowly but steadily is getting more common amongst IT
operators.  Nevertheless in the vast majority of cases operators do not
have the capability to detect and respond to security incidents or do a
forensic analysis of its traces that can be used in a lawsuit.
Jurisdiction in most countries is starting to change and applies
regulations on legal duty to maintain safety on operators of IT.  Hence
incident response and forensic capabilities become indispensable to
avoid successful assertion of claims for damages caused by compromised
or misused systems.

IMF's intent is to gather experts from throughout the world in order to
present and discuss recent technical and methodical advances in the
fields of IT security incident response and management and IT forensics.
The conference provides a platform for collaboration and exchange of
ideas between industry, academia, law-enforcement and other government
bodies.
