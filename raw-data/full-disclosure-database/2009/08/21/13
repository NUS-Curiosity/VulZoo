> How does you feel psychologically? Not as troll, but deep inside.
Pretty good. I've been laughing, I've been smiling, I've been drinking
and getting high. My primary partner and I tagteamed some girl last
night. I might be living in a crappy hotel, but you can't keep a good
troll down. I'm living the high life, because God loves me.

They'll hand you illegal materials at times in public, or plant them
in your car, just to psych you out. They'll threaten or harass every
business partner you have, until you're an alienated island with no
revenue. They'll break into your house while you're on vacation and
steal your documents and computers with no warrants and you'll never
have anyone to call for them. Not to use as evidence, but just to make
trouble for your life. They'll harass your family, your friends, your
old girlfriends. They'll try to intimidate you. Then, they'll offer
you a way out if you narc on your friends.

I think there are two recent lessons of what narcing and entrapment
gets you. Look at Soupnazi or Hal Turner.  They went and played the
FBI's full game, were promised immunity, milked for everything they
were worked, and then arrested anyways. They'll both be going to
prison. When the feds first roped in Soupnazi, they didn't even have
enough evidence to bring him into trial. But they used fear and
intimidation to get him to play their game, and he was hooked. It was
only a matter of time before he had cannibalized all his contacts, and
then he moved to roping in legit people like jimj.

The goodwill I've felt from people in the underground is fantastic.
I've had people offer to put me up, had people offer me loans and
gifts of cash. I could survive for years based off of the goodwill of
others. I don't need to, but I appreciate their sentiment at a time
when I'm hard up for cash.

The old adage of "nobody talks, everybody walks" is quite true but I
think YTCracker put it best in "Spammer Court" when he said "Fuck you
your honor, with all due respect, but i'm not ratting out my buddies
just to save my own neck". I'll never narc. I'll never tell. I am for
real. I am the truth of God.

> Does crime pay?
Wouldn't know. I'm not a criminal.

> If you could go back 5 years, would you have done anything
> different?
Nope. I knew living completely real and truthfully to everyone was
going to hurt me financially someday, and it did. But I wouldn't
change a thing. I'd rather be totally fucking real and miss out on
some material happiness instead of selling the fuck out and being a
gigantic fucking liar to keep up a revenue stream for material shit I
don't care about anyways.

> How much money do you really have?
Enough to get by. Not a lot. I've never built personally-owned assets,
and have always relied upon revenue. Little plots of earth and moving
toys are childish things that the beast can take away. The sweat of
your brow, the work of your mind and spirit? That can never be
diminished. Blood and tears awaits a man who sits on a pile of wealth
in the afterlife.

> How much longer do you think it will be until you're brought to
> prison?
No idea. I haven't committed nor been charged with a crime (save a
frivolous speeding ticket in some shithole state), nor have I
committed one. So I don't know. I live my life in the light of God,
and I have faith God will protect me during this time of trials.


> How long do you think you'll stay?
No idea. As I said, I haven't ever committed a crime. I am a truly sinless man.

> Do you think God will keep you company?
God is with me right now.
