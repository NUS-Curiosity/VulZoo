Subject: OWASP Announces International Application
	Security Conference for 2009

For Immediate Release

Washington DC August 20th, 2009 -- Following in the footsteps of the
Open Web Application Security Project's (OWASP, http://www.owasp.org )
immensely successful and popular conferences earlier this year in
Australia, Poland, Ireland, and Brazil, Washington DC will be hosting
the 2009 OWASP Application Security Conference (AppSec DC,
http://www.appsecdc.org ), North America's premiere web application
security conference, at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on
November 10-13th, 2009.

AppSec DC 2009 will provide a venue for hundreds of IT professionals
interested in securing web technologies to learn, interact, network,
and attend presentations and training given by some of the world's top
practitioners of web application security, suitable for everyone from
federal decision makers and management to application security
engineers and developers.  Executives from Fortune 500 firms along
with technical thought leaders such as security architects and lead
developers will be traveling to hear the cutting-edge ideas presented
by Information Security’s top talent. OWASP events attract a worldwide
audience interested in “what’s next” in the world of application
security. The conference is expected to draw 600-700 technologists
from Government, Financial Services, Media, Pharmaceuticals,
Healthcare, Technology, and many other verticals.

"AppSec DC is a unique opportunity for federal decision makers and key
technologists to become familiar with OWASP and the resources it has
to offer," said Doug Wilson, co-chair of the Washington DC OWASP
Chapter and organizer of AppSecDC. "The federal government has already
embraced the OWASP Top Ten and other OWASP guidelines. OWASP's mission
and community align closely with the goals set forth by the US Chief
Information Officer: transparency, engagement of staff, reduction of
cost, and innovation in technology. OWASP can enable the government to
attain these goals in the pursuit of securing critical technologies
that depend on the web."

Highlights for AppSec DC 2009 include a keynote from Joe Jarzombek,
Director for Software Assurance in the Department of Homeland
Security's (DHS) National Cyber Security Division (NCSD), a panel
discussion of US Federal Government Chief Information Security
Officers on their experiences with application security, a panel of
industry experts on implementing security in development cycles, and a
wide variety of talks by leading personalities in the field of web
application security, including Robert "RSnake" Hansen, Robert Auger,
Chris Wysopal, and others.

"For AppSec DC 2009, We're really trying to reach out to developers,
testers and quality assurance staff because they are pivotal to
solving the root causes of application security problems," said Mark
Bristow, an organizer of AppSec DC and a founding member of the OWASP
Global Conferences Committee. "To this end, we have a dedicated secure
development track designed specifically for these folks to give them
the skills they need to build secure software effectively."

AppSec DC 2009 will feature interactive, hands-on training courses led
by some of the leaders in application security (Security Compass,
Aspect Security, WhiteHat Security, Inguardians and others) on the
10th and 11th of November followed by four distinct speaking tracks on
the 12th and 13th.  Opportunities to interact with AppSec sponsors and
vendors will also be available, as well as an OWASP-sponsored Capture
the Flag competition and other events.
