Subject: Intercepting Southern California Gas Company user
	credentials... (socalgas.com)

...should be pretty easy ;-)  Company has been notified many times
privately of this issue, but they appear incompetent.  Time for public
shaming.

"""

NULL cipher SSL/TLS presents the illusion of security and customers
should be aware that their credentials are easily intercepted.  Wanna
shut off someone's gas in Los Angeles?  :-)
