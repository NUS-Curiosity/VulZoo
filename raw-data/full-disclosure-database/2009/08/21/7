Hey weev.

Now that the FBI and everything are all out to get you, I was wondering what life on the lamb was like.

How does you feel psychologically? Not as troll, but deep inside.

What are their tactics?

(I heard the feds bought a hooker to try to honeypot you.)

Does crime pay?

If you could go back 5 years, would you have done anything different?

How much money do you really have?

How much longer do you think it will be until you're brought to prison?

How long do you think you'll stay?

Do you think God will keep you company?



Simple enough
