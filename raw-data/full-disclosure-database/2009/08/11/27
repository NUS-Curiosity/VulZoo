Wow, it has been a long time since I actively followed the list. It is
actually somewhat refreshing that this witless banter continues on here to
help and break the monotony of it all...
I actually kinda miss it.

That said, my 2 cents:

Mr. "Someone Lawyer", if you want anyone to believe you are actually a
lawyer, you might try to act the part just a little.  A moderate command of
the English language would be a big plus. Thus far your messages sound less
like someone who has successfully gone through all the rigors of law school
and more like the general ramblings of hastly put together words that we
have become accustomed to from our beloved n3td3v. Secondly, using an email
address like someone@...yer.com is about as effective as
microsoft@...tware.com would be for convincing someone you are Bill Gates.

Any way, cheers and thanks for bringing a smile to my face this morning. :)

P.S. My phone book is telling me to get more coffee...
