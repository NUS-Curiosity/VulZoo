Please note that "the list" is merely an aggregation of names, and as such, is
no more able to "want to mock your client" than your phone book may wish to do
so.  And even if you interpret "the list" as the collection of subscribers,
that *still* doesn't work, because the subscribers on the full-disclosure list
are famous for not agreeing about much of anything. If they agreed that your
client deserved mocking, it would be the first thing they've been in agreement
on.

But you might want to have a chat with your phone book, see how it feels
about your client.
