 If you are a real Lawyer, please identify yourself in public, with proper
contact information.
 
  Of course, he's not a real lawyer, nor does he play one on TV.  Hell, he
barely has a 2nd grade command of the English language....  He's just yet
another n3td3v troll post..... and I fell right into it....

What's your problem list ?
it's the same kid all the way, the ones who answer to this guy,  should
wonder how dumb he's.
Dont pay attention to him, make a simple filter like "*anti.*se.*" and get
back to work.

He/They still get attention,and feel like he's/they're important because of
you prick, so shut the hell up.
They/he sucks, OK ?!?
We got rid of n3td3v, plz dont make him feel like he's usefull by answering.
