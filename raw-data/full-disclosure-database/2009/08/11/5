What's your problem list ?
it's the same kid all the way, the ones who answer to this guy,  should
wonder how dumb he's.
Dont pay attention to him, make a simple filter like "*anti.*se.*" and get

He/They still get attention,and feel like he's/they're important because of

They/he sucks, OK ?!?
We got rid of n3td3v, plz dont make him feel like he's usefull by answering.
