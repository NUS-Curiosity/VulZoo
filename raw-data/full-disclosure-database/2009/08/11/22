On Tue, 11 Aug 2009 02:07:49 CDT, someone lawyer said:
> My client is legitimate security researcher

Proper English: "My client is a legitimate...." - unlike some languages,
English *does* have an indefinite article and its use is not optional.

> This matter is taking care of legally now.

Proper English: "This matter is being taken care of..." - although many guides
to writing English recommend the active voice over the passive voice,  unless
it's an SCO lawsuit and has taken on a life of its own, the passive voice is
preferred.

Hint: Proofread. Or have somebody fluent in English do it for you. It makes the
lawyer claim a lot more believable.

Once upon a time, the trolls were literate. And then came the September Without
End.
