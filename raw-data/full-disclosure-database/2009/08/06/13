Hmm .. that "advisory" doesn't come from Jake.  The posting lacks
Jake's PGP key armor, plus it was posted on full-disclosure rather
than on any of the main lists.

That, and Noisebridge isn't a place for fraud.  Hacking and
presentations, yeah, but cloning and fraud?  Not a snowballs chance in
the sun's corona.
