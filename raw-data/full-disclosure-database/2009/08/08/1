Hello,

This is an email in response to the following FD post:
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Aug/0035.html

I did not write the above mentioned email regarding BART cards. That
email is not from my email address and it's not a related Noisebridge
email address either. Whoever is has control of that address is clearly
hostile and anyone emailing it should assume the worst.

The contents of that email appear to be partially taken from a free
software project that I work on. The rest of the information is made up
and likely false.

I sign public email with the following PGP key:

pub   1024D/9D0FACE4 2008-03-11 [expires: 2010-03-11]
Key fingerprint = 12E4 04FF D3C9 31F9 3405  2D06 B884 1A91 9D0F ACE4
uid                  Jacob Appelbaum <jacob@...elbaum.net>
sub   4096g/D5E87583 2008-03-11 [expires: 2010-03-11]

I've signed this email and the previously mentioned forgery lacks any
such digital signature. Please disregard it.

Best regards,
Jacob
