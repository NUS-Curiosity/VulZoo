Whoever wrote this specializes in hyperbole.  ADS is not hidden.  It's 
completely accessible.  For example, you can view the ADS in Word documents 
within Word.  ADS is where some file metadata is stored.  Yes, it's not 
viewable in Windows Explorer, but if you want more transparency with ADS, you 
can add ADS to the Properties tabs of the file system and view ADS for every 
file in the GUI by using StrmExt.dll.

Furthermore, executable content in an ADS cannot be run in some mysterious 
hidden fashion.  It is called just like any other executable and runs in memory 
just like any other executable.  Sure, you can "hide" stuff there, but it's not 
hidden when it's running.

Finally, all reputable a/v companies already scan ADS for malicious code.
