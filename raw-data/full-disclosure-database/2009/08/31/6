Unlikely to work - there's just Too Damned Many legacy binaries that have all
sorts of dependencies on undocumented quirks of the Windows APIs.  So you end
up needing to use a Wine-like shim to provide the API the binaries need - and
if the shim is good enough for the backward-combatable binaries, it's *also*
good enough for the malware to attack.  If IE9 has a bug and some Javascript
scribbles something into the 'Documents' folder, that Javascript really doesn't
care if it's a Documents folder on a real Windows box, or one that's in a
directory being managed by a shim on a Unix/Linux box.  All it cares about is
that it *behaves* like a Documents folder.

Hint:  If a Windows user's home directory is on a remote file share, it
really doesn't care if it's a Genuine Windows(TM) or a Samba share, does it?
Heck, it doesn't even know/care if its domain controller is Windows or Samba.
All it cares is that the file share and the DC *act* like Windows.

And unfortunately, that's true for both legitimate binaries and malware.
