Subject: Why FD should unban n3td3v.

Some of you may call n3td3v annoying, others may call him funny, 
but others may genuinely value his comments on the list.

Leave it up to the reader to decide.

FD exists to be unmoderated and uncensored. This list is a great 
thing, and I'm requesting that it be restored to it's former glory.

While I'm no fan of n3td3v, censoring him sets a dangerous 
precedent. If I wanted to filter out his mails client-side, I still 
could btw. 

Just don't censor him on the server.


Just my 2 cents.
