Hello list,

I have to clarify some things on the globbing vulnerability here.
The posted PoC (with the fine art) does NOT exploit IIS6 ftp servers,
IIS6 ftp server IS affected by the buffer overflow but is properly protected
by stack canaries. AFAIK it looks like a DoS on Windows Server 2003.
Until someone finds a way to bypass Stack Canaries on recent Windows
versions this remains a DoS on IIS6.

Thanks to HD Moore and all people in the past you wrote exploits for
my releases!
Kudos!

Nikolaos
