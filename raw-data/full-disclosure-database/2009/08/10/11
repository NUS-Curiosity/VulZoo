Subject: Re: Ureleet is the Anti-Sec

n3td3v, ureleet, and anti-sec are actually all Hitler, posting after
being recently unfrozen from cryogenic sleep. He is using this as part
of his black magic scheme to bring back nazi occultism and rule the
world once again.

Careful review of all posts shows the superstructure of a subconscious
mind-virus, waiting for a trigger event deep in the recesses of our
collective minds.

Relax don't do it
When you want to come
