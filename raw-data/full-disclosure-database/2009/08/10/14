We are accepting applications right now sunjestor! All you have to 
do is speak in the language in which you are fluent in which you 
will be immediately accepted upon doing 3 out of the 5 standard 
AntiSec procedures:

1. Suck off Mitnick.
2. Suck off Aitel (Travis is one up on you!).
3. Suck off Wozniak.
4. Suck off yourself (This should be no problem because of all the 
practice!).
5. Suck off everyone who thinks non-disclosure is a viable option 
(Many, many illiterates to choose from!).

3 out of the 5 will earn you a silver star, 4 or more will make you 
the new leader.

Good luck to all participants!!!!!
