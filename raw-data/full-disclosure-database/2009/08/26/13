In what way do you mean it is asymmetric?  CCMP can be used with
preshared keys.  Even if authentication were using asymmetric
algorithms, have you looked at any real-world crypto protocols that
use public keys for authentication?  They pretty much all use
symmetric ciphers for encryption after agreeing on a session key, so
this isn't unusual.  As another poster mentioned, the primary reason
for this is performance.
