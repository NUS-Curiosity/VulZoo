	НА: WPA attack improved to 1min, MITM

Dear dr,
please, let me try to share and elucidate (with you and the list) one
specific and conceptual point about "802.11i" and AES that intrigues
me.

I don't know if you can answer this, but it is worthy for reflection.

So,
Rijndael (AES) is a symmetric block cipher. Why WPA2 uses symmetric
cryptography in a communication (which is an asymmetric situation)?


Regards,
