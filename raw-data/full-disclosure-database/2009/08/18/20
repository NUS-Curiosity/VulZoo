Synopsis
========

An integer overflow in the PNG handling of Dillo might result in the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Dillo is a graphical web browser known for its speed and small
footprint.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/dillo       < 2.1.1                           >= 2.1.1

Description
===========

Tilei Wang reported an integer overflow in the Png_datainfo_callback()
function, possibly leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open an HTML document
containing a specially crafted, large PNG image, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Dillo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =www-client/dillo-2.1.1
