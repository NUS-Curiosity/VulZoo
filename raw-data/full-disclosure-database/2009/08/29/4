iProphet (weev) Questions

Sorry for being repetitive. FD is mostly hoarsechit and fucin 
around anyway (not that you do ANY of that).

My name is Gary McKinnon, I'm the "nerd" that hacked into the 
Pentagon. I'm autistic so I may have difficulty communicating or 
understanding you.

HELLO? Can you hear me?

I CAN'T SEE THE SCREEN. LET ME TRY TO TYPE SOME QUEStions

8======^H^H^H^H^HD

1.) Do you have HIV?
2.) Have you ever anointed anyone with your IRL "Virus"?
3.) Do you think that you could be prosecuted for hacking if you 
give people your IRL badware?
4.) Do the woman you give HIV to go to heaven?
5.) What does your computer screen look like? You run linux? Do you 
have an iProphet wallpaper?
6.) When will we be seeing new vlogcasts
7.) Do you plan on writing some subversive PDF's for us?
8.) Do you intend on making a documentary so it can go viral and 
cause a revolution?
9.) In your mind, what is your picture of an ideal world?
