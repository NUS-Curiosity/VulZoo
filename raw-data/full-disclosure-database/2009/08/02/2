Subject: Just Asking

A friend of mine observed something that I believe should be put on the 
table.
While reading the e-mails sent back and forth by Dan Kaminsky, illegally 
published on zf05 one of the e-mails caught his eye:

"""

Dan,


This is another of our clients and you do not have the permission of the
client to perform this kind of scanning.
You have triggered over 22,000 events for us in this range alone as well
as caused a few other minor aggravations.
While you may believe you are a researcher and doing good, performing
your unauthorized testing on live production platforms is a reportable
offense.
I am going to kindly suggest you seek permission from various targets 
before you continue your "research".
Please note I am under contractual obligations to report your
activities, we have recorded your "scans" on over 26 devices globally
and none of our clients have given you permission to perform these "tests"

"""

Now, according to this e-mail should Dan's CISSP certification be revised?
