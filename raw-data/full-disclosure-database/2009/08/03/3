[TLB:] And none of what you posted represents the least actionable proof
that he did. A text file, posted by self-professed Cyber-Criminals, is
not evidence of any sort that can be acted on to deprive someone of
professional certification. At least, not in those parts of the world
where we have the rule of law, standards of evidence, and other such
things that make commerce work.

The supposed victim of Dan's unauthorized network analysis would have to
complain to ISC2, with proper evidence, and proper chain of custody and
non-repudiation of said evidence, before any action could even begin.

Instead of advocating the rescission Dan's CISSP, you should study the
material and go get your own.
