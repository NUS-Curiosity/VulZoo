Hello all,
By reading the US-CERT vulnerability issue (CVE-2009-0696) I found this :
"The vulnerability affects all servers that are masters for one or more
zones and is not limited to those that are configured to allow dynamic
updates ". I have some Infoblox master DNS servers with not-allowed dynamic
updates, so I'm wondering if they are vulnerable to this attack and if
somebody test this PoC on a DNS server which not allow dynamic updates? What
is the comportement in this case?

Thanks for the help,
