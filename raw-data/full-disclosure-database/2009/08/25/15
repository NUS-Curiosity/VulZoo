Subject: Flex website scanners

Any good flex website application scanners? Most of the free automated web 
application scanners like paros, nikto, etc do not look at flex/ flash web 
pages. We are looking at a website and need some basic automated scanning 
tool to cover the flex/  flash part

Thanks
