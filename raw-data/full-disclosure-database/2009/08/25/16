Check out SWFScan.  It does what a scanner is supposed to do, which is 
find low-hanging vulnerabilities.  The tool does a pretty good job at 
decompiling for the most part, but you still really need to do manual 
analysis on the code!!  You should never rely on ANY scanner to do 100% 
of your analysis.
