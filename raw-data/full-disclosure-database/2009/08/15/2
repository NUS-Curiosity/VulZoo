Huh? Apparently you don't know how CVE assignment works.

If you request one from CVE, they can assign one without knowing any 
details of the vulnerability. CVE will embargo the details until the 
researcher and/or vendor are ready. I assume the Candidate Numbering 
Authorities would be able to do the same, but going to Red Hat, Debian or 
Ubuntu in this case may not be the best option.
