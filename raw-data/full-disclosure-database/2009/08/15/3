Subject: Might want to add this to your blocked list

I was browsing Fail Blog and got redirected to this site.... Shows a video that looks like windows explorer looking at "my computer" and getting scanned. You know the routine...

Surprised that none of our blockers snagged the url (Open-DNS, WOT, Chrome, Phish-Tank) thought I'd share here.

antivirus-online-scanv6(dot)com

thanks,
