	For our readers

We received 123 emails from distinctive readers asking to bring the
secreview blog back! So for those of you who emailed us, the blog is
back but this time things are unlike before. We still do not have time
to do reviews because our lives are just too demanding and we do them
for free. Its extremely important to us that the reviews that we write
are truthful and its difficult to check the truth if we are low on free
time.

So we came up with a plan. Secreview will allow reviews of security
companies, security technology, and other security related reviews that
are written by our readers. We will do our best to check the substance
of the review to make sure that the reviews are truthful, respectful,
and precise.

Reviews can be submitted anonymously or they can be accredited to the
author. If we think that the reviews are fair, truthful and precise
then we will publish them. We will also accept and consider re-reviews
of companies that weâ€™ve already reviewed.

If you want to submit a review the rules are:

1-) Make sure that the review is accurate, truthful, and ethical.
2-) Cite your references so that we can fact check your review.
3-) Submit a scorecard that is ready to be posted.

The Secreview team will no longer be writing any reviews. We will read
and check the reviews that are sent in by our readers. If we think that
the reviews are honest, precise, and ethical then we will publish them.
