[Bkis-11-2009] ProShow Gold Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

1. General Information

ProShow Gold is a software allowing you easily create photo and video 
slide shows on DVD, PC and Web. Recently, Bkis has just detected 
vulnerabilities in the software related to the processing of ProShow 
Slideshow’s project files (“.psh”). This vulnerability permits hackers 
to execute malicious code on users’ systems.

Bkis Advisory : Bkis-11-2009
Initial vendor notification : 08/06/2009
Release Date : 08/20/2009
Update Date : 08/20/2009
Discovered by : Le Duc Anh, Bkis
Attack Type : Buffer Overflow
Security Rating : High
Impact : Code Execution
Affected Software : ProShow Gold version 4.0.2549 (Prior versions may 
also be affected).
PoC : proshow gold poc

2. Technical Description

PSH is the extension of an ProShow Slideshow’s project file. There are 
many bugs found in the way ProShow Gold processing a PSH file with 
overly long fields. Inadequate check for two fields including 
cell[n].images[m].image and cell[n].sound.file fields (where m, n is an 
integer number) could lead to critical buffer overflow errors.

In order to exploit, a hacker might create a specially crafted “.PSH” 
file and trick users into using it. If successful, hackers can perform 
local attack, inject viruses, steal sensitive information and even take 
control of the victim’s system.

3. Solution

Rating this vulnerability high severity and due to the fact that the 
vendor hasn’t released any patch against this vulnerability, Bkis 
recommends that users should not open any untrusted PSH file.
