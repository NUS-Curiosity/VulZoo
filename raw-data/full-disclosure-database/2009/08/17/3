Details.

Piwigo is a photo gallery application written in PHP. The application 
suffers from a SQL injection vulnerability in comments.php, as it fails to 
validate data supplied in the "items_number" variable before being used in 
an SQL query.

SQL injection attacks can give an attacker access to backend database 
contents, the ability to remotely execute system commands, or in some 
circumstances the means to take control of the operating system hosting the 
database.
