Hi

It's Jonas, a master student in University of Glamorgan (UK)

I'm doing a research project about forensic guidelines of IM (instant
messaging)

And I really need some help and opinion from you, the experts or
investigators in this field.

Please kindly reply me with some response of the questions below.

All of this are only used for academic research and all messages from you
will be kept secret.

Question1: How long have you worked in forensic field?

Answer:

Question2: Do you use any guidelines (like ACPO or any document from NIJ or
DoJ in USA)? What is it?

Answer:

Question3: Do you think the guideline documents are enough to provide
guidance in investigating e-crimes?

Answer:

Question4: Have you ever deal with any e-crime case which was using IM as
criminal tool or included the abuse of IM? If yes, please mention the IM
client type.

Answer:

Question5: As a guideline for IM forensic, what part do you think is the
most important one to be mentioned?

                (Example: Background information, procedures, or other
considerations....)

Really thanks for your help. And I'll be appreciating if you can forward
this mail to other friends who work in this field too.
