Subject: This is WAR!

I'm sick and tired of vi fanboys  (and their craven pukes of bastard
offspring - the vim freaks) fucking up the planet!! How can these jokers
claim to be professionals? What sort of person with any sort of brain would
ever demean themselves by learning keystrokes like "escape - colon - i"
before they can even start inserting text? Haven't you heard of full-screen
editors, morons?? Hey, wake up, it's not 1985 any more!!!! Anyone who cares
to look into the subject can see that Bill Joy only wrote vi as a sick joke
to ruin the minds of programmers and sysadmins. vi users are scarcely human!
Only us proud, blessed users who've seen the light of emacs deserve to
survive. vim users should be driven into the ocean, and then prodded with
broomsticks to keep them away from the boats, and drenched in buckets of
fresh abbatoir sweepings, until the sharks come and eat them slowly from the
feet up.
