Ureleet:
God damn you freaking moron. You're making yourself as low as n3td3v. 
Shut the FUCK up for god's sake and gtfo off the list if you're not 
contributing anything security related (which I suppose you never will 
because you're just into the drama. Were you a drama queen in high 
school too? If you graduated, I mean.)
Before you come up with some fucking dumbshit 12-year-old reply such as 
'LOLZ ur gay well i fuked ur mom lolol' maybe you'd like to know I've 
already added you to my spam list as well. Congrats, you've stooped to 
the same level as n3td3v.
Please, go read the definition of 'Don't feed the trolls'.

Regards,
URMOM LOL!!1 (Thats sarcasm for those with an IQ that isn't a double 
digit.)
