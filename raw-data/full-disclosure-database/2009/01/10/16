I curse you and your bloated emacs and Allah forbid XEmacs brethren!  Bill
Joy is the only true Messiah as revealed in 3rd Hezikia 4:12:
And low, I bring you Joy and his pure visual so that all may know true
light.  While all will see the light, not all will know and embrace the
light.  Woe be thou who speak against the true visual for there will be
much gnashing of teeth in hell for them.

We will never stop!  We will send our donkeys strapped with bombs and
destroy your build servers!  We will continue to send our poorly targeted
lisp bombs and terrorize your bloated memory footprint!  How dare you use
the same software to write code, read email, post to
alt.binaries.beastiality and floss your teeth?  Don't you know how unclean
this is- sharing a memory space with pure C code and such dirty thoughts?

Death to all infidels!
