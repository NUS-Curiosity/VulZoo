Subject: Observations from 10 days in Nov.

One thing is 'fer sure...since I can't simply skim over the messages  
due to over-zealous subject lines, I
read the messages.  Most of 'em, anyway.  I find myself assaulted with  
word salad, burying myself in
interesting expressions of hatred, grief, aggravation and amusement.

..So hey, I thought I would share, in between hostile Palestinian  
verbal-fire and absolute assumptions that
n3td3v is a sleeper MI-5 agent.  You can't fool me, n3td3v, I have  
experience in these things.

In no particular order, here is a mean sample from a 10-day period in  
November...I'd write more,
but this is a security list:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


"...to learn about security, its just expected by the user that the  
system is
  1) not ******break in able****** and 2) hasn't already been  
compromised. if you
turn your computer on and everything looks in place and as it should,  
you
suggest to yourself you haven't been hacked, howe..."
-n3td3v


"now i am going back to my real job, doing real things and you can go  
back to
playing with lego and waiting for your mother to bring in some  
sandwiches
cut into triangles. without the crust....faggot"
-Biz Marqee


"Unfortunately, the Joe Sixpacks tend to marry Jill Sixpacks, and  
reproduce."
-Valdis


"i have a power base of nearly 5000 members on the n3td3v mailing list,
****and i don't work for the government**** but i very much believe in  
what
the uk intelligence services are doing. so i suggest you don't fuck
with n3td3v but its your choice at the end of the day. thank you and
good day."
-n3td3v

"They don't realise I might work for MI5.  And then again, I might  
work for MI5."
-n3td3v


"Actually I think a new game should be created that revolves around  
stalking
n3td3v.  At the end of the month a Stalker of the Month could be
selected and given a prize. I think it could be a lot of fun."
-vulcanius


"Look at the 7 days without you - no one was asking "wheres n3td3v" were
they? No, everyone was enjoying the fact that you were in hospital  
having
the guards do reruns of your drunk uncles night time visits your  
bedroom.
That shit fucked you up for life didn't it, faggot?"
-Biz Marqee


"What's a n3td3v?"
-Paul Ferguson


"Does this mean you are wanting the vendors to be fucked?"
-n3td3v


"Let us all rejoice by following Gadi Evron in his love of the cock and
all things whitehat."
-not dev


"I'm not sure this is a good idea as it gives a heads up to hackers.
you may think its not long but its actually 5 days for a hacker to
figure out potentially a vulnerability in said area."
-n3td3v


"maybe we should have a discussion on what a drug addled cock lover  
you are?"
-Biz Marqee


Note:  Like a bad acid trip or some kind of heinous, immutable INFOSEC  
Phoenix, n3td3v Will Not Die.
As soon as he announces he's going away, he comes back.  Tossed,  
tattered,
abused and perhaps prancing around your flat with a but-plug up his  
ass reminiscing
about a phantasmagorical guy named Clyde, n3td3v is Eternal, n3td3v is  
MI5, n3td3v Is All
Things to Everyone.

I'll end this with a prophetic statement by the aforementioned from  
2006:

Subject: [Full-disclosure] n3td3v: viva end of n3td3v----and security  
group
From: n3td3v <xploitable@...il.com>
Date: Fri Sep 1 20:13:50 BST 2006

n3td3v with the beginning Spetember 1st 2006 is the end of n3td3v  
commentry via Full-Disclosure list or any
other medium. This is because n3td3v is moving into the professional  
scene, so underground hacker scene isn't
suitable for the n3td3v agenda.

Fearlessly,
-oz

â€œCondoleezza Rice is a very cruel, offended woman who lacks men's  
attention. She needs to be taken to a company of man-soldiers and it  
would be just fine. Releasing such stupid remarks gives her the  
feeling of being fulfilled. This is the only way for her to attract  
men's attention.  Show me that Rice is a woman? The only thing she  
attracts is reindeer. The States needs to practice the old Soviet  
tradition when both single women and single men were not allowed to  
take responsible state positions..."
