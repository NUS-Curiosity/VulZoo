Subject: Hackery Channel 01-09-01-LOLZ: Cat Spoofing
	against Flow Control

Security Risk:  High
Exploitable: Local
Vulnerability: Arbitrary Flow Control Control, Cat Spoofing
Discovered by: The Hackery Channel
Tested: No

The Flow Control project is an access control project for a cat.  It
consists of a cat door, an electromagnetic latch, a access control device,
and image recognition software that allows Flow to enter the house, and only
when she is not carrying prey.  When Flow is within proximity of the door,
she passes through a light that casts a shadow on an area monitored by a
camera.  If the silouhette, appears to be  Flow without prey, access is
granted.

Cat Spoofing:  An attacker could potentially gain access by posing as a
kitty by placing a cut out of the kitty next to the light.

Mitigation: None.
Work around: Guard dog
Vendor Notified: No
