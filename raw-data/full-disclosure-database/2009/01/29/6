Umm.. what's the risk here?  Does the flaw allow the attacker to upload
files that wouldn't be permitted even as the authorized account?  Seems if
they can administer content types, they can drop pretty much whatever they
want onto the server (possibly limited as to where in the tree though), and
all this does is let them drop stuff outside said tree?
