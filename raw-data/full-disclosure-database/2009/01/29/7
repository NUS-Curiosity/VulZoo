Hello,

  in one scenario you allow a Drupal 5.x user to administer content
types - to set up new structures for node content.  This permission
doesn't allow the user to create content, to upload material, or to
interact with the filesystem in any way.  With the Imagefield module
installed this user can move non-image files onto the filesystem.
'Administer content types' privilege only lets a user set up new
structures for content nodes, not create content, or even upload
material to the filesystem, except for the 'default image' used in the
content type.  The flaw allows such a user to upload any number of
files, opening avenues to trigger local file inclusion vulnerabilities,
hosting malware, phishing, etc., etc.  The route to exploitation might
be oblique, but ideally it shouldn't exist at all.
