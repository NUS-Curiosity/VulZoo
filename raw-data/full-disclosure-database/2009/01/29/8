Subject: CarolinaCon-V - March 13th-14th 2009

InfoSec professionals, h4x0rs, script kidz, posers, and government spies:

CarolinaCon is back for its 5th year!  For about the price of your average
movie admission with popcorn and a drink ($20), YOU are invited to join us
for yet another intimate and informative weekend of technology education.

This year's event will be held on the weekend of March 13th-14th, 2009.
The event will mostly occur at the Holiday Inn in Chapel Hill, NC.  Chapel
Hill is about 30 minutes from Raleigh, Durham, and Research Triangle Park.
For all the exciting details as they develop, stay tuned to: 
www.carolinacon.org

CarolinaCon is an annual technology conference whose mission/purpose is
to;
- provide "affordable" technology education sessions to the unwashed masses,
- deliver varied/informative/interesting presentations on a wide variety of
InfoSec/hacking/technology/science topics, and
- mix in enough entertainment and side contests/challenges to make for a
truly fun event.

CarolinaCon is proudly brought to you by The CarolinaCon Group. The
CarolinaCon Group is a non-profit organization registered in the state of
NC, dedicated to educating the local and global communities about
technology, information/network/computer security, and information rights.

Where else can you have that much fun for $20 (that doesn't involve
mind-altering substances or Internet pr0n, cough)?

WARNING: Shameless (yet well-intentioned) pitch alert!!!
For the corporate-sponsored amongst you, for the first time we invite you
and/or your organization to demonstrate its philanthropic generosity by
sponsoring a "CarolinaCon scholarship".  In past years the CarolinaCon
staff and non-profit board has allowed some predetermined number of student
attendees on tight budgets to attend CarolinaCon for free.  But why should
we monopolize all the good karma and feelings of self-worth?  So if you
have a spare $20, consider donating it to this year's scholarship fund.
You'll sleep better knowing you helped someone in need, and you can
legitimately write it off as a charitable donation.  Here is a link to the
non-profit's filed articles of incorporation, for reference:
http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/Filings.aspx?PItemId=7889445
And if your company is feeling extremly saucy and generous, the non-profit
can accept donations to help buy equipment for future Cons.  Absolutely
no pressure to give here, but the Con barely breaks even annually and we
beg/borrow/steal LCD projectors, PA equipment, etc. in putting on the event
annually.  Again, NO PRESSURE!  We just figured we'd offer the "opportunity"
to help provide affordable education to others, for the first time in 5 years
of Con history.
On that note if you're a struggling student desperately seeking knowledge,
give the Con staff your best sob story at the door (heh) and apply for one
of our admission scholarships.

CarolinaCon-V - Be there or be l4m3!

Peace,
Vic
