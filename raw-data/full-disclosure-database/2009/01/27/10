To block nastygrams like this and others, you should be able
to do this with ipfilter rules like this:

echo '@0 block in quick all with short' | ipf -6f -

and/or add said rule to the top of your ipf6.conf file.

Unfortunately the exploit expects you to be using Linux,
so I'm somewhat challenged to verify this at present.
