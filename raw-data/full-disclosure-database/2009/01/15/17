That is your opinion.
Actually a cyber war is asyncron - so there's no equal panzer on both sides. -.-
Also, no one I've read stated that defacements of websites -and only
that- is cyber war.
It's a term that describes an asynchronous warfare between sides.
note that a war must not have two governments fighting each other.
