Read the archive, I'm too tired repeating myself, I answered each one of his
claims - it is you and your terrorists supporting pals who have been pinned
down, and resort to childish personal attacks.

Maybe that's because he avoids the question with so much noise? Read back
the archive as I am not going to do the work for you.

I don't - I responded to each of his claims, with facts which he and you
ignore, and instead he used bad grammar and bad spelling for childish
personal attacks.

You are making baseless claims - everything I posted can be verified.

How old are you kid? Really?

yes.

no. I don't care who you are - just stating a fact.

I would not be proud of that.

Here again, childish baseless personal attacks. Why don't you grow up kid?

That's because you either have something to hide, or you simply did not do
anything worth posting that anyone would find useful.

I don't need to, I have good enough memory to remember I never supported the
death of innocent civilians. If you think I'm wrong, prove that.
