Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

How come you never sleep ?
There's some relay going on, on your propaganda nickname ?

Anyways :

>>Hamas is also designated as a terrorist organization by the US state
department.
What a nice reference ....
>>I said Hamas was, and that the Palestinians elected Hamas as governement.
Hamas resist against your invasion.
>>Thanks for the 'information'.
I suggest, just in general, that you use a dictionary once in a while...
I do, and i suggest you to look at the use of this word in the medias or by
govs, before 9/11/2001.

>>I didn't say all Palestinians are terrorists

Oh let me guess:

see all your familly killed by israeli, and do nothing = good Palestinian
see all your familly killed by israelis and then kill some israelis with old
school rockets = bad Palestinian

Sure it's always more funny when you can fire at them when they dont fight
back.
