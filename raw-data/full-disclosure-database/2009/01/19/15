I think the one who is using a propaganda nickname is you 'j-f sentier' - My
real name is Avraham Schneider - you can find my profile on Linked In, and I
don't hide by a propaganda nickname, something so prevalent here lately...

How? By firing at _civilians_? Sending suicide bombers to attack
_civilians_? And doing everything it possibly can to attack _civilians_?

How do they resist? by hiding behind their own _civilians_? Then claiming
victory when Israel pulls out after killing hundreds of them?

If Israel really wanted to kill Palestinians in general, it could do it much
cheaper and with no Israeli casualties.

Israel pulled out of Gazaa and let the Palestinians have their own
govornment, they basically gave them everything they wanted on a silver
plate, in return Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups, sent
terrorist suicide bombers accross the border - to kill as many Israeli
_civilians_ as possible.

Israel is _avoiding civilian casualties_, it is _sorry_ for any _civilians_
wounded or killed during fighting - but this is a _war_, and _civilians die_
- especially since Hamas is using Palestinian civilians as human shields -

Hamas on the other hand, _target civilians_ - Palestinians are _happy_ when
Israeli civilians die, the same as they were happy at 9/11 - when 3000
innocent civilians dies in the WTC - spreading candy in the streets.

Sure it's always more funny when you can fire at them when they dont fight

We don't fire at them - we don't target civilians, we target the militant
terrorist organizations that hide among the supporting Palestinian
population.
Any civilian who stores weapons in his house should not complain that his
house is bombed.
any civilian who has a smuggling tunnel underground, should not complain
that his house is bombed.

No other country does what Israel does - i.e. make over 250 thousand
phonecalls to warn enemy's civilians to leave an area about to be bombed -
during war.
