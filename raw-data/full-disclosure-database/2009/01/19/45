Yes, that attack unfortunately often works quite well.  It's been known
about for quite some time though. Read section 7 of RFC5006, which
specifically mentions rogue RAs for redirection.  It also adds:

          Also, an attacker could configure a host to send out
   an RA with a fraudulent RDNSS address, which is presumably an easier
   avenue of attack than becoming a rogue router and having to process
   all traffic for the subnet.  It is necessary to disable the RA RDNSS
   option in both routers and clients administratively to avoid this
   problem.  All of this can be done independently of implementing ND.

And having a rogue RA has been a known issue since at least 2004:

(Probably further back, but I'll let somebody else chase down the
first citation)
