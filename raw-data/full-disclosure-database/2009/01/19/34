You guys are armed by US ... Palestinian do not have equivalent weapons....

> Now quoting party is over, let's also talk about fact:
Israel are illegal since 1948.
They have stolen lots of land in jordany, egypt, palestine, liban while
playing at war with them neighbors.
Btw no one of theses neighbors wanted  the creation of the state of israel,
which is totally understandable,  but US and British got the last word.
Israel also made a nuclear bomb illegaly, they shouldn't have that one.
Also about the elected people by god stuff, i forgot to said that  the man
who wrote the torah was jew ;)
The bigger problems with zionist, is they control most of the medias around
the world,  most of the banks, them community are pretty strong around.
Making/doing propaganda is an easy game for them, you cant touch jews,
because as avraham do, everytime you hit them, they play the holocaust card.
If someone in europe throw some coktails molotov on a  mosque, nothing
happens, but if you do the same on a synagogue,  all the politics will be
condaming the authors of this attak, kind of frustrating eh ?

You have to understand something Avraham, a lots of people (not muslims)
hate zionist, there's a reason for this, you've asked for it.

As you got to understand that a lots of people do not like the US, for what
they've done in central ameriqua for exemple, or for playing the world
policeman game, and yes if 15 clown armed like gardeners can blow 2 towers
in US soil, this will make happy some people around the world, religious
related or not.
Also stop calling everyone terrorists, dont you remember, talibans was good
terrorists when they was fighting agains communists, now that they "fight"
against US, they are bad terrorists.
stifles yourself with your propaganda.
