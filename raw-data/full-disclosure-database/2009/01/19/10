Subject: Sorry if there are multiple posts

Our first post never seemed to go through, it was re-sent, hopefully it
will show up, it involves important infomation about posts that were made
to this list previously, to set the record straight about certain
individuals who have been abusing the list to promote their agenda of
harassment under false names.

There should have been another post before the one that did go through,
so it may seem out of context.
