You really need to start discerning facts from opinion, you should ask your
school teacher for help if you have trouble with that (You're already in 3rd
grade right?)

It is apparent that you, handrix and all the other gmail pseudo-names you
use are the same individual - so it does not matter under which handle you
have chosen to make this claim.

But if you would not like to be held responsible for that statement under
this handle, I'm fine with it - consider it as proof against the claims you
made under the other handle you were using.

OK - whoever did that was stupid, and would be classified as a terrorist.
I have no idea who did it, and I have no association with him whatsoever.

I can read and write in English just fine without the help of a translator -
you on the other hand need to work on your grammar and spelling, as well as
wash you mouth and fingers with plenty of soap.
