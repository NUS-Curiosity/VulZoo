Jews in Germany were law abiding citizens, not terrorists, that were being

systematically. 6 million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust - half of the
Jewish population.

We already established that it is fact that Israel is not targeting
civilians, and that Hamas is using them as human shields.
We already established that Israel is sorry for any civilian injured or hurt
in battle - but Hamas, the elected terrorist government is the one to blame
for civilian deaths - both on the Israeli and the Palestinian side.

It is evident that Hamas, Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and the rest of the
radical-Islam terror groups are the ones that destabilize world peace.
Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists seem to be Muslim - what
does it say about your religion?

Blame Hamas for using them as human shields as they fire at IDF soldiers.

You are partly right, even animals have the instinct of self defense. But if
we were animals like Hamas, we would have targeted civilians and would have
ended this story long ago.

Hence we are humans, Hamas are animals - and we have to keep defending
ourselves from Hamas terrorits.

Yes, it's a shame that Hamas was not stopped before Israel had to step up
and defend itself.

Israel is against the war - it always wanted peace and always wants peace -
but it can not negotiate peace with terrorists who do not stop targetting
Israeli civilians.

Judging by your typos and bad grammer it seems that you are one (very bored)
person.

I'm not worried as you don't seem to hate the Nazis that much.

Then again, if it makes you happy - I give you permission to hate me.
