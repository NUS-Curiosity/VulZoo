Israel was never hostile to the Arab countries - on the contrary, the Arab

all odds.

Everyone beleives Israel have nukes. Nobody (other than those who need to),
knows for certain.

I took your advice, looked at the writing style, spelling, grammer and
opinion - and I came to the conclusion that you are a sick and retarded
individual.

You are a retard - go check your grammar.

No fixation, just after all the BS you have been typing you fingers are
probably full of cow manure.
You think that cursing on an Internet forum does you any good and/or help
your credibility?
You are probably also using these words in your daily conversations so I
arrived at the conclusion your mouth is dirty as well, and for hygene
purposes I recommended you wash your fingers and mouth with plenty of
soap...
I guess you were not taught manners in school... Maybe next year, when you
get to the 4th grade.
