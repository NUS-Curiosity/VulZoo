>>Without checking, I bet the vast majority of these are Muslim. I would be
glad to be proven wrong.

 

Guess what, Islam is for more than 1400 Years, Israel is there since 60
years. Now how old is any of the list you motioned ? do you know that none
of them even exist before The evil Israel exists ?

So should we call them "Muslim terrorists"?

 

You are the evil and as long you exist the world will suffer.

 

Years before any of the resistance groups exist who did sabra and chatila
massacre? who bomb the American embassy in Cairo to destroy the
Arab/American relation ? who sends bombed mails to the German and French
workers in Egypt ?

 

Avraham, do you have a job ? or this is your job ? will you shut up so we
can get ride of this topic
