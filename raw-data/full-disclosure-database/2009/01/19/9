Subject: RJ Carter abuses of kids and defamation - Don't
 Let Your Kids Go Online Unsupervised

Another post to this list was posted by R.J. Carter (who actually writes
reviews of DVD's at www.The-Trades.com, and peddles his bizarre fantasy
books on Amazon with his friend, and fellow Yahweh Clan member, Troy
Riser), where he spams links to his blog where he reposts his "article"
supposedly promoting "online safety" directed to parents.

What Mr. Carter doesn't mention, (and that The-Trades.com probably is not
aware of) is that he is a member of an internet "cyber-terrorist" group,
the YouTube Yahweh Clan.
A group formed with the intent to "troll", harass, stalk, intimidate,
extort, and torment to the fullest extent, the most vulnerable members of
the online community, abuse voctims, women, the mentally challenged,
hancicapped children, suicidal teens, for a form of humor they call
"Lulz".

He also added the keywords listing user Irish282, and Logansperman2 (a
teenaged boy), to spike search engines when his article here was
archived, to direct harassment at them (they are both targets of this
group because they spoke out against them).

In his article (which everyone is invited to read on his own blog site),
he starts out writing what seems to be a balanced article on online
safety, but it's true purpose was to imply things about a kids' YouTube
channel called YoungTubersUnited, and the aforementioned users. His
friend (and co-author) Troy Riser saught out this group of kids (run by a
14 year old boy and his father), who had the popularity and praise that
they both probably wanted, and decided to join in the Yahweh Clan by
implying this group of kids was somehow "run by pedophiles", and part of
an elaborate "pedophile ring" (we could not make this stuff up).

Also, in the most blatant irony, Mr. Carter posted kids' own YouTube user
names in his article about "keeping kids safe", enabling anyone to
directly contact (and harass) these children, calling them "pedophile
supporters".

How this man still has any credibility or a career as a writer of any
sort (even DVD reviews) is beyond me.
