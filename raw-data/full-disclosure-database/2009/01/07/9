First of all, I apologiye for talking about this in a security mailing

facts:
1) Israel is using a revenge politics for ages. Eye for 1000 eyes,  I
would call it, cancelling passes thru the borders to palestinian
residents, indiscriminate bombing, etc.
2)You want facts? Sure,

Israeli armored forces remained poised on the Gaza border for a possible
ground operation, a week after Israel launched devastating air strikes
with the declared aim of ending rocket attacks on its southern towns.

Gaza medical officials put the Palestinian casualty toll at least 429 dead
and 2,000 wounded.

A United Nations agency said more than a quarter of those killed in the
Gaza Strip were civilians. A leading Palestinian human rights group put
the figure at 40 percent.

Four Israelis have been killed by Palestinian rockets since Israel's
offensive began, including longer-range weapons that have hit the port of
Ashdod and the desert town of Beersheba, forcing schools to shut and
residents to scurry for shelter. (as usual, 4 soldiers dead, 400
palestinian murdered in revenge, no surprise, old school Sharon style).

In the Israeli-blockaded Gaza Strip, 1.5 million Palestinians are unable
to escape the conflict. Residents face bombs, missiles and flickering
electricity, and queue for bread along streets littered with broken glass
and other debris.

Ten Palestinians were killed Friday in more than 30 Israeli air strikes.
Seven of them were civilians, including five children, local medics said.

One missile killed three Palestinian children aged between eight and 12 as
they played on a street near the town of Khan Yunis in the south of the
strip. One was decapitated.

Islamist fighters fired rockets at Israel's ancient port of Ashkelon,
blowing out windows in an apartment building. Another house took a direct
hit from a long-range missile later in the day, and cars were set ablaze.

This is the truth. These are the facts. Israel has a constant harassment
and punishment politic against palestinian people. I don' t care about
what your politics could BUY in the 20's with the help of USA, I don't cry
for your soldiers (as they accept a job where they are well paid to
possibly DIE) , I care about families who cannot meet each other. I care
about total block of basic supplies (and don't give me that shit about
humanitarian help, etc... these are people, not begging anything, they
have their rights and Israel decides when they have them and when they
don't).

I am spanish, quite neutral until I ' ve seen what this dammed people
(much more extremist than Hamas, but with suits, crying and smiles they
look like poor nice bussinessmen, they suffered so much in the past..)
have done to a beautiful land. They grow kids in hate for Palestinian (you
can say Palestinian too, but this is a normal after the massacre of your
family and people).

So please , stop chewing your stupid propaganda (nobody believes out of
Israel, for sure not in Eurpe, maybe in some McDonald's in Tenesse...) and
LOOK FOR A PACIFIC SOLUTION (and you hd the chance in the past, but you
want the WHOLE CAKE in the name of the Tora, a book some priest/politician
wrote, remember?).
If not, go to Palestine (as I did) , and talk from YOUR OWN MOUTH.

And PLEASE, stop polluting every media with your fake facts and Eternal
Truth.
This is a Security Mailing list, for people who (shouldn't) believe in
your crap, people with interest in Absolute Truth from HIS OWN EXPERIENCE
(isn't that Full Disclosure?).
Shalom (remeber? It means PEACE ).
