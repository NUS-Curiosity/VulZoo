    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5303

Description:
    Previous versions of Perl contained a race condition in the rmtree
    function of the File::Path module that allowed local users to create
    arbitrary setuid binaries via a symlink attack. This is a regression
    related to CVE-2005-0448.
    
    Additionally a double free vulnerability exists that allows
    context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service via a
    crafted regular expression containing UTF8 characters.
