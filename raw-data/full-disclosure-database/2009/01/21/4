    http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20090107.txt

Description:
    Previous versions of OpenSSL do not properly check the return value from
    the EVP_VerifyFinal function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
    validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature 
    for DSA and ECDSA keys.
