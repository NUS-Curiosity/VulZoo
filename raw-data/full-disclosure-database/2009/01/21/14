Hi guys.

Dave is a member of a forensics list I am on and asked me to post this
response on his behalf (he is not a full disclosure list member). You
can email him at dave@...ekleiman.com if you need to discuss further. 

Ben.

Razi,

You researching skills are astonishing.....maybe NOT!

       >>>seagate.custkb.com != seagate.com<<<

Really, what was your verification process?


       >>>Seagate's knowledge base can be found at
http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/ <<<

No that is where the link to Seagate's knowledge base is. 

Did you bother to check the link, of course not?  It leads here:
http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/news.jsp?NewLang=en

Did you bother to call their support number, of course not?
1-800-SEAGATE (1 800 732-4283), you would have heard all about the
issue.


       >>>Do you have any actual evidence to back up these wild claims?
Besides the inquirer, of course (the source for the electronista
article) and the _fake_ knowledgebase website<<

Yes I do...the actual source of the article, the Seagate forum from the
16th of Jan. ""Seagate Community Forums: Internal Hard Drives : Internal
(ATA and Serial ATA) drives : ANNOUNCEMENT: Firmware Issues""
http://forums.seagate.com/stx/board?board.id=ata_drives  just click on
the ""ANNOUNCEMENT: Firmware Issues"" it is right at the top. 

And, the knowledge base is real, but from someone with what appears to
be your erudition and what would seem to be your knee-jerk reaction, you
may not possess the skill set to figure that out. 

Stick to whatever it is you do well, whatever that is, but it seems to
be obvious that it is probably not any type of information research.


Respectfully,

Dave Kleiman - http://www.ComputerForensicExaminer.com

    Seagate is picking up the tab for data recovery. I have known about
    this problem and been teaching it in the class since the drives were
    released and seen hundreds, not only Seagate's, but also Western
    Digital and Hitachi. It's great to see them being responsible.

    Hitachi have similar problems with drives failing. We will see what
    that is in the future I guess.

shhhhhhhhhh do not tell anyone. myself and byteassassin have created a
supermicro nix kernel that runs in the flash area of seagate drives,
we can cause the rotational speed of a hard drive to triple, and then
the platters shatter. we already have over 500K downloads, and at
defcon this year we be able to take over millions of computers and
show us controlling them during our presentation, and then bang
millions of hard drives will all crash at once....permanently!
i hope you are not one of those security research guys and try and
turn us in........................
