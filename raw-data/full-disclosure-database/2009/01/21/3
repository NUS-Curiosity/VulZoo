Description:
    Previous versions of BIND incorrectly interpret the return value of the
    OpenSSL DSA_do_verify function. On systems using DNSSEC, a malicious zone
    could present a malformed DSA certificate and bypass proper certificate
    validation, allowing spoofing attacks.
    
    rPath Linux does not ship with DNSSEC enabled, and therefore is not, by
    default, vulnerable to this attack.
