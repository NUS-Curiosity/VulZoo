Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

you don't seem to care for Hamas being charged for war crimes, do you? I
guess firing rockets for 8 years at civilian targets (actively trying to
kill civilians) does not count as a war crime for you.

What do you consider as war crimes? Protecting your own civilians from
terrorists hiding behind civilians and killing civilians by mistake?
