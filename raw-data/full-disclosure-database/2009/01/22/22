Subject: MS seems to live in the past

Just cute, probably no security implications...

I am in the habit of regularly checking for new stuff on the
"Microsoft Security Advisories" website
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/default.mspx
Up until a few days ago, it said "Updated December 30, 2008"
or somesuch; cannot remember what the last advisory was, probably
something about SSL certificates.

Checking this morning, it says "Updated: October 23, 2008" and the
last advisory shown there or on
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/archive.mspx
is dated 14 Oct. For example, the advisory
  Microsoft Security Advisory (960906)
  Vulnerability in WordPad Text Converter Could Allow Remote Code Execution
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/960906.mspx
is missing.

Did MS revert into the past? (Did their server crash, was replaced
with a not-so-hot-spare, or recovered from old backups?)

Cheers,
