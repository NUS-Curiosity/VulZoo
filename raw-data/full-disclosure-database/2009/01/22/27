I second that. If he wants to have a list for different types of
discussions, the best choice is to just open one yourself.

As for getting 'traffic' there, I doubt people would stop posting here and
start posting there (as nothing would stop them from posting it here).

FD is un-moderated and as such people can post whatever they want (security
related or not).

Usually, people would avoid annoying others with non-security related topics
- but in the case of js-sentiner and co., one can expect some spam.

Sometimes, when they decide to attack others (either with propaganda, or
just because they are bored) , those attacked have two options - either a)
ignore it or b) respond with non-security related posts and defend
themselves (or oppose their propaganda).

As far as readibility is concerned, that can easily be accomplished by
either white or black list filters - i.e. if you only care about a certain
vendor's patch notifications, put a filter to get them and blacklist the
rest; if you care not to get any andrew wallase/avraham schneider/js
sentier/whatever/whoever conversations - set a filter for that - and you are
back with a readable FD.

Just keep in mind that your posts requesting FD to go back to being
readable, are not computer security related either (at least without
wickedly twisting the meaning of the phrase 'computer security').

So for the same reason you find it OK to post your request (and it is),
andrew finds it OK to posts his (and it is).

Not trying to defend n3td3v or anything - but there's some hypocricy here.
