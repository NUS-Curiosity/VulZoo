Subject: Re: Barack Obama <-- Not Appropriate

I called for John Cartwright to setup a non-technical cyber security
political full-disclosure mailing list some time ago, nothing was
setup.

What are the solutions for splitting up full-disclosure into technical
and non-technical conversation unless two seperate mailing lists are
created?
