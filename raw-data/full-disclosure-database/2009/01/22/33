"Hate speech is a term for speech intended to degrade, intimidate, or
incite violence or prejudicial action[citation needed] against a
person or group of people based on their race, gender, age, ethnicity,
nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity,
disability, language ability, ideology, social class, occupation,
appearance (height, weight, hair color, etc.), mental capacity, and
any other distinction that might be considered by some as a
liability."
