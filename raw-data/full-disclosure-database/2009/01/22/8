I was under the impression this was a list to discuss
_the_technical_facts_ regarding current released and unreleased
_security_exploits_for_computer_software_. I didn't sign up for
_shameless_self_promotion_.

Once again I'm asking for users to post this on your blag, to your own
mailing list, or at the very least show the mailing list and charter
respect and take your flames offline.
_Stop_polluting_full-disclosure_with_vague_speculation_and_opinions_.

Now that President Obama has been sworn in,

This is your chance to speak to the new administration in Washington,
what you say here *will* make a difference.

Let the community know your thoughts.
