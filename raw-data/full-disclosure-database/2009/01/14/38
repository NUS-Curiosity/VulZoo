So n3td3v, I understand your "group" is still shut off in its own little
world. But I wonder why you don't make the archives available. Perhaps it
might assist you in regaining your credibility on FD and slow/stop some of
the arguing. This is an actual serious inquiry.

I'll be honest, I'm expecting either no response at all (which will pretty
much confirm it doesn't exist) or one of these... "There's too much
sensitive information.", "I don't need to prove my credibility to anyone.",
"It's not worth the effort.", "It's not possible.", so on and so forth.


and sexyazngrl69, A/S/L plz!
