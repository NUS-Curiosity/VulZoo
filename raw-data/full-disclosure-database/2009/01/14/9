Okay e.hitler you mention you're attacking Israeli servers*, lets
ignore the impact of that for a second. e.Hitler I want you to tell
me, in more than a sentence, why you did that. Yeh, you failed to
mention it in your original post. Tell me exactly how your cause makes
you feel, and why.

Now tell me how what you're doing makes a difference, that is: 'In
what way does what you did help solve the problem that was bothering
you?' (read it!: HOW does it make a difference, don't just tell me
THAT it makes a difference, I want you to describe out a sequence of
events.

One more question. Do you think you're a good hacker (in terms of
skill). I'm not saying you're good or bad, I've no idea. Further more
I couldn't tell you what makes a good hacker, I don't know enough
(any) of them. Do you think that this event here proves that, or at
least aids proving it?

*Btw defacements happen all the time - wanna do some research on
pathetic skiddies? search the 'google dorks' included in web app
exploits when they're published on milw0rm. They're actually competing
for the servers (re-owning them, etc). Those 21 sites are a drop in
the ocean compared to how many (even ant-Israeli, and the other side)
defacements have happened.
As for the paypal accounts and (so called) 'ownage' of individuals and
their personal data, really this is another drop in the ocean for
Israel (what its economy). Compare the well-being of these individuals
with the number of people being killed in a WAR! Hell! Compare it to
the holocaust, now argue with a WWII vet or holocaust survivor (are
there any still living?) that you are e.Hitler, righteous internet
warrior. Not only that, most CC companies give you the money you lost
scams or stolen paypals. You can even cancel it before transactions
are payed. Then there's insurance companies.

Cheers.
