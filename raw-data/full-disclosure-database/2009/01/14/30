notdev,

Clearly you missed the entire point of my reply.  I was hoping that I could
appeal to some level _thought_ that you might see this as a serious
question, and not a springboard for a useless rant.  I was mistaken to think
that you would engage in a meaningful dialog that would benefit others who
may have the same questions that I do.

So what you are implying is that Kenneth Geers, et al, are hoaxers.

You, sir, are an idiot.

Cheers and all the best !
