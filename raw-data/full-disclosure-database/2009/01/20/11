4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in OpenSG, which can
be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application using
the library.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the
"HDRImageFileType::checkHDR()" function in Source/System/Image/
OSGHDRImageFileType.cpp, which can be exploited to cause a stack-based
buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially 
crafted Radiance RGBE (*.hdr) file.
