4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered vulnerabilities in Trend Micro Network
Security Component (NSC) modules as bundled with various products. 
These can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS 
(Denial of Service) or potentially gain escalated privileges.

1) Input validation errors exist in the firewall service (TmPfw.exe) 
within the "ApiThread()" function when processing packets sent to the 
service (by default port 40000/TCP). These can be exploited to cause 
heap-based buffer overflows via specially crafted packets containing a
small value in a size field.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code with
SYSTEM privileges.

2) Input validation errors exist in the firewall service (TmPfw.exe) 
within the "ApiThread()" function when processing packets sent to the
service (by default port 40000/TCP). These can be exploited to crash 
the service via specially crafted packets containing an overly large 
value in a size field.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Apply patch for OfficeScan 8.0 SP1 Patch 1.

A fix for Trend Micro Internet Security should be available shortly.
