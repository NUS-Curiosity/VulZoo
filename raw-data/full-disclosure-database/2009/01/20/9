4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Trend Micro Network
Security Component (NSC) modules as bundled with various products. 
This can be exploited by malicious, local users to manipulate firewall
settings regardless of configured security settings.

Trend Micro Internet Security includes a management interface for 
users to configure e.g. the firewall settings. To prevent any user 
from changing the settings, password restriction can be enabled.

However, the password check is implemented in the configuration GUI 
and not in the Trend Micro Personal Firewall service (TmPfw.exe). 
This can be exploited to manipulate the firewall settings regardless 
of whether password restriction is enabled by sending specially 
crafted packets to the service listening on port 40000/TCP.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Apply patch for OfficeScan 8.0 SP1 Patch 1.

A fix for Trend Micro Internet Security should be available shortly.
