    Seagate is picking up the tab for data recovery. I have known about
    this problem and been teaching it in the class since the drives were
    released and seen hundreds, not only Seagate's, but also Western
    Digital and Hitachi. It's great to see them being responsible.

    discover it. However, I will tell you that Western Digital and
    Hitachi have similar problems with drives failing. We will see what
    that is in the future I guess.

shhhhhhhhhh do not tell anyone. myself and byteassassin have created a
supermicro nix kernel that runs in the flash area of seagate drives,
we can cause the rotational speed of a hard drive to triple, and then
the platters shatter. we already have over 500K downloads, and at
defcon this year we be able to take over millions of computers and
show us controlling them during our presentation, and then bang
millions of hard drives will all crash at once....permanently!
i hope you are not one of those security research guys and try and
turn us in........................
