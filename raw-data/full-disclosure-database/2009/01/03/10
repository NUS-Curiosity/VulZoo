Subject: [Tool Release] PMD v 1.4 has released!!!

 Happy New Year 2009!!!

We are Happy to announce the release of PMDv1.4.

About:
Process Memory Dumper is a little application that allows you to dump the
entire memory of the wanted Process. Note this is NOT a PE Dumper, PMD dumps
the ENTIRE memory space of the process, so its main usage is devoted to
Forensics and Credentials Disclosure Research..or everything limited to the
fancy of the user.

Working:
PMD v. 1.1 is merely textual so it's necessary to spent some work to explain
how it works. PMD v. 1.2 was the same in GUI. After executing PMD it builds
a list of running  processes with attached PID, after that the list is
completed you have only to insert the PID and PMD will produce a file called
DumpedProcess.dmp
