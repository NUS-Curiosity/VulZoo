Yes, Palestinians need to live in peace, who told you that they kill Jews or
intented to do so, surely fashion magazines.
I think that the jews are not israel, just minority of them

The gaza's residants are in jail 18 mounths ago, and they still.
I can not attack civilian people, nor mosque, nor hospital, The Israeli army
denied completely any responsibility for the shelling.

Please forgive my poor english speaking, i speak french fluently and arabic.

Best regards,
