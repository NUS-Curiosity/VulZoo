First learn how to anwer to mailing lists without wasting precious 
bandwidth doubling your signature.

Do you know that consuming bandwidth means consuming more energy and 
that consuming more energy means empowering global conflicts and wars 
for the energetic resources?

Even if you don't know, you are doing exactly what multi-national 
corporations wants, wasting bandwidth to waste energy to increase energy 
conflicts to sell armaments for wars.

Think about it, it was just a bunch of bytes of your doubled signature 
in an email. Which is the increase of potential damage for the entire world?
