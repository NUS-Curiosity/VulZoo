Does anybody know a plugin that keeps track of the used certificates and
CAs? I tried "certificate patrol" [1]. But I wasn't too happy...

I would like to get warnings, whenever a fingerprint changes. For
example:

INFO:    The certificate fingerprint has changed.
         The new certificate is signed by the same CA.
         Details...

WARNING: The certificate fingerprint has changed.
         The new certificate is signed by a different CA.
         A possible MITM attack has been detected.
         Details...

So long,
    Aiko
