Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

I am just ' lurking'  this newsletter for a while. And normally I do not
post. I'm the typical ' lurker'.

But this time I felt that I ' have to'  post. To comment this. (Beside that
I thought this newsletter is about Disclosure of security-issues).

IMO the Palestinians act in a desperate manner.
When somebody else is taken my home, my country. Or, when I *give* a part of
my country to them, they are still my guest.
So, please, act like a guest. Do not ask more. You are a guest in my
country. In my home.
Please, act like a guest.
You can sleep here, you can eat from my ' ground' . You can live in my
country. You are welcome. Like everybody. Lets live in peace together.
You have your opinion, I have mine. You have your religion, I have mine. You
have your culture. I have mine. Lets respect each other.

But, If my guest thinks he can overrule me, if my guest thinks that he can
'own'  my country, my home, or my religion. Then he is no longer my guest,
but becomes my enemy.

And when my enemy is stronger, more powerful, and has more influence. Then
we have a problem.
And then I can act desperate.

When I ask my guest to go out of my country, or go out of my house. Then I
suspect he is leaving.
And when he don't? And when I do not have other options? I have to load my
weapons.

I'm not Palestinian, I'm not Arabic. I'm a normal guy living in Europe.
But, sometimes, I can have some understanding for the Palestinians.

And, please, know that I am against any form of violence. But when there are
no other options. I don't know how I should act.
And you?
