Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

Are you born from the same shithole as the bush familly ?
Handrix is speaking about Palestine and you speak about his signature
and your no-sense energy bullshit. if you had 1mg of brain in your
Jarhead. You will notice that you Requoting the emails too. Which use
bandwidth. So I give you an advice , Go shoot yourself in the head.
You will stop using energy and Handrix can repost his signature as
much as he want.
