Let me be frank.  This list is about security, but so long as people 
persist in posting lies to the list I will post facts.

No, when you "give" someone a part of your country it is now their 
country.  They are no longer your guest.  Nor do you have the right to 
attack them unprovoked.

Israelis are not guests in Palestine.  Palestine is Palestine.  Israel is 
Israel.  The sooner the Palestinians realize that, the sooner true peace 
will come to the area.

A fine sentiment, but I fail to see how any of it applies to Palestine.

This so-called "desperation" results in over 3000 unprovoked rocket and 
mortar attacks in one year?  And Hamas persists on using Palestinian 
civilians as human shields for their attacks so that they can claim the 
Israelis target civilians any time they retaliate for repeated attacks.

Whose country are you talking about?  Israel isn't occupying Palestine.

If the Palestinians want peace, let them stop attacking Israel.  Israel is 
not the aggressor.

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
