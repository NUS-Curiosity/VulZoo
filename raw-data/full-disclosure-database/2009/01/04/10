Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

Most palestinians are born in Palestine and have their ancestors from there.
While 99% of israelis, come from countries such as Ukraine , Russia ,
Morocco, Germany..
That dont give them the right to claim anything in Palestine land.
They want war so now they die all. Israelis are suicidal people , they
set fire in themself and wonder later why they are burning.
