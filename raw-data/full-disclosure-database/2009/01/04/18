This opinion is causing the majority of the bloodshed in the world today.

The argument can be made that Israel also tried peace, but it was 
responded with my bombings etc. Atrocities have been commited by both 
sides, this is an neverending argument. Both sides need to decide that 
they want peace, make sure they have representatives that also believe in 
this, and then they need to sit down and decide what to do, execute it and 
at the same time curb extremism in their own midst.

This is the current situation, it wasn't like this historically. Trying to 
argue that one side is evil by looking at latest developments is always a 
slippery road. You just before said that there were 5000 rockets launched 
in the past 8 years into Israel? Isn't that evil?

This leads nowhere.

Force? As opposed to the parties involved here, I am writing/talking, 
instead of promoting bloodshed.
