Being a technical person, I'd say whoever launches 5000 rockets in 8 years 
and only manages to afflict bodily harm on 20 people should seriously 
consider if what they're doing is effective, especially considering the 
downside (which wasn't hard to figure out) in your third paragraph.

But this isn't really a technical problem so:

Wonder when both sides are going to figure out that enough is enough and 
nobody can "win", and try to figure out a solution that works for the 
greatest amount of people, and then try to curb the extremist on both 
sides.
