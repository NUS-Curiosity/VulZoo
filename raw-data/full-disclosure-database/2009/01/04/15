>>After WWI winners tried to punish the losers. The losers felt unjust
punished and revolted, so we had WWII. After WWII the losers were
integrated instead...

This is a myth. There were huge land and population transfers after
WWII, especially land from Germany to Poland and German populations from
the East back into the now-smaller Germany
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II). 

And maybe Western Germany was treated well by the Allies, but East
Germany was massively raped and pillaged by the Russians who were
specifically ordered to be harsh to the German population.
