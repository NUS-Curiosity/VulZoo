Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

They just want their country back. Thats all.
It seems that Israeli want to have more, and more. And more.
Israelis build settlements outside the borders of Israel.

In History there where made some appointments which part belongs to the
Israeli and which to the Palestinian.
But it seems that the Israeli want more. Thats are not very thankful, he?
Please stay between your own borders!

Thats what the Palestinians want.
And I can understand them. They have to fight back. I should do the same.
