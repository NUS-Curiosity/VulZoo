Mikael,

Thanks for your interest to answer my Msg.

The strategies are changing but what should never be changed is your
believes and your rights.

Regarding if it is productive pr not. Do you have a better ideas?
Palatines have tried the peace, and look what they have got, a state with no
resources, they have been controlled by the Israeli Army, Israel should
agree on who come and who go, they give or not give water/power/Feul/....

The number of Palestinians are much more than the Israeli ppl, and look at
the map and see how much land they were given. Gaza is the most crowded city
in the world, while Israel gives a big houses and parks in their settlements
for Jewish ppl from all over the world.

Israel deny the right for Palestinians who left their lands during the wars
from coming back to their lands just because that will bring a few more
millions of Palestinians to the region, while they encourage Jewish from all
over the world to come to "Israel" to live in their settlements.

Regarding your area history, you have the right to choice and you are not
treated as 2nd degree  citizen, if so you might think that you should change
your strategy. 

I think not everyone will make the same choice about just live with what we
have now and don't look at the history, even now you are trying to force
your choice on them. They have the right to chose.

I agree that we all have to work to have a better life for everyone.

Brgds...Alaa
