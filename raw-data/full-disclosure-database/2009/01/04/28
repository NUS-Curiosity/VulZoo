Arturo,

Being not believer does not give you the right to insult believers (Jews,
Christians and Muslims).

Who told you this is about religion? Read the subject plz. I don't agree to
discuss religion things here as well.

Thanks to keep your idea to  yourself as long as it does not really add to
the richness of this discussion.

Brgds..Alaa
