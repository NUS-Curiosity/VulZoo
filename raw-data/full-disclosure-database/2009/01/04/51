Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

A flame war never kill children and women. You dont receive a Flame
email while you are sleeping or your 2 month old child get killed by
it. If you dont want flame war you can always quit. With real war ,
you cannot. Even there no Mortar Filter or Bullet Catcher in real
life.
Personally i filter the n3tshit and ureleet email so i dont read their
bullshit anymore. But tell me how could Palestinian do that (filter
bomb from Isralis bomber to hit an hospital) ? 3000 victims and
counting.
