If Palestinians want to live in peace, then why did they elect Hamas?  Why 
do they allow Hamas to place their rocket and mortar launchers in civilian 
areas of Gaza?  Why do they support the destruction of Israel and the 
death of all Jews?

If Palestinians want to live in peace, they start by living peacefully. 
But we all know that's not what Palestinians want, because if they did, 
they would stop attacking Israel.
