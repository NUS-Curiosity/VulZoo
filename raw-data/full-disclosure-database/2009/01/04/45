Avraham,

 

It looks like you are only good in extending your enemies list.

 

As long as you insist to use such language, I'm not interested as well.

 

I don't see why this much hate I can feel in your answers, while I was
trying to be subjective.

 

Any way thank you all for your time and I will go back to the listen only
mode :-)

 

Have a very peaceful and healthy new year you all and all your families.

 

Brgds.Alaa
