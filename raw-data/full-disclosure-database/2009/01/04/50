Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

Before this topic I could not imagine that there was a man who is against
the palestinian.

I read my newspapers, I see the news, daily. So I know 'something'  about
the war which was started by the israeli.
I 'm graduated, so I can say, I'm not ' the stupid guy'. I read my books,
and I am intereseted in history, filosofy and more.

The israeli people are not very populair. History shows that. In 1948 some
ppl helped them, but the israeli screwed it up. That can happen. But nobody
heard a ' sorry' . And that makes the israeli ' not very populair'. (lets
say it nice)

In this topic I read some stories from ppl who believe that the israeli
invasion is right. Before this I could not imagine that. I did never met a
person with that evil thoughts.

I'm confused.

In my opinion you can only have this evil thoughts when:
1/ you live in Israel (then you see only one side of the story)
2/ you live in a country wich is against the jewish people and have a
censored press. (both are bad, IMO)
3/ ????

All others know that israel is a agressor. It is since they get a part of
Palestine.
(The Palestines did not had a choise, they had to give a part of their
country away)

What I want to say is this: I can not imagine that anyone can say that the
israeli are doing right.
When they where thankful, then there was never a palestinian who drops a
bomb or became a suicide-bomber.

For all the jewish people: You can live there together. You can live in the
Palestinian country. But always remember: You get this country from the
palestinian. Be thankful. And do not ask more.
And, do not take more!
