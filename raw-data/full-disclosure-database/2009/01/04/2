Hamas has sent over 6000 rockets into Israel over the past three years. 
In 2008 alone they launched 1,750 rockets and 1,528 mortar shells into 
Israeli territory.  They're about as innocent as a thief caught with his 
hand in the cookie jar.  Not only that but they deliberately place their 
rocket and mortar launchers in the middle of civilian targets in an effort 
to produce as many Palestinian casualties as possible purely for 
propaganda purposes.  They alone are responsible for the deaths of 
"innocent" Palestinians.

The Palestinians overwhelmingly voted Hamas into power and fully support 
their repeated murder of Israelis.  They support the complete annihilation 
of Israel and all its people.  What do you expect Israel to do?  Negotiate 
with bloodthirsty murderers?
