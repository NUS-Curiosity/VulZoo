Avraham,

With all respect to your point, thanks to use a better language

I did not deny that the Jewish ppl exist since what ever many years, but
does that mean they have to own the whole land now? I think this just give
them the right to live and own their lands, without denying the same right
for Christians and Muslims who used to live there as well for thousands of
years even before the existence of the idea of the states.

There might be a wrong popular idea that Arabs have a problem with Jewish,
they only have a problem with Israel, and as you said when Muslims control
the area, they didn't kick the Jewish out of it, in contrary to what Europe
did before with Jewish and what Israel is doing now with Palestinians.

The Idea is to live and let others live as well.

Regarding the War idea you are talking about, you mean that you agree with
aggressive force usage. So we live in a jungle, who ever own the power
should kill every one before they have the same power.
I'm surprised from your idea.

So you want to say that it was a big mistake that Muslims didn't kill all
Christians and Jewish when they were much more powerful and they had the
chance? No that is not acceptable we are civilized ppl and we believe that
we all should live in peace and equally treat ppl regardless their religion,
color, origin ...etc 

The history is saying that no one keep the power for long, so don't built
the hate or you are going to pay for it.

Hope that you will not change your idea when positions will be changed.

But we will never change our idea.

Brgds...Alaa
