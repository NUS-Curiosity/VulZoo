Avraham,

 

I see you are telling so many mistakes here and I don't believe we all have
time to follow.

 

If you really care to continue this discussion, thanks to only send to my
address, and I will be more than happy to go through this argue as long as
it takes,.

 

Just one comment, who ever does not believe that things are changing and
positions are always exchanged is doing a big mistake and he will be only
blaming himself

 

I will not remind you who accept the Jewish when they were kicked out of
Europe maybe 100 years ago, who give them homes and land to live in. if you
believe that things are not changing.

 

Again I'm not talking about Jewish, I have nothing against them they are my
friends, neighbors, and even co-workers and I do really love them.

 

I'm talking about Israel state actions.

 

Israel is not the land for all Jewish, if this is true why we see many
Jewish against Israel, and sometime they go beyond that and talking the same
like most radical ppl are saying that Israel should never even exist. Do u
have an explanation for that ?

 

Thanks for your time and I wish you have a peaceful life we all deserve.

 

Brgds.Alaa
