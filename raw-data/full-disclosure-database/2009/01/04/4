Please!  You must be joking.  Google "kill Jews" and you can find 
thousands of photographs of Muslim "protestors" holding signs that say 
just that.  Or you can read the words of Hamas leaders yourself.  Or just 
read Hamas' own charter: "Hamas has been looking forward to implement 
Allah's promise whatever time it might take. The prophet, prayer and peace 
be upon him, said: The time will not come until Muslims will fight the 
Jews (and kill them); until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which 
will cry: O Muslim! there is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill 
himâ€¦"

Hamas has fired over 3000 rockets and mortars into Israel in the past 
year.  Please don't characterize murderers as innocent people.  They are 
not.

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
