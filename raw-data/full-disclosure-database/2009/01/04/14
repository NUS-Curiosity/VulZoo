Yes, they've been doing that for over 50 years now, it's not working. Time 
to change strategy.

It's not productive.

The part of Sweden I am from was forcefully taken from Denmark in 1658, it 
had been danish since around 900 or so. Before that there wasn't much 
organised state.

So, some of my "ancestors" used to be danish, now I am swedish. Does this 
mean I should revold against the now swedish state, because 350 years ago 
there was a genocide where I grew up (40% of the population died over a 
few decades). No, that's not very productive. Sometimes it's just better 
to forget history (or at least forgive) than to cause MORE bloodshed over 
historic bloodshed.

The Marshall plan after the second world war is a good example. After WWI 
winners tried to punish the losers. The losers felt unjust punished and 
revolted, so we had WWII. After WWII the losers were integrated instead, 
and now we've had peace in most of europe since 1945. The only part of the 
europe which has seen war is one of the regions where there has been a lot 
of historical grudges (former jugoslavia) and where people keep these 
grudges living and keep the hate flowing. Even liberals there bicker 
about who did what do whom 600 years ago.

> And they are always very proud of that

You can't eat proudness.

Sometimes you just have to try to do the best with what you have, instead 
of trying to resurrect old history. It's usually only used as a tool by 
leaders to keep themselves in power, extremeism only leads to suffering. 
Time to realise we're all humans instead, and try to work together to 
create a better world.
