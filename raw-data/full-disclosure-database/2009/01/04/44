Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

 So, mr. Paul Schmehl,
Can you tell me why the israelian want to have more and more? After they get
a gift for their ppl?
Thats what frustrating me the most.
If you get something as a gift.  And still want to have more.
Thats not very thankful....
Israeli are still guests. And welcome.

When you (or someone else) can give me a good answer, I wil think again.

Since they want to have more and more, they occupy more land surround them
.  ( the homes of innocent Palestinian ppl) .

I read stories about Palestinian who had to leave their home because israeli
want to live there. When the original owners of that home did not agree, the
Israelian army send them out their own houses.

Apologize that I'm not a native english and for my typos , but surely you
understand.
