The basic problem is that "your own borders" is a fuzzy concept, and conflicts
start because two countries claim the same physical territory is inside
"their own borders".

In this case, if somebody was actually able to draw a line and everybody
agreed "everything this side of the line is Israeli, everything on that side
is Palestinian", there would be no problem.  However, nobody has been able
to find where to draw that line.
