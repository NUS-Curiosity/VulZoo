Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

This thread has the same kind of full disclosure as seeing my grandma in 
itsy bitsy bikinis.

Could you take this thread the fuck out of here? take it private or take 
it to another mailing
list. If you lack one, I can host one as long as I don't have to read 
it. The only positive thing
seen so far in this is that few of the other cockmunchers here have been 
quiet,  most likely for
being awed at seeing a flamewar, even though in wrong place, where 
people actually try
to give arguments on why they stand where they stand.

Applaudable effort as such but wrong place. Take it elsewhere please. I 
can even offer you a
mailing list where you can do it without disrupting others.

My 0.02 FIM, obsolete as they are.
