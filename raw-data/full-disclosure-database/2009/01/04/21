At least 178 Jews and persons of half- or three-quarters-Jewish ancestry
have been awarded the Nobel Prize,1 accounting for 23% of all individual
recipients worldwide between 1901 and 2008, and constituting 37% of all US
recipients2 during the same period.  In the scientific research fields of
Chemistry, Economics, Medicine, and Physics, the corresponding world and US
percentages are 27% and 40%, respectively.  (Jews currently make up
approximately 0.25% of the world's population and 2% of the US population.)

Considering Jews are testifying to the existence of G-d - I would say it is
hard to make your claim under these results...
