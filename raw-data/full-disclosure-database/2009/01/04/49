It is a fact that throughout history conquering countries have taken over 
land from their vanquished foes.  The Ottomans were defeated and the 
British took over what was known as the Palestinian Mandate after WWI. 
(The French oversaw the Syrian Mandate.)  After WWII, a portion of that 
Mandate was set aside for Israel.  You can claim those lands belong to 
Palestinians all you want, but the fact is, the land was set aside through 
the UN, and it now belongs to Israel.  Afterwards, several Arab countries, 
unhappy with the arrangement, started a war with Israel and lost.  Israel 
took some of that land as well, and could have kept it but eventually 
returned most or all of it.

To now claim that Israelis are "guests" in Palestine is to deny the plain 
facts of history and provide an excuse for continued armed conflict.  What 
the Arabs have failed to gain through conquest they now seek to gain 
through deceit and propaganda, because it has become quite clear to them 
that they cannot win in open conflict.  They hope to use the benefit of 
time and general ignorance to convince the world that the land belongs to 
them and the Israelis should be thrown out.

What any of this has to do with security is an exercise for the reader, 
but there you have it.
