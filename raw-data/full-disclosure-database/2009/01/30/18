0. i would like this list to be unmoderated (not sold like \aleph_1's
one)
1. ads like hosted and sponsored by $lamers is not a good idea
2. you fail to realize that blacklisting is not a solution - ask the
antivirus sellers. it is much cpu-wise to filter the *known* few
accounts of n3td3v instead of reading every email saying "*X* sux much"
sent from a pseudo dummy email created at the cost of solving a
captcha.
