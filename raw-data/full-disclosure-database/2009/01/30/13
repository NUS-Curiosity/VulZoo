The solution of course would be to clone the system and take a
vertical image, creating a decent 3-D map of the Cat attempt. What
about two-factor authentication? I'm thinking a mass spectrometer
reading in combination with the facial recognition. That could detect
a Cat spoofing and/or brute-force attack with a bust or cardboard
cut-outs. With any biometric authentication it's going to be expensive
and have all kinds of bugs and quirks... just teach him a password..
sheesh.
