Subject: Administrivia: Spring Cleaning

Hi

I have recently begun some 'spring cleaning' of the Full-Disclosure list.

Those individuals who have proven themselves incapable of behaving in
an open environment are no longer welcome, and I am in the process
of removing the accounts of those concerned.

Primarily, Mr Wallace will no longer be participating, and I will waste 
no time in deleting any further email addresses associated with this 
individual as and when they are discovered.

Please refrain from adding to the noise whilst this process is completed.

I'd like to thank those ex-subscribers who took the time to point out their
reasons for leaving, giving me the justification I needed.

Comments are welcome off-list (unless you are n3td3v, in which case I really
don't care what you have to say any more).

Cheers
- John
