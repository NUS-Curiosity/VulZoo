Subject: Aint no such thing as cyberwar...

"Last week IWMP received a phone call from a colleague in Central Asia.
Apparently, Kyrgyzstan is under a massive denial of service attack. Three of
four ISPs have been taken down, and their upstream providers in Russia, and
Kazakhstan are refusing to pass traffic because of the scale of the attacks. At
this stage, the motivation appears to be political, and follows several
political/mass media websites which have been blocked in the past two weeks by
Kyrgyz authorities. The suspicion is that the current DOS attacks are
commercial -- commissioned and similar to those we reported back in 2005. IWMP
will investigate these attacks to see if we can establish any similarities
between these attacks and those used against Estonia and Georgia ( as this
would indicate the use of commercial botnets). Separately, the blocking of
major websites in Kyrgyzstan suggests that IWMP should probably move this
country up the relative scale of importance for monitoring cyberwar around the
world."

If it isn't cyberwar, we're gonna need to use a new word to describe this - and
then figure out how to get everybody to use the new word instead of cyberwar.
