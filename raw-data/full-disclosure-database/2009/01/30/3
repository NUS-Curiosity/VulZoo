Subject: Re: Hackery Channel 01-09-01-LOLZ: Cat Spoofing
 against Flow Control

Another cat not carrying prey would also work well.  Lots of stray cats 
like to come in when it is cold so this could very likely happen.  The cat 
the device was bought for could also attract other cats that would follow 
it into the house.  Some cats are quite social and have "friends".  This 
should maybe be called cat spoofing as the cat this device was intended for 
is not the cat getting entry.

Lots of fun finding strange cats in your house at 3AM.  Note;  Cats tend to 
be nocturnal.  You don't need any kind of high tech device for this.  Just 
open the door for your cat and others may come in.  Cats are fast so it is 
hard to keep them out.  Besides they are awake and you are probably NOT.

Been there done that.

Regards,

Nancy Kramer
