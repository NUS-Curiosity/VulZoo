Wow, congratulations.  While people on both sides are risking their lives
and in some cases making the ultimate sacrifice by loosing their life for
their friends, family and country; you've hacked some worthless Israeli
websites- thus once again proving lawyers and artists in all countries don't
know how to apply security patches to their servers.    I'm sure the IDF is
cowering in fear over your awesome power, amazing resources and limitless
influence- just like every other script kiddie out there.
Can we all now schedule the parade and present you with your medal for being
the lamest excuse of a terrorist / freedom fighter / human being of the
week?

Then to prove just how pathetic you really are, you don't even have the
balls to publicly show your face and have to hide behind an anonymous email
address- all while real men are out there on the streets in harms way.  Even
the worthless politicians are doing more and taking bigger risks then you.

Normally I'd suggest to go crawl back into your hiding hole, but since
you've never actually came out; I'll just say shut up and let the adults
deal with it, because clearly you don't have what it takes to make a real
difference in the world.
