Subject: WTF people?

I have lurked for some time, and really, this list has become pathetic  
due to it's hiijacking by two or three trolls with nothing better to  
do than destroy the relevant signal to noise ratio.  This list is not  
about MI5, the NSA, or Mossad unless there is something practical to  
be learned from them.  I do not care about the information war between  
Russia and Georgia unless it is about the systems used.  Think of this  
list as like a trade correspondence journal, not a public tackboard.
