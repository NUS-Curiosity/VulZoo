US-CERT Current Activity

Malicious Code Circulating via Israel/Hamas Conflict Spam Messages

Original release date: January 9, 2009 at 9:25 am Last revised: January 9,

US-CERT is aware of public reports of malicious code circulating via spam
email messages related to the Israel/Hamas conflict in Gaza.
These messages may contain factual information about the conflict and
appear to come from CNN. Additionally, the messages indicate that
additional news coverage of the conflict can be viewed by following a link
provided in the email body. If users click on this link, they are
redirected to a bogus CNN website that appears to contain a video.
Users who attempt to view this video will be prompted to update to a new
version of Adobe Flash Player in order to view the video. This update is
not a legitimate Adobe Flash Player update; it is malicious code. If users
download this executable file, malicious code may be installed on their
systems.

US-CERT encourages users and administrators to take the following
preventative measures to help mitigate the security risks:
  * Install antivirus software, and keep the virus signatures up to
    date.
  * Do not follow unsolicited links and do not open unsolicited email
    messages.
  * Use caution when visiting untrusted websites.
  * Use caution when downloading and installing applications.
  * Obtain software applications and updates directly from the
    vendor's website.
  * Refer to the Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams (pdf) document
    for more information on avoiding email scams.
  * Refer to the Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks
    document for more information on social engineering attacks.
