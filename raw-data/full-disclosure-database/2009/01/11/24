I'm not a troll and only serious researchers are subscribed to the
n3td3v mailing list group.

That was the mistake made people thought I was a troll, n3td3v isn't a
troll its been real the whole time.

I have and I see me saying things that people thought I was saying to
get a reaction when they are actually real things that are going on
and my actual opinion on things.

The only actual troll i've seen *ever* on full-disclosure is "Ureleet"
thats your troll, neither n3td3v or Gobbles have ever been trolls.
