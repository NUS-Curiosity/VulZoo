Synopsis
========

Multiple buffer overflows might lead to remote execution of arbitrary
code with root privileges.

Background
==========

NDISwrapper is a Linux kernel module that enables the use of Microsoft
Windows drivers for wireless network devices.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected

  1  net-wireless/ndiswrapper      < 1.53-r1                >= 1.53-r1

Description
===========

Anders Kaseorg reported multiple buffer overflows related to long
ESSIDs.

Impact
======

A physically proximate attacker could send packets over a wireless
network that might lead to the execution of arbitrary code with root
privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All NDISwrapper users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=net-wireless/ndiswrapper-1.53-r1"
