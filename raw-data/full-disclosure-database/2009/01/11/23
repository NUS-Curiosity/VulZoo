I hate to inject some actual reality, but a few things to consider:

1) 'n3td3v' was *already* widely regarded as a troll when Krawetz did
his research - he picked 'n3td3v' *specifically because* it was regarded
as the biggest security troll since Gobbles.

2) I suspect that the vast majority of full-disclosure readers either
didn't know or didn't care about Krawetz's posting until you made a
point of complaining about it and invoked the Streisand Effect on yourself.

3) The high troll factor of 'n3td3v' on the full-disclosure list scared
off a very high percentage of the full-disclosure people who concluded that
any list of 4,500+ run by a troll/idiot of the caliber seen on full-disclosure
*must* be composed mostly of sock puppets and other trolls.

Seriously - go back and re-read your postings over the past several years,
and then ask yourself "What would *I* think about this poster if I didn't
know who he was?".
