Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in JHead might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code or data loss.

Background
==========

JHead is an exif jpeg header manipulation tool.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/jhead      < 2.84-r1                         >= 2.84-r1

Description
===========

Marc Merlin and John Dong reported multiple vulnerabilities in JHead:

* A buffer overflow in the DoCommand() function when processing the
  cmd argument and related to potential string overflows
  (CVE-2008-4575).

* An insecure creation of a temporary file (CVE-2008-4639).

* A error when unlinking a file (CVE-2008-4640).

* Insufficient escaping of shell metacharacters (CVE-2008-4641).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code by enticing a
user or automated system to open a file with a long filename or via
unspecified vectors. It is also possible to trick a user into deleting
or overwriting files.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All JHead users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/jhead-2.84-r1"
