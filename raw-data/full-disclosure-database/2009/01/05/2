I don't get why this is news. Murder happens all the time.

Has he even been found guilty yet? True it looks like it is, but just
look at that news article! You can perve on some poor guys destruction
because it makes great news. I remember this happened a few years back
to someone else and the guy was found innocent, despite the way the
news channels made it look.
