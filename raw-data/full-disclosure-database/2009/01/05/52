Well, last month we saw reports that one of those "trusted" CAs (one of
those preinstalled-in-all-browsers one) signed certificates without
*any* check. The example chosen was MOZILLA.ORG  (.com? not sure). Few
years ago there was the case of microsoft.com cert being signed to a
non-MS person.

So training the users "lock = safe" or even "green lock = safe" is as
misleading as using self-signed certs.

And as browsers usually do not check CRLs, there is no way preventing
the use of wrongfully signed certificates short of distributing a
"software update" (as was with the MS case). If browsers had a cert
cache and checked it similar to SSH, MitM-attacks would be much harder.
