Subject: to those who want moderation...

For those that want moderation on this mailing list, please let us all know
how you would like to achieve said moderation on a mailing list populated by
security-conscious persons who may also share a tendency to aschew rules
and/or authority.

Before vomiting out an answer, think a little bit more about it and continue
down that road.

Finally, when you come upon enlightenment, shut up and stop crying about
moderation.
