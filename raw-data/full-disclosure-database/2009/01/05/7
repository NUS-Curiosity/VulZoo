What is the "more and more" that you claim they want?

No, they are not guests.  They have their country.  The Palestinians have 
theirs.

Palestinians are not innocent.  Please stop saying that.  They freely 
elected Hamas knowing full well what their agenda is.  Yasser Arafat was 
an Egyptian (actually named Abd al-Rahman abd al-Bauf Arafat al-Qud 
al-Husseini) who emigrated to Palestine.  He was related to the Grand 
Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, who was a good friend of 
Adolph Hitler and approved of his goal to exterminate the Jews.  The 
Palestinians have never renounced that goal.  In fact they refuse to 
renounce that goal.

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
