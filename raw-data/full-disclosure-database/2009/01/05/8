That's correct.  I don't read newspapers.  Most of them lie more than they 
tell the truth.

Well, I'm not there, so I'm sure I don't know everything that's going on. 
Where are you?

Your comment makes no sense at all.  Israel just turned over Gaza to the 
Palestinians in 2005.  Please be specific.  What land do you contend that 
the Israelis have taken in the past three years?

> Do you read the newspapers? Do you see the news on the TV?

I don't watch TV news.  They lie constantly.  I get my news by reading 
sites on the internet, constantly, daily.  I look at source documents and 
read stuff that many people find boring but lacks the emotional bs you 
find in the major news sites.

> I was suspecting that you had more brains.....

I don't know how you would know what brains I have.  You've never met me.

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
