Well, we could, but I'm not sure what it has to do with the charter of 
this list.  Besides, I get the idea from reading this list that people 
have more fun bashing you than they do talking about subjects this list 
was created to address.  I get the idea that the list has no COPPA 
filtering (no one 13 or younger allowed), nor does it have any sort of 
maturity level filtering.  Unfortunately.
