Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

Well Israel is a very young "nation",  in 61 years of existence, they have
been in war with all of them neighborhood, Egypt, Syria, Liban,Jordan,
Palestine.

If someone can find an explication that makes sens, i'll take it.

Also Mr pro-sionist (Avraham Schneider) i dont believe in god nowaday but
i've readed the bible twice and the torah once, so i'm able to segfault your
pro-sionist brain:

"At least 178 Jews and persons of half- or three-quarters-Jewish ancestry
have been awarded the Nobel Prize,1 accounting for 23% of all individual
recipients worldwide between 1901 and 2008, and constituting 37% of all US
recipients2 during the same period. In the scientific research fields of
Chemistry, Economics, Medicine, and Physics, the corresponding world and US
percentages are 27% and 40%, respectively. (Jews currently make up
approximately 0.25% of the world's population and 2% of the US population.)

Considering Jews are testifying to the existence of G-d - I would say it is
hard to make your claim under these results..."

Speaking of which god and religion: jewish says: God have elected,chosen the
jewish people (it's written in the Torah.)
Dont forget one thing, the jewish people were also banned and condemned by
this very same god to have pain and
no home for 2000 years.

Because of what ? same thing here, you want always more than we give you.
And even if some son of god would come on this earth one day, you (sionnist
guys) wont be able to reconnize him or you would kill him again, because you
always thought you we're more intelligent than anyone around (which is a
fundamental mistake).

Also once you're not happy on something you play the card of the second
world war deportation at any times,
but hey, you're not the belly-button of the world, dont forget that Gipsys,
black people, gay, arab, and everything that didn't have blond hair and blue
eyes were also killed, this is real history no propaganda.

All this sionist story is pathetic,  they make more than one "land hold-up"
in the front of the world and no one say nothing, because they're jew.
Wassup if Iran (for example) was the investigator of this, and would have
provided this very same excuse than tsahal did ?
No of course  the occident wouldn't have let this happen or not on this
tonality.
it's pretty funny to see in many places in U-K some huge flag :
"We support Israel."
that remind me why they support so proudly israel :

Btw i'm not antisemite i like jews, i'm just anti-sionist :)

Cheers
