Subject: FD / lists.grok.org - bad SSL cert


Having had enough of the non-topic junk this list has become recently, I
went to unsub, but it seems the SSL cert is not valid/trusted.

For the mods, I guess:

Secure Connection Failed

lists.grok.org.uk uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.

(Error code: sec_error_untrusted_issuer)


    * This could be a problem with the server's configuration, or it could
be someone trying to impersonate the server.

    * If you have connected to this server successfully in the past, the
error may be temporary, and you can try again later.
