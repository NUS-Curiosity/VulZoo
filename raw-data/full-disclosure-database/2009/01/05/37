Subject: Re: FD / lists.grok.org - bad SSL cert

Another thought... If the FD maintainers wanted to include the
fingerprint of their self-signed cert or CA in the monthly list charter
email, it might be archived in dozens of places around the internet and
allow those who actually care about SSL security to validate the
certificate without having to rely on the CA gods in the sky to do it
for them.  Still not perfect, but better than the current state of
things.
