A flame war never kill children and women. You dont receive a Flame email
while you are sleeping or your 2 month old child get killed by it. If you
dont want flame war you can always quit. With real war , you cannot. Even
there no Mortar Filter or Bullet Catcher in real life.
Personally i filter the n3tshit and ureleet email so i dont read their
bullshit anymore. But tell me how could Palestinian do that (filter bomb
from Isralis bomber to hit an hospital) ? 3000 victims and counting.

You mean like when the Israelis pulled out of Gaza and the IDF forcibly
removed Jewish settlers, but then Palestinians continued to launch rockets
and mortars any way?

I'm not a fan of Israel, and I think a lot of the US problems with the
Muslim population of the world are due to our policy towards Israel, but
give me a freakin break.  You can't ridicule one side for spewing
propaganda, then write stuff like that yourself.

Also, for all those whining about civilian casualties in Gaza, yes they're
tragic and highly regrettable.  On the other hand, if your enemy is putting
rocket launchers and mortars in civilian buildings and firing them
indiscriminately into civilian areas (not even _pretending_ to aim for
military installations), how exactly would you respond without killing any
civilians?  Put another way, if one side of a conflict intentionally
surrounds it's weapons with civilians, should the other side just give up?

I don't get why this is news. Murder happens all the time.

Has he even been found guilty yet? True it looks like it is, but just
look at that news article! You can perve on some poor guys destruction
because it makes great news. I remember this happened a few years back
to someone else and the guy was found innocent, despite the way the

Well Israel is a very young "nation",  in 61 years of existence, they have
been in war with all of them neighborhood, Egypt, Syria, Liban,Jordan,
Palestine.

If someone can find an explication that makes sens, i'll take it.

Also Mr pro-sionist (Avraham Schneider) i dont believe in god nowaday but
i've readed the bible twice and the torah once, so i'm able to segfault your
pro-sionist brain:

"At least 178 Jews and persons of half- or three-quarters-Jewish ancestry
have been awarded the Nobel Prize,1 accounting for 23% of all individual
recipients worldwide between 1901 and 2008, and constituting 37% of all US
recipients2 during the same period. In the scientific research fields of
Chemistry, Economics, Medicine, and Physics, the corresponding world and US
percentages are 27% and 40%, respectively. (Jews currently make up
approximately 0.25% of the world's population and 2% of the US population.)

Considering Jews are testifying to the existence of G-d - I would say it is
hard to make your claim under these results..."

Speaking of which god and religion: jewish says: God have elected,chosen the
jewish people (it's written in the Torah.)
Dont forget one thing, the jewish people were also banned and condemned by
this very same god to have pain and
no home for 2000 years.

Because of what ? same thing here, you want always more than we give you.
And even if some son of god would come on this earth one day, you (sionnist
guys) wont be able to reconnize him or you would kill him again, because you
always thought you we're more intelligent than anyone around (which is a
fundamental mistake).

Also once you're not happy on something you play the card of the second
world war deportation at any times,
but hey, you're not the belly-button of the world, dont forget that Gipsys,
black people, gay, arab, and everything that didn't have blond hair and blue
eyes were also killed, this is real history no propaganda.

All this sionist story is pathetic,  they make more than one "land hold-up"
in the front of the world and no one say nothing, because they're jew.
Wassup if Iran (for example) was the investigator of this, and would have
provided this very same excuse than tsahal did ?
No of course  the occident wouldn't have let this happen or not on this
tonality.
it's pretty funny to see in many places in U-K some huge flag :
"We support Israel."
that remind me why they support so proudly israel :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine

Btw i'm not antisemite i like jews, i'm just anti-sionist :)

Cheers

The Israelis were attacked by all their surrounding neighbors back in the 
60's and they beat them all.  Since then they have been giving more and 
more ground to Palestine, yet the Palestinians continue to attack them. 
In 2005 they turned Gaza over to the Palestinians.  The thanks they got 
was thousands and thousands of rocket and mortar attacks.

The Palestinians are *not* fighting back.  They are the aggressors.  No 
matter how much land Israel gives up, the Palestinians will continue to 
attack them, because their goal is to annihilate the country.

Please stop acting as if the Palestinians are poor, innocent bystanders 
being attacked for no reason.  They are not.

Your comment makes no sense at all.  Israel just turned over Gaza to the 
Palestinians in 2005.  Please be specific.  What land do you contend that 
the Israelis have taken in the past three years?

I don't watch TV news.  They lie constantly.  I get my news by reading 
sites on the internet, constantly, daily.  I look at source documents and 
read stuff that many people find boring but lacks the emotional bs you 
find in the major news sites.

Really?  Not one single man?  I dare say you can find several men who

controversial it may be.  In the case of the middle east it would be

If what you say is true, then would it not be logical to assume that the 
news might be biased against Israel?  After all, if they're not all that 
popular, wouldn't journalists have a built-in reason to not cast them in a 
good light?

Once again, there was no Palestine for the "Palestinians" to give away. 
The Ottomans ruled it until WWI.  Then the British took control.  Then the 
UN decided to give Israel some land there and leave the rest to the people 
who had settled there.  The so-called Palestinians didn't even exist 
except as a collection of people of various origins that shared a common 
geographical area.

Palestinians are not innocent.  Please stop saying that.  They freely 
elected Hamas knowing full well what their agenda is.  Yasser Arafat was 
an Egyptian (actually named Abd al-Rahman abd al-Bauf Arafat al-Qud 
al-Husseini) who emigrated to Palestine.  He was related to the Grand 
Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, who was a good friend of 
Adolph Hitler and approved of his goal to exterminate the Jews.  The 
Palestinians have never renounced that goal.  In fact they refuse to 
renounce that goal.

Easily. They should stop firing rockets on innocent Israeli citizens, stop
sending suicide bombers targeting innocent Israeli  citizens, and in general
stop terrorizing innocent Israeli citizens.

At that point, Israel as a country, would not need to use force against the
terror organizations, to defend it's citizens from those daily attacks.

Keep in mind that Israel is targeting terrorists and is saddned by the
injury or death of civilians - with Hamas (the elect government of the
Palestinian people, with over 90% of the votes), they are shamelessly
targetting civilians.

The fact that Israel is so strong counts for the number of dead on the
Palestinian side.

Did you ever stop to think about it? If Israel was really targeting civilian
population, what would have stopped it from just leveling the whole Gaza
strip? You think Israel can't do that? It can, but it cares about the
Palestinian civilian population.

When there is no choice, there is no choice - Israel has to defend it's own
civilian population as a first priority.

Let me tell you a little of the latest events -

1) IDF calls a family in Gaza, to let them know they are about to bomb the
house from the air - demanding that the family members leave immediately.
(the IDF had inteligence that weapons were stored in that family's house)
2) Family members climb to the roof of the house as they know the IDF pilots
would not want to harm civilians
3) The IDF pilot fires a rocket to the corner of the roof, making it clear
that if they don't leave, they will die,
4) The family get the point and run away
5) House is fired at
6) Explosions ocur due to ammunition and rockets stored there.

We are against terrorits, not against the Palestinians - they are victims

Was started by Hamas, with it's daily rocket fire on Sderot (innocent
Israeli civilan population)

Israelis won a war started by all Arab counties surrounding it - how that
translates to 'screwd it up'  baffles me.

I think you should open up the dictionary and reevaluate your understanding
of the word evil. I think you got it confused with 'self defense' - and if
you never met such a person, I guess you live in another planet.

After you understand that you are misusing the word evil, and should have
used the words 'self defense' instead, I think you will be less 'confused'.

"Another one-way cease-fire that leads to rocket attacks on Israel is not
acceptable," said the President in the Saturday address. "And promises from
Hamas will not suffice."

It will be very hard for me to comment on what you can or can not imagine.

What about the suicide bombers targetting and killing Israeli women and

Correction #3:  The MC actually dispatched MIGCAP to fire 20mm cannon,
not 'rocket' -- at the next building over.   The kill ratio from a  
rocket's shrapnel
would have killed anyone on the roof, hence, 20mm fire to ward off the  
family
and scare the dickens out of them so they would bail from the structure.

#4:  Family found Jesus right away, no, Common Sense...and bailed from  
the roof.

#5:  Cool fireworks display courtesy of your local IDF

#6:  Kudos to family for making a media moment of defiance, but it was  
really time
to leave before someone was killed.

 The IDF Spokesman said that Ghayan's house had served as a weapons silo and
a war room for Hamas. Under the house, according to the IDF, was a tunnel
which was meant to serve as an escape route in case of an Israeli attack.
.
.
.
The IDF has code named such operations "roof knocking," in which the army
informs the residents of s suspected building that they have 10 minutes to
leave the premises. In some cases, residents of suspected houses have been
able to prevent bombing by climbing up to the roof to show that they will
not leave, prompting IDF commanders to call off the strike. In these cases,
Channel 10 reported Thursday, the IAF sometimes launches a relatively
harmless missile at the corner of the roof, avoiding casualties but
successfully dispersing the crowd.
.
.
.
It appears that the "roof knocking" technique was used in the assassination,
but Ghayan decided to stay indoors with his family, and the army opted to
bomb the house anyway.
A lecturer at Gaza's Islamic University, Ghayan, 49, had mentored suicide
bombers and would sometimes go on patrol with Hamas fighters. He was known
for his close ties to the group's military wing and was respected in Gaza
for donning combat fatigues and personally participating in clashes against
Israeli forces. He sent one of his sons on an October 2001 suicide mission
that killed two Israeli settlers in Gaza.

It's interesting to note how the PA Palestinians in the West Bank are living
peacefully - they're not launching attacks on Israeli citizens, and therefor
aren't being attacked back by Israel. In fact, many of them have jobs within
Israeli areas and receive benefits from the Israeli government (my source?
I'm there right now, I've asked to both Jews and Arabs about this).

Yet in Gaza, the ruling party (Hamas) has vowed not just to establish a
Palestinian country, but also to destroy Israel and kill every last Jew. And
they attempt to make good on their words by deliberately and specificly
targeting civillians, even killing other Palestinians in the proccess. In
order to defend it's own people (both Jews and Arabs), Israel launches this
latest battle.

THEN, (hoping to garner some sympathy for the Hamas cause, it seems?),
several people start a flamefight on a IT-security mailing list.

...anyone see what doesn't make sense here?

There are places to flame about this, FD doesn't seem like one of them.
Please let's get back on topic?
