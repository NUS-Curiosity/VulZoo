Easily. They should stop firing rockets on innocent Israeli citizens, stop
sending suicide bombers targeting innocent Israeli  citizens, and in general
stop terrorizing innocent Israeli citizens.

At that point, Israel as a country, would not need to use force against the
terror organizations, to defend it's citizens from those daily attacks.

Keep in mind that Israel is targeting terrorists and is saddned by the
injury or death of civilians - with Hamas (the elect government of the
Palestinian people, with over 90% of the votes), they are shamelessly
targetting civilians.

The fact that Israel is so strong counts for the number of dead on the
Palestinian side.

Did you ever stop to think about it? If Israel was really targeting civilian
population, what would have stopped it from just leveling the whole Gaza
strip? You think Israel can't do that? It can, but it cares about the
Palestinian civilian population.

When there is no choice, there is no choice - Israel has to defend it's own
civilian population as a first priority.

Let me tell you a little of the latest events -

1) IDF calls a family in Gaza, to let them know they are about to bomb the
house from the air - demanding that the family members leave immediately.
(the IDF had inteligence that weapons were stored in that family's house)
2) Family members climb to the roof of the house as they know the IDF pilots
would not want to harm civilians
3) The IDF pilot fires a rocket to the corner of the roof, making it clear
that if they don't leave, they will die,
4) The family get the point and run away
5) House is fired at
6) Explosions ocur due to ammunition and rockets stored there.

It's not a flame war - it's an off-topic propaganda started by a Muslim and
defended by a Jew.
Just add the subject to a filter rule in Outlook/gmail/whatever client you
use, and forget about it.

I thought you don't care about this subject as it is off-topic - why are you
asking this question?
