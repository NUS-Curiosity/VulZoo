You mean like when the Israelis pulled out of Gaza and the IDF
forcibly removed Jewish settlers, but then Palestinians continued to
launch rockets and mortars any way?

I'm not a fan of Israel, and I think a lot of the US problems with the
Muslim population of the world are due to our policy towards Israel,
but give me a freakin break.  You can't ridicule one side for spewing
propaganda, then write stuff like that yourself.

Also, for all those whining about civilian casualties in Gaza, yes
they're tragic and highly regrettable.  On the other hand, if your
enemy is putting rocket launchers and mortars in civilian buildings
and firing them indiscriminately into civilian areas (not even
_pretending_ to aim for military installations), how exactly would you
respond without killing any civilians?  Put another way, if one side
of a conflict intentionally surrounds it's weapons with civilians,
should the other side just give up?
