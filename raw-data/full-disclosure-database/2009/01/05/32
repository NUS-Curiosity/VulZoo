Uh, no, actually CAs provide some weak assurance that the certificate is
the real one and associated with that server.  A self-signed one
provides none.  If you can't, in some way, authenticate the certificate
then SSL is not any better than sending data plain text.  It's not that
I approve of the current SSL PKI regime, but it's still better than
none.
