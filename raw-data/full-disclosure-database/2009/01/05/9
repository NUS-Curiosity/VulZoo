Really?  Not one single man?  I dare say you can find several men who 
would be opposed to any subject you raised, regardless of how 
controversial it may be.  In the case of the middle east it would be 
trivial to find thousands.

What you "know" is what they tell you, which is to say you know very 
little about what it actually going on.

Yet you believe the newspapers and tv.  How odd.

If what you say is true, then would it not be logical to assume that the 
news might be biased against Israel?  After all, if they're not all that 
popular, wouldn't journalists have a built-in reason to not cast them in a 
good light?

I'm not sure I follow you here.

So you think it's evil to shoot back when someone is shooting at you? 
Hopefully you live in a peaceful area.  In some areas of the world you 
wouldn't last an hour.

That I can agree with.

Once again, there was no Palestine for the "Palestinians" to give away. 
The Ottomans ruled it until WWI.  Then the British took control.  Then the 
UN decided to give Israel some land there and leave the rest to the people 
who had settled there.  The so-called Palestinians didn't even exist 
except as a collection of people of various origins that shared a common 
geographical area.

Plainly wrong, but obviously not worth pursuing.

Paul Schmehl, If it isn't already
obvious, my opinions are my own
and not those of my employer.
