The prevailing use of self-signed certs on the Internet basically
destroys the usefulness of HTTPS, since it trains users to simply
click "add exception" and ignore the scary warnings "because then I
get the lock icon, which means I'm safe!"

The browser security model should be changed to visually differentiate
between "encrypted" and "authenticated", but that would require
massive re-engineering of browser software, and lengthy re-education
of lusers.

Given the option between no HTTPS and HTTPS via self-signed cert, you
should choose the former if you're running a public website.  If the
connections really do need to be protected, stop being so effing
stingy and cough up the $70 for a certificate signed by a CA that is
in the default trusted bundle of major browsers.
