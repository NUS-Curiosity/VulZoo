Correction #3:  The MC actually dispatched MIGCAP to fire 20mm cannon,
not 'rocket' -- at the next building over.   The kill ratio from a  
rocket's shrapnel
would have killed anyone on the roof, hence, 20mm fire to ward off the  
family
and scare the dickens out of them so they would bail from the structure.

#4:  Family found Jesus right away, no, Common Sense...and bailed from  
the roof.

#5:  Cool fireworks display courtesy of your local IDF

#6:  Kudos to family for making a media moment of defiance, but it was  
really time
to leave before someone was killed.

â€œCondoleezza Rice is a very cruel, offended woman who lacks men's  
attention. She needs to be taken to a company of man-soldiers and it  
would be just fine. Releasing such stupid remarks gives her the  
feeling of being fulfilled. This is the only way for her to attract  
men's attention.  Show me that Rice is a woman? The only thing she  
attracts is reindeer. The States needs to practice the old Soviet  
tradition when both single women and single men were not allowed to  
take responsible state positions..."
