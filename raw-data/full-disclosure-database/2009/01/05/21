Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

Allaa,
	Frankly I think that the entire thing is silly. We're human beings  
made up of the same flesh, blood and bone. We all come from the exact  
same source regardless of what name we give it.  The same bullet that  
can kill me can kill you and the resulting family pains would also be  
similar.  Its a war not worth fighting for either side, just be  
present and enjoy the life that you can have instead of making it  
miserable by focusing on the past which can not be changed and the  
future which will never exist.  The future is just a projection from  
your imagination but the present is where you're living.  If you're  
unhappy with where you are in the present then you haven't been living  
in the present properly.

	God I sound like a monk or something...
