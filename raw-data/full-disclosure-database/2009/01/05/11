We are against terrorits, not against the Palestinians - they are victims
like us - we both have Hamas to blame for.

Was started by Hamas, with it's daily rocket fire on Sderot (innocent
Israeli civilan population)

I think some would disagree with you on your conclusion.

Israelis won a war started by all Arab counties surrounding it - how that
translates to 'screwd it up'  baffles me.

I think you should open up the dictionary and reevaluate your understanding
of the word evil. I think you got it confused with 'self defense' - and if
you never met such a person, I guess you live in another planet.

After you understand that you are misusing the word evil, and should have
used the words 'self defense' instead, I think you will be less 'confused'.

"Another one-way cease-fire that leads to rocket attacks on Israel is not
acceptable," said the President in the Saturday address. "And promises from
Hamas will not suffice."

Was nevery their country yet Israel gave it to them on a silver plate as
part of the Oslo agreements (supported by the extorsionist formula of
land-for-peace)

It will be very hard for me to comment on what you can or can not imagine.

What about the suicide bombers targetting and killing Israeli women and
children?
