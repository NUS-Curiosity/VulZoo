Why should we have to filter messages that are propaganda?  This list is
ridiculous, a flat out joke.  Filters are for n3td3v and ureleet.  Not
this bullshit.

That lame thread about palestine/Israel is just BS.  Flat out.  It has
_NO_ place here!

It's funny to me that the palestinians are getting what they asked for.
 Then someone comes HERE to ask for it to stop?  It all kind of makes
sense...
