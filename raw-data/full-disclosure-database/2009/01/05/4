The Israelis were attacked by all their surrounding neighbors back in the 
60's and they beat them all.  Since then they have been giving more and 
more ground to Palestine, yet the Palestinians continue to attack them. 
In 2005 they turned Gaza over to the Palestinians.  The thanks they got 
was thousands and thousands of rocket and mortar attacks.

The Palestinians are *not* fighting back.  They are the aggressors.  No 
matter how much land Israel gives up, the Palestinians will continue to 
attack them, because their goal is to annihilate the country.

Please stop acting as if the Palestinians are poor, innocent bystanders 
being attacked for no reason.  They are not.

obvious, my opinions are my own
