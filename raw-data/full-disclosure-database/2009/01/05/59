The profit making sector of the security community are determined to
use 'cyber war', and i'm determined to downplay it as a 'cyber
protest' since I have no profiteering motivation. Although using
'cyber war' could actually cause damage and confusion to society if
not used correctly. And when the real cyber war comes, what are they
gonna call cyber war? Because society will already have been
normalized into thinking its something non-important that isn't going
to impact the public-at-large.

Why do you think news outlet's like BBC News aren't quick to use the
'cyber war' label when its just a bunch of kids doing a 'cyber
protest'? It's because the BBC is one of the most respected public
news services in the world and they don't want to mislead and cause
panic, in the same way they don't want to mislead the population into
think 'cyber war' is just something that happens, and not something
they should ever be alarmed about.
