List,

If you allow n3td3v to change the tone of the Full Disclosure list
you're allowing the destruction of the FD spirit. It doesn't matter if
he babbles on about nothing for years or even months. The fact remains
that his efforts may be to destroy the free spirit of FD through the use
of noise. If this is allowed, it only proves that free venues for
security discussion (rational or not) can be manipulated with something
as simple as inane chatter. Certainly, the decision to ban n3td3v is
short sighted and must be reassessed. All users of a truly free venue
for information must be responsible for the distribution of such
information. Filter what you want!

Free n3td3v!
