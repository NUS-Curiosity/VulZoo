Hello list,

I'm a longtime lurker of this list and have also been on the verge of 
saying bye-bye to Full-Disclosure (I've got something better to do with 
my life than constantly deciding if someone's alias(es) belongs in my 
killfile or not).
In this case I am with the moderator as long as he stays transparent 
about the killfile of Full-Disclosure.

Sincerely, Erick
