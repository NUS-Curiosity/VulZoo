Subject: Help with something?

I got started a long time ago writing example code for new security- 
interested people.  I got just one example done, my full time job and  
school started, and gave up debugging.  Just out of curiosity, going  
to throw it out there.  It's the only example up at http://labs.thegoodhacker.com/ 
  let's see where I messed up.  It segfaults, if I remember correctly.
