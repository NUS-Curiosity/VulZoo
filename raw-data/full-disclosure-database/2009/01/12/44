Ohhh amazing. After seeing this I've definitely made my mind up about
who's side is right in the whole Israel-Palestine thing. Your
influence is certainly great.

Hey while you're at it you should edit
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust to mention what you did.

Hitler killed aprox. six million European Jews during World War II.
eHitler (hitlers consciousness that was saved to disk just before he
died and haunts the internet to this day) hacked 21 websites, 3 of
which where .com domains!

Seriously though you make your entire 'side' look like the bad guys,
but dumbnesses too. What annoys me is that the media will take things
like this, overblow them and then say that there's a big deal
