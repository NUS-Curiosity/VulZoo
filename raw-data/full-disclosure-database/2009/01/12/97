If he were to have posted that he hacked this 1 Israeli server - and shown
that he was exploiting some new unknown vulnerability and Fully Disclosed
the methods he used - it would have fit the Full Disclosure character.

The fact that he is 'threatning', does not make it 'newsworthy' - it makes
it 'funny'

As it is - he fits the scrip-kiddy type that everyone has fun laughing at.
