You are in no position to "translate" what we said here in clear
English, and it is not about getting on a plane, because you
_cannot_ just take a plane to Palestine / Israel...

We still disagree, _every_ damage, no matter how small / big, it
does affect people, Israeli people and that is the main point..

We don't think IDF will stop because of some artists and lawyers
websites hacked, but We do believe that this damage, no matter how
small, is actually affecting Israeli people, servers, data, etc...

We expected to be called by a script-kiddie by people like you
because that is all you can possibly think against us, first thing
that pops in a limited mind like yours when a web-hack occurs is
"omg script kiddies", maybe you should lookup the meaning of a
script kiddie, we don't use public scripts ( yet we don't try to
reinvent the wheel ), and we are not kids.

We are not looking for fame, we are talking from one alias, we only
want one thing and that is as much damage as possible for .co.il
boxes.

We did not claim that we are helping hamas, only reason we are
behind an 'unknown' email / identity, is because we are not aiming
for publicity.

You say you have no skin in this game, and yet you try to rant on
full-disc lists, hypocrite much?

Our actions to this situation got nothing to do with replying to
your emails.

... And are you really serious about thinking of a creative and
expressive name for an anonymous signature of a group that's main
objective is damage of .co.il servers?, Hitler killed alot of Jews,
and the holocaust was a huge event to Jews and Palestinians, so we
used both names, if you can think of a better name for this
operation, please forward it to /dev/null.
