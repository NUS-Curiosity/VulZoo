Lot's of intelligence people disclose to people who they are
especially with other intelligencers. I don't understand that wording
that they use because its not strictly necessary to hide your
identity. That statement will just be a general rule for people
applying, mi5 wouldn't be able to operate if none of them ever told
anyone who they are.
