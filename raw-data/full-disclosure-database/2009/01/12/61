>>From MI5 site -

Who can I tell about my application?

This is where we really are a unique place to work. Owing to the
sensitivity of our work, discretion is vital. For this reason, you
must limit those you tell about your application to your immediate
family (parents and/or siblings) and/or your partner. We will ask you
who knows that you have applied during the recruitment process. With
the exception of the Director General, the identities of staff are not
disclosed publicly. Should your application be successful, you will be
given a full briefing on the reasons why it is important not to
disclose that you are a member of the Security Service.
