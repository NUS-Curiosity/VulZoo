I don't need to turn people against you.. you do that better than I could
ever hope to. I merely express my own hate for you and sure, I could ignore
you but that would be passive encouragement. If I don't say something it
says to others that I think you are OK... when you are far from OK. You
claim to be a researcher, yet you research nothing and only ever theorize
about things (and often your theories are impractical and/or just plain
crazy). Researching requires a practical effort to understand things and
move them forward. Do you really believe you are a researcher? Do you
actually believe your own hype? You classing yourself as a researcher
belittles the effort of all the REAL researches out there. This is just one
of my many issues with you.

Also, it is interesting that despite lots of people saying YOU are the
problem, you seem to consistently blame others for your current predicament.

Call me whatever you like, it doesn't detract from the fact you are a
delusional fruitcake. Seriously.. seek professional help or at the very
least get the fuck off this list.
