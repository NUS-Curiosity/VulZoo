So you want to be mi5, but your a drug addict? Sorry they don't employ
people with your state of mind.

Also, they would never employ you because you are an evil blackhat hacker
masquerading behind this "legitimate alias". You are known as the biggest
yahoo and google blackhat hacker going around. You deliberate cause harm to
servers world wide.

I URGE ALL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO BE WEARY OF THE ROUGE HACKER n3td3v!
