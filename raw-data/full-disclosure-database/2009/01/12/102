I think we'd all have a lot more respect if e.hitler (I still laugh every
time I say that!)  and his buddies did something actually worthwhile that
would make a real difference.  Like volunteering for a charity which is
collecting for the innocent Palestinians who are loosing their homes,
schools, etc for example.  Or how about writing his elected officials to put
pressure on the Israeli's to let the Red Cross and other aid agencies in?
Instead he's done the internet equivalent of throwing toilet paper on the
neighbors house in the middle of the night.  Yes, someone is pissed off now
and had to clean it up, but it's just a sophomoric prank which doesn't mean
anything in the world.  It makes him and his buddies feel good like they're
doing "something", but the adults on this forum know better.

Notice nobody in the news is reporting that e.hitler and his merry men are
wreaking havoc.  Even so-called news sites like slashdot are ignoring it...
why?  because it's not news and nobody gives a shit.  When they hack into
the Mossad or IDF let me know.  But they're just lame script kiddies who
don't have the skills or balls to pull that off.

And yes, people like myself without any skin in the game do have a role- to
point out to the rest of the world when the emperor has no clothes.  If
e.hitler doesn't like it, he can always crawl back into his hole and stop
posting.
