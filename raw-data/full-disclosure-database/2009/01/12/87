wow...u people are pathetic..
Ok, enough with all the bullshit.
Everyone in here is talking acting like a smartass who actually tried doing
any better.
I dont know if the so called "e.hitler" can live up to any of his "global
scale message" claims, nor do i know if he his actions will speak louder
than words as he says.
All i know is the guy is utilising what he's got, tryina fight for his cause
and views, while you guys are making fun of the name :S.
Now whether he does that or not, at least he actually "tried" to make a real
difference, instead of posting a "i support gaza" as a fb status, or as an
msn pm.
Now if anyone here sees himself capable of doin a better change, i suggest
he show us.  Anyone arguing he has "no skin in this" doesnt have to
interfere making fun of the people who tried with all the effort and
resources they got, no matter how small, to fight for their cause.  You
either contribute to your side, or stay just stay away and let the people
who are interested in the issue serve their side.
I respect the guy, whether he succeeds or fails.
