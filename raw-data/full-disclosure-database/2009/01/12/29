Subject: Re: n3td3v profile...

Informative, interesting and more to the point - its spot on. His self
medicating with illegal drugs also falls right in line with this..

and even assuming that this profile is all incorrect and this IS some troll
winding us all up, he invariably has some mental illness. no one sane -
whether a "joke" or not - rants on and on and on to a bunch of people who
detest him.. maybe for a while but not for years on end.

n3td3v, get help or exit life.
