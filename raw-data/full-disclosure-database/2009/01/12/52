Subject: Re: I'm not the troll i've been trolled

Hahahaha this post is the work of a CRAZY PERSON trying to keep up the
charade which is slowly crumbling around them.. could that profile fit you
any better. you are joking with this shit right?

- Intelligence agency intrigue & innuendo is a classic

"i'll be applying for mi5 real soon"
"i'll hope one day to collaborate with mi5 to share intelligence on people,
hackers and the threats"


- They usually refuse medications to control themselves, because it dulls
the essence of what they're trying to portray: someone mysterious,
withholding critical information, being the sole-source of knowledge that
might somehow change the world.

"they want people to hate me because they don't understand me because lots
of what's going on cannot be talked about publicly"
"this is a secret underworld you've had some insight to and the way we
think, you will not understand us, you will never understand unless you are
part of it"


- Also notice he hasn't written anything technical -- it's mostly outlandish
hypothesis with pointers to..not infosec..

"I research open source intelligence such as mailing lists and websites,
television and radio. as well as monitoring folks in social situations
online and offline building up profile of folks."


I could go on and virtually connect the dots on everything in that profile
with things you have said in the last week alone, but its not worth any more
of my time.

ps: you are a nobody and we all know it, but at least now we know what the
fuck is up with you. go see a doctor or go back to hospital - that week
without you was nice.
