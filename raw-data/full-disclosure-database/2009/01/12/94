Sure.  But you missed an important point.

If you can't be trusted to keep your damned yap shut about the fact that
you applied for a job there because you think you understand the "need"
for secrecy better than the MI5 guys who have been doing it for 3 or 4
times as long as you've been *alive*, why should they trust you to keep
your yap shut when you get access to something actually sensitive?
