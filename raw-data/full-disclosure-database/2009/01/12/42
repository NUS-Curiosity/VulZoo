Something I've always wanted to do is a virtual free-for-all hackworld. A
wargame with a twist:

Basicly a VPN or something like that, once you connect to it you're in a
seperate 'internet' and all that (the matrix? :p), but the other systems
have either some kind of vulnerability or are other people logged in there.
Then it's standard wargames from there, you try to take over certain systems
to gain control of the 'internet'

I imagine most of the hosts would be VM/VPS hosted on a bigger server. Maybe
there could be fake domain registrars and hosting providers, then people can
get their own websites in this sub-internet (and see if they can keep them
from getting wrecked).

IDK, just thought it'd be a cool idea...no idea how to start building
something like this though.


(shouts out to fellow ds/hh out there!)
