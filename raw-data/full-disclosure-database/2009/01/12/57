It's an intelligence group now? (Isn't that an oxymoron?) What
happened to your security group?

Just the other day you were eluding to the fact that you already did.

Please enlighten us with your revolutionary ideas, we're all ears.

As the saying goes, "If the shoe fits".

No argument with that. However, it's kind of a chicken and the egg
scenario. If you weren't here, there is a high probability ureleet
wouldn't be either. Perhaps you would consider "taking one for the
team"?

Delusions of grandeur again. What "in depth underworld life"? All
you've demonstrated is your ability to barrage FD with inane rant.
Watching the Bourne trilogy doesn't count towards insight into the
world of spooks.

Good luck with that. I'd suggest reinventing yourself, as your current
persona has been tarnished beyond repair.

I hear getting past denial is the first stage to recovery.

No need, you do a good enough job of that yourself.

Uh huh. As your other new persona would say *giggles*

I shall wait with baited breath to see some of this "research"
published, because in the whole time you've been posting to FD, you've
not provided one solid piece of original work that would suggest you
have any skills in the security research arena.

So how would you define the shit you've been inundating FD with? I'm
seeing behaviour like a compulsive liar here, if you tell yourself
something enough, even you will end up believing it. Is that your
game? How is the following not a troll?

Do yourself and everyone else a favor, don't reply.

You are without a doubt the biggest problem on this list. There's been
a big shift of the FD scales over the last 12 months. As your rants
increased, the level of quality, informed posts dramatically
diminished. Coincidence?

As for everyone hating you, I'd probably go more along the lines of
"most people seriously dislike you".

Of which there is generally no substance.

It's good to have a hobby. But, like with politics and religion, it's
a bad idea to try an push your ill conceived ideas upon others.

I thought you were going to work for them?

All of the insight I've had into the way you think quite frankly scares me.

Actually, I think most of the credit for that goes to you. Bravo!
