Subject: n3td3v profile...

Andrew is a special kind of crazy....a friend of mine and former  
colleague who I highly respect (practicing Psych.,
who profiles individuals for a real doggone intel agency...alas, not  
MI-Jive) labeled Andrew as a probable
schizophrenic with grandiose idealizations.

These types of people usually can't hold a job.  The most active  
period of delusions occur from 17-33, some
think the drop-off may be due to decreased levels of testosterone as  
they age.  Intelligence agency intrigue & innuendo is a classic
manifestation, along with imaginary friends, martyr glamorizations,  
alternate personalities and repeated exclamations that they will  
curtail their
behaviors, only to come back, roaringly, foisting themselves upon a  
group/friend circle with a different guise or mission.
Some have said it resembles alcoholic behavior in the promises "to  
quit..."

They constantly need an audience, since 'friends' are temporal at  
best...they churn through relationships like shit
flowing through a goose...as people become estranged/exasperated with  
the constant epiphany's, revelations and
God-like interpretations.

Stranger yet is that people like this can be wonderfully charming in  
real-life....funny for awhile, but as they age, they
start losing boyish charms that previously were  
forgiven...promulgating even more outlandish behavior as grow older.
Sound familiar?  We have a baseline here, folks.  Also notice he  
hasn't written anything technical -- it's mostly
outlandish hypothesis with pointers to..not infosec...but Andrew.

They usually refuse medications to control themselves, because it  
dulls the essence of what they're trying to portray:
someone mysterious, withholding critical information, being the sole- 
source of knowledge that might somehow change
the world.

IMHO, I would venture to say Andrew has attempted suicide -- his type  
is usually unsuccessful, indeed, it's not a suicide
attempt but an attention-seeking event.

He's bat-shit-fucking-crazy-nuts, but sane enough to fool someone  
unfamiliar with his MO.  That's what is so aggravating about this
particular form of mental illness...once again, as long as there's a  
receptive audience, the monkey will feel the compulsion to
perform.  It's akin to sexual gratification for him to see he's the  
subject of people's ire...don't forget that.

This type of person will emotionally soul-suck everyone he comes in  
contact with, and make up dramas if only to suck more
people in, because really, it's all about the adulation of n3td3v/ 
Andrew/????, nothing else.

Solutions:  There's a few, but I wouldn't want to be responsible for  
the end result; once again, n3td3v is a human たまごっち
(Tamagotchi) and should be treated accordingly.
