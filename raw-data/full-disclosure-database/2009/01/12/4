To: full-disclosure@...ts.grok.org.uk


n3td3v isn't at the moment a professional intelligence group but will
be in the future if and when i'm employed into the British
intelligence community if they choose to accept my application form.

You can goto their web site
and apply for a job https://www.mi5careers.gov.uk/ this is what i'm
going to do as well.
