Subject: Simple request

Ladies and gentlemen,

I have a simple request. A lot of people here has already added the
usual shitbags to /dev/null, I added them myself recently too. What I
ask is simple: could you please stop feeding the trolls and NOT reply
to their stupid topics? Most people complain about the noise, but they
end up adding to it. You all know who you are.

There's also no need to reply to this topic, I'm just asking to cease
the useless replies and troll feeding to the usual batshits.

Thanks,

El Pollo Loco.
