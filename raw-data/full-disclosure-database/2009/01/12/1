Translation: I'm too comfortable sitting on a couch in my mothers basement
watching porn on the internet to get on a plane and put my life at risk like
the other 1.4 million people who live in Gaza.  If you don't have the money,
then go get a job at McDonalds flipping burgers until you do.  Anything else
is just lame excuses considering what is at stake.

Yes, it is worthless.  Your targets have no military or political
value. What you're doing is the internet equivalent of throwing eggs at a
passing car- adolescent prank that might piss someone off, but in the end is
meaningless.  Or are you so delusional that you think the IDF will stop now
because some lawyers and artists had their websites hacked?

Let's put it to a simple test to determine its value.  I've been told Hamas
suicide bombers get 72 virgins when they reach heaven for their actions.
 How many virgins does hacking mynotebook.co.il or refaeli-art.com get you?

Of course you expected to be called a script kiddie- that's what you are.
 That or you're the stupidest hacker in the world for using a new exploit
you designed on such worthless targets.  If you really were anything more
then a script kiddie why wouldn't you use your awesome power to hack an
Israeli government site?  Why not steal something embarrassing from the IDF
and post it for the world to see?  Simple- because you're a pathetic script
kiddie.

Please.  I'm not the one making grand claims about helping Hamas fight the
IDF.  I'm more then happy to admit that I've got no skin in this game.

If you believe actions speak louder then words then why the hell are you
arguing with me?  Do you even read what you type?

I gotta say, this whole "e.hitler" and "e-holocaust" thing makes you sound
like you're 9 years old.  Couldn't you come up with something more creative
and impressive?
