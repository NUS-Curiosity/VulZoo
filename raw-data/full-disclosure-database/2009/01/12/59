Subject: [BMSA-2009-01] Authentication bypass in
 Interspire Shopping Cart v4.0.1 and below

BLUE MOON SECURITY ADVISORY 2009-01
===================================


:Title: Authentication bypass in Interspire Shopping Cart
:Severity: Critical
:Reporter: Truong Van Tri and Blue Moon Consulting
:Products: Interspire Shopping Cart v4.0.1 Ultimate edition
:Fixed in: v4.0.2


Description
-----------

Interspire Shopping Cart (ISC) is ecommerce software that includes everything you need to start, run, promote and profit from your online store. It combines easy-to-customize store designs with marketing tools proven to significantly increase your sales.

In v4.0.1, ISC suffers from an authentication bypass problem. This allows anyone to login to ISC's control panel without knowing the administrator's password.

The problem is with ``class.auth.php``'s ``ProcessLogin`` function. This function sets a HTTPOnly cookie flag ``RememberToken`` too early in the process, even before the user is authenticated. A malicious user could force ``ProcessLogin`` to set this cookie by ticking on ``Remember me`` at the login page, entering targeted username such as ``admin``, and anything as password. This first attemp will fail, but the cookie is already set, and ready to authenticate him/her to the control panel.

Blue Moon Consulting has verified the bug in version 4.0.1 Ultimate edition being showcased at http://www.interspire.com/shoppingcart/demo.php. It is highly likely that it also exists in older versions.

Workaround
----------

There is no workaround. Please apply the fix.

Fix
---

The problem has been fixed in v4.0.2.
