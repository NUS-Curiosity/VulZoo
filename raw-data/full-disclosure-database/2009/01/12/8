Actually, if you go look at the SELinux security extensions, the NSA guys
are pretty up-front about being NSA guys, right down to posting with @nsa.gov
addresses.

The only time you don't allude to the fact you work for an intelligence
agency is if you are doing so *covertly*.  Of course, what you actually *do*
there may be classified, but even then you can usually say "I'm an analyst
for the CIA" or similar.
