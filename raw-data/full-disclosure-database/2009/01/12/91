1st of all, his cause and views are summed up as terrorism - worthless
terrorism, but still terrorism - therefore he gets no sympathy.

The fact that it is worthless, and he is presenting it as valuable and
in a way that resembles the brain in 'Pinky and the Brain' cartoon -
and/or Mini-me of Austin Powers - makes us laugh.

It was clear to anyone with an IQ level greater than that of a mosquito...

Now could you please buzz off?

Anyone arguing he has "no skin in this" doesnt have to interfere making fun of the people who tried with all the effort and resources they got, no matter how small, to fight for their cause.  You either contribute to your side, or stay just stay away and let the people who are interested in the issue serve their side.
