First of all, the 21 websites were just used to distribute the
message we had, the real damage was done on the servers holding the
websites, files deleted, databases wiped, etc...

The .com domains were actually Israeli, on Israeli servers... so
please do your research before making a complete idiot out of
yourself.

The media involvement will only be to our side, making a bigger
deal of a small website defacement will only help in the bigger
picture here, more damage for Israelis.
