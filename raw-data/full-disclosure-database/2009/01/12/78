No, they haven't .. learn about ISO date formats : 
http://www.iso.org/iso/date_and_time_format

It's called "calendar date", and goes from largest element to smallest, 
eg: YYYY-MM-DD

That'd be the First day of October, 2009.

GPG uses ISO-format dates :

$wget ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.9.tar.bz2
tar -jxvf gnupg-1.4.9.tar.bz2
$more ./gnupg-1.4.9/doc/DETAILS

"All dates are displayed in the format yyyy-mm-dd unless you use the
option --fixed-list-mode in which case they are displayed as seconds
since Epoch."
