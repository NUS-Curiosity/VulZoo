Subject: mr wallace must be stopped and i know how

OK - so in the interest of attempting to rid this list of the person we all
hate I will now cease posting any replies to the n3t d3viate. Since I am now
pretty sure he is a just mentally unstable person only seeking attention for
his childlike behavior, I will deal with him in the same fashion as a child
- ignoring him completely. I have tried to reason with him in private, as
well outright public abuse. Nothing works because he does not process
rational thought.

I implore each of you who reply to his fishing expeditions (yes I am
guilty!) to consider this as an alternate way to express your hate for him.
He WILL eventually go away if not a single person replies to him.

Please, in the interest of this list which was once GREAT, don't feed andrew
wallace's fragmented ego. Just dont hit that reply button. It will only work
if everyone does it, but will fail if one person does not. If people do it,
it will happen. Not over night but it will.

Anyway I will no longer be baited by this maniac, so I bid you farewell FD!
I hope the list can partially recover from the irreparable damage caused by
this one person, and I hope everyone follows suit and lets this guy drown in
his own thoughts.
