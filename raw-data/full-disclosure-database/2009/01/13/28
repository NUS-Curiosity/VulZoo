Subject: ANNOUNCE: DEFCON London - DC4420 - January meet -
 Thursday 15th Jan 2009

hi all!

here is an announcement, shamelessly cut & pasted from the website (i.e. 
alien wrote it really :)

Thursday 15th January.

Happy seasonal greetings and stuff.

The new year rolls in, the Govt 'crazy ideas' talking starts again - 
however here - sanity reigns and thus we bring you:

"Trampoliner - Automatically choosing return addresses for buffer 
overflow attacks" - Tom Keetch

"MUFFIN recipe: How to find software vulnerabilities on Microsoft OS"
"demo of firewire data leakage" - Guillaume Vissian

"Architecture Analysis." - Orac

"failed allocations, more interesting than pie" - xz

All welcome, and if it's your first time you will be talking. Make it a 
new year resolution to talk to someone you don't know at this meeting!

mailing list - login and look at the projects forum for details. the 
list will only accept posts from subscriber addresses! so if you send 
something and it doesn't appear, that's why...
