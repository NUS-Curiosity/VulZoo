-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of
service condition on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows;
remote code execution is also theoretically possible. User interaction
is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the processing of SMB requests. By
specifying malformed values during an NT Trans2 request an attacker can
cause the target system to kernel panic thereby requiring a reboot of
the system. Further manipulation can theoretically result in remote
unauthenticated code execution.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
