They disclosed their hatred towards *someone*, that personality of
hatred is unlikely to end so plenty was disclosed that law enforcement
and counter-terrorism officials will find useful.

Their hatred is unlikely to be exclusive to 'n3td3v' and will be
carried off into the offline communities where they live.

Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
