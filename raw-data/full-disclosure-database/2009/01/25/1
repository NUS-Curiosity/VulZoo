Learn to read carefully.  I said it was something that *could* be done. I never
actually said it's the best solution.  And I never actually said that we *use*
violence to make the point.  I just said that somebody armed with a baseball
bat should explain how we feel.

And anyhow - in some cases it isn't "violence", it's "attempting to  pound a
message through a skull too thick for normal clues to penetrate". But you knew
that already...
