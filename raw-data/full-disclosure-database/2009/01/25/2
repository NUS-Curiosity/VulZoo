Subject: Security Psychology

I just came across a post telling of the Security and Human Behavior 
workshop (or conference).

As some of you may be away, I've been researching this subject for about 
two years now, and I am very excited that a conference has now happened! It 
means I did not waste the last two years of my life after all! :)

This is very exciting, and I am very thankful to these guys for making it 
happen.

Here's a post I wrote about something similar, although syndicated from 
early on with an ancient post, in my exploration of the subject matter:

I hope that more researchers will start looking into this subject, which 
as of the last six months I've been calling Humexp.

I am currently engaged in research looking into the Estonian cyber war 
from a social psychology perspective, which turned out to be quite 
interesting. More on that when I can share, though.
