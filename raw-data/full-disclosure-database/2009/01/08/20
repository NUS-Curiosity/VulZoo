I say let the animals eat each other... I'm sorry to be callous but there's 
just no reason to throw civilized society into a frenzy over this.  This is 
a battle that has raged since forever, and I'm willing to bet that most of 
these "people" (loosely termed) can't even remember why the hell they're 
fighting each other, or why they hate each other.  Stupidity of the human 
race I guess...

Not sure how he (or even religion in general) got dragged in to this....

That's a bs phrase anyway.

Terrorists are very easy to define.  They target and kill civilians
deliberately.  That is a completely unambiguous definition.  Notice I said
"deliberately".  Civilians always die in armed conflicts.  Terrorists kill 
them
on purpose.
