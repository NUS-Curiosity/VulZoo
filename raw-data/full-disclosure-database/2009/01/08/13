It's some kind of peer pressure tactic he's been trying, its pretty
lame though and just ruins the list by arguing with me. I'm not like
Gobbles who released a vulnerability out of peer preassure that was
pretty lame :) You're messing with the big boys Ureleet, so maybe
after a whole year trying your tactic, you kill off your nickname now
and try something different on a different name?
