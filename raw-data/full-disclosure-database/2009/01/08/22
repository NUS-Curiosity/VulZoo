Subject: Re: ImmunitySec is an NSA front.

are'nt NSA and Mossad supposed to be enemies ? i mean what about all the
crap about Israilies hacking into NSA's unpatched Exchange Server 2003 and
put messages there that resulted in U.S invading Iraq ? and while you are at
it since Dave is in favor of Python should we just abandon Canvas and go
back to Metasploit ? and having that in mind does anybody know if Obama
prefers Python or Ruby ? well , before full-disclosure turns into
clown-disclosure thought i deserve to send a message after all these years
being a silent contributor .
