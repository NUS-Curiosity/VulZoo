Subject: Re: [Suspected Spam]"Security Assessment of the
 Internet Protocol" & the IETF

Hi,

I still not have read all your paper, but my first word is congratulations!
That's an hard job.

Since a quick search didn't give a result for it, and maybe others could
be interested:
The AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and
Applications) project aims at developing a push-button,
industrial-strength technology for the analysis of large-scale Internet
security-sensitive protocols and applications.

This website contains all relevant information about AVISPA for project
members, interested third parties and scientists worldwide.

My 2 cents for now
