Subject: Re: Secunia Research: AXIS Camera
	Control"image_pan_tilt" Property Buffer Overflow

There seems to be a lot of security problems with these camera systems
being configured incorrectly by vendors setting them up for mom and pop
shops and home users. It would be interesting to start looking into this
particular problem more closely since nearly all of the camera systems
have a web service front end and the manufactures are normally slow to
patch and retro-patching camera systems that have already been deployed
is rare.

I'm considering creating a website to start listing these systems out
along with any default logins, google searches, and of course remote and
local exploits. I would imagine a lot of the web services are vulnerable
to XSS techniques. The mail goal would be to establish a process for
responsible disclosure to vendors and customers\public for these types
of poorly secured systems.

I would appreciate any information anyone may have handy. Send me an
email offline.

Thanks in advance,

Control"image_pan_tilt" Property Buffer Overflow

So, concerning the exploitation achievement, which would be the worst
consequence,
forget about that heap memory overflow and just worry about tricking
the user into loading malicious web content.

Easier, huh?
