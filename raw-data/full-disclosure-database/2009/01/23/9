if it's fact, it can not be 'made up'.
If it is coming as response to your claims - it is not propaganda.
And your dirty language does not add to your credibility.

free propaganda? what's that? how does it compare to expensive propaganda?
And how does it _explain my propaganda_, when all I do is respond to your
claims (i.e. there's no propaganda)?

And why do you think anyone on this list cares about it? Is it computer
security related? Why don't you answer this question?

Any conflict have two side, i guess you've misse one while throwing rocks.

Yes, and in this case - a Good Israel, and an Evil Palestinians.

If throwing rocks at them would make them stop their terror attacks on
Israel, I'd do that.

It obviously won't help, so why should I do it?

Besides, the IDF can take care of those terrorists with better tools, so I
will let them do their job while I do mine (computer security - what's
your's btw?).

Yes, true - I admit to making a few mistakes - but at least I'm readable.
Why do you have to use curse words in every sentence? Grow up already.

Your assumption is wrong. I did not use it as last, or any defense - simply
as a constructive critisism.
