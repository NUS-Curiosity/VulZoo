Subject: Re: ImmunitySec is an NSA front.

Any company /country /research that can influence national security is
on intrest of an agency working on national security. i studied some
US gov report related to the recent bombing in india and concluded US
government will/have offer india to build wholesale survillance
capability. News?

Internet is full of examples about Intl agencies run decoy business,
bought 0-days, have approached businesses for over a century now to
comply on their intrest and so on.

it was on the interest of law inforcement agencies for Windows OS to
leaks behind so much of digital forensic fingerprints on the network
and on the system compared to linux. Coincidence :)?

Any business, so be it Certification Authority or ISP or an antivirus
company or any WEB company if holds data/information to influence
national security then it will likely be approached/influenced by a
national security agency already.

Let me give you an example, antivirus companies can easily (likely)
track you even if you are behind a TOR network. Periodic auto updates,
unique Serial key per machine, other uniq system identifiable
information, defination update status, quarentine files, anonymous AV
scan log, system clock etc can all act like "super cookie" to identify
your identity. Imazine how many of them work as a frontend for fed's ?

just some thoughts...
