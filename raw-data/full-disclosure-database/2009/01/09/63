When you have a look at his answer timeline, you are an idiot if you do not
notice that he doesn't work for an employer.
He's located in his father basement, and doesn't know what to do while the

So he spam his anger aways while despairing the day he will go on purpose
for some job until he understand that no one wants him.

This predilection is based on a real future true story.
