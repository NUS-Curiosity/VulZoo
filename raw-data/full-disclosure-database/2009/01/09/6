[too much]

We expect noise from n3td3v, and despite his ph33rsome skills he is
no match for a well written procmail rule.

I am surprised however that you seem unable to give it a rest on
this topic that is so clearly off-topic. While I do have opinions
on this "episode", i am not so vain as to think the readers on this
list care about it and not so arrogant as to keep the topic going
despite pleas to get off-topic threads killed.

I'm not sure about others on the list, but i thought more of you
(and thought more of your respect for other list members).
