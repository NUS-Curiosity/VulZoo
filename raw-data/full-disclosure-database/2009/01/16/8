Subject: Re: Cyber War or just Cyber Protest?

Israel is fighting terrorists - those terrorists decide to attack websites
(since they wrongly believe it will help their cause)[1] - Israel cares
less.

It is  Cyber-War because those terrorists are fighting a war against Israel
- and the 'Cyber' is just an additional front for this war - not an
important one, hence ignored by Israel, but it still is.

If you call blowing yourself up in a bus, trying to kill as many passengers
as possible - 'protest' - than by your definition one may call this
'Cyber-Protest' - but since normal people call those who practice suicide
bombings 'terrorists', by their definition it is called either
'Cyber-Terrorism' - or since there is a war on terror - 'Cyber-War'.

I hope this explains it for you.
