Subject: Re: Cyber War or just Cyber Protest?

Israel has one of the most powerful and advanced armies.
But they cannot find their enemy.
When there is maybe one hamas-soldier, the israeli can't shoot him when hey
is in a building, the israeli bomb the whole building.

In modern world we use intelligence and we have snipers.
In modern world we do not blow up a whole building when there are probably
weapons from the enemy in that building.
And we do not blow up a building when there are civilians inside.

In modern world we do not shoot at the enemy when he is among civilians.
And we never bomb the UN or Red Cross. And then say 'sorry,  it was a
mistake"
And the next day bomb another hospital. and say 'sorry' again.

Why do the israeli not use their army.
I agree that their army is one of the most powerful, but why not use this?

And apologize for my english.
I'm not native english. I'm dutch.
And I am sure that my english is better then your dutch.
So please do not attack people because of their english.
