The scary thing is you actually think its a Cyber War and that those
kids are terrorists, militants.

Extremely sad and worrying that people like you exist, as i've
previously said its a threat to national security that people like you
are going around making those claims. It's just fortunate that people
like the BBC have a clue and choose to ignore it and not put it to
print.
