Subject: Re: Why are you against n3td3v?

Come now Mr Wallace, answer my previous question in this thread. You've been
posting on FD all day so there's no excuse. I'll even include it for you now
incase you missed it the first time.

"So n3td3v, I understand your `group` is still shut off in its own little
world. But I wonder why you don't make the archives available. Perhaps it
might assist you in regaining your credibility on FD and slow/stop some of
the arguing. This is an actual serious inquiry."

I await your timely reply.
