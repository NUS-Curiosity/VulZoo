Subject: The war in Palestine

Hi all,

The terrorist Israeli forces bombed Gaza city and destroyed many buildings
and killed several hundred people.
Israel likes to invoke as a justification for its attacks on its neighbors
the "war against Terror" - the current slogan adopted by the United States.
I hope that can help many people to understand why killing children, women,
and all innocents person.

Please "STOP WAR IN PALASTINE"
