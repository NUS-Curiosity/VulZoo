A Morocco-based Islamic group hacked into DomainTheNet's registration
system server today, hijacking several domain names, including
ynetnews.com (the English-language Web site of Yedioth Ahronoth) and
Bank Discount, and sending users to pages featuring anti-Israeli
messages. One of the messages read: "The only solution for peace for
all peoples in Palestine, Jews and Muslims and Christians is the
demise of the Zionist and that the treatment of malignant cancer
tumor."

This latest attack follows the defacement of more than 300 Israeli Web
sites with anti-Israeli and anti-U.S. messages in a 48-hour period
last weekend.

Today's attack did not hack particular Web sites, and are believed to
be retaliation for Operation Cast Lead in Gaza.
