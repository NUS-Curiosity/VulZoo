Subject: NO-IP service Flaw

A flaw exists in NO-IP service while updating the status. The problem
reside in the URL and corresponding variables because they are send in
plain text.

By monitoring HTTP traffic in a machine using NO-IP DUC it's possible
to intercept the username, password and subdomain for the account.

Example:
http://dynupdate.no-ip.com/ducupdate.php?username=email@email.com&pass=123456789&h[]=subdomain.no-ip.biz
