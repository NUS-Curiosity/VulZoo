"what would you call your lies"
Which lies ?
You're tunnel-focused on your point, with no relativisation at all, which
brings your argument not valuable for a penny, when i read your post i feel
like reading/listening a tsahal interview/report.
There's two side on a medial, dont forget that, that's why i say you're
doing propaganda, while criticizing the other propaganda.
