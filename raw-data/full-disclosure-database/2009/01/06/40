Well whilst I agree the self generated ones or whatever work well, I find
it amusing that a _security_ based list is using one, and then expects
people in the security industry to blindly accept or add exceptions for it
- my irony alarm is going overtime at that one.  I certainly wouldn't add
an exception, as it's not a trusted website to me.  I'm sure others would
see it the same.

Doesn't matter now, as I'm unsubbed via the mail method, because FD just
has too much noise-signal these days.
