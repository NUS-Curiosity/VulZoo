Because the effort, even a small amount, to do any verification that
the requester is who they say the are is non-trivial.  It takes actual
humans to do this, which means you have to pay salaries.  It also
costs money to handle the keys for the CA securely, hardware signing
modules, etc.

There are some CAs that charge a lot less than others, and there are
also resellers who often sell certificates to their customers at less
than what someone could buy the cert from the actual CA itself.

Is paying 2 months worth of residential DSL for a certificate that can
be used to secure an e-commerce storefront really that outrageous?
