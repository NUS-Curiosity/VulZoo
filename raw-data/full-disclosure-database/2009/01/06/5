Hello everyone,
A bit off topic..

Can somebody explain why signing a cert for a domain is still so expensive ?
Or do CA pays a lot of money to browsers so they do not a allow CA with a
better price.. ? Why can't a CA sign a certificate free of charge so
everyone who own a domain can have a https for it's site ?

In my opinion CA (these that are recognized by browsers) charge too much, or
I'm missing something ?
