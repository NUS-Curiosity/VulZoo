Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

Relativisation in this case is neccessary, because the UK took this land
from arabians, and gived it to jews mostly because it was
supposedly them promised land.
Before that maybe not much arabians was living there, but still it was them
land.
The not legit attribution in 1948 of the land to israel was the conflict
starter and still today, now excuses have changed, palestinian are throwing
rocks and old school rockets around the border in israel.
What have changed so far ? as i sayed in my first post on this topic, israel
is very young 61 years old, and have been in war with all of them neighbors,
also while fighting with them, israel once again has taken more land during
theses wars.

I can understand why palestinian mothers are telling to theirs sons to wear
a bomb, and blow themself to kill some israelians, i totally do not approve
this, but as a mather of fact, i understand the despair for this people
(open-mind is a crime ?).

Also as i sayed in my first post, another problem of  Israelites is that
they think they are elected  by god... and then are superior to any other
race/religion, i'm not inventing nothing here.. it's written in the Thora.

Just this fact  is a fundamental communication problem, for any discution
because persons such as Avraham will always overlook the others point of
view.

I'm not pro-palestinian or pro-israel, the only thing i know is
relativisation in such conflict should be always the first thing to do
before dumping any crap from your brain.

A correction for Avraham:
Jews != Israel
Sionists != Jews

Also you sayed that jews that dont support the state and actions of israel,
are not real jews, or have lost the believe, this again is propaganda , as
the US government was doing in USA a few years ago, "if you're not for the
invasion/war in irak/afghanistan, you're not a real american".
