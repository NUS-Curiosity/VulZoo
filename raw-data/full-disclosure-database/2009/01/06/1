It's off topic for this thread. FD, by it's very nature, is designed
for in-depth discussion of things that are not usually disclosed.
Moderation, is, of course, relevant. Palestine is also somewhat
relevant, in that there is a large amount of misinformation and lack
of disclosure involved; disclosing information leads to discussion.
Yes, it has little place here, but it's presence is somewhat
understandable. Netdev should be banned. However, this thread is
discussing none of those, and as such those topics do not belong here.

Also, don't just change ths subject, please. Make a new thread. Simply
changing the topic does not make it a new thread, many mail clients
show it as part of the same thread.
