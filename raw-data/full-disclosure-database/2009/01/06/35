	But is expected that list members will self moderate and
	keep on topic.  I've been on plenty of lists which are
	unmoderated over the years.  This *one* is the only one
	where members continue to deliberately post off topic
	messages for days after it is pointed out that the discussion
	is off topic for the list.
