Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

You started this thread with propaganda lies.

You bring no facts to support your claims.

This thread is going nowhere.

Plus your typos have turned from funny to annoying.

Therefore I am done with this thread.

I am sure many subscribers to this list will be delighted.

I am sure they would be even more delighted if you stopped as well.
