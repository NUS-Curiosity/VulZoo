teaching your kid to strap a bomb against their chest and commit
suicide while murdering innocent people is much more like child abuse
than being open-minded if you ask me. I think others here would
concur.

I think a bigger communication problem is being blind (on purpose) to facts.

Why don't you start then?

A Jew is a decendent of Avraham, Isac and Jacob on the father side,
having a Jewish mother.
Conversion to Judaism is also possible, bud discouraged for reasons I
will not get into here.

Jacob's name was changed by G-d to Israel - you can find it in the
Torah - not that I expect or want you to read it.

> Sionists != Jews
1897 (CE) - First Zionist Congress convened by Theodor Herzl in Basel,
Switzerland; Zionist Organization founded.
Zionism was an international political movement that supported the
reestablishment of a homeland for the Jewish People in the Land of
Israel.

To clarify - I did not say they are not real Jews.

As for propaganda - see my previous points on the difference between
facts and propaganda.

It is obvious that you are also against the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The reason the US is fighting there is close to the reason why
Israelis are fighting in Gaza - to ensure peace to their citizens.
Should I remind you of 9-11?
