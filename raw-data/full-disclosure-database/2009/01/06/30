When someone in the press starts regurgitating lies, I've got to step
in and say something.

Lie #1: There was such a country named Palestine, for the Palestinian
people.
Fact #1: There never was such a country until 1920 - what is today
referred to as "the Palestinian people" were nomadic tribes that made
their homes in encampments in the deserts of Jordan and Egypt.
"Palestine" was only enacted as a separate protectorate in 1920 by the
British Mandate in 1920.  The region referred to as "Palestine" in
historical terms encompassed a much wider area, comprising Jrodan,
Egypt, and many other Middle Eastern countries.  Until 1920, there
never were any formal boundaries or a formal country.
Lie #2: Israel stole Palestine from the Palestinians.
Fact #2: In 1920, the British Mandate formed Palestine for the intent
of "creating a national home for the Jewish prople" (note this doesn't
say anything about Arabs or Palestinians).  In 1947, the UN approved
splitting Palestine into two parts - one Jewish, one Arab.  In 1948,
the Jewish part of Palestine declared its independence, calling itself
"Israel".  From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel:

After 1945 the United Kingdom became embroiled in an increasingly
violent conflict with the Jews.[50] In 1947, the British government
withdrew from commitment to the Mandate of Palestine, stating it was
unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both Arabs and Jews.[51]
The newly created United Nations approved the UN Partition Plan
(United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181) on November 29, 1947,
dividing the country into two states, one Arab and one Jewish.
Jerusalem was to be designated an international city - a corpus
separatum - administered by the UN to avoid conflict over its
status.[52] The Jewish community accepted the plan,[53] but the Arab
League and Arab Higher Committee rejected it.[54] On December 1, 1947
the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a 3-day strike, and Arab
guerrilla attacks began against Jewish targets. Convinced that these
attacks were merely a prelude to full-scale military confrontations
with the regular armies of the Arab states, Ben-Gurion elected to
escalate the military conflict. As such, Haganah embarked on a policy
of "aggressive defense." This strategy was accompanied by economic
subversion and psychological warfare.[55]

On May 14, 1948, the day before the end of the British Mandate, the
Jewish Agency proclaimed independence, naming the country Israel. The
following day five Arab countries - Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and
Iraq -invaded Israel, launching the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.[56]
Morocco, Sudan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia also sent troops to assist the
invaders. After a year of fighting, a ceasefire was declared and
temporary borders, known as the Green Line, were established. Jordan
annexed what became known as the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and
Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip. Israel was admitted as a member
of the United Nations on May 11, 1949.[57] During the war 711,000
Arabs, according to UN estimates, or about 80% of the previous Arab
population, fled the country.[58] The fate of the Palestinian refugees
today is a major point of contention in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.[59][60]
