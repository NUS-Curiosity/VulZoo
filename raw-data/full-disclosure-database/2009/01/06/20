Hi,

> It's off topic for this thread. FD, by it's very nature, is designed

I wonder why so much effort is spent discussing a self-signed
web interface for unsubscribing from a mialing list - when
the email headers clearly state how to leave via an email message
and not bother with a web interface at all. most decent email clients
can deal with such mailing list headers.

aye. A bane of my life. I wrote a draft RFC which covered 2 mechanisms
to allow email clients to break the message thread (specifically unhook 
the In-Reply-To and Reference headers) if the client detected that a
thread was being hijacked (eg subject deleted with a new one - or the entire 
body of the email deleted (so no reply > lines etc) - unfortunately
there wasnt much support :-|
