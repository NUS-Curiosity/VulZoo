Yes, see, its just a huge mass conspiracy, the whole world is against
israel and makes this stuff up. They would never release lies and
propaganda video. NEVER! It's not in the Zionist scum blood to lie! NO
SIR! NEVER! The BBC is ran by Palestine!

Label me not surprised, if someone disagrees with zionist scum they
are labeled as either self hating if they are Jewish, or mentally
unstable.

Your mothers a whore and your father holds the money.
