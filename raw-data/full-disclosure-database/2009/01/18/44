I thinks it's a topic where "admins" have to be a bit more sensitive.
;-) Still works like a charm and they have not the slightest idea. But
nice to see that this paper is from november 2008. This means I'm not
that slow with discovering such stuff by myself. And in this case I
haven't sent bogus messages, routing via my tunnel worked.

So long,

	Lukas
