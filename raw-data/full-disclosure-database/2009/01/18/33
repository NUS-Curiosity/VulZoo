Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

I wish life had a roll-back function.
Then I went back to 1939.

The israeli create an environment, or a climate, for hate.
I 'm was not an antisemitist, but now I become one.

At the moment we have as much jews as bef√≥re WO 2.
It all have to start again.

Yes , I know,  that are very crude words.
But people like Schneider ask for this hate.

Schneider, I do not wish you dead.
I wish that some 'terrorist' take your home, your country, your everything.
Then they let you suffering until you are dead.

Your replies ask for this.

I think I just became an antisemitist.
Schnieder, thanks for that (not) !!

And again: stop annoying me private!

Schneider, do you want some gas?
