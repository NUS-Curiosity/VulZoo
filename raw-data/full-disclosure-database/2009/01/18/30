Sure they can - Hamas is hiding in civilian homes, firing rockets from the
rooftops and use civilian homes for weapon storage.

You wrongly assume it is one hamas-"soldier" -

a bit...

True.

You need to prove that claim.

Israel calls up the civilians inside and gives them 20 minutes to evacuate,
they also drop flyers from above alerting civilians to evacuate - this is
something that is unuique in the "modern world" - no country is known to be
this humane at times of war.

Israel has a top priority of protecting it's own citizens - if Hamas uses
the civilians as human shields - Hamas is the one to blame for their deaths.

You need to prive that claim.

In the "medern world" your enemy does not fire anti-tank misiles from a UN
or Red Cross compound at you.

We are always sorry for innocent civilian deaths - should we remind you of
the cheering that was done in the streets of Gaza, with candies being
distributed to everyone for the death of 3000 innocent American civilians at
9/11? Why didn't we see them upset for civilian casualties?

Not sure I understand your question? Don't you think Israel could easily
wipe out Gaza with all it's inhibitents in exactly 10 minutes? Why do you
think Israel is risking it's soldier's lives for? Exactly for the reason you
are claiming Israel is ignoring - for protecting civilian lives.

Do you want them to just Nuke Gaza?

Yes, but you are comparing Apples to Oranges. I am a native Hebrew speaker.
I don't go on Dutch forums and start mumbling nonsense in a lunguage I am
not fluent with.

I didn't attack you - just mentioned you need to get professional help with
your English.
