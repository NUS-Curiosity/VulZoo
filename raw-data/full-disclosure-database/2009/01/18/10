Why don't they leave to Egypt or any other Arab country for that matter...?
Regardless, they can and should leave the area that is being bombed, and
flee to a different area that is not (yet) being bombed.
That's the smart thing to do...

You are not helping your credibility with these sort of statements.

Why do make empty statements and place them as a reply to facts I have
stated  - do you contest what I have written just above your response?

How does the fact that Israel want peace since before it's establishment and
the Arabs chose war every time they thought they could win (and lost) - make
Israel a terrorist state?
I think you should look up the word 'terror' in the dictionary - read up
other words while you are at it, your English needs improvement in general.
