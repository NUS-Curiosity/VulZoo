Innovative solution to all your problems, on both sides:  stop discussing politics on FD.  I was under the impression this was supposed to be about compsec, not alt.politics.middleeast.  Doesn't matter who -is- right, from here it looks like a bunch of kids using slightly more sophisticated arguments.

Understand?  Someone is wrong on the internet, shocker, that one.  You guys aren't going to change each other's minds, so what you're doing is a waste of time and lowering the noise to signal ratio.

Grow up.
