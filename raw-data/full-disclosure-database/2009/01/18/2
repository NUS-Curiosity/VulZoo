Sure it's always more fun when you can fire at them like rabbits.

Hamas are really bad terrorists, after tsahal killed 1000 civilians with
phosphore bombs, it's sure that 7 home made rocket fired with some old
school pipe and a cheap compas, makes the difference.

Anyways more you bombs them, more they want  revenge, even the ones who
wasn't pro war/revenge.
So what's make the difference between a palestinian and a terrorist to you
?
not much eh ?
Well, thats why we can call that again a genocide.
And know what ? your argument about poor innocent israeli people who got
killed by rockets throwed near the border by bad palestinian terrorists got
segfaulted :

This remind you something ?

Oh i guess it's because they've throw 5 rockets near the border  so it's
legit to killed anyone ?
And you expect them to shut the fuck up ?
