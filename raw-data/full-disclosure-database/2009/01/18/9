Subject: Re: The war in Palestine

yes, let me make a point favoring my political views then say take it
off the list... that's smart!

israel deserves to be wiped off the map, and America should be first
in line to do it. We do nothing but support israel and look where it
has landed us. Not only has it landed us at war with israeli's enemies
but it also has landed us as having to guard our intelligence from
israel because the scum spy on us more than any other country. If you
support the zionist scum then you deserve what they deserve.

Long Live Palestine.

...now take this discussion off list.

lol
