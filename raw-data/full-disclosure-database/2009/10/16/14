Subject: Re: Drupal XML Sitemap 6.x-1.1 XSS Vulnerability

2009/10/15 Justin Klein Keane <justin@...irish.net>
> Drupal 6.14 with Site map 6.x-1.1 was tested and shown to be vulnerable.
[...]

> The Site map module contains a cross site scripting vulnerability
> because it does not properly sanitize output of titles before display.

[...]

> To carry out a Site map based XSS
> exploit the attacker must have 'administer site configuration' permissions.

> I'm not into drupal that much, but with the right "administer site
configuration" you already have total control over quite everything [1], For
example you can administer themes, add your php or JS code right thereâ€¦ and
you can do a lot more.
