Subject: Re: Drupal XML Sitemap 6.x-1.1 XSS Vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Dave Reid of Drupal security correctly pointed out to me that this
vulnerability is for "Sitemap" module, not "XML Sitemap" as specified in
the subject line.  There are just so many that I lose track sometimes...
 Props to Dave for spotting my error and apologies for any confusion.
